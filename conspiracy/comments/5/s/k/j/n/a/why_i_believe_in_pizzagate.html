    <div class="md"><p>Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, especially politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that&#39;s attractive to the psychopath.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kakistocracy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats an in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priest must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves to become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they proof themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so much opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).</p>

<p>I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must not had followed it and instead followed all the fake news about. Pizzagate was never just about one store, it&#39;s about an elite pedophile ring (politicians, celebrities, rich). The main theory has been Haiti is the main source, though not the only source, for child sex slaves. This is because of the Clinton Foundation ties to Haiti, the missing Haiti money, and rumors of people &quot;didappearing&quot; when the Clintons are around, as well as a few emails. Comet Ping Pong was never a big part of the equation.</p>

<p>Pizzagate went from being about Podesta emails, pizza, and comet ping pong and evolved to include ALL child trafficking. </p>

<p>It did this to try to gain legitimacy, because the podesta and pizza restaurant claims were shit. So by grasping onto worldwide child trafficking it forced it&#39;s nonsense into an area of legitimacy. </p>

<p>A person who posts on a blog thread, in the guise of &quot;concern,&quot; to disrupt dialogue or undermine morale by pointing out that posters and/or the site may be getting themselves in trouble, usually with an authority or power. They point out problems that don&#39;t really exist. The intent is to derail, stifle, control, the dialogue. It is viewed as insincere and condescending.</p>

<p>A concern troll on a progressive blog might write, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to say things like that because you might get in trouble with the government.&quot; Or, &quot;This controversy is making your side look disorganized.&quot; </p>

Since this whole thing about &quot;fake news&quot; no matter what you think of the concept, you have hordes of advertisers cutting all business and funds to sites suspected of spreading fake news, so it would seem very plausible that there&#39;s some kind of monetary motive behind the resistance, i don&#39;t see how the resistance in itself proves anything about pizzagate?  </p>

<p>If you picked a totally random person, and then started to ramdomly and very publicly connect this person to all sorts of &quot;facts&quot; about child molesting activities, would resistance in that case also &quot;prove&quot; guilt?   </p>

<p>I can&#39;t deny that, and i&#39;m not accusing you personally of anything.  </p>

<p>But i think you can find plenty of undeniable proof of libel in posts about pizzagate, posts that claim that certain named persons are child molesters based only on conjecture and speculation. The fact that some of the info floating around pizzagate might turn out to be true, still won&#39;t change the libelous nature of all the rest.   </p>

<p>Even if it turned out that some of the usual suspects named in PG was actually guilty of child molesting, then it still has nothing to do with whatever artwork was collected or how company logos are designed.</p>

<p>Debunking specific points proves nothing and would be contrary to the point i&#39;m trying to make, so what would be the point of spending time debunking them one by one? </p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, then I really think you should re-assess your confirmation bias towards this stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>for the record, I don&#39;t think any one person at facebook sent me a death threat, but rather that the site in question created an automatic response when posted on facebook. It was instantaneous the second I posted the facebook link that the page refreshed with that message. It was too soon to be anything but an automated response. I also had my Twitter account hacked by people in Denver the day after I posted some links bw Madeline Albright and child sex traffickers. Denver of course is the headquarters of the anti-trafficking organization named in her father&#39;s honor.

<p>I&#39;ve heard talk about Enlisted pilots as far back as 2010. I guess they pussy footed around for a few years and are just now getting in to it. So my post was only mostly wrong. Thank you for the correction. </p>

<p>Also, your average Lieutenant is not far removed from just another high school kid, except with an English or Liberal Arts degree. Your average TSgt is far more experienced and trustworthy than any Lieutenant. </p>

<p>Police said 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N.C., walked in the front door of Comet Ping Pong and pointed a firearm in the direction of a restaurant employee.

    <div class="md"><p>Saying that because pedophiles have been busted elsewhere is evidence that Pizzagate is real is like saying because Jerry Sandusky got busted that Bill Belichick is a pedophile.</p>

<p>And people are making a big mistake when evaluating that circumstantial evidence. If you only look at the things which confirm what you already thought was true, then of course it&#39;s going to look like a mountain of evidence. It&#39;s the same thing as climate change denialists thinking there&#39;s a mountain of evidence against climate change because they only look at the 3% of papers disagreeing with climate change theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying about the need for more contextualization when it comes to confirmation bias and using unrelated examples, but the bill belichek/sandusky analogy isn&#39;t the same. If there were rumors going around that Belicheck liked little kids and the response was, &quot;no way a football coach would do that&quot;. Why would we would not bring up Sandusky as an example to suggest that it is possible? This type of evidence is to defend against dismissal, it&#39;s not meant to be proof of anything, necessarily. There were apparently whispers of sketchy stuff preists were doing for years but many wouldn&#39;t believe men of god could do such a thing. Now that we have numerous examples that this is not unheard of, when people do speak up, we tend to listen more closely. </p>

<p>Pedophiles being busted all over the country simply means that this might be a more pervasive problem than people would like to believe. It&#39;s not evidence, it&#39;s <em>context</em>. When scientists are caught manipulating temperature data, it doesn&#39;t mean climate change is fake, it means there might be multiple agendas with an interest in confirming their existing beliefs. Citing that &quot;only 3% of papers diagree with climate change theory(?)&quot; tells me you haven&#39;t looked too closely at the actual debate and are just blindly accepting consensus as evidence of your own claims, which it is not. </p>

<p>So I guess we just disagree on what qualifies as <em>compelling</em>, which I&#39;m okay with. It&#39;s definitely not an open and shut case, just a lot of little weird things added up. </p>

<p>On that note though, don&#39;t you see any relation between this case and the one with climate change? Anyone who disagrees with this statement: The climate is warming at an unsustainable rate specifically due to anthropological factors-- is automatically a &quot;climate change <em>denier</em>&quot;. That&#39;s the definition of a strawman if I&#39;ve ever seen one.  Did you ever read the survey that they got that 97% number from? I&#39;d be happy to link so you can read the actual report if you want, not what some opinion writer thinks it says. Even after you decipher that there <em>is</em> somewhat of a consensus, it is not nearly 97% percent that are in agreement about specific factors, natural cycles as significant drivers of temperature change, and most importantly, the <em>degree</em> of severity of the situation, and what various policies are going to be both a) noticeably effective in combating &quot;change&quot;, and b) cost-effectiveness. I think its bogus and misleading to classify me as a climate change <em>denier</em> just because I don&#39;t agree with their strict definition and &quot;at any cost&quot; approach to policy prescriptions. Any thoughts? I&#39;m just curious. I&#39;m not a natural science-oriented person so I&#39;m just going off of how I see the debate being framed, and actually reading the reports/surveys concerning the scientific community. </p>

<p>I will mention that they also found that, &quot;of the 90ish scientists with over 120+ studies done on human-caused climate change, 97% agree.&quot;(iirc)  Well, why would someone do over 100 studies, or how would they get funding to do 100 studies, if they aren&#39;t seeking to confirm this phenomena? Not saying it invalidates their research, just that it&#39;s not de facto proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the opposite extreme. No one is saying that because it happens in some places it happens everywhere. You evaluate all evidence and ask questions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is. As Gowdy said &quot;I haven&#39;t reached a conclusion, I ask you don&#39;t reach one either. This is an investigation.&quot; </p>

<p>What makes people get upset is the active cover ups and silencing of dissent. If I can&#39;t ask &quot;Why are the clintons doing X, Y, and Z,?&quot; then something is fucked. The circumstantial evidence is often paraded falsely because people for some fucking reason love to say &quot;this is absolutely stupid&quot;.</p>

<p>Why? Franklin cover up showed gov&#39;t leaders running sex rings. So it CAN happen, why CANT it happen with Podesta/Clintons? That&#39;s my question. It&#39;s not purely circumstantial, Clintons werent picked because LUL MAGA FK HILLDAWG. No, their whole clan has been doing shady shit, then over 10 years evidence of child trafficking leaked out, so we ask &quot;Are they really doing this?&quot; And in response to &quot;impossible&quot; we say &quot;well it&#39;s happened here, why would it be impossible in similar situations?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point he&#39;s making (I think) is that there is ample documented evidence that child sex trafficking involving government and media elites has happened and affected governments and media have had an active part in covering it up.</p>

<p>Documented cases of it happening have popped up at least 3 times in Washington DC since the 1970&#39;s and despite the evidence showing deep networks of pedophilia happening in the nations capital I can only think of 1 person convicted (Hastert). Many of those involved in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s rings will still be employed today.</p>

<p>Most recently in the mid-2000&#39;s we found out that at least 5000+ people were purchasing child pornography using government funds (likely purchasing cards) and yet we cannot name a single one, including any of the nine with top secret clearance involved in the practice. </p>

<p>The point is this; We know it&#39;s happened. We know it&#39;s happened recently. We know very <em>very</em> few are caught and punished. Logically many of those who have evaded capture or punishment are still active in Washington DC. Those people need to be stopped and need to face justice.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever said they&#39;re going to eat something &quot;for an hour&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you send me walnut sauce recipe?</p>

<p>I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most powerful people in the world are sending each others square shaped boxes with cheeses? You really think that&#39;s not some kind of a code? They&#39;re gonna demolish their kids and grandkids? </p>

<p>It&#39;s very obvious that they are talking in some kind of a code. It might not be children they are talking about, could be drugs or something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh come on. In multiple emails these people discuss dinner parties where one of them cooks and make their own pasta sauces. They enjoyed the pasta so the person made them some. You&#39;ve honestly never heard of people giving friends homemade food before? A square box is code somehow? I guess everybody who has ever moved before or put their things in storage are child murderers because they used square boxes. Also, cheese is a very popular food to give as presents. That person is waiting for their kids to get home so they can demolish the cheeses, because, idunno, maybe they want to share the food with their family? Christ, I guess I&#39;ll stay the fuck away from the dairy aisle next time I go grocery shopping, lest I end up a registered sex offender/child trafficker for my part in liking smoked Gouda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey buddy, why dont you read all the emails. In some they actually discuss food. </p>

<p>Guess what...it doesnt read anything like that. There is no code, and more than chicken, cheese, pasta, walnuts, and hotdogs are discussed. </p>

<p>So why are they speaking in some fucked up broken talk one time and normal another?</p>

<p>And tell me this, the story that actually made the paper on Bush Sr and co hiring gay porn stars and prostitutes, does that ring a bell? I&#39;ll help out: Obama flying in $65k in Chicago Hot Dogs. You can actually argue that one. On one side he&#39;s been accused of participating in the gay community in Chicago as a senator and that White House rules are strict against outside food and that $65k in &quot;lol taxpayer money&quot; of hotdogs is insane for a smallish party. On the other, they&#39;ve done crazier things, may be they just overpaid for some gourmet shit. </p>

<p>Either way, be skeptical. But straight denial is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now tell me what part of that says &quot;convicted of child trafficking and served the time&quot; to you? </p>

<p>The part where it was reduced to 6 months under some bogus travel charge? Weird, if I got caught with 33 kids I claimed were orphans and got charged with child trafficking, I&#39;d be rotting in Haiti. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t even find info on whether she stayed the 6 months. Like dude, what part of that chain of events says &quot;innocent&quot; or &quot;justice served&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll help you out, GA&#39;s McKinney and others wanted investigations into Clinton&#39;s children centers in Haiti, never happened. The only action was Haitian authorities trying to jail em. The fact that most of them were just released and the head bitch in charge got some bogus charge and walked away TO HEAD THE FUCKING AMBER ALERT SERVICES that doesnt say anything to you?</p>

<p>Tell me what part of equal under the law applies here? If you got caught trafficking kids would you then get a job deciding what missing children deserved an alert and which didnt? If you got caught selling weapons to ISIS would you then get a job at a weapons factory let alone being in charge of sales or distribution? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She wasn&#39;t convicted of trafficking. Apparently they didn&#39;t have enough evidence that they thought it would be something they could get a conviction for so they reduced the charges. She is a moron and could have thought she was helping kids get out of bad living situations for all we know. She probably thinks of herself as an advocate for children and that&#39;s why went to work for Amber Alert. </p>

<p>Hypothetically, if I was caught transporting kids in a third world country, thinking I was doing something to help them, I bet you anything I would just get a slap on the wrist as well. If I was dealing arms and was caught I would probably make a deal with the FBI and get a light jail sentence in return for information, after serving my sentence, yes, I could probably parley my experience into a legit job in sales or distribution. </p>

<p>It&#39;s right there dude...she WAS RUNNING A CHILDRENS SANCTUARY why the fuck is she taking kids across a border? She runs a fucking center for em? She decided these 33 needed to be illegally smuggled out? She couldnt ask for help to get em elsewhere if need be?</p>

<p>Also she said they were orphans, they were not. Is she misguided, stupid, or idk evil? </p>

<p>Like come on, this isnt skepticism, this is denial. You have a literal ton of evidence showing that rich and powerful are not prosecuted for crimes. Don&#39;t use that excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said they must not have felt they had enough evidence to find Silsby guilty of human trafficking. They got her for a different charge they felt they could prove. I didn&#39;t say shit about Hillary being prosecuted. That&#39;s a completely different situation. </p>

<p>Yeah, most American people in third world countries who can afford a lawyer are more likely to get out of legal issues there. This happens all the time regardless of their political connections. The Secretary of State was alerted to her situation and probably plenty of others as their job to be aware.</p>

<p>I think Silsby is a dumbass who thought she was helping these kids. Have you ever met any missionaries? Many are blinded by their faith and I could see them being easily fooled or doing something wrong while thinking it&#39;s something God wants them to do. I think more people are ignorant than evil. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting how you said, &quot;You have a literal ton of evidence showing that rich and powerful are not prosecuted for crimes.&quot; And then continued to name rich, powerful, connected people who were convicted of crimes. I guess I&#39;m the thick one though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think they probably are guilty of what would have technically been human trafficking. It sounds like the missionaries thought they had proper documentation but they didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t feel that they were trying to sell these kids to be sex slaves for the elite though. </p>

<p>It seems like the Clintons got involved because it was her job to know these things as Secretary of State. The Clintons probably did so shady things to make money off of the tragedy in Haiti but I just don&#39;t buy into the whole stealing kids for occult sex and murder. That&#39;s just how I feel personally though and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. </p>

<p>Thanks for being understanding and not just calling me a shill or thick for having a different opinion, I really do appreciate it! </p>

<p>1) It&#39;s clear that the children are not from the home of the person hosting. </p>

<p>2) It&#39;s not clear that the children have ever met Podesta</p>

<p>3) The woman (who has the same last name as the children) refers to them as &#39;entertainment&#39; for Podesta to enjoy. I would never refer to my children as &#39;entertainment&#39; for a visitor to enjoy, especially in the context of them swimming in a pool (presumably in bathing suits).</p>

<p>The language doesn&#39;t make sense. As a parent or even a family member, why would I refer to my children or nieces/nephews as &#39;entertainment&#39; for an older male visitor that hasn&#39;t met them before?  For me, that&#39;s the big question mark. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you understand that to be the context? Why are kids being invited and Uber&#39;d over if Podesta doesn&#39;t have children as well? Why invite a stressful problem over in the first place?</p>

<p>You are reaching as much as anybody asking why some lady calls her kids &#39;entertainment&#39;, even as a joke. Considering who the email was for (Podesta) and the lack of relationship, I don&#39;t understand why you would place it in the context you have. Again, from all accounts these kids had never met Podesta, hence why their full names and ages were used in the email.</p>

<p>That&#39;s another point - if this is supposed to be a jovial, friendly email, why are we talking about people with full name and ages attached? If I was having my kids Uber&#39;d to some pool party with an old man, I don&#39;t think i&#39;d refer to them in email by their full title and age. </p>

<p>&#39;Have Fun, child John Doe, age of 6! Enjoy the party!&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My response from elsewhere in the comments:</p>

<p>Original quote from the email: &quot;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Alternate phrasing: &quot;The pools is gonna be heated so you guys can swim while you&#39;re here. Also, Bonnie is gonna be bringing along the Luzzatto kids (they&#39;re between 7 and 11). They&#39;ll definitely be in the pool so that should be entertaining.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a matter of phrasing. Entertainment doesn&#39;t have to mean &quot;hey we&#39;re gonna bring these 3 kids so you can fuck them.&quot; At least that isnt anywhere near the first thing I think of when mentioning little kids being entertainment, but maybe I&#39;m just a normal person. Old people get a kick out of little kids. And it matters their ages because different ages require different supervision. They aren&#39;t 2 or 3 where they need constant surveillance in a pool and outside the pool, but they also aren&#39;t teens so they will need to be supervised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why is the fact that there will be 3 kids in a heated pool for entertainment being expressed in an email to other adults? If i&#39;m planning a dinner party with my friends, I don&#39;t mention that my children will be there and will be swimming &#39;for sure&#39; - that would be super creepy of me. </p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t understand why the children even come up in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, why does it matter that they will &#39;be in that pool for sure&#39;? Why does she need to confirm that fact? The language is suspect if you think about the intention. Why is she wording it this way?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A grandparent? Sure. An uncle or close family friend? I can understand it. People who are complete strangers (hence needing to use full names and ages)? What the hell - no! Again, I don&#39;t understand how this is not at least a little suspect. </p>

<p>I will concede that very unfortunate wording may ultimately be the culprit, and I don&#39;t even want to imply those children were directly impacted - maybe he just watched them play in the pool in a family setting like you&#39;re implying. I still think it&#39;s kinda weird that they were used as a point of emphasis for &#39;entertainment&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A circumstantial case is often made up of individual pieces of evidence that on their own might appear innocent or only mildly suspect, but when you tie all the individual pieces of evidence together paint a pretty clear picture of guilt.</p>

<p>If people are part of a circle of people who keep making comments that use pedophile code words, use pedophile symbols and logos, make pedophile jokes most people would find revolting, decorate their homes with pedophile art work, are close friends with convicted pedophiles, advocate for jailed pedophiles, support policies that make it easier for pedophiles to gain access to children, are part of a circle that comments online about kill rooms, while some members of this circle build or refer to underground bunkers in their homes or places of business, at some point you have to stop giving them the benefit of the doubt when a comment seems a bit suspect and consider that it should be added to the pile of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the information. I was wrong. I hadn&#39;t heard where they got those details and I knew there were reports of him shooting the floor, but he definitely shot through that door.</p>

<p>Regardless, the shot was accidental. It would have been impossible for him to know exactly what&#39;s behind those doors. <em>Even if he did</em>, it&#39;s clear that only the computer&#39;s power supply was shot and there is no mention of loss of data. Those types of computers have their hard drives located below the optical drive bays. This is very important, because it&#39;s clear that even though the computer was shot, he can&#39;t claim to have lost data (which is presumably the reason for this &quot;false flag&quot;).</p>

<p>PG proponents argument would that JA and/or the others accused would somehow stage a huge elaborate &quot;false flag&quot;, yet neglect to actually destroy the data? It makes no sense. If they weren&#39;t trying to destroy the data, then bringing up the fact that he shot a computer is irrelevant, since the &quot;false flag&quot; was meant for some other reasons. Either way, this specific detail doesn&#39;t really indicate a &quot;false flag&quot; IMO. You can feel free to disagree, of course, as either scenario is equally likely (there were definitely people advocating for going to CPP to &quot;investigate&quot; and to bring &quot;protection&quot;).</p>

<p>TL;DR: I was wrong about the details, but there&#39;s a difference between shooting through a door and accidentally hitting a computer&#39;s power supply vs going to the pizza shop specifically to shoot a computer. The latter sounding much more suspicious wrt a false flag than the former. It&#39;s clear the shooter was looking for a secret room, but found nothing. My mistake about the details, but the fact that he shot a computer doesn&#39;t add credence to the belief that this is a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think theres a big difference in pizzagate and 9/11 truthers, in that pizzagate has a targeted specificity, and an extreme urgency, theres a lot of different theories about 9/11, the consensus just being that the official story isn&#39;t true, a pizzagate version would be if all 9/11 truthers thought &quot;Grimes Elephantus&quot; orchestrated 9/11, an was still actively plotting to kill more people as part of his evil scheme. </p>

<p>Even if you think the CPP shooter was a false flag, do you really think its unbelievable? to a lot of people there are children ACTIVELY being abused and murdered, and the police refuse to do even a basic investigation! if someone could just get in there and see something, you could crack it all open and save those kids! Before the guy did that, people were saying on reddit to go there with a go pro, and bring a gun for protection.</p>

<p>That kinda thing scares people a lot more than jfk/9/11 conspiracies, because they&#39;re 1000x more likely to act on something like this, than on a conspiracy where you couldn&#39;t conceivably do anything about it anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today, the best way to separate the arguments is to look at the media supplied by the spectrum of doubters and believers. Invariably, the doubters are from large (corporate) media institutions and, as a rule, they examine as little evidence as possible - usually defaulting to the &quot;4chan hoax argument.&quot; <em>MANY</em> independent researchers have put together their own compilations of information and drawn their own conclusions using <em>VARIOUS FORMS OF EVIDENCE</em> to state their case(s).</p>

<p>Is there actual proof? If there is, I have not found it; I am thankful, as actual proof is CP. Still, there is more than ample evidence to make the determination that <em>SOMETHING SKETCHY</em> was going on with Pedostas, JA, and Co. Sadly for our partisan doubters, the NSA has all of the information logged away. Legal precedent from copyright case vs. KimDotcom gives legal precedent for this to be used as evidence. CF players are going down. If lefty partisans want in on the action, then they need to look into CF crimes in Haiti and demand prosecution of Dyncorp. Luckily for Dyn, the lefties get no such instruction from their echo chambers (has nothing to do with racism/sexism/EvilRussia). 2017 is going to be an interesting year!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is no one mentioning the political aspect?</p>

<p>It&#39;s really simple why myself and a lot of other people push back against it: the theory was conjured up by Trump supporters to attack Trump&#39;s political enemies.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got it in you, try to take a step back and look at this from the perspective of someone who dislikes Trump and does not find the evidence for PG remotely compelling.</p>

<p>Is it really that surprising that people would push back against poorly sourced pedophilia accusations thrown around against the political opposition to the most powerful man in the world? A personal army of supporters to the President trying to discredit every prominent member of the opposition party (the one with little actual power at the moment) with the most horrible accusation imaginable.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a member of the Democratic party or simply anti-Trump you&#39;re a potential victim of this witch hunt. You see it here all the time - someone speaks out against PG (or even Trump in general) and gets called a pedo or pedo defender.</p>

<p>Are the people pushing PG capable of imagining being on the other side of these accusations?</p>

<p>The whole thing stemmed from the podesta leaks.

<p>Some of it was on reddit, some of it was on 4chan, some of it was on voat, but the whole point of it was to take down &quot;crooked hillary&quot; and her supporters (MAGA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>follows is a comment I&#39;ve posted before</em></p>

<p>i was hanging out in r/wikileaks 3-5 hours a day starting about 2 weeks before the release of the Podesta e-mails that birthed pizzagate.  i occasionally swung by 4chan during p-gate&#39;s spawning, but not daily.  I saw real-time the whole process from &quot;Hmm, what&#39;s this?&quot; when the e-mails and their odd phrasing/syntax was discovered, to &quot;Umm, guys?&quot; to &quot;This isn&#39;t real.&quot; to &quot;ohhhhh shit...&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody was looking for anything pedo related when the two e-mails that originally piqued interest were released.  The syntax/phrasing was so odd people figured it for a code and started trying to puzzle it out.  After several days, someone found an FBI list of pedo-slang/codewords.  When read as slang, the e-mails made creepy sense.</p>

<p>IMHO, the two e-mails didn&#39;t convince the majority of eventual pizzagaters (such as myself).  Alot of eyebrows went up but... Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and this is extraordinarily serious shit.  Enter SpiritCooking, Marina Abramovic, some pretty dark art/artists surrounding children, one reallllllly questionable photo on Instagram, and Madeleine Mccann.  And all that <strong>on top</strong> of what was already common, well-proven knowledge about the Clinton&#39;s associations with Jeffrey Epstein/Lolita Express.</p>

<p>People were motivated to start digging.  IIRC, it was mostly via Maria Abramovic that the connection to James Alefantis &amp; Comet Ping Pong was originally made.  And from there shit gets really &quot;no-effing-way&quot; unreal very quickly.  IMHO, discovery of the SpiritCooking stuff allowed the majority of pizzagaters to entertain the possibility there&#39;s some genuine pedo/ritual abuse going on.  </p>

<p>From there, its not a very large conceptual leap to consider the broader problem/idea of sex/child trafficking and its history, both in the US and worldwide.  People started looking into &quot;pizzagate&quot; in that context and found Comet Ping Pong, et.al., fit a certain profile way to well and, even uglier, Clinton Foundation actions in Haiti and other 3rd world countries they operate don&#39;t always make sense unless there&#39;s some sort of questionable motive.  </p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>, Pizzagate has evolved to be as much a reference the global child-trafficking/abuse as anything at Comet Ping Pong.  Most of the original pizzagaters have evolved in their beliefs as well.  Most who go down the rabbit-hole and look into just recent events in the US find there&#39;s a huge dearth of convictions and arrests relative to investigations and publicly available information.  There&#39;s also a pattern of investigations getting stopped and major stories stories getting held back.</p>

<p>Admittedly, <del>alot</del> most of the <strong>SMOKING GUN!!!!1!!</strong> posts about pizzagate are exercises in confirmation bias but there&#39;s still a fair bit of questionable stuff.  </p>

<p>The Instagram photos are an excellent example.  Most of the photos getting attention probably have innocent explanations.  However, the chickenlover Instagram photo...  There&#39;s clearly intentional symbolism in the pic.  In and of itself, it&#39;d be chalked up to poor taste and South Park humor.</p>

<p>Another example is the logo/graphics stuff.  I&#39;m an artist with graphic design/layout xp and, again, the overwhelming majority of what is getting posted is almost certainly aesthetic/style choices devoid of pedo meaning.  However, having said that, the original Comet Pizza logo with the spiral was a bit blatantly coincidental to pedo code.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just too much stuff.  Its like a doctor or a teacher who keeps seeing a patient or student come in with scrapes and bruises.  How many times can a kid fall off their bicycle or someone&#39;s spouse trip down the stairs before red flags go up?</p>

<p>The Madeleine Mccann kidnapping is a good example of the &quot;too much stuff&quot; idea.  Normally, most of us would consider the police sketches one of those really weird coincidences, be glad we don&#39;t look like the Podestas and quietly hope we never look like someone in a police sketch.  Most of us would justifiably and reasonably give the Podestas a pass.  Shit <strong>does</strong> happen.  But then you find out the Podestas were probably staying at a nearby house at the same time, John P. was having an assistant answer his e-mails during that period, the Mccann&#39;s story is, at best, an exercise in negligent parenting...  </p>

<p>Too. Much. Weird. Shit.</p>

<p>Personally, the phrasing/syntax of the two pizza e-mails <em>(handkerchief &amp; domino/pizza/pasta)</em> piqued my interest but was hardly enough to convince me of anything.  It was the conjunction with SpiritCooking, Abramavic and Tony&#39;s abused-kid art collection that convinced me to start looking into it on my own.  Nothing I&#39;ve learned since, either specific to Pizzagate or the wider pedos-among-the-powerful concept has done anything to alleviate suspicions.</p>

<p>Ah, speaking of innocent-ish explanations...  In and of itself, TP&#39;s art collection wouldn&#39;t have raised a red flag.  People groove on weird shit well past their teenage years.  Not knowing the guy but putting myself in his shoes, my first impression would be a) he&#39;s trying to shock people or b) this is how he deals with messed up shit from his own childhood.  However, given everything else...  There&#39;s a recurring theme here.</p>

<p><strong>Do your own research on the Clinton Foundation.</strong> Literally, there is absolutely nothing to absolve them of child-trafficking suspicions.  There&#39;s no smoking gun but there&#39;s a f-ton of questionable choices/events/associations.  CF activities in Haiti <strong>absolutely</strong> need to be investigated.  As does the &quot;suicide&quot; of Monica Peterson.  Before her &quot;suicide&quot; shortly before the US elections, Monica Peterson was in Haiti investigating human trafficking and had found links to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Folks want to be all in denial about this stuff b/c &quot;that kind of thing doesn&#39;t happen&quot; and the overwhelming majority of us are decent sorts who prefer to &quot;assume goodwill&quot;.  <strong>BUT...</strong> there&#39;s quite a few well-proven stories/cases of the powerful engaging in regular pedophilia and ritual sex abuse. Its also seriously ugly crap to wade into and most people don&#39;t want to think about it.  </p>

<p>its worth reviewing other material first that has nothing to do with p-gate.  the following links are just a place to get started on their respective topics.</p>

<p>Start investigating the above links on your own and sooner or later one can&#39;t help but wonder what motivates people, who benefits, logistics and all the other stuff associated with any human endeavor.  Every answer leads to more questions.</p>

<p>Its looking at pizzagate allegations with the links above in mind that made alot of p-gaters realize it was more than a little possible the Podestas, Clintons, et.al. could be involved in child sex/trafficking/ritual abuse.  Start looking at the Clintons in that context and stuff starts to pop out <em>(i.e.: Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s main madam/&quot;procurer&quot; having a front-row seat at Chelsea&#39;s wedding)</em>.</p>

<p>If you are looking for more reasons to think Pizzagate is special, consider that its support was galvanized on forums with a history publishing child pornography. Critics were able to watch the creation of pizzagate in realtime and it went like this:</p>

<p>There are weird food words in e-mails, including Cheese Pizza. -&gt;
CP is a popular abbreviation for Child Porn <em>on the website I frequent.</em> -&gt; Cheese Pizza must mean Child Porn -&gt; They must be pedophiles!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is scapegoating.</p>

<p>In modern society sex is so heavily forced on everyone that it causes an intense internal and cultural conflict with vying emotions of lust, guilt, fidelity, and promiscuity. Couple this with rapidly changing social norms about sexual and gender identity alongside changes in technology that allow instant communication, online dating and very little direct contact and society begins looking for a scapegoat to alleviate their sense of conflict. </p>

<p>In the past the target would have been gay men but that is no longer possible so the target has moved to the pedophile. Attacking the pedophille (because no one questions attacking the pedophille) allows for a release of conflict. You didn&#39;t see the same fervor against pedophillia in the past when there was a more visible target. You will notice how accusations peaked during times of great upheaval like the daycare hysteria during the 80s or the priest scandal momentum  after 9/11.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind, what I am talking about is the public&#39;s interest and targeting of pedophiles. there have been other times when the public&#39;s interest was on animal abusers, terrorists, corrupt politicians, police officers, etc. but there is always an ultimate evil. </p>

<p>Now consider 4Chan. It is no wonder that the most vocal and tenacious pedophillia opponents come out of an anonymous web forum flooded with not only run of the mill pornography, but trap porn, anime porn, Rule 34, and child pornography.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why is Pizzagate so special?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on the surface, it&#39;s because it appears to target a specific person who is not necessarily considered a public figure- JA.  And he is using the safety of his employees to deflect. &quot;I don&#39;t care if you crazy kids want to make some ridiculous accusations about ME, but I am obliged to protect my employees and family from you tin foilers&quot;</p>

<p>He has been able to say- look, because of this witch-hunt, my employees are now threatened with crazy conspiracy theorists who are coming into my restaurant with guns.</p>

<p>If podesta was the primary figure here, i don&#39;t think they could shut it down as easily, because he is obviously a powerful public figure.  </p>

<p>There used to be libel laws which could stopped journalists from making spurious claims against people and corporations.  With the internet, we can all make any claims we want.  This allows us to theorize without proof- free speech.  But it also means anonymous people can make stuff up and impact your PR, and you have no recourse.  </p>

<p>This dude called in some favors (I still haven&#39;t seen why he is supposedly so powerful and connected) and they started shutting down conversation on this BEFORE there was a demonstrable threat (maybe he had death threats, but who hasn&#39;t received some of those?  this is the internet).  When that guy walked in there with a gun, it really solidified it.  </p>

<p>And because the theory was so poorly constructed at first- with a lot of leaps and assumptions, it really just looked like a fear-mongering haphazard conspiracy theory that was targeting specific people.  It was really easy to dismiss as crazy.</p>

<p>As if pizzagate is about <em>one</em> paedophile owning a pizza store. If it was just one person that would be very believable. But Pizzagate stretches to the very top of the US government, supposedly. Right? It&#39;s supposed to be a huge thing. </p>

<p>Killing 3,000 Americans lead to actions that might have benefitted some powerful people. Patriot Act, Iraq War, etc. </p>

<p>But why would paedophiles in the government choose a pizza store? Aren&#39;t there more secure and secret locations out there? </p>

<p>and this alefiantis guy is named one of the top 50 most influential people in DC so obviously someone is benefiting  </p>

<p>im just not seeing the disconnect between 9/11 and pizzagate, pizzagate is obviously the more realistic/believable conspiracy.    </p>

<p>especially when you look around the world and see that other government officials get caught for this shit. its not a huge leap to think that maybe they talked to eachother about where they went and who they called to get there...  </p>

<p>i dunno seems pretty retarded to believe a really fantastical giant conspiracy (and by all means, 9/11 in my opinion is true, but that doesnt take away from the fact that its absolutely ridiculous in its scope) over a conspiracy rooted in already proven facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take as fact, just for my comment, that the WTC towers collapsed due to charges strategically placed inside the elevator shafts by a crew of contractors &quot;hired to upgrade the internet&quot; as this random <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/trade-center-cameras-locks-electricity-turned-off-weekend-before-911/">source</a> says.</p>

<p>Well, those contractors would have been operating (planting explosives) under a <em>front.</em> The government, or Saudis, or Mossad, Jews, reptilians, alines, whoever you think wanted it done - <em>they</em> would have ordered it done from their own office (or equivalent), but they can&#39;t very well plant the explosives themselves. So they have it done by proxy behind a front.</p>

<p>With that in mind,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why would paedophiles in the government choose a pizza store?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t pick a pizza store. The pizza place is just one facet of the whole story. And from everything I&#39;ve seen on it, it is or was a front.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like this: say this &quot;CES&quot; guy FBIanon (or was it a LARPer...) claimed fucks kids - well, Check Schummmm I mean CES, he&#39;s not going to do that in his <em>office</em>, right? Certainly not at his house? Definitely not somewhere people know to find him, e.g. places be drinks, hands out at, shits at. And certainly not anywhere where he&#39;s the only one fucking kids - because there is strength and acceptance in numbers, right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they picked a <em>pizza place</em>. I think they picked <em>a front shop</em> owned by someone they were all connected to, a place they all knew they could get away with fucking kids at. A place owned by the guy that maintains the circulatory system of the conglomerate body of high-ring pedos in DC. They didn&#39;t pick it <em>because</em> it was a pizza place - they picked it because of who owned it. And who says it&#39;s not secure? Have you been to the basement?</p>

<p>Same as the internet contractors on 9-11, it&#39;s a front. An abstraction, obfuscation of the group that&#39;s really in charge. 9-11 and Pizzagate conspiracy theories are both equally as believable. They are not at odds with each other, and believing in one does not mean that you necessarily have to renounce the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, &#39;Fake news&#39;, that was one of the things that made me really take interest in Pizzagate, I showed an interest in PG prior to that, but the evidence was all circumstantial, so I was inclined to not believe it at that point. And then the media crackdown came and it was bizarre, I have never heard the term &#39;fake news&#39; in the media before, yet when PG emerged, all of a sudden every media outlet is using it?! And if you look at a graph of trends in Google searches, you see a suspicious correlation between the terms &#39;fake news&#39; and &#39;pizzagate&#39;, fake news kicked off just prior to pizzagate in Google searches, almost as if they were getting in there quick to prevent too many people from catching on and looking into PG.</p>

<p>Then of course was the way they reported on it, ignoring the more disturbing details and picking out isolated pieces of circumstantial evidence to &#39;debunk&#39; and distorting the entire investigation to make it look like a few loons online that jumped to wild conclusions based on no evidence. But with PG, in the absence of concrete proof, you&#39;ve got to look at each piece of evidence in the context of the wider investigation, sure, that one weird photo of a baby on its own looks innocuous enough, but when you consider everything else in the investigation together, the emails, the other pictures, the creepy comments, all Alefantis&#39; connections in high places, the &#39;Pegasus&#39; museum overlooking a children&#39;s playground etc etc, suddenly that weird picture of a baby doesn&#39;t seem as innocuous anymore and you can&#39;t help but wonder...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t deny that, and i&#39;m not accusing you personally of anything.  </p>

<p>But i think you can find plenty of undeniable proof of libel in posts about pizzagate, posts that claim that certain named persons are child molesters based only on conjecture and speculation. The fact that some of the info floating around pizzagate might turn out to be true, still won&#39;t change the libelous nature of all the rest.   </p>

<p>Even if it turned out that some of the usual suspects named in PG was actually guilty of child molesting, then it still has nothing to do with whatever artwork was collected or how company logos are designed.</p>
