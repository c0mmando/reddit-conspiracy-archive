<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/828135633780633600/photo/1">https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/828135633780633600/photo/1</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a really good <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1999/spring/nazi-gold-merkers-mine-treasure.html">history on the mine</a></p>

<p>Some highlights</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 8 Patton learned that in addition to the paper money found the day before, his soldiers had found a significant quantity of gold, and he also learned that the press had found out about the Merkers mine and had published stories about the capture of the gold. Patton called Gen. Omar N. Bradley, commander of the U.S. Twelfth Army Group, and told him that owing to the amount of the seizure and the fact that it had been made public, he believed it was now a political question and requested that Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), commanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, be asked to send somebody to take it over.(25) Colonel Bernstein Becomes Involved The person who would take over the Merkers operation was Col. Bernard D. Bernstein, deputy chief, Financial Branch, G-5 Division of SHAEF. In October 1942, when he was commissioned a colonel, Bernstein was the assistant general counsel at the Department of the Treasury, handling foreign funds matters. Late on the morning of April 8, Bernstein, at SHAEF headquarters at Versailles, read a front-page story in the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune about the discovery of the gold and other treasures at Merkers. He immediately called Barrett to see if he had any information on the subject. He was advised that Barrett was forward at Third Army and would be telephoned immediately about the matter.(26)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 18 Bernstein sent McSherry a detailed report of the activities that had taken place during the preceding two weeks. He concluded by observing that &quot;the Germans hid their assets in mines and other secret places in Germany, presumably with the intent of maintaining a source of financing of pro-Nazi activity.&quot; &quot;Many of these caches,&quot; he continued, &quot;have not yet been uncovered and should be ferreted out as soon as operations permit.&quot; He observed that it was &quot;necessary that some procedure be established for analyzing and utilizing the property and records found in the Merkers area and those uncovered in the future.&quot; &quot;Intelligence reports,&quot; he wrote, &quot;indicate that just as the Germans secreted assets and valuable property within Germany, they also made elaborate arrangements for secreting assets in neutral and other nations of the world.&quot; &quot;Every step should be taken,&quot; he urged, &quot;in Germany to obtain information of the assets secreted both inside and outside Germany so that these assets cannot be used to perpetuate Nazism or contribute to the rebuilding of Nazi influence.&quot;(65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the summer of 1945, Allied currencies found at Merkers and elsewhere by the Americans were returned to various countries, and the process of restituting the artworks found at Merkers and elsewhere in the former German Reich began.(68) The gold found at Merkers was in early 1946 turned over to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency and eventually turned over to the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold (TGC) for distribution to countries whose central-bank gold had been stolen by the Nazis. The TGC began the process of getting the gold returned to most countries as quickly as possible. However, cold war factors resulted in some of the gold not being restituted until 1996.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The accomplishments of recovering, moving, and managing the Merkers treasure by Colonels Bernstein, Barrett, Morris, Moore, Mason, and their colleagues may or may not have shortened the war. But they did block the Nazi leaders from further use of their looted gold and property of victims of their persecution. Their actions also ensured that the central banks of Europe would receive back at least some of the gold the Nazis had seized and that some funds would be available for restitution to individuals.(70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This report details were the gold was sent and when: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.state.gov/s/l/65668.htm">https://www.state.gov/s/l/65668.htm</a></p>

<p>By all accounts this was a serious operation and the Allies/Eisenhower took it very seriously and were meticulous with making sure everything was accounted for and returned. </p>

<p>Again like the engine this is a very specific picture to post. My theory on what the message is, is based off nothing but my observations so take it as you will.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the total value of the loot in the Nazi mine was estimated at 520 million dollars, about 3 billion today. </p>

<p>So all this coordination and effort was put into following this 3 billion and making sure it was all accounted for. This is most likely due to the nature of it being stolen goods and all the afflicted countries were sure to be vocal about getting their gold back. The question is, how would the gold have been handled if it wasn&#39;t necessarily stolen, but considered ill gotten gains in the eyes of the would be captors? 
The only other example that I can think of where precious metals in the billions of dollars in value were seized by a foreign entity is Libya in 2011. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6528">This document</a> is an email from <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6528">Sid Bluementhal</a> to Hillary Clinton. It states that insider information puts Gaddafis gold and silver reserves at around $7 billion dollars. Most of which being 143 tons of gold. </p>

<p>From the email</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to sensitive information available to this
these individuals, Qaddafi&#39;s government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read the whole document you&#39;ll see mentions of his frozen bank accounts and how they wouldn&#39;t really trip him up too much by cutting those off because he had all this gold and silver. So we won&#39;t talk about where the estimated $150-256 billion dollars are (there are reports its scattered every where from swiss accounts to south african airplane hangars) or what the motivations for going into Libya were (although they are outlined fairly well in that email). I just want to talk about where the gold and silver went. </p>

<p>Like I said this is different in that there wasn&#39;t anyone to return the gold or silver to like with the Nazi loot, and because of that there was no organized or focused effort to secure the gold and silver, despite the value being <em>double</em> that of what was in the Nazi&#39;s stores. </p>

<p>These articles talk about the situation but there&#39;s no clear answer to what happened to the gold:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/libyan-oil-gold-and-qaddafi-the-strange-email-sidney-blumenthal-sent-hillary-clinton-in-2011">https://news.vice.com/article/libyan-oil-gold-and-qaddafi-the-strange-email-sidney-blumenthal-sent-hillary-clinton-in-2011</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hangthebankers.com/libya-destroyed-gold-silver-missing/">http://www.hangthebankers.com/libya-destroyed-gold-silver-missing/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://awfulavalanche.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/who-stole-143-tons-of-gold-from-the-libyan-people/">https://awfulavalanche.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/who-stole-143-tons-of-gold-from-the-libyan-people/</a></p>

<p>Under the command of Esienhower and the under the circumstances that it was stolen goods, 3 billion dollars in goods was given insane amounts of protection and documentation. It was a detailed military operation. In Libya a similar situation arises, save for there&#39;s limited allied/NATO boots on the ground, its &quot;ill gotten gains&quot; not stolen, and the total sum is 7 billion instead of three, and instead of heavy protection and strict documentation there&#39;s nothing. The goverment/state dept. doesn&#39;t even offer up a theory or propaganda story that &quot;the rebels took it&quot; because it doesn&#39;t fit. There&#39;s limited options and people for handling 7 billion in precious metals, and the &quot;rebels&quot; sure wouldn&#39;t have the skills or resources to pull it off. </p>

<p>So is wikileaks saying they know what happened with Gaddafis gold? Its the only situation that I can relate to the Nazi loot pic at all, If anyone has any other simlar instances or theories lets here em</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was much more, including explosions before and during the demolition of the world first &quot;skyscraper collapse due to fire&quot; and a finely remodeled one at that.</p>

<p>But wait if the audio and video and FDNY testimonies on explosions at 7 (not 1 and 2 cause those explosions actually destroyed lobbies and people) are fake and the small fire made a building free fall, then how did it start?</p>

<p>Oh simple, it was when the insanely strong struts of the WTC went fucking flying and hit the WTC 7. You know flying too far for a fire caused free fall collapse, but not as far as deutchebank bldg, the one housing hundreds of fdny/wtc employee bone fragments on its roof. </p>

<p>You know, like when buildings collapse and they fucking launch people blocks away in small pieces, it&#39;s LIKE an explosion, but it&#39;s really just office fires. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn... why are humans so caught up on gold? It&#39;s so silly... I heard aliens need gold to scatter about in their planetary orbit to protect against a projected incoming bombardment from some kind of space radiation in a the distant future, so they came to earth long ago and tampered with our DNA to make us desire gold to such an extent that we dig every last little crumb of it out of our planet&#39;s crust and consolidate it into gigantic stockpiles... then when it is all pure and smelted and bricked up for transport the aliens will return and snatch up all our stockpiles and take it back to their planet to make preparations... Not true, but an entertaining thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess so.</p>

<p>I just saw your response and wanted to clarify that copper is what gives it the antibacterial quality, as brass is an alloy of copper.</p>

<p>So gold, silver, and copper, at least.</p>

<p>And look at this, copper used by ancients for its antibacterial properties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good read. Still reading. Highlights so far</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1930′s, royal Asian families had seen that some of their gold and silver holdings in Southeast Asia were being plundered by the Japanese and needed to do something about it. In 1938, the Chinese Kuomintang government sent 7 warships loaded with gold and silver to the US Federal Reserve for safekeeping.</p>

<p>In return, the Chinese were given 60 year gold bonds–a subject we will return to further down. A few years later in 1944, the infamous Bretton Woods Conference took place in which the US, France and Britain were given a 50 year mandate to modernize and transform the world for the better. Backing this new global financial system that had just been set up was a now estimated 2 million metric tons of gold, held by this group of royal Asian families, which is also known as the Dragon Family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1998, 60 years after the Federal Reserve Board and the Chinese swapped gold for gold bonds, the Chinese requested their gold back. After refusal from the Fed, the Chinese Kuomintang government followed with a lawsuit.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice ruled that the Fed needed to return the gold, which was later agreed upon by the Fed. The first payment was scheduled to be delivered September 12th, 2001.</p>

<p>Interestingly, on September 10th, 2001, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced that 2.3 trillion dollars went missing from the Pentagon defense budget.</p>

<p>Even more conspicuous, Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, the company that was handling the paper work for the gold to be delivered back to the Chinese, was inside One World Trade Center on floors 101-105. All 658 of their employees were murdered on that day as the towers fell and the gold was not returned to the Chinese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s certainly possible that they are referring this but there are so many more accurate/descriptive while still cryptic ways to allude more to that scenario. I still feel the Libya scenario has more parallels </p>
