<p>If so, do you think he will go after those at the top, such as Podesta?</p>

<p>If so, how soon do you think it will be before the arrests start?</p>

<p>The reason I ask this, is that according to fbi anon, and what I personally believe, there are hundreds if not thousands of people in our government who will be implicated. No doubt the fbi and the justice department are powerful, but what this means is going after some of the most powerful people in world.</p>

If this investigation is being done by the FBI and the Justice Dept. than I believe it his job to follow through. Hopefully the dominoes fall. You are right they are very powerful people, and some of them with probably be found not guilty or take pleas deals for lesser charges. But I believe if they have the evidence to prosecute we will see some top politicians be charged and convicted to the fullest extent that the laws allow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also wonder about Comey. I think there is a lot of behind the scenes action that went on, that we will never know.</p>

<p>I have no reason to think this is true, but it is a thought I had:  Comey reopening the case a week before the election was a game a chicken. It was him saying to HRC that we have all the evidence to put you away and you know it. If you rig this election we will procecute.</p>

<p>It just strikes me as strange that the case was reopened so close to the election. Waiting a week wouldn&#39;t have made much difference in terms of a procecution. It did make a huge difference in the amount of publicity and the election. Comey is no friend of HRC. Going after a Senetor, former first lady, presidential nominee, etc. Is no small task. People around HRC have committed suicide for less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hit me hard tonight how strong and deep this cross section of thought is. I want to believe it&#39;s the final cards, but honestly, if it happens, it will be the first time we&#39;ve breached the wall and will finally get a glance of what&#39;s inside. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing this for too long to pretend I can even pretend to imagine or comprehend the level of depth or complexity of connections that are likely involved in this. We&#39;re just getting started and this journey will last many years and change the course of human history in a similar magnitude as a world war. </p>

Yes history is changing right now. It will be a rocky transition but eventually I think it will bring us all together. The division has been artificially instigated all along.</p>

<p>i&#39;m doubtful though. i really am. if household named politicians go down, i will stand back in awe, jaw to the floor in mild shock. not holding my breath though. people in power are rarely held accountable for their actions. everyone&#39;s gettin paid or suicided.</p>

<p>I think there is enough evidence right now to prosecute these people, but Loretta Lynch wont. I believe that is because she is politically connected to the people involved in pizzagate. I am hoping that Jeff Sessions is not involved in pizzagate, and is willing to press charges. Maybe its a stretch, but its the best hope i have for the time being.</p>
