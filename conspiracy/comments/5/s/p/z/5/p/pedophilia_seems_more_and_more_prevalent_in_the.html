       My personal conspiracy on the subject is that Townsend has been abused as a kid and that's why he was looking at this shit. Still, the fact that he got caught so easily means he's probably
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a member of the cabal, just a straggler.

       the more it is discussed the more it is normalized in our collective psyche. the more it is normalized the sooner it is accepted. then it will be defended by the masses as normal and even beautiful. "love" is love after all...

       I disagree - part of the problem that so many people don't buy or even understand PG is because nobody realizes how depraved a big part of humanity is - we sugarcoat everything as a culture; when something bad happens, you really see it with your own eyes, just read about it.
      </p>

       The only way to combat evil is to acknowledge that it exists in full force at every turn, and constantly plan your attack plan against it.  Burying this shit doesnt make it go away; that gives it a chance to fester

       I agree. I have noticed when I talk to people about conspiracy, they are much more apt to listen when it is about 9/11 or even sandy hook.  But when you start talking massive pedo rings, you can tell how uncomfortable they are. Like they don't even want to hear it

       "When U.S. Supreme Court Justice (((Ruth Bader Ginsburg))) was an attorney for the ACLU, she co-authored a report recommending that the age of consent for sexual acts be lowered to 12 years of age," the article points out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knight and York's footnoted documentation on this is as follows: "Sex Bias in the U.S. Code," Report for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, April 1977, p. 102, quoted in "Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Feminist World View," The Phyllis Schlafly Report, Vol. 26, No. 12, Section 1, p. 3. The paragraph (from the Ginsburg report) reads as follows: "'Eliminate the phrase "carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of 16 years" and substitute a federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense. ... A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person. ... [and] the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.'

       Me too. Not a fan of alchy either, but there's something magical about a night with friends, debauchery, bar bathroom/off the titty blow. Can't see how people get addicted to it or adderall though, fuckkk that crash, and fuck it sober.

       Townshend was writing a book dealing with his own abuse and his defence was it was research for said book.

       I wouldn't doubt for a second that a lot of these people are in a large organized homoerotic boys club that stretched across the western world. I wouldn't doubt that almost every cop, lawyer and judge, mayor fireman and businessman were in this club too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't doubt that this club has tenets that state they must come to the aid of their fellow club member no matter what.

       They will never admit they are in the club nor will they deny it. My father in law saw some books on our coffee table and asked about them. I returned by asking if he was a member.  He said " I have been asked to join"

       If this is true I hope he gets exposed quickly. So far I haven't seen anything concrete that says he is a pedo

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pete Townshend has been not-so-subtly creating music to expose the cabal's plans for YEARS!
      </p>
      <p>
       TOMMY - 1969
Shows a child, traumatized to a catatonic state from watching his mother's lover murder his father in front of him, is then sexually abused by his uncle and tortured by his cousin. He stands in front of the mirror, attempting to discover his true self, yet his mother smashes it, an allusion to Monarch Programming, developed by MKUltra, and their use of mirrors to create multiple personality disorder in children and program them for submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he wakes up, and becomes a spiritual leader, his child molester Uncle Ernie and parents hijack his message and create a "Holiday Camp" to capitalize off his followers and lure children there for Uncle Ernie. From "We're Not Gonna Take It": "We forsake you, gonna rape you, let's forget you better still."
      </p>
      <p>
       LIFEHOUSE - 1970
In 1970 Pete had a realization of the world we were headed towards. Lifehouse predicted a future where everyone on earth was spending their time in "experience suits" (think VR with full sensory immersion). The suits would connect to "The Grid" and through feeding tubes and sleeping gas, would allow users to live out full lifetimes in VR. So... basically the Matrix. Or Surrogates. Or that Rick and Morty episode where Morty plays the "Roy" video game and lives an entire life as a guy named Roy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person in charge of the Grid controlled everything people experienced on the grid, and thus, controlled what they thought. the heroes of the story are living off-the-grid and keeping Rock-and-Roll alive, which they use to stage a massive concert in which they free everyone from the dystopia through Rock.
      </p>
      <p>
       QUADROPHENIA 
Follows Jimmy, and his 3 other personalities as he seeks an escape from the media-induced fear of not "fitting in" with the manufactured trends and ways of thinking. His psyche has been shattered into 4 separate personalities, and it is only by getting free from their influence by sailing a rowboat into the sea that he can finally realize his true self and the true meaning of life, LOVE. Cleansed in the rain from the heavens, he sings "Love, reign over me".
      </p>
      <p>
       I could dig into every Pete Townshend album, his autobiography, his repeated open statements about this. But yes, he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse and, instead of repeating the cycle of abuse as many do, he explored his psyche through music and through writing Tommy, unlocked trauma he had blacked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has since been a warrior against pedophilia, child trafficking, and has raised more money for the Teenage Cancer Trust than anyone I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Pete wanted to look at child porn without getting caught, he wouldn't have used his personal credit card. He accused a site to gather evidence, and then when he tried to present the evidence, he was told that it would incriminate him. So he included it in his paper "A Different Bomb":
       <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/822162/posts">
        http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/822162/posts
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, they found his name on the sites registry, raided his house, and after digging through all his computers, hard drives, and personal effects found NOTHING. NOTHING!
      </p>
      <p>
       They issued him a "cautions" and gave him a half hour to decide if he wanted to go to court and fight it, or accept it as a slap on the wrist and move on with his life. The press had already proven his guilt to the public, so he made a snap decision to accept the cautions and try to move on with his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was trying to expose the British child sex-slavery ring! And they convinced the world that he was a pedo!
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward to seeing the name of the world's greatest living songwriter exonerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       LONG LIVE ROCK!
