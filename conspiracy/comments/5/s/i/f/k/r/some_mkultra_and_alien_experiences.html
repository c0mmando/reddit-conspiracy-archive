        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR: was raising too many vibrations, got attacked in different ways. These aren&#39;t symptoms of an illness, there&#39;s just a war on good. </p>

<p>Starseed, interesting name/birth date/genes it&#39;s like opposite of archons, childhood near death experience, natural artist, small CP incident in US (felt planned) </p>

<p>5 years ago found out about UFOs, started to meditate and tell Iranians about conspiracies and spirituality, was already vocal about political stuff, one morning was laying towards the wall, heard 3 footsteps walking towards me then loud digital tones in my head and a shock to my heart, I turned after couple seconds aand no one. always had an unknown scar between my eyebrows</p>

<p>immediately a perp renovates his apartment next to me and the walls just take way too long, It never really finished. They introduced lot of prostitutes and drugs to my family, lot of vandalism and scams, relationships destroyed, like organized people fucking with anyone cuz they can.</p>

<p>moved to Maryland..(Hi NSA! =D) experienced stalking, street theater, usual being treated like shit in lot of places (as opposed to few years before, I had noticed how nice Americans were, I&#39;m not trying to shit on anyone just the sellouts) and I&#39;m lucky to know they would sexually stimulate me remotely while I&#39;d sleep</p>

<p>moved back to Tehran, meditated a lot with help of herbs, was in a very good state and psyched about strengthening my psi, first day I heard voice of god technology say &quot;Enki&quot;. Few months in heard a guy with voice to skull say hi I asked his name, he said George (later there were very weird youtube videos about some people <em>attempting</em> to channel an entity called George by a channel I used to follow...)</p>

<p>saw alternate realities, some lucid numbers, a very vivid benevolent dimension with thousands of ethereal beings, was starting to float lucidly (it felt like a long dmt trip, was awesome) then attacked twice with scary entity sounds, one yelling with a deep voice &#39;I can take it all away&#39;, induced suicidal thoughts along with white flashes in the air for couple months and urinary tract infection that I read is common in alien abductees, I think they can create some illnesses remotely somehow, they took some blood treated me like shit and followed me on the way back from the hospital</p>

<p>I&#39;ll write rest later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First head of the Psychiatric Association of US/CAN was an MK Ultra participant. Prided himself on wiping people&#39;s memories with drugs and or shock treatment. The earlier history of the &quot;profession&quot; was warehousing people and performing sadistic experiments on them. </p>

<p>Psychiatry is bullshit. This was also proven by a professor that sent test subjects faking illnesses. The psych hospitals failed the test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, very interesting reads, I&#39;ve read a few of them before. My point is, it&#39;s MORE likely he&#39;s just some poor guy who may be having mental issues and it&#39;s BETTER to try to get him help than him hurting himself or others. I had an aunt who passed away last month. She had suddenly became schizophrenic two years ago, completely out of the blue. She never got a brain scan though, turns out she had a brain tumor and died of it. Funny how she wasn&#39;t a government experiment. Just an average person who didn&#39;t get the treatment she deserved and now is missing from our lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A major goal of functional MRI (fMRI) measurements is the localization of the neural correlates of sensory, motor and cognitive processes. The term “brain mapping” is often used to refer to this goal of relating operations of the mind to specific areas and networks in the brain. Another major goal of fMRI studies is the detailed characterization of the response profile across experimental conditions for known regions-of-interest (ROIs). In this context, the aim of conducted studies is often not to map new functional brain regions (whole-brain analysis) but to characterize further how a known specialized brain area responds to (subtle) differences</p>
