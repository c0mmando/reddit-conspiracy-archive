        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is the Trump Administration now.  Obama is gone and Clinton is irrelevant.  Any terrorist attack on US soil is Trump&#39;s responsibility, just so we all know who to blame moving forward.  </p>

<p>Whether you believe 9/11 was an inside job, or allowed to happen out of negligence, or the work a highly motivated Bin Laden, it was all on George W. Bush.  Thousands of US Soldiers died because of this in two wars, one of which we&#39;re still fighting.  Somehow, we&#39;ve all given Bush/Cheney a pass, even to this day.  </p>

<p>So the next Boston Bombing or Pulse Shooting, or even something big like 9/11, will happen because of the actions or incompetence of President Trump.  How he reacts will determine how many more US Soldiers will die, as well as where we attack next.  Is this something that you really want? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but those who are have bought into a con man&#39;s con.  No matter what you may say about his actions, he&#39;s making more money now as President than he did before he ran.  We no nothing of his financial ties, or why he&#39;s so cozy with Putin.  Somehow, he gets a pass in this sub, and we should be all over it.  Instead, we&#39;re still talking about pizza. </p>

<p>The bottom line, is that Trump is in this to make money for himself, and his billionaire cabinet and their cronies.  Unfortunately, the poor and middle class Americans are going to pay for it.</p>

<p>I get that you&#39;re pro-Trump, obviously.  I am anti-douche, for the record.  When you say he&#39;s &quot;draining the swamp&quot;, I see him filling it with cronies for his own benefit.  When you say he&#39;s going to MAGA, I see him destroying it... already.  I don&#39;t even see him doing it per se.  I think someone&#39;s got something on him, and he&#39;s marching to their orders.  He&#39;s got 5 or 6 Goldman Sachs alums in his goddamn cabinet, starting with Bannon.  Seriously, any rational un-biased person should be able to see that these people could give a fuck about you unless you&#39;re in the .001%.  You are not in that group, and if you are, what the fuck are you doing on Reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man has a recorded IQ of 156, John Quicy Adams is the only President who has had a higher IQ (approx 165 reports as high as 175). Either you are unaware of this or you are severely underestimating what that kind of computing power is like. </p>

<p>The reason you think Trump is an unintelligent oaf is likely that you have a limited view on him as a man aswell as the global situation he is attempting to deal with. What do you know about the politcal situation in Saudi Arabia or China? I guarantee he better understands the culture of France and Taiwan than you and the vast majority of Americans.</p>

<p>You want some fucking savior of humanity, get up there and run yourself next time, otherwise Trump is a damn good option when dealing with killers like Putin, Kim Jong-Un, and Natanyahu. Unless you have a plan to deal with Isis, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Oh my, I cannot tell you how much this hurts my feelings.  Here, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and just let it go, you know, agree to disagree.  But ok then, have it your way.  You don&#39;t want to accept my apology?  Snowflake much?  You need your safe space on the_donald?  This is Conspiracy, and Trump is a walking conspiracy unfolding in real time.  Wake the Fuck Up!</p>

<p>Obviously, you&#39;re merely a parrot, lacking any ability to have critical thinking and original thought.  You are an easily led and deceived follower who drank the kool aid decided, for what ever reason, that he is your God Emperor and can do no wrong.  You&#39;re going to defend him no matter how foolish and inept he has already proven to be.  Nothing I say will change your mind, but I&#39;m going to say some things to you in response anyway.</p>

<p>My view of President Trump is based purely on his nonsensical statements and actions over the 30 or so years that he has courted public attention.  He has created a cult of personality, one where he has painted himself as the only one that can lead our country to greatness, even tho it was far greater before he entered office 3 weeks ago.  If anything, he&#39;s lessened our credibility and power across the globe already.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re merely one of many uninformed and ignorant followers that helped cause his rise.  Good job idiot... we all reap what you have helped to sow.  Yes, I am saying this directly to you, because instead of coming back with something, anything of credible substance that Trump has said or done that is positive for our country, you merely repeated one of the many falsehoods purposely created (most likely by Bannon) to feed the Trump Trolls such as yourself.  IQ of 156?  Seriously?  Hahahaha.   Next thing you&#39;re going to tell me is that he doesn&#39;t have tiny hands with a tiny dick to match.</p>

<p>As far as knowing the cultures of France and Saudi Arabia, what the fuck does Trump know about that?  He knows how to slap his name on hotels and golf courses and make money from that.  Somehow, idiots like you think that is a qualification to be President and voted him into office.  How&#39;s that panning out for you so far?  How many steel and coal jobs has he brought back to Pennsylvania?   None.  How many is he going to bring?  None.   I hope to be proved wrong in this, but I have zero confidence he is going to bring steel jobs back to the US.  Trump Tower was built with cheap Chinese steel.  </p>

<p>Having lived longer than you, probably by several decades, I am far more aware of the historical phases of our political system, as I have seen first hand the corruption that the office has attracted over the years.  Kennedy Assassination (both of them), MLK, Kent State, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Read My Lips, Monica Lewinsky, Weapons of Mass Distruction, Bengazi...  </p>

<p>Every administration has done something to prove that money and power corrupts our government.  Why do you think this one is going to be any different?  This is by far the most corrupt administration to ever take the office of President, and it&#39;s been what, 3 weeks?  </p>

<p>In that time, President Trump has done more to undermine the credibility of the United States among foreign leaders, to place our once great nation in the pantheon of aggressive enemy states just like the ones you quoted.  &quot;... dealing with killers like Putin, Kim Jong-Un and Netanyahu...&quot;  No my sad little friend, he&#39;s not dealing with them.  As far as Putin is concerned, he pretty much seems to be controlled by him.  As far as the rest, well history will decide just how badly his time as President will be reflected upon, or how many people will die because of his ineptitude.  One US Soldier has already lost his life... how many more are going to die?</p>

<p>I am definitely a &quot;show-me&quot; type of person.  I want proof that he&#39;s capable of doing good for our country.  So far all he has done is bitched and moaned about his inauguration, complained about the press being mean to him on Twitter, and pushed this Alternative Fact, Bowling Green Massacre bullshit.  Build a fucking wall? Give me a fucking break.  US taxpayers and consumers are going to pay for that wall in higher prices from import tariffs, while his Billionaire Cabinet siphons their cut off the top, off the bottom, and from every angle they can. </p>

<p>The Trump Administration is trying to create their own false reality and none of us, especially on this sub, should buy any of it.  He signed the executive order elevating Bannon to undergrupenfurher without reading it first, or even knowing what it was all about.  Who&#39;s really in control over at the White House?  It sure as hell ain&#39;t President Trump.</p>

<p>It has been 3 weeks, and in that time we&#39;ve gone from a nervous but hopeful nation, to the most divided and destabilized our great country has been since the civil war.  Bannon wants to &quot;tear our government down&quot; on purpose, to rebuild it in his image.  The press should &quot;just shut up and listen for awhile&quot;?  That&#39;s what Nixon wanted too, and thank god Woodward and Bernstein didn&#39;t listen.  So far, it looks like Bannon is calling the shots in the White House, and whatever hold he, the Mercers and Putin have over Trump, its their agenda that&#39;s being implemented.  Trump is far from his own man, and this is going to end badly for the rest of us.</p>

<p>So back to you... yes, you&#39;re either so sucked up the Trump Train&#39;s ass so far as to only parrot Bannon&#39;s talking points, or you are a paid shill funded by the Mercer&#39;s.  I&#39;m not going to throw terms like racist, misogynist or xenophobe at you, cause I don&#39;t know... I hear some Trumpets are good people.  But hold no illusions that this whole thing nothing but a a cash grab for Trump, and a power grab for Bannon.  Little people like you have not only enabled it to happen, but will suffer the most because of it.  So good luck to you buddy, you&#39;re going to need it.  We&#39;re all going to need it.</p>

This is Conspiracy, and Trump is a walking conspiracy unfolding in real time.  Wake the Fuck Up!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I needed a safe space I wouldn&#39;t have picked a fight. Sometimes, flipping the insult to the otherside doesn&#39;t work, just so you know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, you&#39;re merely a parrot, lacking any ability to have critical thinking and original thought.  You are an easily led and deceived follower who drank the kool aid decided, for what ever reason, that he is your God Emperor and can do no wrong.  You&#39;re going to defend him no matter how foolish and inept he has already proven to be.  Nothing I say will change your mind, but I&#39;m going to say some things to you in response anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with Trump on many issues, but I&#39;m also aware that. That should be obvious vonsidering I listed Netanyahu, PM of Israel, as a killer. Trump is Pro-Israel, yet I am Anti-Zionist (and before you ask, I am aware that Trump maybe a Zionist plant) I won&#39;t sefend Trump no matter what, but I will support our leader so far as I morally can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My view of President Trump is based purely on his nonsensical statements and actions over the 30 or so years that he has courted public attention.  He has created a cult of personality, one where he has painted himself as the only one that can lead our country to greatness, even tho it was far greater before he entered office 3 weeks ago.  If anything, he&#39;s lessened our credibility and power across the globe already.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, Maketing 101 right here. Trump created a sellable, larger than life, characature of himself to promote his brand. Aslo, saying American was greater before he took office is an opinion, and a hard one to agree with for me considering I was preparing for civil war if Hilary won.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re merely one of many uninformed and ignorant followers that helped cause his rise.  Good job idiot... we all reap what you have helped to sow.  Yes, I am saying this directly to you, because instead of coming back with something, anything of credible substance that Trump has said or done that is positive for our country, you merely repeated one of the many falsehoods purposely created (most likely by Bannon) to feed the Trump Trolls such as yourself.  IQ of 156?  Seriously?  Hahahaha.   Next thing you&#39;re going to tell me is that he doesn&#39;t have tiny hands with a tiny dick to match.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Few Positive Things Trump Has Done:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Repeal Obamacare, most poor people I know could not afford it and chose to take the fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin the process to build the Wall</p></li>
<li><p>Is hiring 10,000 new immigration officers.</p></li>
<li><p>Lifetime ban on Lobbying for Foreign Governments</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as knowing the cultures of France and Saudi Arabia, what the fuck does Trump know about that?  He knows how to slap his name on hotels and golf courses and make money from that.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure thats all he knows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somehow, idiots like you think that is a qualification to be President and voted him into office.  How&#39;s that panning out for you so far?  How many steel and coal jobs has he brought back to Pennsylvania?   None.  How many is he going to bring?  None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impatient much?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope to be proved wrong in this, but I have zero confidence he is going to bring steel jobs back to the US.  Trump Tower was built with cheap Chinese steel.  Actions speak louder than words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your rant has not altered my opinion in the slightest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having lived longer than you, probably by several decades, I am far more aware of the historical phases of our political system, as I have seen first hand the corruption that the office has attracted over the years.  Kennedy Assassination (both of them), Gulf of Tonkin, MLK, Kent State, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Read My Lips, Monica Lewinsky, 9/11, Weapons of Mass Distruction, Bengazi, Drone Strikes...  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems more like you saw what they wanted you to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every administration has done something to prove that money and power corrupts our government.  Since 9/11 the &quot;terrorist threat&quot; has been used as an excuse for rich dudes to make money keeping stupid people like you afraid of &quot;radical Islamists&quot;.  You have a greater chance to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist attack.  Why do you think this administration is going to be any different, especially since they pretty much lead off with a &quot;travel ban from Muslim majority countries&quot;?  This is by far the most corrupt administration to ever take the office of President, simply because of all the half-truths, twisted logic, alternative facts and false narratives... and it&#39;s been what, 3 weeks?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put simply, &quot;Radical Islamic Terroism&quot; is the acceptable excuse for American Imperialism and Expansion. As I am all for American Supremacy I don&#39;t see this as a negative. Also, the only falsehood I&#39;ve seen was the Bowling Green Massacre (which could be as simple as getting the locating mixed up)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that time, President Trump has done more to undermine the credibility of the United States among foreign leaders, to place our once great nation in the pantheon of aggressive enemy states just like the ones you quoted.  &quot;... dealing with killers like Putin, Kim Jong-Un and Netanyahu...&quot;  No my sad little friend, he&#39;s not dealing with them.  As far as Putin is concerned, he pretty much seems to be controlled by him.  As far as the rest, well history will decide just how badly his time as President will be reflected upon, or how many people will die because of his ineptitude.  One US Soldier has already lost his life... how many more are going to die?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Undermind the credibility? Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and so on have done that just fine on thier own, NWO scum. Probably a lot of soldiers are going to die on both sides, the USA will be the Germany of WWIII</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am definitely a &quot;show-me&quot; type of person.  I want proof that he&#39;s capable of doing good for our country.  So far all he has done is bitched and moaned about his inauguration, complained about the press being mean to him on Twitter, and pushed this Alternative Fact, Bowling Green Massacre bullshit.  Build a fucking wall? Give me a fucking break.  US taxpayers and consumers are going to pay for that wall in higher prices from import tariffs, while his Billionaire Cabinet siphons their cut off the top, off the bottom, and off of every angle they can. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would rather my tax money went to the wall than to most of what it has since I came of age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Trump Administration is trying to create their own false reality and none of us, especially on this sub, should buy any of it.  He signed the executive order elevating Bannon to undergrupenfurher without reading it first, or even knowing what it was all about.  Who&#39;s really in control over at the White House?  It sure as hell ain&#39;t President Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m SURE he never read it and has no clue what it said. You are sounding like a joke at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been 3 weeks, and in that time we&#39;ve gone from a nervous but hopeful nation, to the most divided and destabilized our great country has been since the civil war.  Bannon wants to &quot;tear our government down&quot; on purpose, to rebuild it in his image.  The press should &quot;just shut up and listen for awhile&quot;?  That&#39;s what Nixon wanted too, and thank god Woodward and Bernstein didn&#39;t listen.  So far, it looks like Bannon is calling the shots in the White House, and whatever hold he, the Mercers and Putin have over Trump, its their agenda that&#39;s being implemented.  Trump is far from his own man, and this is going to end badly for the rest of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do understand many of us voted for Trump as a molitov cocktail to the system? We want a total dissolvement of the broken government we had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So back to you... yes, you&#39;re either sucked up the Trump Train&#39;s ass so far as to only parrot Bannon&#39;s talking points, or you are a paid shill funded by the Mercer&#39;s.  I&#39;m not going to throw terms like racist, misogynist or xenophobe at you, cause I don&#39;t know... I hear some Trumpets are good people.  But hold no illusions that this whole thing nothing but a a cash grab for Trump, and a power grab for Bannon and his financial backers.  Little people like you have not only enabled it to happen, but will suffer the most because of it.  So good luck to you buddy, you&#39;re going to need it.  We&#39;re all going to need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well if the Mercer&#39;s are paying, I&#39;ll take the money, right now I&#39;m just doing this for shits and giggles as well as to keep myself as well informed as possible. Am I racist, sorta, misogynist, kinda, xenophobic, depends on where they are from. Am I a good person, no and I don&#39;t try to be.</p>

<p>In the end, are all these thing you&#39;ve said possibly correct? Absolutely :) </p>

<p>I get that you&#39;re pro-Trump, obviously.  I am anti-douche, for the record.  When you say he&#39;s &quot;draining the swamp&quot;, I see him filling it with cronies for his own benefit.  When you say he&#39;s going to MAGA, I see him destroying it... already.  I don&#39;t even see him doing it per se.  I think someone&#39;s got something on him, and he&#39;s marching to their orders.  He&#39;s got 5 or 6 Goldman Sachs alums in his goddamn cabinet, starting with Bannon.  Seriously, any rational un-biased person should be able to see that these people could give a fuck about you unless you&#39;re in the .001%.
