       Do you have proof that's what they're doing? Because I thought shills were just pretending to be accounts against trump. Nothing illegal about that, even though I don't buy it in the first place.

       As much as I love a good conspiracy, and as much as I love leaving politics out of my conspiracies, you guys need to quit calling every person who disagrees with you a pedo.

       It is documented that there are people who are paid to infiltrate Internet discussion forums and affect the climate of the discussion, sabotage posts, massively upvoting or downvoting certain posts and comments in an attempt to sway the climate and foundational beliefs of the sub as a whole.

       People who are doing this are covering and protecting the worst criminal elements the world has ever known. They should be held to that standard when caught and tried, which they will be.

       as i understand it, treason is all about the details of who / what rather than specific actions (like, say, drug dealing or murder). it seems like the people who wrote that legislation left it intentionally vague.

       Doesn't it strike you in your gut as fundamentally wrong? For just myriad reasons that any self-aware person, I would think, would be able to see? What if it was legal to, say, kick dogs, and there were these people who made a game out of it: would you be like "it's not illegal so I don't know what people are getting so upset about"?

       Not if they do it on their own time and not as part of a planned organizational plan to control speech and narratives. Reddit has become the bastion of piss. I used to love it, now I only go to 4-5 subreddits. The last straw was them removing 9ver 50 of my photography posts with over 100,000 karma (not that I care so much about karma but the principles, I do.

       Treason is actually pretty specific, it's the reason it's not really charged a lot. And no, a judge or jury would not someone with treason for "shilling" against the president. It's funny that in a conspiracy forum the members are calling for those that criticize the standing president go to prison for treason. Sad!

       I can't remember what the picket was.  It wasn't a strike though.  We showed up at this building downtown in a couple of mini vans(maybe a dozen of us), and we all had signs.  We stuck around for maybe an hour, then took off and did our normal jobs(which was going door to door to fundraise).

       My point is, I think its funny when people consider it manipulation, but from a political organizer, you are just trying to get people involved.

       I think it's fair to say that each of us, understanding the true scope and severity of shilling, would welcome at least the minimum punishment being delivered to each person who has profited from impersonating a real person, with the intent to manipulate entire societies, and the maximum given to those who orchestrated it.

       Dude the amount of effort and supposition you put towards your world view should be enough to tell you what you need to know, but just in case, one of the marks of intelligence is not believing in ideas which only serve to make us feel better, or more "right". Confirmation bias and all that.

       By proven you mean that during the election Clinton did in fact pay to have a company work in her inline image (which is completely normal). Now it's safe to assume they also spent some time on Reddit as it a huge site.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the election is long over. There is zero proof or even possible hints that for some reason anyone would be paying money to keep working on clintons image now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on man, if you are gonna claim paid shills then back it up with something more recent than Clinton campaign funds.

       I'm more sick of the paid shills than the few rare people who seem to think everyone that disagrees with them is a shill. Those paranoid folks don't actually cause much harm except that they insult trolls. The paid shills are all over social media and do cause legitimate problems.

       They're just as annoying as users like you. Luckily, most of the pro-Trump people here don't troll while they're here, so I don't have to  worry much about them.

       There's also been a string of self posts attacking anyone who dissents against PG along with more talking about how wonderful it is to be newly converted into PG-truthers.  I'm surprised more people on this sub are suspicious of this kind of thing, what with people always talking about brainwashing tactics.

       Where can I sign up to get paid? I mean, tens of thousands of people are being paid to protest and post on internet forums by george soros.  So where do I sign up? It seems to be pretty hard to find...I mean, how do illegals that only speak spanish find out, but I can't find out? Can one of the paid shills please pm me?  Yes, I'm making fun of you. Which is fair, seeing as you kind folks (volks?) are now saying that anyone who disagrees with you is guilty of treason.

       It is documented that there are people who are paid to infiltrate Internet discussion forums and affect the climate of the discussion, sabotage posts, massively upvoting or downvoting certain posts and comments in an attempt to sway the climate and foundational beliefs of the sub as a whole.

       People who are doing this are covering and protecting the worst criminal elements the world has ever known. They should be held to that standard when caught and tried, which they will be.

       It's funny to me that you think the only people who disagree with you are paid to do so. You guys are so easy to manipulate. You get that a lot of people are concerned with the extreme right wing  track the world seems to be on? That they disagree with practically every policy goal you guys have for legitimate reasons? That those people-hold on to your butts-have computers? That just like you they involve themselves on the internet where most political discussion happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       But no. They're paid. They have to be. My guys told me so. No need to think about why. Their word is plenty good enough for me.

       Ok, so "shill" was in the title, obviously, but it was a general comment meant to spur conversation (which it did). And there were some interesting responses. It was in no way targeting any specific user, nor, judging by the comments, was it perceived that way. So I'm confused about the cause for removal. May I ask for your take  on what was being communicated?

       Exactly. I have never once believed CTR and others were Americans. If they help to incite American Civil War, are they technically "enemy combatants" then? How does the U. S. legal system deal with foreign disinformation agents, if at all?

       Treason, un-American, protecting traitors to America, none of these things bother these snarky, shitty trolls from India, Saudi Arabia or whatever other sandy shit-hole these slugs crawl around in.

       I don't think it works that way any more. Yes, there were paid actors who targeted this reddit specifically during the wikileaks clinton drops. Most of the people you see now are actual people. Angry democrats who can't find anyone to blame. CTR has been disbanded. Soros doesn't operate on the micro level. He's funding entire movements. What you are dealing with now are zealots.

       Repeatedly deflating weak arguments isn't shilling. It's perfectly warranted, sensible critique.

       Treason is actually pretty specific, it's the reason it's not really charged a lot. And no, a judge or jury would not someone with treason for "shilling" against the president. It's funny that in a conspiracy forum the members are calling for those that criticize the standing president go to prison for treason. Sad!
