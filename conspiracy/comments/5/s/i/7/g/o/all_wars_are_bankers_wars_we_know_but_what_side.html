       He's the guy jerking off in his hat in the corner. So far his reaction to anything he is accused of doing is that he didn't know he did it or he lies about it. What are you a fan of?

       He talks about the bubble, he appointed some brilliant people, not all, but they possibly could be the central bankers, but why would they show their face center stage? He talks about currency manipulation, he talks about Andrew Jackson, he's been the most decisive president in my lifetime, and I have seen a good few. When does he say he didn't know or lies about it? You talking about the fake news garbage that is that Bannon shit? Bannon while I do not agree with him on things is anti central bank aswell.

       He talks a lot. That's all he does. His EO's will mostly be struck down by the court system. What do you mean by decisive? He hasn't actually done anything other than sign a bunch of papers that really don't mean a fucking thing. The immigration ban has already been struck down and in record fucking time. Do you not understand that he is acting as a racist, xeonophoboc, nationalist? Or are these thing acceptable to you? To be decisive he would have to do something. He doesn't. He just spouts off from the stupidest part of his body, which happens to be his mouth. By the way, Andrew Jackson wouldn't be somebody that you would want to emulate.

       Which ones? Even the immigration one that got struck down is BS and multiple courts of the same level disagree, the decisions doesn't say anything about the law or constitution, just the judges feelings.

       If that's all you've seen, please go check out the EOs. Things have been moving forward. The immigration one like I explained above is BS.

       How is he racist? How is he xenophobic? He wants immigrants to come legally, and not leach off our system. For example, he loves Indian immigrants because we work our assessment off and have the highest incomes in America.

       What did Andrew Jackson do so badly? He is widely regarded as great, except the trail of tears, which ended up making America stronger, at the expense of many native deaths.

       Racism and xenophobia are words without meaning. Sure, they have definitions, but they get slung around without any regard for those. Like when your mother in law asks why you hate her so much; hate has nothing to do with it, or at least, she has no basis for claiming it does, short of you having already admitted to it.

       Don't waste your time on this one. Save it for someone who has at least a cursory knowledge of the powers of the executive branch.

       Yeeeeeah...... If you'd read that article you'd know Trump's EOs were legal. The only one that's been overturned is a very specific power that the US Code very explicitly grants the president. Overturning it was childish and merely symbolic. But then you probably already know all that. If you don't, then... Well... Educate yourself.

       I think the old regime (the Rothschilds and co.), in their attempt to get Clinton installed, elevated Donald Trump in what we've heard described as a "pied-piper" scheme and it didn't go the way they'd planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're witnessing now is a coup against the Rothschild regime by a billionaire class that has arisen recently and outside Rothschild control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's role (likely unbeknownst even to himself) is to wield the power he's accidentally stumbled into and execute the will of the few existing anti-NWO billionaires.  I guess in that way he's alot like G.W. Bush, except that Bush was a dullard mascot installed by and for the Rothschilds, while Trump is the dullard mascot of a team so new to the field that they haven't even got a team name yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike W, Trump's not taking orders from a master class that's been successfully running the show for centuries.  He's being pulled in a bunch of different directions from a number of competing elements.  Take for evidence of this all the pro-israel stuff he says and does.  Obviously some of those who have his ear are still Rothschild agents...

       Ehhhhhh supporting Israel isn't purely a Rothschild thing. He probably genuinely believes Jews are with us, Muslims are against us. The scary thing for those who prescribed to Jews are puppet masters is that his daughter is now Jewish, and both is sons married Jews too

       Israel is the seed of the violence in this world. The quicker you understand this, the clearer world will get. Read the Balfour declaration letter it stated "Zionist Jewish" aspirations and it was addressed to Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean all Jews are bad, there are a lot who detest zionists but you never hear about them. It's the same as radical islamists and normal Muslims.

       The Bush family are trillionaires.  Maybe they are not as wealthy as the Rothschilds, but they are wealthier than most people think.

       You think the true capital holders would come from modest beginnings, work their way to the top of a bank and still not even have 10 billion. He has been exploited, one of the smartest people, he knows the sham out central banking is. Same with Rex Tillerson. He was ceo of fucking Exxon, and he's not as rich as you'd think he should be. The capital holders exploited these creators and organizers just as much as us.

       The plot of The Great Gatsby revolved around this area that was divided into East Egg (old dynastic money) and West Egg (new/shady money, think like rum runners/organized crime). It is a good book, well worth a read, and I think it totally has bearing on our situation. Except instead of it being about the conflict between the origin of money, I think this is a conflict of origin of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our politics has been dominated for a long time by what I think of as Old Power, and Trump is not aligned with it, so he is New Power. I think more accurately he is chaotic power, as he got here and isn't even sure what to do with it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually read something by I think they called him High Level Insider the other day? What I was thinking predated my exposure that that leak, but it fits. He was saying that what we are calling the New World Order is actually the Old World Order of slaves and masters. So, we have been living under OOW pretending to be NWO. But NWO is actually supposed to be a positive movement that will benefit us normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, back to Trump, I think he is neither OOW or NWO. I think he has the potential to serve the good NWO, but he was not planned by either group, and the OOW is absolutely trying to destroy him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno if that helps anything, I wish I had saved that link to the High Level Insider or whatever. Maybe someone will come along with that info, it was a fun read.

       We will see.  There is a small group of people that are trillionaires.  They are fascists and push their fascist agenda.  The Rothschilds, the Bush family, the Rockefellers, Morgans, DuPonts, etc. are all included.
