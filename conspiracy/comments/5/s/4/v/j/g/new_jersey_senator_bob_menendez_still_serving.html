<p>The Department of Justice is investigating Bob Menendez, United States Senator of New Jersey and close Hillary Clinton associate, for claims that he engaged in illicit activities with underage girls in the Dominican Republic. As part of the same Department of Justice case, Menendez is currently undergoing investigation for assisting Salomon Melgen in procuring visas for Melgen&#39;s young sexual mistresses: <a href="http://archive.is/dnvP7">http://archive.is/dnvP7</a></p>

<p>In a separate, but possibly related incident, one of Menendez&#39;s interns was an illegal immigrant and wanted sex offender: <a href="http://archive.is/2Lexd">http://archive.is/2Lexd</a></p>

<p>Bob Menendez is the senior United States Senator from the State of New Jersey and a member of the Democratic Party. First appointed to the U.S. Senate in January 2006, he was later elected Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in January 2013. In 2015, he was also ranked #1 on The Hudson Reporter&#39;s annual Power List of the &quot;Fifty Most Powerful Political Figures in Hudson County&quot;.</p>

<p>On April 1, 2015, Menendez was officially indicted on federal corruption charges in the United States District Court, related to alleged favors he did for Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen and gifts he received from him, including campaign donations and private flights. Melgen was charged as well. Menendez has pleaded not guilty to all charges: <a href="http://archive.is/2Lexd">http://archive.is/2Lexd</a></p>

<p>&quot;In further bad news for Menendez, the DOJ says the senator’s trip to the Dominican Republic was “during time frames in which one unidentified alleged minor victim specifically claimed to have had sex with him.”&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/ZaiTS#selection-1833.0-1833.210">http://archive.is/ZaiTS#selection-1833.0-1833.210</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, Bob Menendez has connections Hillary Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, and even was trafficking children from the Dominican Republic during the same time period Laura Silsby was attempting to take children to the Dominican Republic without permits.</p>
