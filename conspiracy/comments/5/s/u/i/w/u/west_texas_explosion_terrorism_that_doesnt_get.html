<p>With the volume turned up and watching frame by frame, it is almost impossible to ignore evidence of some sort of missile fired at unreal velocity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on-M7z_xFBE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on-M7z_xFBE</a></p>

<p>There are a bunch of oddities around this story.  The rogue volunteer firefighter named Reed being quite a rabbit trail of its own.</p>

<p>I have no theory as to the motive around a rural fertilizer plant, but only ask you watch the two videos filmed closest to the explosion after the initial fire.</p>

<p>im sure their safety procedures were top notch and would never lead to an accidental explosion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so first you say the tanks were relatively undamaged, but now its just the foundations?</p>

<p>and yes, look at numerous explosions from history and see how many foundations are left over, while walls and the main structure is damaged heavily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relative to the building, which became a crater, the tanks, which are seen in the post blast photos you provided, are intact...  relative to the crater which USED TO BE A BUILDING.</p>

<p>Do you think there used to be a foundation where there is now just a big hole in the ground?  Or are the tanks, that you originally brought into the subject, the origin of impact for the huge explosion? </p>

<p>In your opinion did the tanks or the building incur more damage?</p>

<p>It would be hard pressed to believe that the foundation of the origin of blast would remain, yet totally destroy the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve changed not one iota of my original story.  The tanks that you originally brought up are in a field.  A field that was not near as disrupted as the building directly beside it, which is clearly shown in the pictures that you have provided, to be completely gone.</p>
