       Who cares, nobody is really pro Trump cabinet.  It's more like people like him and they'll just go along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing you can do now anyways bit wait 4 years and use your fingers furiously on the keyboard then...  For now you have a new President and that's how American politics works.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the man monumentally screws up then he will be out quicker, these posts pointing out the obvious are just retarded .  If the agenda is to sway someone, it's too late.  We don't need Trump videos 100000 times a day posted unless they have some relevance to the suvreddit topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drain the swamp meant get rid of Democrats, and anyone who opposes Darth Trump.  You just need to understand that and move on respectfully.

       It's the fourth turn brah. Do you even read Bannons work? The pain is coming to America and it will be bigger than ww2 in scope. We can either succumb to a new global paradigm and disappear as a nation or take the whole world down with us.that is what Bannon believes. Oh and that some form of Trumps administration should rule throughout the 80-100 years of turmoil. Do you still want Bannon anywhere near the President?

       Exactly. Plus the DNC really helped to make is bid for presidency taken seriously. He always said he was going to run, the media never batted an eye at it nor did they give it any serious coverage. Sort of funny that they wanted this to change, and it did.

       is Trump's 5 point plan created to "Drain the Swamp". This was in his speech specifically about the phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to continue to misconstrue what was meant by the phrase, and disingenuously throw it back in the faces of his supporters, by all means have at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be taken seriously then maybe do a minutes worth of research before spewing someone else's talking points.

       And TRUMP is to blame i suppose? What about all shit OBAMA and BUSH blew up over there. You think there is a lot of people over there loving America right now? On top of being radicals they completely hate our infidel asses.

       YEAH SO WHAT? Who did you vote for? Gary Johnson? WE are going to drain the swamp you mark my words so many in political positions that are guilty of perjury. As for his picks I like them. I am tired of hearing waaaaa this guy used to work for Goldman sachs!!!! GOOD! Maybe he seen the shit they were doing to this country and wants to help Trump take them down. WAAAAAA CEO OF EXXON. Let me tell you something right now if your an American then you better get on your knees and thank the universe Rex is your Secretary of State instead of Hillary or John Kerry. Rex is a powerhouse even more so than Trump and he would DIE before the hair on the head of a citizen gets hurt.
      </p>

       Sorry bud you don't have all the answers. You wanna run around and ruin us Trump supporters hope for the future it ain't gonna happen. Complain and whine and doubt.. is all the OP offered me

       That wasn't ner point at all. As she said, it's been a long policy spanning multiple presidencies. She even pointed to the Wesley Clarke statement in 2007 outlining these seven countries planned for war back in the 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is Trump to blame for continuing this policy? One Clinton would have pursued just the sane? No. But you're the dupe who can't see his obvious nakedness.

       Why bring partisan hate into it when you could have just used logic to make the point that Trump may not be what he seems?

       Dykes has a long reputation on youtube posting conspiracy related material. But here she is criticizing Trump, so her work gets downvoted to censorship in /new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any questions on the brigading? And the damage its done to this sub? How it's perverted the purpose from discussing conspiracy into a PR platform for Trump while suppressing Trump criticism?

       It's the fourth turn brah. Do you even read Bannons work? The pain is coming to America and it will be bigger than ww2 in scope. We can either succumb to a new global paradigm and disappear as a nation or take the whole world down with us.that is what Bannon believes. Oh and that some form of Trumps administration should rule throughout the 80-100 years of turmoil. Do you still want Bannon anywhere near the President?
