    <div class="md"><p>Their audience would need to ostracize the offenders but unfortunately the branding of these major networks and papers creates a blind trust and almost a worship of certain outlets while others are the &quot;bad guys&quot; (Fox) for having a difficult perspective.</p>

<p>Imho the bad guys are ones who purposefully mislead, twist facts to fit a narrative, bury or obfuscate and fail basic fact checking to push sensational headlines and again that narrative. And frankly all of them do that.  Some worse than others.</p>

<p>Just look at the absurd way they shunned Ron Paul in 2012.  Skipping over him, leaving him off polls and tallies including one where he was overwhelmingly the leader.  How can we trust any of them after seeing such a blatant misuse of their power and such a dishonorable display of bias.</p>

<p>I bet they wish they&#39;d used that tactic with Trump.</p>

<p>Then again maybe he is far too connected and rich to have made that possible.</p>

<p>We need unbiased journalism. The MSM needs to go too. Especially if they are complicit. And not as a partisan issue. If that can&#39;t be done? Then we need watchdogs against &quot;the people&#39;s watchdogs of the government&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ALWAYS have a choice. You don&#39;t &quot;fall into&quot; becoming a pedo apologist because you&#39;re poor.  You don&#39;t &quot;accidentally&quot; spread intentional disinformation so as to delay hours, weeks, months and YEARS of investigations and obstruct justice for potentially thousands of children who could have been saved from hell on earth.  </p>

<p>Judas Iscariot was immortalized as having sold his soul to the devil to betray his friend Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.  Humans have free will, and if you choose to be on the wrong side by ignoring those huge &quot;red flags&quot; of evil in waving in your face, there&#39;s nobody to blame but you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people have families.  A man who puts principle above the wellbeing of his family is no man to me.  Principle is a great thing, but that&#39;s little use to a father trying to make ends meet and keep a roof over his children&#39;s heads.  At the end of the day these are employees working for a corporation.  They probably hate their jobs as much as the next person, get paid shit wages, and have to follow a strict corporate policy.  But when 30% of the population is out of work you take what you can get.</p>

Maybe no knowledge of it themselves, but because it implicates their masters, it must immediately be shut down with no debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You simply stop using and relying on them. Deny their credibility and deny them the revenues they receive based on the number of readers or viewers they have and find some other sources that are independent and trustworthy. </p>

<p>Newspapers are already in critical financial condition and TV news isn&#39;t far behind. They&#39;re all crap because they&#39;re desperate for money and run on the cheap. They only continue to exist because of their ability to spread  propaganda and enough social conditioning to get people to believe that propaganda.</p>

<p>The internet is the next wave if we can keep our governments from interfering with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most appropriate punishment for the people who were involved or the people who hid it is public crucifixion. Nothing else really gets the message across. It&#39;s slow, it&#39;s painful. They die in agony knowing they are failures, knowing their legacy is shame.</p>

<p>They will be given the chance to spare their families by handing over their associates and then their children will be hung up next to them anyway. There can be no mercy shown to such corruption. If even a single person survives then this will never end.</p>
