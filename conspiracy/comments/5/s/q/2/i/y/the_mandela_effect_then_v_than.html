        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my opinion this is an example of the Mandela Effect that is quite ubiquitous almost to the point where on reddit it seems they are reversed almost as often as they are used properly. There are several possible explanations for this that exclude the Mandela Effect.</p>

<ol>
<li>They look very similar when written and people therefore think they are the same word.</li>
<li>People know they are different words but don&#39;t know the difference so just go with one in hopes it&#39;s the correct one. </li>
<li>There is another language where the words are reversed and the people in that language use their native language version when speaking English online. This gaslights native english speakers online into questioning their own knowledge of these words and therefore exacerbates the problem through the pressure of group conformity. </li>
<li>Some people pronounce these words the same in real life and therefore don&#39;t realize they are two different words and use one or the other 100% of the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>My objection to all of these is that I haven&#39;t seen a single instance of similar words being misused on anywhere near the scale that these words are. Examples of similar words would be: Pen v Pan, End v And, Send v Sand, Men v Man. None of these words are more dissimilar than then and than in objective meaning, and they&#39;re all 100% identical in pronunciation of the &#39;en&quot; v &quot;an&quot; sounds. So if either point 1 or 2 was the reason behind the confusion then these words should be confused equally as often. Point 3 is possible but unlikely. I welcome anyone who knows of a language that reverses these two words from their English meanings to point it out. Point 4 is possible but as a person living in the US I&#39;ve never heard anyone confuse these words when speaking. Not even in movies or online, but if you are from a region where these words are interchangeable when speaking then feel free to chime in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you joking right now?</p>

<p>None of those examples are similar.</p>

<p>Then doesn&#39;t have to deal with a material object - it only exists within context of another object.</p>

<p>Send is a word used to describe another object, Sand is an object.  Furthermore, you state these sound the exact same...they don&#39;t.  Those are two very different and easy to differentiate words.</p>

<p>Pen is an object, Pan is an object.</p>

<p>Men and man actually does confuse non-native English speakers - sometimes.  However, it is entirely different to Than vs Then.</p>

<p>End vs And is easily distinguishable because they sound different.  &quot;Eh&quot; vs &quot;Ay&quot;.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t hear the difference between the words, it&#39;s likely a hearing problem, or you live in the south.   The reason &quot;than&quot; and &quot;then&quot; get mixed up so much, is because the vowel is half way through the word, and we tend to rmeember the frsit and lsat lteter of each wrod.</p>

<p>I bet you could very easily read the &quot;rmeemebr the frsit and lsat lteter of each wrod.&quot; because the first and last letters were in the correct spots.  This matters more than the middle letters.</p>

<p>Send and Sand are pronounced differently.  End and And are pronounced differently.  This is not arguable, those are 100% pronounced differently.  The only exception is if you live in the south, and in that case, you are saying them wrong due to an accent.</p>
