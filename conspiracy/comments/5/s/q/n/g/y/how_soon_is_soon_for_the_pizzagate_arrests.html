        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been seeing with some frequency the prediction that Trump and some in his administration are on the side of pizzagate theorists, and that arrests of a large trafficking ring are around the corner, likely including the Podestas, James Alefantis and Hillary Clinton (and it is suggested, many other powerful people).</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t discount the existence of child trafficking involving some powerful people, I remain very unconvinced that we have a good reason to think these particular people are involved in such a thing, but of course, I could always be wrong.</p>

<p>So when are these arrests going to happen? And how much time needs to go by before folks here start to think they may not be drawing very good conclusions here?</p>

<p>How soon is &quot;soon&quot;? If a month goes by, will that dim your certainty? How about a year? If none of these arrests happen in four years, will you start to question your logical process?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make my own prediction. There will be arrests for child trafficking over the next four years, because child traffickers exist and people whose job it is to catch them work hard. Perhaps one of them will have some connection to someone in Washington, I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised. The people whose names have been connected to &quot;pizzagate&quot; and who I named above will not be arrested for child trafficking.</p>

<p>Now if I&#39;m wrong and these arrests happen next week, next month, next year, I&#39;ll be on here apologizing. I&#39;ll have to rethink my whole approach to evidence and conclusions. I&#39;m willing to do that.</p>

<p>What would it take for you to do the same? How long with none of these people arrested? If your answer is that no amount of time will make you seriously reevaluate your thinking process, I&#39;d suggest that&#39;s a good reason to reexamine it right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible some of it already happened, but the elite involved have already covered their trail. Look at all the busts happening recently in Norway, Haiti, California, Boston, etc.</p>

<p>Hundreds and hundreds of people in the last few months arrested related to child sex trafficking, I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever seen so many in such a short span. It seems very plausible to me that some of these are the ground-level grunts involved in pizzagate and will take the fall for it, while the elite escape and the MSM will never acknowledge any connections between all these busts.</p>

<p>The elite get away, they set up shop with a new name, new people, new codewords, and make sure it never leaks again, and meanwhile people will think Pizzagate is fake because there was no formal bust of politicians. They might have already gotten away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may have misread me.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there is good reason to think the people accused of crimes at the center of this theory have actually committed them. I do not think that there is good reason to think that the Trump administration holds any actionable evidence of these crimes, again because I haven&#39;t been convinced that these crimes occurred.</p>

<p>I disagree with people who believe otherwise and who are making a prediction based on that belief. If someone has an incorrect belief, then either their premises or their logical process includes a mistake.</p>

<p>I suppose you could say anyone stating a disagreement is inherently &quot;accusing&quot; someone of being illogical, but it would be misrepresenting the disagreement and would be needlessly inflammatory.</p>

<p>I could be wrong. I&#39;ve laid out the clear evidence that would prove me wrong, and if these other people are correct and this action is happening &quot;soon&quot; then I will be proven wrong soon, and I will have to find out which premise or process I made a mistake in.</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply asking if people here are ready to hold themselves to the same standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you consider that pizzagate led the citizen investigators to a conspiracy in Haiti, and within the last few days a remarkable similar conspiracy was broken up in Haiti, it seems pretty likely that arrests are already happening.</p>

<p>It&#39;s normal for low-level conspirators to be arrested first, and for police to work their way up to the leaders of the conspiracy.  I would assume it&#39;s going to take a few months before people like Podesta are even implicated.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take pizzagate theorists to conclude that child trafficking occurs in Haiti, it&#39;s a major, internationally recognized problem in the country. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an organization dedicated to fighting this issue since 2007.
<a href="https://restavekfreedom.org/about/">https://restavekfreedom.org/about/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll question my logic when something happens that at least is not already widely known.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve answered your question, can you answer mine? You say it will take a few months before people like Podesta are arrested. If six months go by and John Podesta has not been arrested, will you question your logic? A year? How long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see the similarity, but what is that supposed to show?</p>

<p>That a contemporary crime happened that has similarities to an older crime that this group is interested in? What is meant to be interesting about that? What about that should make a person reevaluate their response to pizzagate?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a parallel example. Imagine a group of conspiracy theorists who believe that JFK was killed by an escaped tiger instead of a gunshot. They congregate online and look into animal escapes. One of the many animal escapes they&#39;re interested in is a case from 2010 where a tiger escaped from a zoo in Haiti. Now in 2017, there is another tiger escape from a Haitian zoo.</p>

<p>What does the interest in the earlier escape have to do with the recent one? What do either have to do with the central belief that a tiger killed JFK?</p>

<p>This is one of my central problems with pizzagate. There&#39;s so much focus on &quot;connections&quot; Who has met who, is related to who, lives near who. Not nearly so much effort is made to establish that these connections are meaningful.</p>

<p>Now in this particular case, I may be missing your meaning, so please clarify. From where I sit, no number of similarities between this case and the 2010 case by themselves validate any other charges, but I&#39;m open to seeing what I&#39;m missing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A group believes jfk was killed by a tiger</p></li>
<li><p>Another tiger is caught trying to kill another president in the same place, in what appears to be the exact same way</p></li>

<p>Conclusion: hey that group might be on to something about that tiger killing jfk.</p>

<p>Generally, I question my logic when it leads me to an incorrect conclusion. I never doubted that human trafficking existed in Haiti, in fact it is widely known that it does. I never doubted that missionaries may be involved. If I had thought otherwise on these two points, I may have had reason for pause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to need to ask you some questions.</p>

<p>What do you believe was the motivation for Laura Silsby&#39;s actions in Haiti?</p>

<p>Do you believe that Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita Express?  If you do believe that he did, do you believe he had sexual contact with minors on it?</p>

<p>Do you believe the John Podesta emails leaked by wikileaks are authentic?</p>

<p>I answered the question in your original post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you dodging my question about the reason for dodging my question?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You did not ask such a question. There is not a single question mark in your second post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is relevant to what you think of yourself is the obnoxious repetitive tone you&#39;ve taken. It&#39;s as if you have some sort of agenda that involves convincing people through repeating the same lie, and dodging questions which relate to facts.</p>

<p>What lie am I repeating? </p>
