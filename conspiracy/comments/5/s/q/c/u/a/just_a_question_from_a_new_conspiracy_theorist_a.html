       I'm aware of origin stories and motives of the original group. I'm a skeptic by nature and if I had to place my life on it, I would say no such organization existed with any real influence today. However I find certain pieces of conspiracies very believable. Do you find nothing fishy about society today?

       I find a lot of things fishy about society today. I just don't there any secret societies (like what we think of) controlling or trying to control everything. There are probably thousands of groups or individual trying to control things. Whether they are doing it for religious, nationalistic, economic or whatever reason doesn't matter.

       Well I don't think there are any magic powers behind sacrifices of any kind. I guess I am just wondering if there are any popular and possibly logical theories of the illuminati that don't involve Satan, who ever the hell moloch is, or any supernatural element. Because as soon as a theory gets supernatural that's when I start to not find it plausible.

       Your choice of terminology (magic powers / supernatural) is telling. The public conditioning around Satanism has been so sensationalized in order to make it more easily dismissed by the left brained, hyper-rational mind. These are not rituals performed to appease external gods, but are used as conditioning tools to breed psychopathic, materialistic behaviour - we as a collective consciousness create our reality, for better or for worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have stated, it doesn't matter if you believe in these things or not, they will exist regardless and will be adhered to by those who wish to control a population. I suggest you do some research into esoteric philosophies, dark occultism, psychopathy, the left hand path, and materialistic satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       To dismiss millennia of mystery traditions, esotericism and human control systems would make you a prime candidate for the "coincidence theorist" camp.

       My personal belief? I believe that such actions create negative psychological, and even cosmic, effects. I understand the hermetic principle of correspondence, or causality (or the law of attraction, if you will). These effects bring our collective vibrations down, and by association, prevent humanity from reaching higher levels of enlightenment and consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       No need to apologize regarding terms, I understand where you're coming from. We are conditioned to look at these things with skepticism, or to dismiss it outright. Try not to look at it so dualistically, like it's either "of the spirit world", or "of the physical word".. They don't see it that way, and they fully believe that the material/spiritual planes are connected intrinsically. Matter and spirit are one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, what I believe doesn't really matter. Do they believe it? I am convinced they do. Additional research material for you to consider: The Occult Season of Sacrifice, and it's connections to human/animal/goddess sacrifices throughout history - made to various incarnations of "Sun Gods". There are too many parallels and recurring themes for it to be dismissed summarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not these practices have cosmic significance, or simply allow the ruling class to further suppress their empathetic tendencies and become more psychopathic (and thus become more controlling) is the true mystery to be solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to get into the Jews because I have no opinion on the matter at this time and it's not something I've researched.

       If you have the time and inclination, check out Mark Passio's podcasts with an open mind - he does a great job of verbalizing many of these concepts. Start with #1.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Mark himself says, don't take anything he proposes as gospel, nor should you do so with any other researcher. However, as you do your own analysis, you will begin to identify the common threads in so many narratives. Trust your intuition.

       Not that user... but, ok, my atheist truth seeker. Answer me this. If energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred than what makes you think that sacrifice have no effect? Follow me. If someone is terrified, tis' energy right? Electricity flowing, and other things. That person is then killed and eaten. Where does that built up energy go? We know it cannot be destroyed, so one could say it's transferred to the consumer/perp, no?

       Sure if a person is eaten it transfers energy in the form of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Just as if you killed and ate a cow. While this is obviously not a perfect comparison, being as eating a human is sinister and demented, I see no difference in the energy transferring effects.

       That's not energy, that's chemical/compounds. See, this it what your not understanding. We are talking about energy, not what you said... I ask atheists this all time. Never get a straight answer ;). Science says: Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. We are energy, so where does that energy go? It's transferred, and no that doesn't mean our rotting corpse provides a nutrient source for the plants above us.

       The energy science refers to is exactly what I was talking about. The kind that cannot be created or destroyed. The type of energy that you are referring to sounds more like a for lack of better terms chakra or spiritual energy. Currently I have not made up my mind on whether I believe in such energy. Please keep responding as I'm interested in what you have to say!

       Im just gonna give you a little info on Moloch.  In the bible he is mentioned as a god people would worship and sacrifice their children to for good luck or some shit.  IMO abortion is such a huge issue today because the Elites/TPTB/whatever are giving Moloch all these child sacrifices.

       With all due respect I find that the Bible is AT BEST a retold story of perhaps our true creator. I do not believe that the Bible is the word of god or that anything in it has to be true. This being said some things it contains might be true.

       The true elites do not worship Moloch. That stupid shit is for the lower lackeys, imo. The true elite worship the works of Hermes Trismegistus, which basis it's teachings/writings off of the original works of Thoth.

       Moloch is a deity of Babylon. It's not literal but figurative. That's how the ruling elites compartmentalize, imo. They have idiots who actually worship a statue, while they know it's figuratively something else, in the esoteric/occult. Most people fall for this smoke and mirror parlor trick, just like the sub-elites... So, in essence, both are just as gullible and uneducated...

       Invert your question. Yes a small number of total Jewish population is in on the formation of nwo but how many in on the formation of nwo are Jewish? I believe you will find a much higher number than you'd expect. They are certainly the highest represented 'faction/religion/race' whateverthefuck Jews(Zionists too) are in the group pushing for NWO.

        Very very few obviously. The NWO-creating dynasties are jewish in origin, so there is an undeniable element of that. But the vast majority of jewish people are just as heavily brainwashed and propagandized as gentiles. They are told the goyim are out to get them and there could be a shoah waiting behind every corner. Of course they are extensively lectured on the atrocities commited against them by the german people. Out of this paranoia grows a lot of the behavior that people find objectionable. Extreme nepotism as they could never trust any nonjew, a certain ethno-supremacist attitude as a result of being seemingly outnumbered 1 to 1mil, the need to demoralize and ideologically castrate nations they live in (Frankfurt school), the desire to have a very racially heterogenous society the inclusivity of which makes them less of a target minority, etc. etc. They don't mean any harm to anyone but are victims of mind control just like everyone else.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       One thing that's key to understanding a lot of this is the fact that jews seem very morally relativistic. The idea that the same rules apply to them as apply to everyone else doesn't seem to find fertile ground in their minds. You can find proof of that in endless episodes of hypocrisy by the ADL, Israeli politicians, jewish intellectuals, or prominent jewish people in general. (I believe) the first thing Netanyahu said publicly after 9/11 was 'It's good for Israel'. This would be an outrage of galactic proportions coming from anyone else. But if you are a jew, that's really genuinely how your moral compass works. Anything that's good for the jewish people and Israel, is good. Period. I cannot recommend 'Culture of Critique' enough, it's so key to deciphering the jewish element seemingly behind everything.

       Atheist here, you don't have to believe all of this story you can leave out the religious worship parts that are just silly imo they are far fetched disinformation they added to use as a cover. Its like the shill strat to find one piece of your argument that is incorrect so they can invalidate all of your argument.  they may eat the pinal  gland to get high they may use blood transfusions of young blood to invigorate them self i doubt the actual devil worship,  they may do these satanic rituals to add to the effect for mk ultra training all these may or may not be linked idk.  As far as the Jews again proberly disinformation im sure if we all go far enough into our family tree there be Jew thr somewhere the child hunting eating molesting i would say is not restricted to the Jew you will find this activity in European royal families and middle eastern sorry im rushing, this could go on for along time through are many books,  this is not religious you don't have to believe all all of it apply commonsense and evidence of witch thr is little hence the theory part of conspiracy lol.

       I will do some research into the book you so highly recommended. I contain Jewish family that have been very much Americanized so I understand some of the points that you bring up very well.

       I read in another comment that you are Jewish and I would like to clarify something about you're question. When most people speak about the Jewish connections, what they really mean to say is zionists. Most people don't realize that you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist(. With that being said, the Zionist movement literally revolves around Judaism so I'm willing to bet a majority of them are in fact Jewish. Something like 60-80%, possibly more. The Rothschild banking dynasty, for instance, are key players in the Zionist ideology and have been heavily involved since its conception in the late 1800's.

       If you would like to get a better understanding of the type of people you are dealing with, and I hate to say it, your going to have to study a little bit of scripture and history. You may not believe it but you can rest assured that they do.

       Strictly focus on the captivity in Babylon, the Pharisees, the return to Israel, the fleeing from Israel back to Babylon(after Rome defeated them) and the eventual expulsion from Babylon to the caucus mountains (khazaria, or what ever)
      </p>
      <p>
       The customs learned in Babylon play an integral part. Also keep in consideration that gypsies come from the same area in the caucus mountains.

       Israel is a bedrock ally for controlling Middle Eastern oil reserves. Along with Saudi Arabia. And Egypt.
      </p>

       Separate the question about people - those who affiliate as Jewish or have Jewish heritage - with those who control the government and land known as Israel (and Palestine). The matters having to do with the nation of Israel are - for the United States - a question of global power relations and energy extraction.

       You may want to study up on energy fields. This all will make much more sense for you.
