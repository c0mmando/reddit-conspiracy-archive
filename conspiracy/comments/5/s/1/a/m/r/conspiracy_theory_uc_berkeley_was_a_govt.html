       So my theory is thusly: we are going to war with Iran during the Trump administration. I've had this idea for a while, but
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwjR-QpDtME&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        this video
       </a>
       provides some compelling points better than I could.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I would add onto that, is to connect some of the recent riots, specifically UC Berkeley. As they mention in the video, it's news that's being promoted as a distraction for the populace. Smoke and mirrors. I'd go further and say such things aren't organic at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we all know cointelpro and how the govt/Delta Force likes to subvert organic movements. But UC Berkeley specifically was people rioting over that dangerous faggot. The one who works for Steve Bannon, Trump's personal adviser no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even msm has gone ahead and said that perhaps their violent reactions would only serve to promote Milo and his message. And yes, that's true. I'm no lefty, but lets be clear that the lefty riots only make the righties feel more righteous. It gives support to that cause and discredits the people who are speaking out against Trump. It makes them look like leftists loons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's specifically part of a campaign to drum up more support from the reicht in order to garner political capital to spend on the upcoming war with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama used false flags/hoaxes to drum up support for his causes. LETS RETURN TO OUR ROOTS r/conspiracy. The Trump administration will do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm calling out UC Berkeley as one of Trump's administrations first false flag events.

       Trump involved in a conspiracy but he's an outsider, swamp draining, Intel hating, smarter then the military billionaire. How can that be? I thought that was what we'll get if Hillary was elected. /s

       This is not sarcasm at all. Which side are you referring to? Contextually I'd take it you're talking about the right? But... I don't know? I think both sides are consistently hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, of course there will be organic protests. No denying that. But let's not forget what COINTEL is all about- taking things that are organic, peaceful protests and stepping them up a notch.

       You might be right. All this crazy behavior seems driven by something less than organic. Weather you like Trump or not, I think we all know whom ever is sitting in that office is not the one making these calls. The COG makes these calls. The puppet in office is just the mouth piece delivering the message.

       You lay out a great argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my estimation, it looks like there's a proxy war going on in the States between the Bannon/Breitbart crew against the Soros cartel. Remember Hilary was Soros' girl the whole way. It would stand to reason that both sides are carving out territory and trying to prove they control this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the bullshit that comes from the war like riots, protests, executive orders and false flags are their way to control their unwitting soldiers. Both sides are constantly conditioned to believe the other to be lunatic fascists hell bent on destroying civilized society. They prey on the racial, gender and emotional leanings of their soldiers to entice them to fight in-person and all over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust any of these fuckers or subscribe to their nonsense so from my perspective it's been fascinating to watch.

       One thing though, is that Steve Mnuchin was an employee of Soros. So while I'm not disagreeing with you at all, it's certainly a complicated web, whatever is going on.

       I think it's worse than that. I think Soros and the Breitbart mob are engaged in a fake war. And their mutual goal is to nuke iran and expand israel. Soros is a villain,  but so was Emmanuel Goldstein in 1984. A TV screen villain, only there to attract the peoples hatred.

       Well, we know someone told the police to stand down, so technically it was a government sanctioned riot. Its not a false flag when people get hurt for real.

       False flag means people get hurt, but its blamed on someone else. The fake truth movement tried to muddy the water by saying that false flags and hoaxes are the same thing.

       Tbh it was a lame protest and wasn't a big deal. If anything, it's a distraction from what's happening in Romania, where 1.25% of the population is out in the streets and they're jailing former politicians

       The Riots and the conspiracy of Trump wanting to go to war vs Iran are not related in my opinion.

       If we make it 4 years without war I'll be a happy camper. But I do imagine that they'll want to start it before Trump ends on the off(?) chance he's only in for one term.
