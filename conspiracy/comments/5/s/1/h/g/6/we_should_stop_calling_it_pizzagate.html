       So we aren't allowed to discuss "pizzagate" on Reddit. For some reason. Ok, odd. But we're still allowed to talk about pedo rings right? It's not against the rules to do research/share opinions, even if those opinions are about pedophilia. So change the name. It was never really about Comet/Pizza anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name "PIZZAGATE" sounds ridiculous. It trivializes the seriousness of the situation. It misrepresents the emphasis and focus of what we're trying to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're talking about here, actually has very little do with Alefantis period. Our goal should be to EXPOSE the GLOBAL NETWORK that these SATANIST SICKOS are participating in.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people start asking for evidence for "Pizzagate", start linking them to ALL the exposed pedophilia in elite circles throughout time. There's staggering evidence that they ARE doing this. There's staggering evidence that this isn't a one off. This is an organized network. THAT should be the truth that we're trying to wake people up to. Alefantis and Pizzagate are trivial. Don't fall into the trap of trying defend Pizzagate. It's a tiny fraction of what we're trying to wake people up to. We need to coin a new term, and we need to expand our perspective on this if we want this shit to STOP.

       I mean, we really aren't allowed. Technically we're "breaking the rules" by even discussing it in these subs.
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       talks about it sometimes, but if a post with the word pizzagate hits the front page, they delete it, because they're already treading dangerous water and don't want another "broken rule" in their sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also we aren't allowed to have a subreddit devoted to it specifically. So there's that...

       No, but it certainly takes away from the "no way is this happening" mindset. If we can acknowledge a large network is operating, then it would make the idea of James Alefontis's involvement in pedophilia less farfetched.

       You're talking about evidence that could get him convicted? Like in a court of law? We don't have any. What we have, is evidence that he's a very sick person, a sexual deviant, almost hyper sexual, and seems to make a lot of odd comments, that without context make no sense, but under the context of pedophilia, seem to make a lot of sense, and would be very damning.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have a smoking gun. We don't have pictures of him fucking children. There's no quote of him saying "I torture and fuck little children." You won't get that without an investigation. All we're asking for is an investigation.

       Seriously. 2-3 years ago, half of what we talked about here is the growing police state and how it's fucked up.

      <p>
       Now this sub is endorsing it. Dragnet surveillance too since that's the only "investigation" that could take place; 24/7 surveillance just waiting to see if they do anything.

       I'm not supporting a police state. 2 comments down and you're already taking things out of context, inflating a semantic, deflating the point I make, and criticizing the entire subreddit based on one comment. What are you even doing here? Is your paycheck worth it, CTR? We're busy trying to make the world a better place, you pedophile defending rat.

       Explain how calling for somebody's investigation/ arrest with no evidence of a crime based on anonymous online accusations that don't allow the accused to face his accusers isn't supporting a police state.

      <p>
       And of course we have the added bonus of "anybody who questions what we're doing is defending pedophiles". Despite the fact that once again, no accuser, no victim, no witness and no former employees collaborating anything.

       No, I don't care about social media. And James isn't putting up anything illegal. Weird, sure. There are weird people and I personally have known people much weirder than Alefantis seems to be based off his instagram.

       I haven't seen him endorse pedophilia one time on his instagram. A picture of a baby with money in its mouth, with his friend calling Alefantis a hotard, is not pedophilia. A picture of a girl
       <strong>
        smiling
       </strong>
       while her arms are
       <strong>
        scotch taped
       </strong>
       (shits weaker than paper mache, yo) is not pedophilia. A picture of a doll is not pedophilia. A picture of him covered in pizza sauce in heels is not pedophilia. A picture of a dude wearing a "I &lt;3 L'Enfant" is not pedophilia when you realize it'd about a person, the guy who designed the area. Am I missing anything?

       I don't say he endorsed pedophilia, I said the exact opposite. There is no smoking gun. He obviously doesn't come out and admit it. You don't think its a little weird to call a baby a hotard though? That doesn't even make any sense out of the context of pedophilia....

       Honestly, what makes more sense here? A person is calling
       <em>
        a fucking baby
       </em>
       a retarded whore because he's sexually attracted to
       <em>
        fucking babies
       </em>
       , and just felt the need to randomly proclaim this out of nowhere on Instagram, directly after talking to the grown ass man who posted the picture?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or a person calling their friend an insult in jest directly after
       <em>
        referring specifically to that friend
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is abundantly clear that common sense would tell you which is more likely. But pizzagate does not follow common sense.

       You can bet your sweet ass that if I looked at everything you've ever said, while thinking you literally raped and murdered children on a regular basis, I would find a lot of things that don't make sense without context but seem damning as fuck if I
       <em>

       that it's secret code for raping children.
      </p>

       You can't assume the conclusion, and then search for evidence to support it. You have to look at the evidence and form a conclusion, not have a conclusion and look for evidence.

       You have to explain, logically, why this stuff is evidence for the thing you are accusing. Which you can't, with any of these things surrounding pizzagate.

       You can't look at

        anything

       that people cite as "evidence" here, and say that a reasonable person could honestly deduce from this evidence, without having any preconceived notions or foregone conclusions, that James Alefantis rapes children and murders in the basement of his pizza restaurant.

       Super weird how on this subreddit posts talking about the layout of the restaurant, and posts using Alefantis maybe false statement in whether or not the restaurant has a basement as further "evidence" for pizzagate, were highly upvoted.

       Not really when you realize that these guys probably host events and/or cater for these people, develop relationships and probably get the scoop on some juicy 411 in those circles. These guys may be aware of some shady shit that goes down, but because they're on a list that GQ put together doesn't mean they're on there for raping kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's a list made by GQ. It's not like a census or some financially based list. It's an opinion piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also also, #42 is a group of 3 party planners; Svetlana Legetic, Jayne Sandman, and Barbara Martin. Stephen goddamn Strasburg is #47, and I'm sure he has very little to nothing to do with politics. He sticks out like a sore thumb on that list and yet no one questions that one? Maybe because the list doesn't mean jack, it's an opinion piece and doesn't implicate anyone in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember, Stephen Strasburg, pitcher for the Washington Nationals, is ranked higher than Alefantis. A baseball pitcher.

       What you need to realize is anyone who believes in pizza gate is either a pedophile or considering  being a pedophile , they are just trying to normalize by drawing attention away from themselves claiming they are "investigating" when really they are glorifying and romanticizing their mental illness , sick desire and past actions .

       You should call it what it is, Fake News. There is definitely pedophilia in D.C. among the folks in power, but an Egyptian immigrant who owns a pizza shop isn't part of it. Nor is/was Alefantis running a pedophile ring in his pizzareia.

       I was digging hard into pedogate, and found one super damning piece of evidence. It was a picture of child porn, on display in an art museum for some reason. It was a picture of a grown man, penetrating a child. The security guard, on duty guarding the picture had sort of "dozed off" at his post in this picture. James Alefontis apparently "stumbled upon" this (like he does, innocently with SO many perverted sexual instagram pages). James commented on the picture "I love how he's totally desensitized to it now!". Laughing that guard was "dozing off", next to the picture of a little girl being penetrated. Under what circumstance would it be appropriate for James to have commented on a picture like that? What was James searching instagram for to find something like that? I've never "accidentally" stumbled upon something like that, and I CERTAINLY wouldn't make a comment like that if I did. Can we at least quit pretending James's disgusting sexual depravity is normal, run of the mill stuff, and acknowledge that the dude is FOR SURE into some raunchy shit?

       Nope. The picture contains ACTUAL child porn. I was freaking out for days after stumbling upon it. It isn't cited in most of the common evidence posts, because saving the file on your hard drive could possibly put you in jail. I imagine people would have a hard time spreading it.

       You think if I called my local police department, and told them I just found a picture on imgur, of a screenshot from instagram, with a picture of pedophilia, with a pizza shop owner in D.C. commenting on the picture, and that I demanded they go arrest this man for commenting....they would do anything but laugh in my face?

       Do you understand that these social media companies may log stuff that the users do and deleted items may just be marked as private, as is the case for facebook?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see. You are using a new account because you are worried that your real account would be tied to Pizza Gate, and you would let a crime that you claim to be really against go without a report because of "reality".
      </p>

       To me, Pizzagate represents the destruction of reasoning.  There is nothing to it but a long string of speculation.  It represents the takeover of skepticism by people with no respect for logic, reasoning, and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       On o e level, we know this shit they are looking for is going on out there and has been caught and prosecuted, but so much of Pizza Gate is poorly connected things that just don't get proven in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Alefinas / Achilles - because some guy on anDNS registration for has the same last name
       </li>
       <li>
        Kill room / park / tunnels / vivisection table.
       </li>
       <li>
        Things "tied to" this or that - tied to and linked to are weasel words for weak minds.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hawaii hot dog stand with dirty buckets allegedly used to dissolve bodies in acid
       </li>
       <li>
        lost alien civilization in Antarctica
       </li>
       <li>
        David Seaman selling T shirts and having a long history of trying to exploit sensationalism for profit
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This whole thing represents a 4chan level of trolling and hoaxing at every turn, but there are a lot of people who are Johnny come lately to the scene who don't respect logic, don't understand what proof is, and just believe whatever they are fed.

       You've listed probably the worst 6 examples I could think of. I've never even heard the Achilles thing. And I follow it closely. I could improve your list drastically. Here are a few odd things I've found.

       *Alefantis's instagram profile picture was a statue of Antinous, an ancient greek gay pedophile, who would be an icon for pedastry in the ancient world.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous">

      <p>
       *Use of the word "chickenlover". A picture of a grown man, holding a child. Alefontis comments simply "chickenlovers". Under what context would this make any sense? The child isn't eating chicken, and there is no reference towards chicken in the picture. One possible context that this would make sense in, is in the context of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       *I was digging hard into pedogate, and found one super damning piece of evidence. It was a picture of child porn, on display in an art museum for some reason. It was a picture of a grown man, penetrating a child. The security guard, on duty guarding the picture had sort of "dozed off" at his post in this picture. James Alefontis apparently "stumbled upon" this (like he does, innocently with SO many perverted sexual instagram pages). James commented on the picture "I love how he's totally desensitized to it now!". Laughing that guard was "dozing off", next to the picture of a little girl being penetrated. Under what circumstance would it be appropriate for James to have commented on a picture like that? What was James searching instagram for to find something like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Alefontis constantly commenting on EXTREMELY sexual instagram posts. Usually displaying pizza in a sexual way. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Alefontis is into disgusting artwork. Often this "art" displays children in a sexual context. Sometimes the art is a nod to torture/ trauma. Why are you displaying things like that in your restaurant?
      </p>
      <p>
       While none of these things are "the smoking gun" that will hold up in court, we think it at least deserves a closer look. We shouldn't pretend there's nothing out of the ordinary about this man.

       I tried make #PedoFiles catch on for a little while, but Pizzagate was already too established by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure it's sensible to change it at this point though. Pizzagate is an innocent enough sounding term that you can conceivably bring it up in casual conversation. As soon as you say Pedo-something, people block their ears, trying to forget such pieces of shit as childfuckers are even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that sense, the innocuous term pizzagate is pretty useful in terms of keeping the conversation going in the public mind without everyone turning away immediately. I mean, they still turn away and laugh mostly, but this way they will at least keep making light of this "silly theory", whereby keeping the conversation going regardless of their opinion on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that Pizzagate goes waaay beyond Comet Ping Pong and pizza code, it might as well be called Haitigate or Silsbygate or Clintongate or any of a number of things, and it would still not adequately describe the scope of the scandal we're trying to unveil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda think it's our best option to make it clear that pizzagate is a citizen investigation of a global human trafficking network hinted at withing the Podesta emails is our best approach to keept the conversation sidetracked by Alefantis-defenders.

       This has been brought up many times. I don't think P!33@g@te is going anywhere. The name doesn't change the evidence at hand. It's a blanket term that also encompasses Satanism, child sacrifice, organ harvesting etc.

       Drop the gate stuff altogether. It's cheap, generic..unprofessional. It's a media coin-term from an incident that took place likely before you were born--at a place you've likely never been. Much like this Berkley nonsense, there is a reason people cling to things like those. Because they/you feel small. We've heard tales of previous wars, cultural uprisings, notable scandals, etc; and part of your brain fools you into thinking that latching on to things of the past, in this particular way, will make you/we relevant far into the future. Let the evidence (if it exists) stand for itself. If it's a serious matter, treat it so in every regard.
      </p>

       Anything otherwise damages credibility and is a shortcut at the least.

       I find it sort of harmless when we're entertaining broad specualtions about batshit theories, or legitimate past events that have never been 'solved'. A bit different when we're throwing very serious accusations around involving kids, business people, people's families, etc. All of which is in real time. I'm not saying that everything the potentially fits under 'pizzagate' should remain off-limits for 50 years. I'm saying to be very measured in how it progresses and how it is presented--stressing that proponents have something adequate and remember that the burden is upon them to prove their end result. It's not my job or anyone else's to disprove something which is speculation. Not only is this largely impossible, but it's a stupid expectation all the way around. This is serious stuff and it's about time it were treated as such, true or false. I don't care how many people gather and scream about it. That's not evidence. That's screaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub has ample subjects, to ponder lots of theories. While entertaining, a rock is still a rock. Don't try to shove nonsense down people's throat and attack them for looking at it sensibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate may be real, in full. I have no idea. If so, that truth will NEVER be realized the way 'the internet' is going about it.

       I've spent many years investigating certain historical events I was interested in. I spent very large amounts of time and effort then. I never saw a widespread adoption of best research practices, which could have prevented so much aberration and fruitless diversion. Things have further declined since then. "Pizzagate" combines everything that could possibly go wrong in this regard into one topical collective. It is, frankly, a case study in error; nearly resulting in actual physical harm. I appreciate your efforts, but I'm skeptical it is possible to effectively reach out to politically deeply polarized conspiracy-theorizing lynch mobs and turn them into productive investigative journalists. But again, hats off to your effort, engagement and positivity.

       People already call it Pizzagate, we need to stick with that. Yes, this is global, but when we're bringing in every single aspect of pedophilia, then we're just talking about child trafficking. Pizzagate is rather different. Especially if these implications are true (satanism). I wouldn't change the name. It doesn't matter what we call it, as long as we stick with the name that has traction. Pizzagate is a lot more friendly and intriguing than satanicpedogate.

       if you go back in time, someone posted this when the story was first starting to break here around Nov the 8th if my memory serves me right.
      </p>
      <p>
       he warned of this exact thing you are talking about, by saying PIZZA GATE LETS THEM OFF THE HOOK, because it doesn't sound serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was right.

       And finally people are starting to understand the point ive been trying to make for months.
      </p>

       PizzaGate is classic misdirection psyops.  The donnies and the right wing nuts bought it hook line and sinker and completely discredited a real problem with wild innuendo, baseless claims, with witch hunts and a stupid fucking name.
      </p>
      <p>
       PizzaGate will never be taken seriously.  Call it what it is ..... A HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM WITH THE ELITES CALLED PEDOPHILIA.

       The great thing about the name pizzagate though is every where you go you see pizza shops and are reminded of it.
      </p>

       It's marketing genius.

      <p>
       Why do you think they fight this so hard and not "illuminatti pedophile rings"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you can ignore the illuminatti. You can't ignore pizza.

       I'm not supporting a police state. 2 comments down and you're already taking things out of context, inflating a semantic, deflating the point I make, and criticizing the entire subreddit based on one comment. What are you even doing here? Is your paycheck worth it, CTR? We're busy trying to make the world a better place, you pedophile defending rat.
