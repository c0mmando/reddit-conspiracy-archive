    <div class="md"><p>Idk man I feel like you might want to research that a bit more.. Archons involve fourth dimensional parasites that feed off human suffering.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is a natural thing built into the cycle of life. Energy/consciousness can&#39;t be destroyed so we inhabit different (hundreds) of bodies to learn and advance our soul stage and level of self awareness.</p>

<p>Archons cannot interfere with the natural process of reincarnation.. It&#39;s impossible.</p>

<p>Soul contracts however are real in a sense, but anyone can actively change or modify any &quot;contracts&quot; you currently have</p>

<p>They can even be reprogrammed in your sleep.</p>

<p>I love the message you&#39;re trying to get out but this might scare some people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I have great respect for you and your work. Sadly you are very incorrect on this subject. Humans are meant to expand eternally like the Real Free Universe. Nothing is gained from Reincarnation and Memory Erase. It is a huge step backwards. The Archons are based in the Astral and the Satanic Global Elite does their bidding in this dimension. They have enslaved all of humanity. Earth is not a school it is a prison controlled by Demonic Aliens. I have seen them as have many others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79lVNKthCw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79lVNKthCw</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one notion I&#39;ve come to many times and one that is very frightening. However all the spiritual material I&#39;ve read and researched goes into great length about how reincarnation is advancing yourself, and paying off karmic debt that you could have. But I&#39;ve entertained both thoughts, both yours and what I&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>I do understand how it could be a control system and how it&#39;s been anchored into this reality. Living in a polarized third dimensional reality doesn&#39;t help things much either, and neither does all the psychopaths doing the bidding for these satanic forces either.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to look more into it and connect dots. it&#39;s a frightening and facsinating subject at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. It is very frightening and at a certain point heartbreaking. I have read all the spiritual material for decades and sadly it all ended up here. Reincarnation and Karmic Debt are limitations that have been used to enslave previously &quot;Eternal Limitless Beings&quot;. The good news is that there are caring people like you and me who can change this horrible system.  I will no longer allow my memories and personality to be stolen from me. I will no longer allow this to be done to my loved ones or anyone else. To go further, there are people who are trying to save those who are now in the the Astral Afterlife who are waiting to be be brutally recycled. The group running the earth 3rd dimension are the Satanic Global Elite. Everything they do is for their insane and brutally cruel masters: The Archons. It is time for anyone who has &quot;woken up&quot; to do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; and end this madness. Most will ridicule and spit at you as you attempt to free them and everyone else from never ending slavery. I get insulted constantly from people here, but I will never give up the quest to free humanity...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to picture but easy to explain. Our essence, right now, is just a part of who we truly are. A spark of our soul is currently in this body, here, now, on earth. But you also exist as a higher soul (your higher self, which encompasses everything you&#39;ve been and experienced, such as all the lives you&#39;ve lived etc)</p>

<p>Then before birth we plan our parents, our lessons to learn, our marriage or soul mate, etc. it sounds fucking crazy but makes a lot of sense the more I looked into it.</p>

<p>Two amazing books I read on this subject are</p>

<p>Journey of souls by Michael Newton</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>The meaning of the life you planned before you were born by Robert Shwartz</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I have great respect for you and your work. Sadly you are very incorrect on this subject. Humans are meant to expand eternally like the Real Free Universe. Nothing is gained from Reincarnation and Memory Erase. It is a huge step backwards. The Archons are based in the Astral and the Satanic Global Elite does their bidding in this dimension. They have enslaved all of humanity. Earth is not a school it is a prison controlled by Demonic Aliens. I have seen them as have many others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79lVNKthCw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79lVNKthCw</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true what is the motive of the Archons?</p>

<p>I have astrally projected and experimented with pretty much all the &quot;mainstream&quot; psychedelics so I feel from my experiences I have a sense of this kind of stuff potentially being true. However it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me that someone who can astrally project can become so advanced at it that they can comprehend what higher level astral entities (basically gods as far as we can tell) are doing.</p>

<p>It feels like it could be true but it also feels like it could be misinterpreted astral experience. </p>

<p>I feel like my life is just an endless series of lessons that are seeing me grow in maturity, gratitude, sophistication, personal power (over self) and wisdom (from mistakes). It&#39;s easy to feel like my life is being led in this respect but it&#39;s also easy to acknowledge that it is comforting to have the belief that I am being led. I feel this kind of cognitive bias may be being used in reverse in this archon. However I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Essentially how can I see the Archons for myself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes. I meant a entity that took the form of Baphomet. But there are good entities there too. Like Saddhartha and Naga. Its the spirit realm.  I have friends that have meant a cloaked figure with a preying mantis skull for a face; Holding a sickle looking over a windmill that had people tied to it. I have read stories of people meeting the Virgin Mary and Jaguar Headed people. The other side is pretty crazy. Try it for yourself. The info on making and materials are very easy to obtain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think this universe is a simulation or hologram where light is slowed and condensed into matter. When you take in large amount of DMT ( Large amount meaning more then your brain would generally produce ) that amount interrupts you seeing the light in the macro and diverts your perception into your third eye. This allows you to see the fractals that comprise the holographic universe. What you see on DMT is always there. You just dont perceive it. I searched and have found that life grows in the Fibonacci sequence. If you take any two numbers from the sequence and divide them you will get a ratio that continually get closer and closer the phi ratio or 1.66. Everything does it. Now if you inverse that divide equation ( basically switch the numbers ) you will get the same ration -1 or .66, So I think we live in a holographic universe we create by perceiving it. This universe is GOD. We are GOD experience GOD by way of a holographic universe. What you see when you smoke DMT is the non material world or phi -1. The one is the singularity that is all we know and see but also the force that connects it all. But hell go find, search create what works for you. Create what works best for all. Im no guru so you have to look into all the info and make your own conclusion. Im no guru so what do I know...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeas and no. The info is hidden but those dark ones in control ( for now) put info out. They just slip it in with B/S. Start paying attention to what movie concepts make it to be popular.  Ask why. Then go back and watch it again. Like a basic example. I watch that shit Dracular the untold story. He gets his power from and old  man in a cave. The old man breaks a skull into  bowl and put the blood in it to be drank by the Dracula character. Now at first site you may think that this is but for effect till to look into what these sick fuckers do with this pizzagate shit... The dark ones thrive on being able to fool us all. But the ultimate bamboozle is to have you know the truth but be able to trick you anyway. Thats why its in the music, in the TV in all pop culture...even your money</p>
