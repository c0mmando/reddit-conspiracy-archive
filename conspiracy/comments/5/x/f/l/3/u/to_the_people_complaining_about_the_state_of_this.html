        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My question to you. Why are you so bothered that this sub won&#39;t conform to the rest of Reddit&#39;s narrative? The Trump dossier can be literally discussed openly on any sub without fear of repercussions with the exception of a few I can count on my fingers. Why does it bother you so much that this sub might want to better put its focus on piizagate for example, a topic that&#39;s being surpresed on all other subs. This is what conspiracy is all about. In actuality I see this sub thriving and only growing stronger from this resistance. The way I see it, and I&#39;m sure many others do, is that you are literally upset that this sub won&#39;t conform to information you can easily find and discuss on any other subreddit. That reeks of complete ill motives. That&#39;s why the fake pleas are constantly ignored. Bottom line is you won&#39;t change the narrative here no matter how many times you scream at the sky as no one really takes them seriously and I guess you must be getting tired of getting affirmation from bots all the time. But you won&#39;t get it from us.</p>

<p>However no one is stopping that from being discussed just as no one is stopping this from being discussed. You see it as a political shitpost but I see it as a conspiracy to impede investigations for horrendous crimes that were comited on humanity. Pretty big conspiracy if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are crimes of very serious magnitude that were comited by the previous people in power and whomever was pulling their strings in the establishment are desperately covering for themselves now. We are talking crimes beyond regular people&#39;s comprehension. We are in the midst of uncovering not one but all of them. People are taking matters into their own hands with a momentum that can&#39;t be stopped. The harder they try the more they keep exposing themsleves. It&#39;s all crumbling down and falling apart for them. Never in my lifetime have I thought I would see them so desperate! I feel like I am in a dream, truly. We already won but they keep wanting us to think we&#39;re two steps behind while we really aren&#39;t!</p>

<p>No where else on Reddit are you allowed to discuss this in big subs without either getting banned or going against subs that are designed to not have your free-thinking and consenting voice heard. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying there&#39;s nothing worthy to discuss about Trump. We sure as hell should be skeptical of him and it&#39;s OUR DUTY to make sure he owns up to his promise to drain the swamp. </p>

<p>However he won fair and square. Even if Russians did hack those emails and and it wasn&#39;t an insider, people didn&#39;t like what they read in those emails and  decided in their own hearts and minds not to vote for those monsters. Not based on fake news. Based on rational decisions. There&#39;s no rocket science behind it really. No Russians did not personally hack the machines. There&#39;s not even proof they hacked the emails. Either way Trump won by democracy. Actually a lot of people saw it as a last chance of democracy as after he won they started trying to federalize all these rules now to make sure this act of democracy doesn&#39;t happen again.</p>

<p>By us giving in into the mainstream narrative, I assure you that it will do this sub no good. It will be just like any other, unless of course that&#39;s your intention. </p>

<p>We should stop focusing on Trump, but we don&#39;t like the way you present it because it is impending investigations and accountability for the crimes that were already committed. You&#39;re ultimately covering for people&#39;s crimes because you simply don&#39;t like Trump or because you suspect he may be a bad guy who wants to act like a shady businessman. We are comparing war criminals to shady businessmen. Do you not see the difference? The hyprocracy? Gosh I&#39;m tired of keep getting woke like this. Can&#39;t take any more of this waking. Need a break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll never be able to do that when the old crooks are back in control! That&#39;s what people don&#39;t get. Trump already opened himself up too much to be able to get away with such dirty shit they commited.

    <div class="md"><p>i agree, i think this sub went from being boring af to super interesting because its actually following real legitimate conspiracies. people fail to realize here that a majority of trump supporters are what you would call conspiracy theorists. in fact, stuff that was suppressed ten years ago is openly being discussed today while intelligence agencies are attempting to retaliate by literally manufacturing their own conspiracy theories. i believe trump captured the attention and approval of a lot of americas subconscious feelings toward conspiracies, and intelligence agencies realize that and are attempting to retaliate with their own manufactures theories. its psychological warfare, conspiracy theory vs. conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>now someone will take this and claim im a trump supporter. sure i talk in the_donald a lot and have a generaly positive attitude towards this establishment, but i never voted for trump and i dont believe he is some sort of saviour. there is also quite a few things i disagree with, but what i dont do is hate trump just for the sake of hating him because its the cool thing to do currently and also start believing and taking the side of institutions i&#39;ve grown to distrust since 9/11 like the mainstream media or our intelligence agencies. many people here seem to now be siding with them against trump because they either distrust him or hate him so much. </p>

<p>than there is the minority of people on here that just want to talk about fantasy spooky shit like aliens, ancient civilization hyroglyphs, and flat earth nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me is that all this negative attention on Trump is being used as a method to divert any wrongdoings these criminals commited. Like hello don&#39;t want the people who sold us a fake war and the fake terrorist threat they created to be finally put in jail? Oh wait there&#39;s a high chance that might actually happening due to all this stuff that&#39;s being unravelled. But no let&#39;s focus on how Trump is a Russian spy. Like fuck who knows what dirty tricks he has up his sleeve. What I do know is that we were lied to over a very long period of time manipulated complelty out of humanity. I want justice. I don&#39;t wanna go after some manucfated hate instead. Sure I&#39;ll look into Trump but obviosuly not when it&#39;s used as a diversion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just amazes me that people consider Trump anti-establishment.  Clinton and Trump are long time friends and business partners in a sense.  Many of Clinton&#39;s shady friends are also friends of Trump.  Trump has done business with Columbian drug cartel members, mafia members, and notorious pedos.  Plus, Trump is just a verifiable pathological liar on so many fronts.  The guy is in brand marketing so it comes with the territory. And it&#39;s not like all of this has just come out after he started running for office. I&#39;ve known he was a douchebag for years. </p>

<p>I think so many people desperately want to think they can change the system that they find some emotional relief in supporting Trump.  They want to believe so badly that they refuse to accept reality.  That&#39;s just how our political system is designed.  Left foot, right foot, marching onward to the corporate agenda. </p>

<p>That was deep and I sometimes feel I&#39;m falling into this trap but I can&#39;t full heartidly agree. Crimes are being unravelled and he&#39;s allowing this space to happen. He&#39;s allowing people&#39;s eyes to be opened, for those with eyes ready to see. We&#39;d never see that before. Think about that.</p>

<p>Now is he just using that as a manipulation to get power and then won&#39;t allow us to demend justice he promised? Well we will demand it and go after him too then. We won&#39;t allow these kind of lies to repeat again. Right now he&#39;s giving us a chance to unravel things that weren&#39;t allowed to be before. Is it a trick? It sure as hell is one risky one then I must admit. Would he/they really allow pizzagate and other criminals implications on them (which are real) to be so easily brought to surface? There seems to be a genuine campaign against him. I think American was at its literal last steps before fully becoming integrated into the NWO and over taken by the globalists, betrayed by our beloved traitorous leaders. There seems to be a change and a last minute hope that spread like a wildfire. Were we programed into all this? And if so for what reason? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Trump has shown he&#39;ll put forth whatever ideology he thinks will gain him influence or money.  Look how fast he dropped the &quot;Lock her up&quot; mantra after being elected.  In the last Presidential debate, <a href="https://streamable.com/8cwtp">Trump repeatedly said he would have a special prosecutor investigate Clinton</a>.  Then in his acceptance speech he completely backtracked on it saying <a href="https://streamable.com/o9bhx">&quot;Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.  And I mean that very sincerely&quot;</a>.  Shortly after his victory he seemed to completely change his stance, saying the Clintons <a href="https://streamable.com/q4tmf">&quot;are good people&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt them&quot;</a>.  He refused to be definitive on the special prosecutor.  Later his surrogates went further, <a href="https://streamable.com/9jvkb">confirming there would be no investigation</a> and implied that Trump wouldn&#39;t encourage Congress to investigate. </p>

<p>Even if Trump had unimpeachable character I would be suspicious of him for being able to attain the highest office in the land, but the fact that he seems to have no real character makes it impossible for me to suspend disbelief. </p>

<p>I think so many people desperately want to think they can change the system that they find some emotional relief in supporting Trump. They want to believe so badly that they refuse to accept reality. That&#39;s just how our political system is designed. Left foot, right foot, marching onward to the corporate agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eloquent in its simplicity and deeply accurate.  This is it!  I think the Messianic impulse was at the height in 2008 and now we are seeing the pendulum swing but the impulse is there.  This obscures the simple truth of what you laid out:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not defending it. We want the crooks who lied and manipulated to us brought to justice. That is all. However there is an effort to discredit the lies we uncovered by putting the focus on Trump and causing a division. Well also because he started a fire and got all the snakes to come out of their snake pit. </p>

<p>Many of us still speculate he may be part of some grander NWO scheme, despite our support for him. We will keep our man in check and if he starts making fake wars based on fake terrorists threats and false flags and is highly suspected of working with terrorists and involved in pedophila and human trafficking then we&#39;ll go after him. </p>
