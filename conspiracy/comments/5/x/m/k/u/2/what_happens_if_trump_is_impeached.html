       The liberal media will stop at nothing, it seems, to impeach Trump. 
Why do they want to so badly? What is he doing that is in such opposition to these individuals? And if the media hates him, I feel I've become conditioned to believe that maybe he's actually doing something to benefit more than just the elite. I could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happens if he hypothetically is impeached? Do they just move on to slandering Pence until eventually Hillary Clinton rises from the dead and sits her squishy ass down in the oval office? What is the end goal?

       , it's politics as usual.

      <p>
       If he was impeached, Pence would be sworn in.  If there was a legitimate reason to impeach him though, he'd probably resign like Nixon did.

       impeachment does not mean you have to leave. its an procedure that "wipes the slate clean"  Clinton didn't leave.  Nixon willfully resigned. its meant to embarrass the shit out of a sitting pres or at least expose misgivings. or try.  to actually unseat a sitting pres is a monumental task. and they need to have they're ducks in a row before they try and they know it.

       Yes, I never said it did mean that.  My point is that if there is an actual real reason for impeachment proceedings where it looks like there is enough evidence to actually impeach, I doubt the sitting president would go through it and would rather resign.

       If the alphabets investigation yields enough evidence to warrant an impeachment that won't result in an embarrassment for the  dems, they'll insist on starting the proceedings to maximize the republican embarassment around midterm elections to flip as many seats as they can.

       I don't like him or agree with his policies isn't grounds for impeachment.  So sick of this bullshit and the word traitor being thrown around.  He has hardly been able to even do anything because of all the shit slinging from the opposition,  of anything,  impeach Pelosi,  Shumerrrr,  Fienstein, Graham,  and McCain so we can get on with it.

       Think about that for a second.

       It is no secret that the majority of people no longer trust the mainstream media. The media know it. The elites know it.

      <p>
       Do you think they would use the media to push their favoured candidate, knowing that the people will automatically distrust that candidate due to their distrust of the media?
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites have been manipulating populations for centuries. They know how to play the game. They know that sometimes the easiest way to get someone to do what you want is to tell them not to do it.

       Bernie Sanders was opposed by the media. Genuinely opposed. How did they deal with him? Did they spend all day, every day telling you not to vote for him?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A new study by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy validates that critique, finding Sanders received far less media exposure than any other major political candidate in the race.

       No, they simply ignored him. The left him to languish on the sidelines while they legitimised Trump and Clinton instead. Sanders never had a chance because the media made it a two horse race right from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think they would have made Trump one of the leading contenders if they actually opposed him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wasn't opposed by the media. They
       <em>
        made
       </em>
       him.

       Well, there are two reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, continuing to attack Trump solidifies his support. People who otherwise might question Trump's actions are being tricked into supporting everything he does because "he's the outsider".
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, it's only been a couple of months - there is a long time between now and the next election... which brings us to the second reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem - Reaction - Solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at the Problem stage. The media are laying the groundwork for the next handover - polarising the people (Reaction) so that when the time comes they can offer the Solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was the Solution to the Obama problem. Obama was the Solution to the Bush Jnr Problem, Bush Jnr was the Solution to the Clinton problem. Clinton was the Solution to the Bush Snr Problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around and around it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They create the problem, wait for the reaction, then offer the solution. All the while, they control the whole game. They ensure that the real outsiders are marginalised and ignored - they are "unelectable" - and ensure that only the people they control are ever considered "viable".
      </p>
      <p>
       They give you a choice between Team A and Team B while telling you that Team C is not even worth thinking about. Why? Because they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       Team A and Team B. They want you to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you have power, but in reality you're just pushing the buttons they tell you to push, like a trained monkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're playing
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       game, and they have rigged it.

       a game being played... and will reject the "solutions" offered.

       to be fair:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump administration has been, so far at least, embarrassing at best. It is pretty likely that he is not the leader you were all hoping for, given the fact that he isn't a leader at all. He has no leadership skills whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I am very glad he is in office as opposed to Hillary. I think if Trump can work out the kinks he might do some good but I am not holding my breath as it appears he is just another establishment puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think is that it will just get worse. Trump will run himself into the ground. By that time, the people will be so desperate that they will accept any alternative to Donald Trump.

      <p>
       Even enslavement.

       It's weird, because our perception towards Trump is only based on what the media portrays to us. There were an infinite number of negative things that Obama actually passed that the media never covered, and now he's being looked at like a saint. 
Trump even sneezes awkwardly and news jumps on him. 
They control our perception of reality.

       Actually, with Trump we just have to listen to the words he says. The media need only quote him and most but blind supporters see him as the childish charlatan he is.

       Speak for yourself amigo. I don't even own a TV. I watch Trump's media appearances on youtube, I read his twitter, I pay attention to primary sources.
