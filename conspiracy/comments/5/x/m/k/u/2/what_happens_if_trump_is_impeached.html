Why do they want to so badly? What is he doing that is in such opposition to these individuals? And if the media hates him, I feel I&#39;ve become conditioned to believe that maybe he&#39;s actually doing something to benefit more than just the elite. I could be wrong.</p>

<p>But what happens if he hypothetically is impeached? Do they just move on to slandering Pence until eventually Hillary Clinton rises from the dead and sits her squishy ass down in the oval office? What is the end goal? </p>

Nixon willfully resigned. its meant to embarrass the shit out of a sitting pres or at least expose misgivings. or try.  to actually unseat a sitting pres is a monumental task. and they need to have they&#39;re ducks in a row before they try and they know it.</p>

<p>Think about that for a second.</p>

<p>It is no secret that the majority of people no longer trust the mainstream media. The media know it. The elites know it.</p>

<p>Do you think they would use the media to push their favoured candidate, knowing that the people will automatically distrust that candidate due to their distrust of the media?</p>

<p>The elites have been manipulating populations for centuries. They know how to play the game. They know that sometimes the easiest way to get someone to do what you want is to tell them not to do it.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders was opposed by the media. Genuinely opposed. How did they deal with him? Did they spend all day, every day telling you not to vote for him?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new study by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy validates that critique, finding Sanders received far less media exposure than any other major political candidate in the race.</p>

<p>No, they simply ignored him. The left him to languish on the sidelines while they legitimised Trump and Clinton instead. Sanders never had a chance because the media made it a two horse race right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Do you really think they would have made Trump one of the leading contenders if they actually opposed him?</p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t opposed by the media. They <em>made</em> him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are two reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, continuing to attack Trump solidifies his support. People who otherwise might question Trump&#39;s actions are being tricked into supporting everything he does because &quot;he&#39;s the outsider&quot;.</p>

<p>Remember, it&#39;s only been a couple of months - there is a long time between now and the next election... which brings us to the second reason.</p>

<p>Problem - Reaction - Solution.</p>

<p>We are at the Problem stage. The media are laying the groundwork for the next handover - polarising the people (Reaction) so that when the time comes they can offer the Solution.</p>

<p>Trump was the Solution to the Obama problem. Obama was the Solution to the Bush Jnr Problem, Bush Jnr was the Solution to the Clinton problem. Clinton was the Solution to the Bush Snr Problem. </p>

<p>Around and around it goes.</p>

<p>They create the problem, wait for the reaction, then offer the solution. All the while, they control the whole game. They ensure that the real outsiders are marginalised and ignored - they are &quot;unelectable&quot; - and ensure that only the people they control are ever considered &quot;viable&quot;.</p>

<p>They give you a choice between Team A and Team B while telling you that Team C is not even worth thinking about. Why? Because they <em>are</em> Team A and Team B. They want you to <em>think</em> you have power, but in reality you&#39;re just pushing the buttons they tell you to push, like a trained monkey.</p>

<p>You&#39;re playing <em>their</em> game, and they have rigged it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be fair:</p>

<p>The Trump administration has been, so far at least, embarrassing at best. It is pretty likely that he is not the leader you were all hoping for, given the fact that he isn&#39;t a leader at all. He has no leadership skills whatsoever.</p>

<p>However, I am very glad he is in office as opposed to Hillary. I think if Trump can work out the kinks he might do some good but I am not holding my breath as it appears he is just another establishment puppet.</p>

<p>What I think is that it will just get worse. Trump will run himself into the ground. By that time, the people will be so desperate that they will accept any alternative to Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Even enslavement.</p>
