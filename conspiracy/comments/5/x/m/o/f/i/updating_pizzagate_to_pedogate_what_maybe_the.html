    <div class="md"><p>This is not about Democrats, Trump or partisan bullshit.  This is an endemic problem within our government that affects 20-30% of our government officials on all levels and across all parties.  Trump is just an instrument and tool for the real heroes - the Pedogate researchers that have worked tirelessly since last October and even earlier - to expose and exterminate these pieces of shit.  It WILL happen, regardless of whether him or Sessions goes the full nine.  The misdirection and deflection of Pedogate as a Democrat-only witch-hunt is false.  We are well aware that the Republicans are just as complicit in pedo blackmail, and likely even worse than the infiltration of the Democrats.  The left-right paradigm is and has always been full of shit at the top levels of both parties - it is a <em>class</em> war - the real problem within the parties is their collusion to protect their mutual interests and criminality from the American people.  The Democrats got destroyed last year, and the Republicans are next, bet on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean for it to be pro-Trump - I&#39;m saying he <em>could</em> (and should) use Pedogate as his path to greatness, and some people like to think he will, but that&#39;s debatable because he&#39;s surrounded by traitors, partisans, special interests and incompetents actively fighting him and blocking/poisoning his intel.  According to rumored inside info, he&#39;s disgusted at the depth of the pedo problem in DC and underestimated how bad it was, and doesn&#39;t seem to grasp the fact that his own party is NOT on his side either and is an even bigger part of the problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I think he&#39;s a well-meaning and super-patriotic guy (in comparison to his predecessors) that means what he says and has real vision, but he lacks a properly effective staff, doesn&#39;t prioritize his agenda properly, lacks the natural curiosity for knowledge to understand his situation vis a vis the Deep State (and CIA/NSA), and falsely believes that his party is behind him and/or not as compromised as the Democrats.  He needs to take a meeting with Dennis Kucinich, Robert David Steele, Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura and other independent, center/left/libertarian voices to truly reach across aisles to the people who dismiss or hate him to be truly effective, and IMO, survive his Presidency intact.  So no, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a savior insomuch as he&#39;s a potential tool for the people to get what we want, which will happen whether he&#39;s on board or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>StrizzMatik, you are a revealed SAGE. Totally spot on, every word.</p>

<p>One of Trump&#39;s first actions was to go to CIA and offer his support. I thought it was a sarcastic trick, but now I&#39;m not sure. This gang needs to be busted, or Trump will go down in flames before his 4 year grant is complete. He needs to drain nearly everyone in DC, and pedophilia busting is the way and the blessing he has been given along with his election victory. He may have earned the victory, but if he fumbles this blessing, he will lose his mandate from heaven.</p>

<p>He was making a threat, and I&#39;ll link to where he makes those threats.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GMBqDN7-QLg?t=2m4s">Unprompted, he claims that he has the full support of the military and law enforcement.</a> </p>

<p>There was no reason for him to say this, but he said it anyway. Because he wanted the CIA to know that the most lethal organisation in the world is protecting him.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GMBqDN7-QLg?t=14m48s">Says that there isn&#39;t enough room to fit everyone in so he might have to get the CIA a larger room which will be built by someone that knows how to build and &#39;we won&#39;t have &quot;columns&quot;. You understand that?&#39;</a> </p>

<p>Clearly states his intention to remove the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column">Fifth Columnists</a> that infest the CIA. Plain as day if you&#39;re paying attention (and those intelligence officers were certainly paying attention).</p>

<p>He knows.  The campaign season made that all painfully obvious.   His buffoonery is all for show, and he will continue to play as if the party is on his side because if they don&#39;t (and they are all being very careful at the moment), and they fight against him in the open, they will stand little chance of re-election.   It would be wise for right wing independents or libertarians to start thinking about running for office, people like Paul Nehlen, who may stand a chance removing cabalist bootlickers like Paul Ryan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you don&#39;t just lock up the most powerful and high profile politicians in the world, specifically HRC, who has connections to THE most powerful family in the world and think that&#39;s just going to fly without a proportionate, directed retaliation from the citizenship, press, the Deep State, you name it. This isn&#39;t TV where you just go &#39;cuff the bad guy, perp walk them into the police station and go &quot;Book &#39;em&quot; and ride off like the Lone Ranger. The case has to be airtight, all possible variables need to be examined, all connections exposed, a total slam dunk with no chance of acquittal. Sessions, Trump and anyone serious about bringing them down would be putting targets on their heads along with their families too - it&#39;s rumored Barron Trump is not living in DC for precisely that reason. Even IF Hilldawg or big names like Obama, Schumer, McCain got clipped for the pedophilia/occultism, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was done in secret with a ready-made media excuse to cover it all up, even to the point of faking their deaths rather than expose the whole fucked up underbelly of what REALLY goes down at the highest levels. </p>

<p>Just think of what those kind of revelations would do to the average person, the national/world psyche and people&#39;s sense of security to find out that, oh, 20-30% of the entire American political establishment household names that you liked, respected,, trusted and voted for are raping, torturing and eating children. Can you say &quot;REEEEEEEE&quot;? Revolutions, armed civilian marches and street justice would run wild, previously &quot;untouchable&quot; individuals would be executed en masse by normal Joes, absolute craziness. They, meaning anyone in power, don&#39;t want that. TPTB rely on our sustained faith in the inherent &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot; of their illusory government and its puppets, or the whole thing comes apart and fast. We know and they know we can&#39;t handle a redpill like that in one shot without putting themselves in serious jeopardy, so we&#39;re getting little snippets that progressively get bigger and bigger, easing us into it. Either way, I wouldn&#39;t count out Trump and Sessions on this one yet. Too many people (including well-meaning people in positions of power and influence) know about it and are dedicated to exposing it regardless of whether Trump moves on it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your stance is based on a grudge, I&#39;d recommend reconsidering the volume of stuff that has been sifted through to find what we have now.</p>

<p>My stance is based on three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>None of the circumstantial evidence we have is not evidence of a crime.  It&#39;s like a parking ticket is circumstantial evidence if it corresponds to a time when you were accused of murder.   But it&#39;s not evidence of a crime.</li>
<li>None of the evidence indicates a pattern.  A photo of a girl with tape on her hands is presented as evidence of child abuse, (with a huge grin and masking tape) but there&#39;s only one &quot;suspicious&quot; photo of her.   Laura Silsby is quoted as a connection to human trafficking, but the connection is completely tangential; they&#39;re not meeting on weekends.  People are trying to sell us this &quot;code&quot;, but the &quot;code words&quot; are only used in one or two emails, and don&#39;t match the pattern of actual code language you can find in any number of other cases.</li>
<li>Gigabytes of data was parsed here.   How many emails could you go through on average before finding one that could be interpreted as suspicious?  We have a dozen or so out of thousands.</li>

<li>Because he&#39;s clearly using code words to describe something that is NOT literal dominoes, cheese or pasta.  In this particular email it&#39;s slightly odd and nonsensical, but when you take it in the larger context of the fact that these people engage in occult rituals like spirit cooking, which is <em>definitely</em> not normal or just &quot;art&quot;, or that these people are friends with known pedophiles (Dennis Hastert), post disgusting child rape references, jokes, and pictures depicting pedophilia, cannibalism and rape like Alefantis and his friends on Instagram do, or buy up explicit artwork that depicts those same acts and make references to Crowleyism and Luciferian Thelema (Podestas), that&#39;s more than enough circumstantial evidence to be investigated if you&#39;re ANYONE but filthy rich.  But yet there hasn&#39;t been ONE official investigation.  That should tell you something.</li>
<li>Again ignoring context.  Kathryn Tate says &quot;I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.&quot;  Using the handkerchief code, that would mean Podesta is into underage S&amp;M.</li>
<li>Again, why would they be getting an Uber ride to a house full of adults, and why was it important to state their specific ages?</li>
<li>Nah, you&#39;re just being wilfully obtuse for whatever reason.  I don&#39;t even post on T_D with any frequency or regularity except for a handful of times, so your slick attempt at a burn didn&#39;t quite work.  I see no reason to continue this conversation, you can believe what you like.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda seems like what happened is the people pushing Pizzagate kept getting embarrassed at a total lack of evidence, so they decided that Pizzagate was <em>actually</em> part of some massive conspiracy. That way, any tiny bit of evidence for <em>any</em> pedophilia happening basically anywhere in the world could be considered proof that Pizzagate exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left is concerned about collective responsibility and protecting the weak. The right is concerned about personal responsibility and maintaining reward for the successful. The left worries about the weak being preyed on by the strong. The right worries about collective ideals squashing the incentive to excel. They are both right in many ways, but we aren&#39;t supposed to see that.</p>

<p>Government programs are very useful for helping the unfortunate, yet they often are made imperfectly and selfish people take advantage of them, so they don&#39;t have to work as hard. The right worries about a lot of threats, many of which are illusory. The left sometimes ignores real threats, because they see fear and militarism as threats as well. </p>

<p>What I am trying to convey is that this partisan dichotomy thinking we are encouraged to have is dysfunctional. We know that there is truth in both perspectives, but are encouraged to pick an extreme and stand up for it, because our identities are associated with teams. Somehow we need to rise above false dichotomy thought. I have come to see that it is one of the biggest ways our minds are limited and manipulated to keep us from taking our power back.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t always <em>this or that</em>, often times it is this <em>and</em> that, and maybe even more. When we are successfully manipulated to perceive only two options, these elite psychopaths can just corrupt two groups rather than one for even greater control than corrupting only one. With two presented choices, many of us think we are free. When we can <em>perceive</em> many options, we see that both presented choices don&#39;t include the options we prefer. The psychopaths don&#39;t want us to perceive this way. They want everything to be good vs evil, black and white, positive or negative, keep or discard, yes or no, right or wrong, 1 or 0, left or right, Republican or Democrat. Apparently conflicting ideas often combine together to form a greater understanding with more details and dynamics included. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was 20 years ago.. from all the evidence out there is is pretty safe to say that Trump never engaged in pedophilia or at the very least if all the elites are compromised he is against it now</p>

<p>there was a clip that I cannot find where he is saying epstein needs to get investigated and clinton and whoever else is on his flight logs </p>

<p>Trump is the most woke president so far besides JFK.. I know he is not perfect but he is a necessary chaotic actor that is attempting to gut and neuter that federal government and also stand up for some of our essential human rights such as owning and carrying firearms! </p>

<p>He also is responsible for greenlighting the pedo arrests totalling something like 1500 so far that were already being investigated but obama had held off on busting them because they are procurers for the elites!  </p>

<p>The latest Alex Jones show features Eddie Bravo as a special guest and they go into some of this stuff and its a really great episode! Also Eddie voices some criticism about Trump. Trump is not perfect but he is a valuable chaotic actor and will fight for our rights to carry firearms as well as gut and neuter the corrupt and over reaching federal government!

<p>Is copied directly from the literature. I have a BA degree in Natural Science. Do you think I would make up a word like &quot;magick&quot;? If you actually read into the references, the relevance of ritual murder of children, draining their blood to drink, and sometimes eating their flesh (esp. heart) is discussed in many places.

    <div class="md"><p>well just saying &quot;pizzagate is fake&quot; is kind of a blanket statement as well.. I think there is some pretty good evidence of some creepy shit going on in those wikileaks..</p>

<p>im just frustrated with people completely ignoring the wikileaks so you are right i was projecting but you did just matter-of-factly pronounce the whole thing fake without even so much as a caveat</p>

<p>one of the creepiest things that popped out to me is evie&#39;s crib and the connection to the infamous pool party wikileaks email.. there is also the connections to epstein and what not among other things</p>

<p>its just kind of odd to declare the whole entire thing fake.. thats almost something i would expect to see on r/politics, but i do agree the actual pizza parlor stuff smells of cointel and psyops along with the fact that the owner is david brock&#39;s ex boyfriend.. that to me is the strangest thing. It triggers the streissand effect in relation to the wikileaks emails outlining the clinton cirlce&#39;s creepy behavior.</p>

<p>then there is this tweet
<a href="https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/662070477737893888?lang=en">https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/662070477737893888?lang=en</a></p>

<p>which makes me think that clinton is one of those criminal psychopaths that gets off rubbing it in investigators faces that she is untouchable but very much guilty, at least of something related or people in her elite cirlce </p>

<p>also the guy that shot up the pizza parlor had past acting credits and conveniently shot the hard drive on the computer which i think was done on purpose to further bait would be researchers to go after a red herring </p>

<p>my point is that p-gate is a kind of an entrance to a rabbit hole and it just struck me as odd to see that on this subreddit... but maybe im wrong</p>

<p>See it all comes back to that. Telling people to dig until they end up making connections they shouldn&#39;t. A waste of time.

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate only refers to a small part of the story, that being the Comet Ping Pong / James Alefantis connections to the Clintons, Podestas and other DNC personalities and their use of the pizza/food terminology in their emails.  Chances are that Alefantis is only a procurer/Renfield-type cover-upper protecting his clients, although he&#39;s assuredly a pedo himself.  Pedogate is much bigger and encompasses high-level pedophilia and ritual murder/rape/cannibalism that has gone on in the upper classes for centuries and more across national, religious and political boundaries - which is why we often say that known cases like the Franklin scandals, Dutroux Affair, the Vatican, Hollywood, the UK government and more are all likely connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly what you asked for, but...</p>

<p>Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They often are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, especially politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that&#39;s attractive to the psychopath.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kakistocracy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves, and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such?</p>

<p>Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they prove themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while, they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so many opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).</p>

<p>I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”</p>

<p>On of the most frustrating parts of researching is seeing videos such as this, that do quite a poor job of presenting a convincing argument but simultaneously have an atmosphere of certainty about them. It&#39;s makes it clear why people take a cursory look into certain theories and come out saying &quot;How do people believe this conspiracy garbage?&quot;.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the new deflection. It was YOU hoaxers who first began PizzaGate by claiming Podesta and Alefantis are pedophiles. Now that these claims have been debunked, your new coping mechanism is to claim that PizzaGate is not just about Podesta/Alefantis.</p>

<p>Except, <strong>these people were the original factors that spawned the hoax in the first place!</strong></p>

<p>If the roots of the hoax are false, then everything else falls apart.</p>

<p>Disgusting. You hoaxers have co-opted the very real issue of pedophillia to use it as a smear against people you don&#39;t like. It&#39;s like a game to you people now.</p>

<p>PizzaGate has been debunked, thus your ilk have been forced to change it&#39;s meaning - &quot;oh, it stands for so much more.&quot; This is being done to give it some credibility by fallaciously linking it with paedophile ring busts around the world - &quot;see we&#39;re right! Something BIG&#39;s happening! Oh, look Chaffetz mentioned HUMAN TRAFFICKING! wow, he knows!&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>Every post about PizzaGate has been debunked, whether it&#39;s the Portugese mugshots, secret code words, hidden meanings in logos, secret kill rooms, secret basement, etc.</p>

<p>It might shock you but some adults (possibly not yourself) can enjoy playing with kids and think its fun to have them round. Most sane people don&#39;t  see an adult with a kid and immediately think they are fucking them.</p>

<p>The &#39;court&#39; that issued the warrant is ITCCS. This place/organisation doesn&#39;t exist. If you dont believe me have a look yourself. Its impossible to verify any of it because it simply isn&#39;t true. I mean, the crimes may have been true but there is no warrant or arrest. Some sites are even saying she was convicted! What it goes on to say is &quot;we convicted her in her absense because she didn&#39;t show up&quot;. When they say we I suspect its just the one man but there may be a few in on it. I don&#39;t think he is a troll, I think he is delisional.</p>

<p>Please forgive me for saying so, but Alex J it seems to me, should fade into backstage, and let his team of reporters take center stage. He can&#39;t control his emotions enough to come across like a sane truther, he seems more like a flipped-out fanatic. But he has a great research team and superb talking heads. Infowars could be the kernel of a new alt media network, if the independents could somehow combine forces and invade the mainstream. It could be argued they are already doing that, but right now, there is no cooperation, which might help. Some folks are making small teams, like James Corbett and Ron Paul, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats just like, your opinion mann.. I fucking love Alex and I know lots of other people do as well.. probably somewhere around 40 million people that never fail to miss an episode, and I and probably many of those 40 million appreciate the enthusiasm.. One of the best parts of his show is how entertaining he is and I think he plays on that anyway consciously. My only gripe is that Alex is ill informed on a few subjects and also is not critical enough of the Trump administration although he is critical about some points I just wish he was a bit more harsh on some of Trump&#39;s shortcomings so there would be a better chance that Trump actually does what Alex is recommending like decriminalizing drugs. Alex does want to remain on his good side though and Trump is known to get super butthurt about things. </p>

<p>BUT, I do agree that infowars really need to focus on luring more people in that would not otherwise search for that kind of thing or just be off put by Alex&#39;s aggression. The problem is that so many people are literally programmed by their television to avoid and discredit anything that has to do with the Alex Jones brand or even Infowars. I guess its a branding issue. If I was Alex I would fund a completely other operation designed specifically to lure in the brainwashed types but there is only so much you can ask of a single person and he is already losing money this year because they pulled his advertising off of google. But for the time being they already have at least an hour Infowars nightly news which features the other cast members, and no one is forcing you to watch Alex specifically. I guess it would be fair to say they need more of the other cast members features regularly on Alex&#39;s show and also it would be great if they all had their own hour each night even if their topics overlap because they have different appeals and audiences.</p>

<p>If you are ever searching for something with a bit of a left leaning theme and a completely different perspective then my favorite for that is media roots which is a podcast by Abby Martin of Breaking the Set fame and her brother.. They get into a ton of conspiracies and they always back it up with really good publicly available information. I cant say enough good things about them but recently I think Abby has gone a bit SJW and also they promote full on socialism now but in the past they were big Ron Paul supporters, and they are not gun grabbers which is a plus! Still though, they are legitimate in my opinion and call out all the propaganda bs.. including the Russian boogeyman Propaganda. </p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/media-roots">https://soundcloud.com/media-roots</a> </p>

<p>Abby Martin also hosts the Empire files at the moment: </p>

<p>and also the old episodes of Breaking the set are great and ive watched them all and theyre so good that theyre actually entertaining today even when the events shes covering are not happening at the moment. She nail a lot of stuff that Alex Jones and crew miss for example, she featured an expose on Ag-gag laws. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8cOuFETbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8cOuFETbs</a> </p>

<p>It appears that Howell and Diggs may have done something to put infowars at jeopardy at some point with slander and libel laws.. they have to walk a tight rope in order to not get taken down. But Alex is still committed to exposing the pedophilia situation and he has people on like Steve Pieczenik  and he used to have Gunderson on as well and they have been talking about pedophilia and the elites for years and years! It might also seem that Howell has other interests as well and Diggs is still doing limited work for Alex, but breaking up team of employees is always ugly just like breaking up with your girlfriend and its never perfect and Alex is only human! </p>

<p>And I have to disagree with you.. I really appreciate Alex&#39;s unfiltered opinions on subjects like Islam... He says what we are all thinking and I am someone whos best friends in college are Muslim Refugees that came from warzones and they are some of the cooles most open minded people I have met, especially in Europe. But there is no denying that a certain percentage of people that come from those same warzones react to their trauma in a different way. PTSD can cause people to want to relive that trauma and inflict it to other people as a way to control their own memories. Trauma also can produce the most mature and open minded and genuine personalities on the planet. The problem though is that if the number is even 1 percent or 0.05 percent that is wayyy too much. And there is no denying that in places like sweden the instances of rape and violence have skyrocketed, so Im not saying there should be a ban on people just because they are Muslims but there has to be some kind of psychological screenings or something. Leftists are able to skew statistics and they lie all the time but there is hard evidence and personal experiences relayed shared online that make it clear that there is a problem and its unfair to people that built safe communities and then having that all go out the window. But again I like that Alex is able to go on air with his true emotions and reactions to situations. And there has to be somebody like Paul Watson to call out all the BS that the &quot;left&quot; have spewed out, and his videos are a bit aggressive but they are super effective at dismantling the kind of brainwashing that the &quot;left&quot; has been guilty of! The word Islamophobe is loaded and makes it impossible to have a rational discussion about the subject. We are able to have honest discussions about negative religious impacts from evangelical Christianity, Mormonism, the Amish, and Scientology and the same mechanisms are in effect when it comes to Islam. Thats not to say there are not cool or open minded Muslims or at the very least Muslims that respect freedom! But there is also some evidence that political factions are actively seeking the outcomes you find in Sweden for purposes such as divide and conquer.   </p>

<p>This guy Nimmo honestly sounds like a douchebag himself and even called Alex a snake oil salesmen which is the lowest kind of unintelligent insult towards him. Joe Rogan also sells supplements and as long as they are quality and include what is advertised there is nothing wrong with monetizing a media operation and its infact very necessary. Alex Jones actually sells his supplements at a pretty decent price.. far lower than Joe Rogan and any kind of attack using that angle really shows ignorance on their part. Nimmo seems like a classical jaded employee but we will never know the true story. It could be true that he did nothing wrong and Alex may have fucked up! We are all flawed human beings.. No one is perfect and that includes Trump. I think there is evidence that he is doing really great things for the economy as well as dismantling the awful bureaucracy in DC and that makes him worth it in my opinion. Even if he goes after marijuana users I still think that he is a natural karmatic response to what happened to US politics in recent times and even if he is not ideal.. he is perfect for the situation at hand.. hopefully he goes after the pedos as well.. that is the most important thing! I see Trump as a necessary chaotic actor and hopefully his successor is even better than him! </p>

<p>The old model of media is dying fast but there is still a lot left to do! I think that infowars could branch out a bit and make media that is more appealing for sensitive viewers or even media that is designed to bait &quot;leftists&quot; but I think its pretty clear that Alex has his heart in the right place and he supports freedom most importantly. Alex plays to a certain audience, which is growing, and I find him extremely entertaining and I am glad that he has no intentions of changing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am ok with your views, jm. My simple take on Nimmo was in accordance with his criticism of Jones to be totally pro-Trump, which is abandonment of his anti-establishment philosophy, and without knowledge of Trump&#39;s true intentions or how his administration will &quot;pan out.&quot; I have been very enthusiastic of the Trump upset, we missed the 2015 HRC bullet, like we missed a similar 2008 McCain bullet, (only to be hit with two O&#39;Bummer bullets). I&#39;m also a big fan of Paul Watson, and Luke Rudikowski, who is not afraid of warning us about Trump&#39;s poor choices.</p>

<p>I supported infowars by purchasing several DVDs, I&#39;m ok with selling &quot;snake oil&quot; supplements, but I purchase herbs and vitamins in local retail stores.</p>

<p>If there is an audience that really likes to see Alex go ballistic, fine, let &#39;em have it. My personal taste is for polished elocution like David Knight, who does not stutter, hesitate, or rant; and Millie Weaver is another fav. Emotions should remain in check in a popular exposition, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm well Alex did go off on a rant about sessions being anti marijuana and he has brought up Trump&#39;s support of torture.. among a few other minor things.. but Alex is personally friends with Trump so he cannot criticize him too much. I think that if you are looking for real criticisms about Trump then infowars may not be the place. Its hard though because most people that are anti trump are into the stupid &quot;muh russians&quot; or worse. </p>

<p>My personal favorite is Abby Martin and her Brother for opposing views! They are not brainwashed or disingenuous. They have an amazing podcast and admit the truth about things and hate the DNC and bitched and moaned over Obama even though they are basically socialists but they also supported Ron Paul back in the day! And they have great episodes about 911 and the fake osama raid:</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/media-roots">https://soundcloud.com/media-roots</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/mediarootsradio">https://www.patreon.com/mediarootsradio</a></p>

<p>And they are against authoritarianism and anything pseudo sjw-like that Abby brings up is genuine and from the heart instead of just virtue signalling or whatever, although sometimes she isnt perfect either or 100 percent rational in her defense of certain minorities, BUT she has great information about corruption and was amazing on breaking the set about the Obama administration and Im sure she will be calling out Trump&#39;s bullshit anytime now and you can expect to not be the usual propaganda lies but actual concerns. She has a video on youtube calling out the russian propaganda lies! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op6Qr7uuMy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op6Qr7uuMy8</a></p>

<p>Abby Martin is famous for calling out putin on his own network and breaking the set was </p>

<p>great overall! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaEzMo0uYc&amp;amp;list=PLI46g-I12_9qGBq-4epxOay0hotjys5iA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaEzMo0uYc&amp;amp;list=PLI46g-I12_9qGBq-4epxOay0hotjys5iA</a></p>

<p>And now she hosts the empire files which is totally amazing! Her episode where she calls out John Podesta on everything but pedophilia was really great.. im pretty sure her podcast episode mirrored the same issues and brought up the infamous &quot;wet works&quot; email also! And also btw my screen name on her is supposed to be making fun of John Podesta!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG29FnXZm4F5U8xpqs1cs1Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG29FnXZm4F5U8xpqs1cs1Q</a></p>

<p>But yeah I love how casual Alex Jones is.. I have a hard time paying attention to any kind of show where the people act too serious and thats why I ALWAYS prefer podcasts that are conversational than actual news shows.. especially if they are scripted or use a Teleprompter, although Abby Martin does great I still like her podcast a bit more, and having a natural conversation with her brother is awesome! And I love it so much when Alex starts yelling! He&#39;s like a preacher but he preaches freedom and conspiracies and rebellion! I can understand being tired of the cheerleading for Trump though but they are basically friends at this point so I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath for criticism from team infowars! To each his own! Check out Abby Martin and her podcast and empire files.. Im pretty sure they are going to be digging into actual valid criticisms of Trump! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe my previous comments about Trump were misleading. I&#39;m praying he survives to achieve his goals, I just wish those goals were a mite more right, like Ron Paul&#39;s. I prefer the straight truth, and not a lot of fluff (unless it is entertaining fluff, but ranting is not entertaining). So long videos are not good. Text is best. That said, today I have some good ones to recommend...

I like hard evidence in text but I like the &quot;fluff&quot; sometimes and I like podcasts and radio shows for their entertainment value as well as informative value! I will check out Black Pigeon! But yeah with those podcasts I sent you I have to admit that they havent been as high quality about Trump as they were during the Obama administration (worth a watch) but they are still pretty good and Im expecting them to get much better and call out Trump for his real shortcomings. Anything with Abby Martin is always going to be at least pretty good and much better than anything the &quot;left&quot; has come up with so far.. Anyway have a nice day!

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, Pedogate is just a desperate attempt to move the goalposts and steal some light from the genuinely good work fighting child abuse being done by organisations who you normally accuse of being in on it. It&#39;s a re-branding formed out of the cognitive dissonance that whilst you believed religiously that Comet Ping Pong had &quot;secret tunnels and kill rooms and.... oh my I&#39;ve come over all faint!!&quot;, it turned out to be all bollocks.</p>

<p>The sum total of children benefited by PG and your investigations is zero, in fact less than zero, since a fair few were put in danger by that idiot with a gun at CPP and more than a few have had their photos spread around the Internet as victims of child abuse, which must be lovely for their parents too. &quot;Here&#39;s a picture of me and my kid having fun at a pizza place!........wait what? why are all these websites showing pictures of my kid and saying I&#39;m letting her get fucked by a cabal of democratic pedophiles?&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh whatever, you know as well as I do that Comet ping pong was there right from the beginning. The reason it came under scrutiny was because it is mentioned frequently in the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>I know you want PG to be something better/greater than what it is, but it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The main core of Pizzagate is Podesta&#39;s emails. They contain the both the ridiculous code words and Comet Ping Pongs underground pedo sex chambers and kiddie trafficking.  Like to crazy people walking hand in hand</p>

<p>Trump mentions any old bit of rubbish that drifts across his phone screen. You don&#39;t know what he was referring too.  He also fired members of his own staff for spreading Pizzagate rubbish.  I suppose that&#39;s all part of his 4 dimensional chess.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many times it needs repeating, but no 1500 paedophiles have not been caught in a few months. And those operations were ongoing well before Trump came to power, so if any president could claim responsibility, yes it would be Obama.</p>

<p>Urgh, so much crap.  Yes Paedophiles exist, yes some of them are powerful people.  No you have no evidence of some systematic ring.  It&#39;s a fan fiction you all made up. Come to reality, it&#39;s not that bad.</p>

<p>And you are spreading disinfo! There are rumors about why he fired flynn but no one can know for sure.. it might be because pence&#39;s brother had something to do with it. If you are referring to something else please link it!</p>

<p>And there has been 1500 arrests.. they were under investigation before but the FBI was told not to bring them in because they are procurers for the elites. AKA Rennefields.. the ones who brings the real vampires their victims. Edward Keith an ex british PM is known to have killed children and drank their blood and gland fluid. Now the elites actually harvest the blood as part of their anti aging regime. The evidence against keith is Ted Gunderson who called out penn state 15 years ago! And boystown! And then recently a chief of police in britain came out supporting what he said! </p>

<p>Here is a meeting with Trump about human trafficking but not the one I was talking about earlier.. Trump even made a Freudian slip talking about bringing human trafficking charges TO the federal government.. I cant find the one I was talking about but I am sure I saw it, and there is also one where he says epstein needs to be investigated more or something along those lines!

<p>This is a direct response to the pedo gate scandal and Trump is famous for talking to Alex Jones on the phone on a regular basis and Alex has even said on his show Trump knows about this.</p>

<p>This is the most recent Alex Jones show and it has EDDIE BRAVO on it as a guest host you might like it! And if you want to stay informed Alex is a great resource whether or not you agree fully with his unwaivering support of Trump. And Trump is far from perfect but he is the best so far and the closest we have come to having a real human in charge instead of one of those teleprompter reading puppets like obama or clinton. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsdf0VLu-2Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsdf0VLu-2Q</a></p>

<p>The government and agencies like the CIA have many different factions in them and it is especially clear that certain elements go rogue as evidenced by the recent Vault 7 leaks from Assange and crew!</p>

<p>And like I said before the pizza parlor was probably a diversion with an actor that went to shoot it up! It was owned by David Brock&#39;s ex boyfriend!</p>

<p>And what do you think of Laura Silsby who was charged with trafficking in haiti working for amber alert? What do you think of evie&#39;s crib?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an interesting video about reddit shills created by the same director that did &quot;Idiocracy&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXrU1VK3lc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXrU1VK3lc</a></p>

<p>well its shilling for independent news media outlets telling what i think is the truth and that part of the comment is kind of separate from the rest of what i wrote and its direct so its not like im trying to deceive anyone  </p>

<p>my problem with shills is when they use evil and deceptive gas lighting tactics and they are dishonest</p>

<p>if someone happened to work for a company and their product was good and commented about it i wouldnt mind but i unfortunately there are people here like &quot;FrenchCuirassier&quot; who&#39;s been called out numerous times if you check his post history because his logic is so incredibly flawed that it triggers numerous red flags</p>

<p>apparently he is an &quot;internet security expert&quot; who does not understand how DKIM verification works and thinks that wikileaks provides false information even though their last release had numerous zero day exploits that any security expert should want to know about</p>

<p>also he talks about serving he country so I am assuming he is a paid shill and one of the first things he said to me is.. &quot;i am not one of these liberals, i support gun rights so im totally not a shill&quot;... which screams SHILL</p>

<p>it seems that his MO is to gaslight conservatives and somehow to try to convince them not to trust verified publicly available information because its all &quot;russian propaganda&quot;</p>

<p>anyway a few months ago I was totally against Trump but I watched the episode of JRE with alex jones which happens to be the most downloaded podcast in itunes and googleplay history and it really woke me up to the fact that he is doing a lot of good things like downsizing the  government and protecting things like firearm rights and deregulating abhorrent business laws and eliminating the death tax which takes money from families when someone dies</p>

<p>I also read a lot of the wikileaks myself and realized that liberals are not really liberals anymore they have twisted that word to mean liberty for the government to take our liberty away.. classic liberals are basically libertarians and even Abby Martin and her brother who i shill for anychance are socialists but still hate obama and hillary and the whole dnc but supported Ron Paul because he is a classic liberal.. and conservatism is moving closer to classic liberalism because the influence of evangelical christianity has diminished and the new conservatism literally is trying to conserve freedom! The new &quot;left&quot; is trying to turn the USA into the EU which is great in terms of welfare but is horrible in personal freedoms: you can go to jail just for quoting the quran or posting pictures of warzones and in many countries you are literally not allowed to defend yourself and women are instructed to let men rape them instead of fighting back and calling 911 after they have been raped! You can not even carry things like pepper spray in many countries there! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re trying to link the discovery at the Tuam Mother and Baby Home to.... Pizzagate.</p>

<p>The Tuam mass grave is symptomatic of historic socio-religious bigotry, and the very Catholic institutional mistreatment of children (and its subsequent coverup) - NOT the ridiculous Democrat pizza sex dungeon bullshit.</p>

<p>Yes, there has been, and yet remains, widespread and horrific institutional child sexual abuse in the world. Pizzagate and its accompanying theories, however, are a truly demented response. </p>

<p>I&#39;m almost certain the whole thing is propagated by a core of gleeful trolls and a bunch of credulous people who think they are doing good.  For those of us who actually work in child protection, Pizzagate is a clownish, cynical info-age mockery of what we are trying to do.</p>

that pool for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda seems like what happened is the people pushing Pizzagate kept getting embarrassed at a total lack of evidence, so they decided that Pizzagate was <em>actually</em> part of some massive conspiracy. That way, any tiny bit of evidence for <em>any</em> pedophilia happening basically anywhere in the world could be considered proof that Pizzagate exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt you are correct about the church. The conspiracy comes in now that the beans have been spilled, and we have internet so the official cover has been challenged. The conspiracy to hide the truth is what all this brouhaha is about. And this time, there are political strings attached, and a chance to challenge the tyrannical authorities, possibly to remove them. Everyone who is trying to sustain the authorities&#39; version is obstructing justice, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;My friend Bonnie is going to drive the kids over.  The kids are going to have fun at the party and jumping in the pool etc.  Won&#39;t that be nice&quot;</p>

<p>It might shock you but some adults (possibly not yourself) can enjoy playing with kids and think its fun to have them round. Most sane people don&#39;t  see an adult with a kid and immediately think they are fucking them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left is concerned about collective responsibility and protecting the weak. The right is concerned about personal responsibility and maintaining reward for the successful. The left worries about the weak being preyed on by the strong. The right worries about collective ideals squashing the incentive to excel. They are both right in many ways, but we aren&#39;t supposed to see that.</p>

<p>Government programs are very useful for helping the unfortunate, yet they often are made imperfectly and selfish people take advantage of them, so they don&#39;t have to work as hard. The right worries about a lot of threats, many of which are illusory. The left sometimes ignores real threats, because they see fear and militarism as threats as well. </p>

<p>What I am trying to convey is that this partisan dichotomy thinking we are encouraged to have is dysfunctional. We know that there is truth in both perspectives, but are encouraged to pick an extreme and stand up for it, because our identities are associated with teams. Somehow we need to rise above false dichotomy thought. I have come to see that it is one of the biggest ways our minds are limited and manipulated to keep us from taking our power back.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t always <em>this or that</em>, often times it is this <em>and</em> that, and maybe even more. When we are successfully manipulated to perceive only two options, these elite psychopaths can just corrupt two groups rather than one for even greater control than corrupting only one. With two presented choices, many of us think we are free. When we can <em>perceive</em> many options, we see that both presented choices don&#39;t include the options we prefer. The psychopaths don&#39;t want us to perceive this way. They want everything to be good vs evil, black and white, positive or negative, keep or discard, yes or no, right or wrong, 1 or 0, left or right, Republican or Democrat. Apparently conflicting ideas often combine together to form a greater understanding with more details and dynamics included. </p>

Let&#39;s not forget how close he is with Epstein and how much he loves to see underaged girls naked. Trump and co and in the same circles as all the worst of the worst. But no one ever looks into that. No sir nothing to see here. </p>

<p>A statement on the tribunal&#39;s website states: &quot;In the event the tribunal convicts any of the accused, the only sanction is that the name of the guilty person will be entered in the Commission’s Register of War &gt;Criminals and publicized worldwide.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So its just a symbolic gesture. Anyone with enough money could start one of these courts. They cannot hand down any type of sentence and they cannot order any type of warrant or arrest. </p>

<p>I wish it were true that Bush, Blair et al were convicted but until they are in a real court it doesn&#39;t hold weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trump must be pulling some kind of feint, veiled threat, or sleight of hand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was making a threat, and I&#39;ll link to where he makes those threats.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GMBqDN7-QLg?t=2m4s">Unprompted, he claims that he has the full support of the military and law enforcement.</a> </p>

<p>There was no reason for him to say this, but he said it anyway. Because he wanted the CIA to know that the most lethal organisation in the world is protecting him.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GMBqDN7-QLg?t=14m48s">Says that there isn&#39;t enough room to fit everyone in so he might have to get the CIA a larger room which will be built by someone that knows how to build and &#39;we won&#39;t have &quot;columns&quot;. You understand that?&#39;</a> </p>

<p>Clearly states his intention to remove the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column">Fifth Columnists</a> that infest the CIA. Plain as day if you&#39;re paying attention (and those intelligence officers were certainly paying attention).</p>
