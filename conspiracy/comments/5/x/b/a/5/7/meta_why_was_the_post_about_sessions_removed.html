    <div class="md"><p>FRANKEN: CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week, that included information that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” These documents also allegedly say “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” Again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so, you know.</p>

<p>But if it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?</p>

<p>SESSIONS: Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.</p>

<p>FRANKEN: Very well.</p>

<p>The question was about communications in regards to the Trump campaign. Have you actually considered context when you make comments?</p>

<p>If Sessions meant to say, &quot;<strong>AS A SURROGATE,</strong> I have had no communications with russia...&quot; then he probably should have said that.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a trained lawyer with decades of experience, you&#39;d think he would know how to use the words that he intends to use.</p>

<p>that quote is straight from the video transcript, sorry to burst your bubble.</p>

<p>and here&#39;s this for you... and before you complain about WaPo, just google it. He made these remarks in public, and you can fact check it yourself if you&#39;re skeptical.</p>

<p>&quot;On Thursday, Sessions defended those remarks as “honest and correct as I understood it at the time,” though he also said he would “write the Judiciary Committee soon — today or tomorrow — to explain this testimony for the record.” His explanation, he said, was that he was “taken aback” by Franken’s question, which referred to a breaking news story at the time about contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians.</p>

<p>“It struck me very hard, and that’s what I focused my answer on,” he said. “In retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times, and that would be the ambassador.”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed the mods tend to kill threads here because of a couple of reasons (my guesses here, not mod statements)  </p>

<p>1) the threads are shilled fast and hard. Threads in this sub have a normal up-tick on u/d votes. When there is a massive push on a specific thread prior to it hitting r/all then there is reasonable suspicion of brigaiding. These threads need to be killed regardless of whether they get brigaided from t_d or politics.</p>

<p>2) Certain threads are hate factories which devolved from civilized discussion into verbal knife fights. I suspect the user reports explode during the lifespan of these threads and therefore the thread no longer provides an avenue for civilized discourse but instead create a shit storm of headache for the mods.</p>

<p>3) Some threads a repeat duplicates of other more active threads found in other subs. Due to reason 1) and 2) keeping the threads alive here is pointless.</p>

<p>Hate on the mods all you want, but personally I think they have done a decent job keeping this sub as neutral as possible. People can keep accusing the sub users of shilling for t_d or politics but after looking at /new you can see the stream of incoming threads is relatively balanced. The thread getting upped to /hot are likely doing so because users of this sub happen to share common opinions of certain topics (9/11, pizzagate, etc).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to hate on the mods. Honestly, I believe there may be an entirely reasonable explanation for deleting that thread.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just irritated that there hasn&#39;t been an explanation.</p>
