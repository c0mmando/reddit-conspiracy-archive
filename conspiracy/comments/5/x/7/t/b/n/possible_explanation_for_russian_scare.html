        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think I am finally figuring out what&#39;s happening here and this dates back to 9-11 but it more recently dates back to the G-20 summit. </p>

<p>Backstory: I read the protocols of Zion last year. Its a full blown diabolical blueprint for world domination. It involves 3 world wars in which the final one is between the Arabs and Israel while being funded on both sides by the cabal. This way, the cabal makes maximum profits. </p>

<p>ISIS has never attacked Israel. They have spread into many countries but have never attacked Israel. I think Israel is puppeteering America who, under Obama, was puppeteering ISIS. FBI anon once said that Obama is the king of the heroin drug trade inside of Afghanistan and that many of the elite have dark businesses like this where they make fortune and this is now Obama&#39;s territory. Who can possible police a drug empire other than the local ISIS groups? </p>

<p>Whenever ISIS hit the MSM, Obama always played them down as a JV group. When ISIS grew out of control, Obama kept quiet. Obama also tried to snatch the Ukraine from Putin and Ukraine is the headquarters where tanks are made for Putins Army. If Putin lost the Ukraine, he would be in serious shit for not having a tank factory. Eventually, Putin declares war on ISIS and goes into it with his friend Assad from Syria. Assad has been demonized to death and MSM claims he gassed his own people and so America is angry with them. I think Obama was mad at Assad because he wouldn&#39;t succumb to the pipeline and he was holding his own against the ISIS attacks. Finally, Russia jumps in and helps Assad tremendously. At this very moment, the G-20 summit meeting came up. Note, we all thought that Obama and Putin were allies at this point but at the dinner, Obama was furious and you could see it in his face. He was mad-dogging Putin the whole time. (If someone can find a clip of this, it would help). I couldn&#39;t figure out why Obama was mad-dogging Putin so aggressively and why Putin kept a straight face the whole time. He didn&#39;t participate in the Mad-dogging but acted normal when Obama was staring him down.  This mystery was never solved but now I realize it is because Putin waged war on ISIS and Obama is puppeteering ISIS and Zionists are behind it all. They made sure that ISIS didn&#39;t harm a hair on Israels head. </p>

<p>Finally, Putin bombed ISIS into a much weaker state and someone in the government was on TV saying something like, &quot;Assad or Putin, have you no shame.&quot; The ISIS army got hit too hard and partially collapsed and our government, under Obama, was pissed. </p>

<p>Finally, the democrats realized they were losing the Presidency to a populist and decided to wreck the US relationship with Russia before Trump gets into office because they knew Trump would make peace with the Russians and that Putin would agree to peace and make the democrats look bad. Now, Trump is talking about a total destruction of ISIS and the democrats are doing the best they can to maintain Russia as a villian. They are pumping non-stop propaganda because once Russians and Americans unite, ISIS is going down and Zion might become isolated in the middle.  </p>

<p>The US relationship with Putin fell apart as soon as Russia waged actual war on ISIS. Obama puppeteers ISIS. It&#39;s probably like his cartel Army of rag tag soldiers who can replenish themselves quickly because the US ruined every economic advantage and so the only job left is working for ISIS. </p>

<p>At this point, I think the Cabal will flip if we make peace with the Russians. They are praying for a long shot which is to turn America against Russia completely, but since the people can see through the propaganda, the infection is unable to quickly spread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the part where they need WW3 because the fiat debt based economy is over due for collapse. The ponzie scheme has run it&#39;s course and they need to hit the reset button in such a way that they (central bankers) don&#39;t get the blame. A massive war is the great excuse they need. This was all planned out for Hillary as president to continue provoking Russia, as Obama was, until they could find a way top start war in a way that makes Russia look like the aggressor. </p>

<p>Since Trump won they are going to allow the economy to collapse and blame it on Trump and Russia killing 2 birds with one catastrophe. That is why they are trying so hard to connect Trump to Russia. .. Of course Trump just started so they must wait until he actually does something economy wise before they pull off the frame job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no. The majority of America would have to be convinced that Russia is the bad guy. Right now that is seems like more people are waking up so the believers are shrinking. Fox is even calling out this Russian scare gimmick right now which helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own father can see through it, and that is saying something, we may have hope for us yet, they are pushing to much to often, and it will fall back onto them hard.</p>

<p>We all know Russia is not our enemy here, that does not absolve them from what they have done in the past, but they are not to blame here, and people I know are seeing through it, people that abstained from political discussion with me in the past, now they are more then happy to talk about it and share information.</p>

<p>The world is waking up, and we are seeing the effort some will go to, to keep the rest asleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US relationship with Russia fell apart from the Ukraine plane incident, a little before Russia starting attacking ISIS. (That&#39;s another interesting conspiracy)  Russia attacking ISIS made the US angrier because they exposed all the bullshit going on there.</p>

<p>So Russia has one tank factory, just one? Not even within their own border? Sounds like total bs to me.</p>
