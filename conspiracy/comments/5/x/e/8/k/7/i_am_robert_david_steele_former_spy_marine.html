<p>&quot;Steel toes would often heat up and become intolerable. <strong>This heat was also a concern for the search-and-rescue dogs used at the site.</strong> Many were not outfitted with protective booties. More than one suffered serious injuries and at least three died while working at Ground Zero.”</p>

<p>“Instead of heat subsiding within a week, as is generally the case for major fires, the astronomically elevated heat levels remained for three months. Cleanup vendor Bechtel Corporation—with 40 employees at the Pile—issued this comment about working conditions:</p>

<p>“The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400ºF to more than 2,800ºF. The surface was so hot that standing too long in one spot softened (and even melted) the soles of our safety shoes.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of this sub has taken a non-political stance. Many of here actually reject the two party system, and share a skepticism of Donald Trump. His vocal support of NSA spying, his cabinet consisting of several Goldman Sachs members and billionaires, his relationship with the character Jeffery Epstein, a convicted pedophile, and his AG&#39;s stance on cannabis reform, have many of us rolling our eyes and expecting &quot;the same old stuff&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, absolutely.  The chances of Trump rolling over and playing dead the way Al Gore did are 80-20. He is however our one chance of taking down the Deep State in the near term, so I will do everything I can to reach him and help him.  If that fails, I am positioned to open alt-gov.org with a Sunshine Government, and seek to raise $1B a year with bigbatusa.org so that I can beat Trump (or Pence when Trump resigns) with a really large weiner every single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protest was a pro 2nd amendment rally in Austin, Texas. This is damming evidence to me because the people at the rally knew Alex Jones should be on their side, yet he showed up with his bullhorn and drowned out the speaker so badly they had to shut down the rally. People there realized what was going on and called him out for being&quot;one of the bad guys&quot; and he almost got in a fist fight with one of the people there. I was 100% convinced Jones is CO after seeing this video the first time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE CONTROVERSY OF ALEX ‘BULLHORN’ JONES being an alleged Zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent Zionist-Jewish connections on his 1) Personal Staff2) Website Advertisers 3) Link To Time Warner President, Edgar Bronfman Jr.</p>

<p>Jones’ seeming allegiance to Zionism, which explains why he virtually never targets Zionist Jews or the racist, Zionist rogue state of Israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks, may well stem from a Protestant-Zionist belief system, and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a Jew – – which makes his two children Jewish under Talmudic law and eligible for the Israeli Law Of Return.</p>

<p>With additional information on Jones which this site is now providing, Alex Jones’ Zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global Zionism, becomes ever more obvious.</p>

Yes and PDB is also shit.  General Tony Zinni is on record as saying he got &quot;at best&quot; 4% of what he needed from secret sources and methods. CIA calls me &quot;open sores&quot; they are just fucking irresponsible and unprofessional about the craft of decision-support.

    <div class="md"><p>My mother supports Trump but she&#39;s on the fence about some stuff with him, but she also didn&#39;t vote for him. I was proud. She wants him to be legit. I didn&#39;t vote, and I too <em>want</em> Trump to be legit. We&#39;ve had many discussions about it, some in disagreement. But really, do anyone think &quot;guy that&#39;s wants to do good for America&quot; gets this far? That&#39;s naive thinking from my perspective. Time will tell though.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about trump is that he&#39;s 70 years old. All of the stress that comes with being a president will do a number on him. He knows this. People close to him say he has a need to be well liked. Well right now, he gets shit on by the media, and others. I&#39;d like to think he&#39;s in it because he wants to change the country. But he&#39;s a sociopath so you never know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling them &quot;giant space birds&quot; was a given random example, and an extremely absurd one at that, because you already claimed something based on from a book, so I claimed something based on random whims.</p>

<p>I am not however &quot;mocking&quot; the book, the issue with the Book is that by claiming that the Anunnaki are ahead of the NWO is already horseshit.</p>

<p>The point is the Anunnaki aren&#39;t behind it, yeah they are behind the creation of humanity, but that&#39;s about the general story we get, if the Sitchin and what else isn&#39;t taken into play, yet however the &quot;Serpent&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot; whatever has always been the sentient and major threat, and that thus ties in the whole Reptilian ordeal.</p>

<p>Moral of the Day: Don&#39;t trust and read actual &quot;official&quot; books and media, because there is a high chance that it&#39;s fake, if &quot;Controlled Opposition&quot; is believed, best bet is simply to go on the internet and do some &quot;laying of the land&quot; (or researching) rather than jumping on the &quot;probably fake&quot; list.</p>

<p>Its really weird, though, we&#39;ve spoken about it scores of times over the years, and I bought it up again just last week and suddenly he doesn&#39;t ever remember even getting the anthrax shot.  I had to remind him what happened, and he readily agreed and nodded, but I can tell he doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to thank you Robert for your hard work &amp; bravery for telling us (the People) the truth. I&#39;m so sick of the Government lying to us. </p>

<p>Q1) Any opinion of Gab.ai versus Twitter? Sometimes there&#39;s only so much I can research until not knowing whether an alternative &quot;twitter&quot; site is safe or not to express my feelings freely. Lately Twitter has been banning accounts from talking about certain taboo subjects (Pizzagate). </p>

<p>Q2) I noticed certain web forums there&#39;s always this army brigade downvoting and/or bashing/belittling others in order to change the narrative. So, are we dealing with real paid people, or are they just a computer program activated by certain words? </p>

<p>Q3) Is the future of a free Internet safe from heavy regulations from the Government? </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>the implication is that the journalist felt it was journalists and main stream media&#39;s job to create our reality, and Trump was going his own way, talking about issues that the MSM didn&#39;t want to talk about, like the fact that vaccines cause autism </p>

<p>make no mistake, his strong stance on vaccines and autism helped get him elected.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.syti.net/GB/SilentWeaponsGB.html">Silent weapons for quiet wars by anon; from Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper</a> and, in particular, this part:  </p>

<p><em>In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent. Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few. In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public appearance as to earn for themselves the name &quot;silent weapons&quot;.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the response.  I do have one more question for you, though I&#39;m not quite sure how to phrase it.  It&#39;s about a secret society/cabal/whatever you want to call it that I heard about years ago, composed of Christian extremists.  I think when I originally heard about them I heard the name Dominionists used, though I haven&#39;t been able to find what I&#39;m looking for in reference to that name.</p>

<p>These people were said to believe that it was their duty to hasten the apocalypse shown in the Bible because if they could bring about the end of the world Jesus would return to bring about the kingdom of heaven, or something along those lines.  To this end they sought to gain power by any means necessary while quietly seeking out people who shared the same ideals.  They think they&#39;ll be rewarded for doing God&#39;s work in this endeavor, so they&#39;re not afraid of death and because they feel it&#39;s a holy mission then everything they do is preordained and justified by God.</p>

<p>For all I know now this group could&#39;ve just been something that was a plot to a book, but I swear I heard about them through reading conspiracy theories.  My question is this; have you encountered anything/anyone along these lines?  Does this seem like a real group, and if so is it a real threat?  I apologize in advance if I&#39;m not communicating it properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr Steele, thank you for your prior replies to my [initial question](<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x5qd6/weekend_ama_guest_robert_david_steele_friday/dehdf9n/_">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x5qd6/weekend_ama_guest_robert_david_steele_friday/dehdf9n/_</a></p>

<p>. WRT <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x5qd6/weekend_ama_guest_robert_david_steele_friday/dehekrl">this reply</a>, may I ask: </p>

<p>You stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton is a lesbian pedophile traitor and criminal. To say that I have been a Never Clinton is to put it lightly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea about Hillary Clinton&#39;s sexual preferences. What evidence do you personally know of to support the claim she&#39;s engaged in criminal pedophilia? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I started supporting Donald Trump in July 2015 but my focus has always been on electoral reform, not on a particular candidate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WRT: Trump, numerous press outlets have reported on connections between he and his campaign staff&#39;s connections to Russian state and business interests. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-candidate-for-state-has-close-ties-to-vladimir-putin-1481033938">reported on Rex Tillerson&#39;s ties to Russian oil interests</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Fox News reported on Michael Flynn&#39;s <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/21/trumps-national-security-adviser-pick-raises-serious-questions-about-putins-influence-over-us-policy.html">apparent connections to Putin</a>. As ABC News reported, Flynn subsequently resigned after reports emerged that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-michael-flynn-resignation-raises-dark-questions-surrounding/story?id=45486020">he&#39;d met with the Russian Ambassador</a> without informing the Vice President. </p></li>
<li><p>According to the NY Times, Michael Cohen - Trump’s campaign attorney, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html">met with Russian officials to discuss lifting Russian sanctions</a>, after vociferously denying such meetings having taken place as reported in the Steele Dossier. </p></li>
<li><p>According to Poitico, Richard Burt, a former Trump campaign manager, <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/">sits on the board for Russia’s Alfa Bank</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">Interagency Intelligence Community Report on Russian US election interference</a>.</p>

<p>And the Steele dossier, which I won’t link to. </p>

<p>This is just a short list of the many associations between Trump and Russian interests personally, as well as through his campaign staff. </p>

<p>My question to you: As an old cold warrior, do these reports concern you? And if not, why not?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr Steele, thank you for your reply. </p>

<p>You wrote: </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So there are four assertions here regarding your claim that Hillary Clinton is, according to your prior comment, a &quot;lesbian pedophile&quot;. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton has had a &quot;predilection(si) for youngish yoga instructors. Has this ever been published on the public record?</p></li>
<li><p>Huma Abedin (si) was &quot;run at her as a young girl&quot;. And there, according to you, they &quot;appear to have fallen in love&quot;. And where is evidence for that on the public record? Furthermore, even if it were true, according to Wikipedia, Abedin took a position as an intern while at University in 1996. She would have been about 20 years old at the time - well over the age of consent. How is that &quot;pedophilia&quot;? </p></li>
<li><p>And as for Abedin&#39;s Saudi intelligence connections - being a mole for Saudi Arabia while working for Clinton - how can you prove that?</p></li>
<li><p>And where are the flight logs that support your contention that Hillary visited Epstein&#39;s island home without Bill. And to my knowledge, there are no public statements on the record claiming either Bill or Hillary engaged in sexual conduct while in the company of Epstein. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do you know for a fact Hillary (or Bill) engaged in sexual conduct with minors?</strong> At any time? Are you witness? Can you make an affirmative declaration of fact in a formal deposition in support of this claim? </p>

<p>A quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, an assertion as fact of criminal sexual misconduct by Mrs. Clinton might be construed as defamatory speech, spoken or written with ‘actual malice’ and ‘reckless disregard for the truth’. And thus she might consider Mr Steele’s statement damaging to her public reputation. If so, I’m sure Mrs. Clinton has access to the best libel attorneys in the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answers to ALL questions was too long and could not be saved.  You guys need a limit of 3 questions per....</p>

<pre><code>Do you know any politicians that are cannibals? Please list them.
</code></pre>

<p>Nancy Peloisi and Hillary Clinton both like small children (little girls) served rare and thinly sliced.  Are you fucking serious?  The pedophiles do have rituals and do like blook and probably cannibalism, but I have no direct knowledgel.</p>

<pre><code>Do you know any politicians, and their staff, that are paedophiles? Please list them.
</code></pre>

<p>No direct knowledge.</p>

<pre><code>Which journalists are targeted by the government now?
</code></pre>

<p>All MSM journalists work for the US Goverment either directly for cash or indirectly to keep their jobs -- such as Massimo Calabrisi who published the CIA party line as a cover story for TIME -- alternative media journalists such as Alex Jones and Natural News are now targetted by #GoogleGestapo under the leadership of Eric Schmidt, they now do the dirty work for CIA -- Amazon and Washington Post probably have a growing role to play, I fully expect Amazon to stop selling any books or kindles that question the official narrative at some point.</p>

<pre><code>Which journalists are targeted by the CIA now?

Which journalists are on the hit list now?

Are &quot;Targeted Individuals&quot; really targeted by the government, or are they crazy? Which agency is responsible for targeting them?
</code></pre>

<p>Mind control and involuntary neuro-manipulation is very real.  Here is one link to several posts: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/?s=mind+control">http://phibetaiota.net/?s=mind+control</a></p>

<pre><code>In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he claimed that people can travel to Mars through some machine and the air is breathable. Additionally, he claims that the colours were filtered so people see all red on TV. Is it true?
</code></pre>

<p>I like Jesse Ventura very much.  He is a wild card.  </p>

<pre><code>In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he exposed an expansive base in the Ozarks mountain range. What is that facility for?
</code></pre>

<p>Ask him.  There appear to be a number of secret camps across the USA including in the unreachable portions of Washington State and of course across the south, where &quot;men without a country&quot; are held in waiting against the day when a unit is needed to wipe out an entire US town or demonstrating body.  Lots of weird stuff that the local authorities turn a blind eye to.  All of the Governors are part of the Deep State, one reason I do not believe Donald Trump can survive without an Electoral Reform Act that knocks the two-party tyranny on its ass.</p>

<pre><code>Are FEMA Camps now being used?
</code></pre>

<p>I have seen advertisements for National Guard camp control specialists.  FEMA started the camps and the trains with shackles as an illegal refugee round-up concept under Ronald Reagan.</p>

<pre><code>9/11 - Was it an inside job? Which agencies? Name names.
</code></pre>

<p>Yes.  Learn to read for yourself.</p>

<pre><code>9/11 - Was it a plane? Remotely piloted plane? How was the plane remotely piloted? Was it a missile? Which flights were actually missiles? Where are the passengers if it was a missile? If it&#39;s not a missile, what plane was it?
</code></pre>

<p>Controlled demolitions in NYC, a missle in Washington.  Here are all references to 9/11 at Phi Beta Iota: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/?s=9%2F11">http://phibetaiota.net/?s=9%2F11</a></p>

<pre><code>Directed Energy Weapons. Real? What is the size of such a weapon if it&#39;s real? Meaning, anti-personnel, anti-tank, anti-building, area effect, etc? Space based? Air based? Land/Sea based?
</code></pre>

<p>No direct knowledge.</p>

<pre><code>Which agency killed Max Spiers?
</code></pre>

<p>No idea but the US Army has a lot of pedophiles and sodomizers and sexual saddits with neo-Nazi tendencies, if he got too close to any of them it is entirely possible he was killed by an individual or small cell rather than as an official act.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>Why do retired CIA always come out and &quot;expose&quot; the CIA etc, eg yourself, Ray McGovern et al, when you guys probably have done loads of shady stuff when you&#39;re inside the CIA yourself? Guilty conscience? Have you defied shady orders?
</code></pre>

<p>Out of the thousands of clandestine case officers (spies) -- every one else works out of a cubicle -- most disappear into retirement or double-dipping jobs retirement jobs pushing paper. A few of us become vocal opponents of spying done wrong.  Robert Baer, Ray McGovern (who founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity) and I are examples of the latter.  Part of your problem is that you are LAZY. You have not bothered to go to <a href="http://phibetaiota.net">http://phibetaiota.net</a> and read a single thing I have written.  You have not bothered to see the lists, all with links on line, to my books, articles, chapters, interviews, testimony, and even movies.  So I am answering your LAZY questions out of respect for Reddit, not because I think you deserve an answer.</p>

<pre><code>What is your purpose to do this? Sell books? Get paid interviews? Radio show?
</code></pre>

<p>Moron.  Try the obvious: responding to a well-presented polite, professional request from Fly -- not something you are capable of.  </p>

<pre><code>No witnesses? If your memo has been read by a million people already, then why do you still want to do a &quot;no witness&quot; meeting? Why should the POTUS trust a person like yourself to shed the Secret Service and whatever, when you were an intelligence agent that should be quite skilled at stealing info and perhaps killing people?
</code></pre>

<p>You have no idea.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;You have 30 days to settle the country. A violent “American Spring” looms.&quot; You&#39;re starting one? Somebody from CIA whispered this tip into your ears? CIA starting another colour revolution? Which is it?
</code></pre>

<p>You give Reddit a bad name.  Do you even have an education? When the weather gets warm enough so people can &quot;Occupy&quot; public spaces comfortably, Soros and the many organizations that have received ober 50 million dollars are ready to roll out into the streets.  Berkeley was a test drive.  Note that the Governors, Mayors, and university presidents are all part of the Deep State and against Trump.  For those who are interested in the four-track strategy against Trump, start here: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/special-three-track-program-to-destroy-trump/">http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/special-three-track-program-to-destroy-trump/</a></p>

<pre><code>Once a CIA, always a CIA. Why should anyone trust what you&#39;re doing?
</code></pre>

<p>I feel sorry for you. If you cannot figure that out by yourself, based on all the writing and public speaking and testimony to Congressional and Presidential Commissions to be found, with links online at <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com">http://robertdavidsteele.com</a>, then you are barely worthy as worm food.  Certainly I would not feed your ignorant remains to my dog.</p>

<pre><code>In your estimation, how many people are still languishing in Black Sites?

In your estimation, how many tons of drugs does the CIA smuggle per year? Which branch of the CIA does it, or is the whole organisation behind it?

How is the Black Budget funded, other than through drugs?

<li><p>it seems that a lot of former CIA have come forward recently to denounce the organization that they worked for and have been staunch opponents why is that?</p></li>
<li><p>with all of the dis-information coming from both sides and this being a conspiracy subreddit we would like to know your motivation for doing this AMA.</p></li>
<li><p>What are your motivations for meeting the president one on one?  Are you worried about who might be listening?  as you point out the whitehouse is bugged so we are all curious why one on one?  Are you concerned the people around Trump are trying to sabotage?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think the violent spring is coming?  Is soros that deviant?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I get why you are angry at the establishment but there is a way to talk to people and there is a way not to talk to people.  I did the same thing you did to a soldier just back from Iraq.  I was so angry they were killing people and for a war I did not agree with but I said some bad shit about how he could lie with himself.  It was not till his friend let me know that he could not sleep and had nightmares every time he did that I realized I was the prick and not him. I apologized in a cowardly fashion with my head held low because I did not know his suffering.  Robert Steele was nice enough to answer our questions when he did not have to so we should at least be respectful .  He did not need to insult you but he was probably pissed off as most of us would be if you insulted him without reading what and who he had campaigned against for some time it seems.  I have not read all of his work.  </p>

<p>People are heated and rightfully so but channeled aggression should be towards those who wish to do us harm and not those seeking to shed light on a dark time.    </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not &quot;recently.&quot; The gist of the thing is, why did they not make noise while they were inside, or changed the organisation, or quit.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not to talk about disinfo. It&#39;s to talk about his motivations. Not just this AMA, that he wrongly interpreted, but coming out and talking crap in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, it&#39;s not about &quot;bugs&quot;. He already mentioned it. He wanted a no-witnesses meeting, and judging from how CIA is famous for killing people, wanting something like that, while saying that there&#39;d be a &quot;violent American Spring&quot; in less than 30 days is highly suspicious. I do not see why Trump, or anyone, should let down their guard when in the presence of such dangerous characters.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to know his source of info. Whether it&#39;s his crystal ball, a CIA contact, or he&#39;s actually going to start anything. Soros is unlikely to do it, seeing how this is &quot;home ground&quot; and he still owns much of everything here. His protests are just mere annoyances, not a bloody revolution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The soldier you mentioned did not serve the military his entire life and is not telling people to join the CIA. Having nightmares and suffering does not excuse his going to other countries and taking part in the genocide there.</p>

<p>I am highly suspicious of anyone that retired from the CIA/NSA et al, and I think that I am perfectly right to be suspicious and cautious of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it was not condescending.</p>

<p>Out of the 4, 2 of his &quot;replies&quot; are non answers.</p>

<p>Is it true that ex-CIA always come out and talk crap? Yes. So why do they do it? Exactly. Guilty conscience/sell books/whatever. Similarly, asking if he ever defied shady orders comes naturally.</p>

<p>Why should Trump trust somebody from the CIA? Especially somebody that is saying &quot;30 days to settle the country&quot; or &quot;a violent American Spring looms&quot;. It is very clear that he&#39;s talking about a revolution, not protests.</p>

<p>Maybe if you stopped seeing that he&#39;s trustworthy just because of a few internet posts, you&#39;d see that I&#39;m the one asking the right questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you, I do think you&#39;re being a bit more skeptical than I, but that&#39;s not the problem, I&#39;m glad there are people that are more skeptical.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that at the very basic level of human communication, there was a better way to word the questions. If someone comes off as rude or a know-it-all when asking a question, you&#39;re less apt to answer said question, or at the very least you&#39;re going to reflect the attitude they gave you in your response. When you ask questions worded like that you&#39;re just kind of asking for him to insult you back.</p>

<p>Now to the opinions: If I dedicated my life to something I felt was right (like the majority of people in the intel community) only to slowly realize I was being gamed the entire time, I&#39;d be doing the exact same thing he is doing currently: trying to get the word out about the corruption, greed and power monopolies within the government. I think the reason a lot of ex-3 letter agency guys flip is because of the very nature of their work. They&#39;re exposed to a lot, and are usually presented with frequent moral dilemmas surrounding their work, and have access to verifiable sources that most normal citizens don&#39;t. That fact alone can lead them to believe that if they don&#39;t do something about it themselves, it&#39;s likely that nobody will, as very few know what they do.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more of a human element to this as well. I think that for the most part, people (humans in general) try to be &quot;good&quot;. I don&#39;t think that they&#39;ve suddenly had a change of heart mid-career, I think that for the most part, they were most likely left in the dark, and once they figured out the truth, this is what changed them.</p>

<p>Similar to what Robert previously said, I believe the vast majority are good people just pushing paper, the bigger issue is the secrecy and compartmentalization of tasks in the intelligence agencies. Hundreds of people dispersed into smaller groups or projects are led to believe that they&#39;re helping create a better world, when in reality they&#39;re compartmentalized puppets for the real &quot;masters&quot; so to speak. All put together they can create something truly evil, all without knowing what they contributed to.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with all of the book/website links, etc. Although I personally do think they&#39;re great, it just seems a bit shady linked from the author himself. If you read through his websites and books though, he isn&#39;t trying to get rich at all from any of this. He&#39;s just trying to spread the truth, and I haven&#39;t found many sites or books that are on the same level as his, so I don&#39;t know of any better links for him to share with us, and it&#39;d be unrealistic to expect him to type out pages and pages of replies that could be condensed into a single paragraph and a link to a website.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

<p>The person you&#39;re talking about is John Kiriakou and other CIA whistle-blowers. Not Steele. He <strong>retired</strong>, AND is still encouraging people to join. He is a &quot;company man&quot; through and through.</p>

<p>No need for an AMA then. From what I can see, everything is just &quot;go read your website&quot;.</p>

<p>Since you imply that I do not have an education, can you enlighten me what is the difference between a CIA backed coloured revoluation vs Soros protests? The question is valid because &quot;Whatever Spring&quot; means there will be a bloody revolution.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for you.

<p>I have heard you talk about 7 branches of CIA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computerized cars can be hijacked, sometimes without installing a chip. Do you not read at all? Have you not seen the proven demonstrations featured by WIRED and other magazines?</p>

<p>I already know this. All I want to know is if the CIA has a programme, a unit, a team, and interest to do this.</p>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t expect this as a reply.  Your first several questions were ones that I&#39;d thought about myself.  I&#39;m glad you asked, but I&#39;m disappointed to see this kind of reaction.  It bugs me that those who were members of an organization which is openly loathed in subreddits such as this are treated as &quot;allies&quot;, often without question.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen confirmation bias become such an overwhelming part of political discourse that I had wondered if that were the reason for this attitude.  After all, we all like to have the thoughts that we espouse affirmed by an authority figure of sorts.  It&#39;s become increasingly difficult to take the word of anyone anymore.  It&#39;s easier for me to trust someone that has actually risked something, like Snowden, but I may just be ignorant of this dude&#39;s history.  Maybe I&#39;m just becoming overly cynical.</p>

<p>MICES - The people here identify with the ideology part, because they imagine that Steele is not one of &quot;them&quot;, just because of a few internet posts. Ignoring everything he did in his life, the fact that he, the self proclaimed &quot;desk jockey&quot; is meeting up with terrorists in other countries, as well as encouraging people to join the CIA.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uW2U5L17lDQ">https://youtu.be/uW2U5L17lDQ</a></p>

<p>Also, what do you know about The Finders?  I believe they were involved with the Franklin Scandal.  What are your thoughts on this mess?  I also believe Johnny Gosch was kidnapped by The Finders, and ended up in Omaha.  Do you have any inside knowledge or insight on these topics?  </p>

<p>It is like The Finders were sent out to &quot;find&quot; and photograph potential kidnapping victims.  The photographs were shown to potential buyers, and then the kids selected were taken.  I think some of the potential buyers were very high level government officials.  I have also heard rumors about auctions, and the kids were branded like cattle.  </p>

<p>I do realize a conspiracy press conference could actually make matters worse, possibly putting him in more jeopardy, but what do we do? We seem to be in a position where an information offensive is necessary. It&#39;s obvious that our nation will be held in arrested development until we face the truth about our past. In your expertise, what should we do? Continue soft disclosure via the alternative media? Or step it up a few notches and just swallow the bad medicine in order to move forward? Thank you.</p>

<p>I ask because I feel if he keeps giving soft answers to hard realities, then we will be stuck in this cabal mentality for far too long, and it will only escalate. I say bipartisan whistleblowers across the board (and from multiple previous administrations) because it would be perceived as some revenge tactic against the &quot;left&quot; if not bipartisan.</p>

<p>I do realize a conspiracy press conference could actually make matters worse, possibly putting him in more jeopardy, but what do we do? We seem to be in a position where an information offensive is necessary. It&#39;s obvious that our nation will be held in arrested development until we face the truth about our past. In your expertise, what should we do? Continue soft disclosure via the alternative media? Or step it up a few notches and just swallow the bad medicine in order to move forward? Thank you.</p>

The first, delivered via Certified Mail to both Judas Preibus and his love child Spicer, was trashed and not delivered to Donald Trump.  The second has been read by one million people including Trump and Bannon, and the latest word I have is that Trump is ignoring pleas that he sit down with Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney and me (to which we have added Jesse Ventura, I am trying to connect to Jesse and fly out to Mexico to have a face to face before I leave for Norway on the 14th of March).  The second link was also at ZeroHedge where it got over 180,000 views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I think we have two ETs, one good, one bad, and each has its own version of human &quot;straw bosses,&quot; and there is afight going on between those who want to pillage the Earth and those who want to help humanity reach its full potential (the one infinite resource we have is the brain power of the five billion poor we are repressing).</p>

<p>I believe there are at least 4 and probably 26 dimensions, and we are at the very beginning of understanding cosmic complexity across time and space.  I do not believe there is any computer than can replicate living (not just human) cerebral complexity, see this interesting quote: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2009/12/graphic-jim-bamford-on-the-human-brain/">http://phibetaiota.net/2009/12/graphic-jim-bamford-on-the-human-brain/</a></p>

If the truth is revealed to the public, they will want to see the arrests happen. If the truth is revealed, and no arrests happen, won&#39;t that totally diminish any trust that is left in our government? If no arrests happen, and the truth is not revealed, then what changes?

    <div class="md"><p>first thanks for answering our questions and taking your time
I usually don&#39;t ask questions or read amas no reddit anymore but this ama is really interesting,</p>

<p>i&#39;d like to ask this question:</p>

<p>what is the reason for most of the western countries becoming so strongly opposed to Turkeys government since 2012/2013 before 2013, they seemed to only have praise for Erdogan, what changed? Also what is their long term plan for Turkey, is it true that they want to create a Kurdistan with access to the mediterranean, black sea and caspian?</p>

<p>also is it true that the Saudi Royal Family has a jewish origin? a week ago there was a post on this subreddit about the movie taken is it true the saudi/emirati &quot;royals&quot; are involved in buying slaves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Mr. Steele, I&#39;m listening to a podcast and wanted to quote you as saying this about the Electoral Reform Act, which he states is how Trump could bring the country together and actually be the one person who truly represents all people. I really want people to hear this. What this act does, in his words (I&#39;m replaying it and typing out on mobile, forgive me if I miss anything, I&#39;m getting the gist):</p>

<p>Creates paper ballots, exit polls which keeps Democrats from stealing elections like they did to Bernie </p>

<p>Frees the members from their dependence on Israeli, Saudi and Wall Street money </p>

<p>Opens the way for Greens, Libertarians, Conservatives, all kinds in congress as opposed to the Two-Party tyranny, which is neither Conservative nor Liberal, it&#39;s simply criminal. </p>

<p>This also stops the violent American Spring, which certain entities are working towards, from happening. </p>

<p>Mr. Steele, please fill in or correct what I&#39;ve missed, and feel free to expand on anything. </p>

<p>You, sir, are an American hero and a treasure!!</p>

<p>Since the 1980 Global 2000 report, do you think the world has a depopulation agenda mixed with lad grabs to maintain planet resources? If so do you think the resource concerns legit, or a deceptive tactic to gain control of everything?</p>

<p>Do you think the Agenda 21/ The 2030 Agenda is a vision for a world government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Global 200 report was one of Jimmy Carter&#39;s greatest contributions. He is a good man who did what he could but now we are past the time of going along with the Deep State. I believe the time has come for all nations to expropriate all land and all mineral resources and deny the banks and corporations their continued impunity in stripping the world of its resources for their benefit.</p>

<p>There will be no world government. They over-played their hand with the housing bubble, and that started a dismantling of the Deep State and an awakening of the public.</p>

<p>The Saudis, like the CIA, are not monolithic.  There is some good visible in the younger princes.  The older leaders are pedophiles, sadistic homosexuals, and evil in every possible sense of the world. Saudi Arabia and Israel are the two greatest threats to world peace, not Russia and Iran. Anyone that does not get that is either stupid or a paid asset of one of the first countries.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s family was almost certainly being paid by CIA in some fashion. Obama was almost certainly born in the USA and then his citizenship given up by his parents when he moved to Indonesia. That may have been a cover that could be reversed by CIA, and Obama would also have had the right to reclaim his citizenship at the age of 18. In any event Obama, the Bushes, Clintons, everyone going back to JFK, all Deep State controlled.  Puppets.  Including Jmmy Carter who cried his heart out when he found out he was not really president, just a placeholder.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just Zionists, but over-lapping circles of criminal influence centered on the Rothschilds with the Zionists, the Vatican, various dictators including Saudi Arabia, selected organized crime familiies, selected banking executives, all able to ignore all forms of law and social responsibility.

<p>Yes. They would get fired.  The most common was stealing money from agents (as a 38 year old I was handling $100,000 a month without receipts) or cheating on their travel vouchers.  By and large CIA is a bureaucracy and most spies including myself are a joke because CIA is lazy and insists on working with official cover, meaning all of its case officers are easily identified to local liason within 30 days or arriving in-country.</p>

<p>Are you aware of any assassinations conducted by the CIA while you were there or after?</p>

<p>Me personally no, but we supported the White Hand in El Salvador that assassinated extreme leftists, and we have been helping dictators improve their secret police for decades.  CIA trained and armed ISIS with funding from Saudi Arabia, see <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/?s=ISIS+CIA">http://phibetaiota.net/?s=ISIS+CIA</a> and especially <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2016/01/robert-steele-the-virtual-caliphate-between-two-evils/">http://phibetaiota.net/2016/01/robert-steele-the-virtual-caliphate-between-two-evils/</a></p>

<p>Do you feel that there is any difference between the CIA and the various military intelligence services in terms of tactics, effectiveness, or ruthlessness etc?</p>

<p>Both are 90% clown shows with enormous waste, and 10% evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, as long as you’re not a bitch-ass limited hang-out or biased shillstain, thank you eternally from my entire being for your efforts and work, please don’t get me wrong, I’ve/we’ve been hurt before and now I cringe every time I hear someone that makes sense to me waiting to be dissappointed, maybe that’s the psy-op.  And whether or not you (or any of us) are correct, merely the effort at the legitimate search and communication of “the truth” is the highest, most noble living a human can attempt I believe.  So again HUGE THANKS, and to everyone really, with aforementioned caveats of course. ;)</p>

<p>Ill elaborate my question as a statement for your assessment and criticisms/advice.<br/>
Going with my own extrapolation of popular history of religion, I believe monotheism, which is a developmentally staged form of anarchism, was developed as a foil to undermine rulers and kings (alternate meanings for the generic word “god”/<em>malach</em> in hebrew, “father” being another) and eventually to undermine classes so that people could have the dignity and courage to stand up for themselves, but ironically, and yet as prophesized by monotheistic scripture itself, the very same “rulers ” <em>who desire to be the god of humanity on earth</em>  would seek to deceive them using base primitive desires (back-sliding into idol/alpha-ape worship) to lead them to hell (suffering) and darkness (ignorance).  If you realize that even though scripture constantly states there is nothing likened to the “god of the universe,”  god is mentioned in direct equivalence as “the light” which also had multiple meanings, one of them being knowledge or <em>information</em>,. as well the god of the universe is referred to in scripture as “<em>the</em> truth” and “<em>the</em> reality,” truly the only thing(s) that are deserving of submission to by humanity, whereas a <em>beast</em> submits to it’s primitive desires.  </p>

<p>For the Hebrews, the original monotheistic “people of the book (the record-keepers),” it was pharaoh who was “the devil” that undermined the scripture by raising ranks among the corrupt power hungry Hebrew scholars (reading and writing was uncommon amongst ancient peoples) to subjugate the rest using their own primitive inclinations towards idol/alpha worship, thus enslaving them all and <em>fooling</em> them into building an empire, not to mention suffering and despair.</p>

<p>For the Christians, it was caesar that coopted “the word” using terror, torture and false gospels (saul of tarsus/st.paul) and placed a “man” in the place of god(sound familiar?).  then the trinity “father”(king in heaven/dead king), “son”(natural heir) and spirit (dna) for the purpose of predictive programming acceptance of royal bloodlines in order to secure control of <em>the world</em> for one’s own dna, truly basic bitches.</p>

<p>And for islam its, any longbeard in drag with the <em>right</em> collection of hadiths and/or sunna (a 300 year old game of telephone/hearsay and 1000 years of record and analysis) tucked under their sweaty armpit in order to take the merits away from critical thought and analysis and give it to some tribal gang leader as middle eastern culture is amongst the most tribalist and conservative.  The qu’ran (“the recitation, the reading” in arabic) is, as it stated itself, “the only source for islam(submission to the will of god/”the light/the reality, the truth”).</p>

<p>The reason paganism and polytheism are considered evil in monotheism is because one purports that humanity is nothing more than an advanced beast and the culture, rituals and rites are programmed accordingly, and the other implies and programs the mind to perceive the daily and vital phenomena people perceive as disconnected and in historic and eternal conflict/”war,” thus fooling people into feeling disconnected from one another and reality so as to convince them to accept conflict, thus mediating authority figures, and fairy tales, thus supernatural magicians and sages as reasonable.  Satanism(rulership over humanity) is a mixture of these two psychological operations.</p>

<p>Until people can be courageous enough to decode all the meta-parentalism and take personal responsibility for their own beliefs and actions, firstly they will never be able to live free, to be themselves, and secondly… who cares about secondly.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t bother to answer, Thanks again, really </p>

<p>I believe that NSA needs to be eliminated (along with the NRO and NGA, and ODNI). CIA needs to be cut in half and then expanded with a division for signals, another for imagery, and two centers, one for all-source process and one for all-source analysis.  An open source agency (what I want to do for the next 20 years) keeps everyone honest and informed. I totally believe in blockchain and other solutions that cannot be hacked (I wrote the first letter to the White House in 1994 on cyber-vulnerability) but blockchain evidently has scaling issues and no one is committed as I am to a world brain that connects everyone to all data in all forms with absolute anonymity, privacy, rights, and security.  I will happen.  NSA is a dinosaur.  They only process 1% of what they collect and they are a cancer on the US polity.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the best Twitter alternative for dissidents? Reddit alternative? Public charity? Credit union?</p>

<p>Face to face.</p>

<p>If the Pacific Northwest peacefully votes to secede from the US, would you oppose a military occupation of the PNW by the US?</p>

<p>No.  I strongly support secessionst movements including those of Quebec and Scotland.  The United STATES of America is now a fascist imperium.  Time to either make it right or break it up.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve stated that you support a &quot;truth and reconciliation&quot; approach to rooting out organized crime syndicates among elites (e.g. Saudi slaves, Bush cocaine, Pedogate). &#39;Decrease resistance to reform by giving your enemies a way out&#39;.

To what extent is this true? What should happen to all the sadistic psychopaths that have packed the ranks of the rich and powerful? Mental hospitals?</p>

<p>I support decriminalization of no harm to others behavior. I support culling the heard of deviants, but only after we first carry out a truth &amp; reconciliation program.  I support selective euthenasia for specific psychopaths - the problem is that our government is psychopathic and our universities are socio-pathic and a major vehicle for creating mental disorders (am a fan of Jon Rappoport).  Every institution has failed.  See this starting point: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2008/10/2008-paradigms-of-failure-election-2008-lipstick-on-the-pig-full-text-online-for-google-translate/">http://phibetaiota.net/2008/10/2008-paradigms-of-failure-election-2008-lipstick-on-the-pig-full-text-online-for-google-translate/</a></p>

<p>What US legislators are most vulnerable to political pressure calling for an audit of the CIA and Pentagon?</p>

<p>All of them.  Wayne Madsen&#39;s piece on McCain and Graham (a closet gay) is representative: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2017/01/wayne-madsen-cia-interference-in-us-election-is-without-precedent/">http://phibetaiota.net/2017/01/wayne-madsen-cia-interference-in-us-election-is-without-precedent/</a></p>

<p>What can a Bernie Sanders (anti-Soros) leftist in the US do to start a sustainable American Spring occupation in their city?</p>

<p>Bernie is fraud, his movement is not. An Electoral Reform Act would bring the Sandernistas together with the Tea Party and the small parties (e.g. Constitution, Green, Libertarian, Working Families) and Independents to end all parties and establish extreme democracy.  Part of the problem is that too many Sandernistas and liberals are stupid ignorant and too many conservative christians are stupid God will provide. We need a middle where we take responsibility for evidence-based self-governance.</p>

<p>What was the most unethical thing you ever did while working for the USG? Are you a pacifist? If not, under what circumstances would you murder a fellow human?</p>

<p>Participated in a regime change operation and managed a  false flag operation without questioning either.  I am not a pacifist; I have designed a US military with 450 ships, a long haul Air Force and a three million soldier armored Army that can smash any peer competitor, but I also understand the irrelevance of the military to nine of the ten high level threats to humanity.  We have a stupid out of control government that does not govern, it just taxes the wrong people and spends on the wrong things.  At this point in my life I would rather die than kill someone else, but I have absolutely no problem shooting an out of control human about to kill someone else.</p>

<p>What warm countries are best for reluctant American ex-pats?</p>

<p>Mexico in the Yukatan, Ecuador Pacific Coast, Thailand coast, etc.</p>

If it were me and I had real money in the stock market, I would get out completely before 1 May.

Everything the USA makes is 50% waste.  I guess if I had to pull out completely, I would look to taking my money to invest in India and China and Russia and maybe Iran and Turkey.  These are the powerhouses of the future, the USA has lost its integrity.  Now having said that, if I can get Trump to listen, I would just as soon save us and stabilize us.</p>

There&#39;s his oversight, which works in those area of operations. And then here&#39;s the head, like department head or something near that.

<p>Has the CIA taken the place of the mafia of old? For example fast and furious and drug smuggling ops are regularly discovered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>VERY compartmentalized in one sense, and very open in another.</p>

<p>No.  CIA is simply legalized crime on behalf of the White House, Wall Street, Saudi Arabia, the Vatican, the Zionists -- they work for everyone EXCEPT the American public.</p>

<p>War is a profit center that also produces children for pedophiles and organs for marketing.</p>

<p>The Clintons were entirely created by CIA.  Bill Clinton, like Barack Obama, has been a Deep State president installed to screw the 99% for the 1%, at the direction of Wall Street.</p>

<p>I am in an odd position.  I welcome death -- am worth more dead than alive now -- but I believe that my deep integrity combined with the realization by many that I actually represent what is best for the secret world, the US Goverment, the US public, and indeed global civilization, is a &quot;grace&quot; of its own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Mr. Steele, </p>

<p>First off, thank you for service and joining us for an AMA. I am sure that you have some of the most unique perspectives into the military operations of the nation. </p>

<p>I am currently in my senior year at college, and I&#39;m working on a research project into the Invention Secrecy Act. I was wondering if you could answer a question of mine and then maybe elaborate more on how classification or special access programs that may have &quot;free energy&quot; technologies. </p>

<p>Question: To your knowledge, would it be theoretically possible for the existence of &quot;free energy technologies&quot; to be completely suppressed from the public? </p>

<p>I am an Environmental studies student and I believe that there is the possibility to &#39;save the planet&#39; with a new energy source, but I realize the destabilizing effect that this may have on governments. I would love to have any insights into the influences of companies like Lockheed into protecting certain technology. </p>

<p>My grandfather was a marine that fought on Guadalcanal. I know men are a rare breed, I look forward to your response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arugah!  I honor your Dad!  Uncommon valor was a common virtue.  I just weep for the fact that most of  our soldiers die for criminal purposes set forth by the elite.  Most do not know that Wall Street and the City of London funded Hitler -- without their support there would have been no WWII (or Civil War or other wars for that matter) and most do not know that we commited eight separate acts of war against Japan to force them into attacking Pearl Harbor.  The perfidy was all ours.</p>

<p>Short answer is yet.  Study the concept of Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE), not the same as free energy but there is a lot going on that is repressed by the elite and that needs to be freed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish you guys and gals would call me Robert.</p>

<p>Trump did not expect to win. He knew from the moment he won (3 am the morning after election day, his odds until midnight were 20% per Cambridge Analytical, 20-1 at best 200-1 at worst from bookmaker -- the house never loses) that he had inherited a shit storm and was slated for death.  My take on all this, still the best available with 50 linked endnotes, is here: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2016/11/robert-steele-the-accidental-president-will-he-resign-the-closed-system-is-still-rigged-and-likely-to-remain-so/">http://phibetaiota.net/2016/11/robert-steele-the-accidental-president-will-he-resign-the-closed-system-is-still-rigged-and-likely-to-remain-so/</a></p>

<p>Trump had to deal immediately with two big problems: first, to &quot;settle&quot; the Deep State, Wall Street, and the Rothschilds as well as the military-industrial and intelligence complexes so he could live to see Inauguration Day (many of us were worried that he would resign and leave the mess to Pence  who is a Deep Stater); and second to start being presidential in a domain completely foreign to him.</p>

<p>He had to pick someone like Judas Preibus as a sop to the Republican Party that hates him and fought him tooth and nail.  He had to pick some of the people like Rick Perry (probably the dumbest Governor on the planet after Gary Johnson) to settle that side of the house.  He made many mistakes. He did not reach out to the 73% that did not vote for him.  He did not reach out to folks like David Stockman that could have helped him form a government, he did realize the everyone around was blocking attempts by people like me (since July 2015 -- my first article for him was in CounterPunch in August 2015) to help him.</p>

<p>He also seriously mis-calculated in offering so many posts to billionaires who are either dropping out because they rightfully will not destroy their fortures for what are essentially shit jobs or wrongfully cannot stand scrutiny, and he has let folks like Judas Preibus roll him -- the guy Preibus put in charge of Presidential personnel is salting Establishment moles into the process and Sean Spicer is simply not up to the job.</p>

<p>In my view, Bannon is a keeper, everyone else including McMaster (a NeverTrumper without a clue on any threat not named Russia or Iran) need to go.  Trump, in my humble opinion, needs to make nine decisions and announce them all at once and do so before 1 April 2017.  The nine decision are at <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/robert-steele-memorandum-for-the-president-warning-on-american-spring-riots-eight-actions-to-make-america-great-again/">http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/robert-steele-memorandum-for-the-president-warning-on-american-spring-riots-eight-actions-to-make-america-great-again/</a></p>

The would have four fewer Representatives in Congress if the districts were allocated only on US citizens instead of all including illegal aliens and foreigners in country legitimately.  Hollywood is like  a gun -- it matters who pulls the trigger.

<p>Donald Trump is GIFTED at barn-storming.  He is NOT gifted at dealing with Congress and he is NOT gifted at diversity.  I offer to solve both those problems by combining the Electoral Reform Act (I often stress that I aggregate ideas from others, these are not my original ideas) with a diversity team that includes Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Jesse Venture, me and a few others), and 50 states in 30 days.  I would like to jam this up Paul Ryan&#39;s ass and break it off -- make add some little gerbil claws to the pointy part that goes in first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promised Fly I would try to answer every question, including those from village idiots, so here goes.</p>

<p>How is lobbying the current administration for a job, repeatedly, and peddling books on YouTube channels, count as being an &quot;electoral and intelligence reformer&quot;?</p>

<p>I respectfully suggest you read the Nobel Peace Prize nomination that the Norwegian supporters guided me in preparing.  You will find it at <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com">http://robertdavidsteele.com</a> as the last entry that begins with the article that recommended me.  If that  does not do it for you I cannot help you.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t reformed anything. You&#39;re just saying things, directing people to your websites/media, and know a couple of long- irrelevant spooks.</p>

<p>Evidently you have no life beyond Reddit.  Consider drinking yourself to death. All of my life&#39;s work is at <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com">http://robertdavidsteele.com</a> which you obviously have not looked at.  I don&#39;t do comic books, so sorry, I think you are better off finding another Reddit threat to monitor.</p>

<p>Why not affect change while you were already in the belly of beast?</p>

<p>Had you ever worked in the belly of the beast you would know that change has to come from outside. Had I stayed in, sacrificing my integrity, I would probably be an agency head today, a  world  class drunk, with nothing to offer the world going forward.</p>

<p>Suppose things are different now. You were biding your time maybe, right..</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#39;s accidental election changes everything.</p>

<p>You folks are a dime-a-dozen nowadays and I&#39;ll not afford you automatic credibility.</p>

<p>I personally do not give a shit about you or anything you think.  I am honored to do a Reddit AMA (my second, but you would not know that since you have the attention span of an elderly gerbil).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, sir, but Nobel nominees ought not call people drunken village gerbils.</p>

<p>If you cannot responsibly handle very mild criticism, it seriously detracts from your overall objective here. You sounded like an angry teenager just then. </p>

<p>You are on a conspiracy sub, as a former CIA operative. I have no idea why you&#39;d think it would be a breeze here. If anything, the other users are to blame more than yourself. If you think about it, even yourself could understand a certain level of cynicism regarding both your history, and current intentions.</p>

<p>Overall, I just think you&#39;re laying it on a bit thick with your websites, books, and other <em>stuff</em>. Answer the questions. If people are interested, they&#39;ll seek you out.</p>

<p>Good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was beyond mild criticism, that was dismissal. </p>

<p>You realize a lot of his stuff is available for free, right? Moreover, it&#39;s really, really easy to never hear about people like Steele if you&#39;re plugged into mainstream sources. Forwarding people to the domains where you store your work is the sensible thing to do if that&#39;s the whole reason you put it there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one here should be solely plugged into mainstream sources, so that&#39;s moot. Whether his media is free or not, his exposure is worth something (at least to him). I have no problem with that-- but answer the questions in concise way, rather than shoeing people off to his <em>stuff</em> automatically. We have enough people peddling their shit on reddit, this sub should have higher standards.</p>

<p>Besides, doesn&#39;t it strike you as odd that a former CIA agent, who&#39;s plugged into very important subjects, got rattled almost immediately and pulled my criticism (admittedly somewhat provocative) into child-like territory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No one here should be solely plugged into mainstream sources, so that&#39;s irrelevant.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between &quot;should be&quot; and &quot;is,&quot; so it&#39;s not irrelevant, but we don&#39;t have to argue about that. </p>

<p>If I had already written extensively on something, I would certainly forward people to where I&#39;ve published it instead of repeating it, knowing that I don&#39;t have the time, space, or energy to do my work twice to appease one Redditor, but that&#39;s just me. I&#39;m sure Steele is ten times busier than I am.</p>

<p>Honestly, it doesn&#39;t strike me as odd that he responded to you that way because what you said wasn&#39;t so innocent. You lumped him in with others, calling him &quot;a dime-a-dozen.&quot; Even if you have valid points to raise, the tone of your comment was, &quot;I doubt your credibility and am not impressed,&quot; that started off with a subtle accusation of ulterior motive. If I had my doubts and wanted to bring them to his attention, I definitely would have been more careful in my phrasing. You probably came off sounding like countless fools he&#39;s dealt with before, even if you aren&#39;t a fool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very helpful question and wins a copy of INTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH or the oldie but goodie NEW CRAFT OF INTELLIGENCE if you send me your mailing address.</p>

<p>Normally the two-party tyranny would refuse to consider an Electoral Reform Act. Electoral reform legislation has been introduced nine times according to Richard Winger of Ballot Access News, the last four times by Ron Paul. Each time, slammed into the dust.</p>

<p>WHAT IS DIFFERENT NOW is the combination of Donald Trump as  the accidental president, and the awareness of the 27% that voted for him that the Republican Party is as much his enemy as is the Democratic Party, combined with the awareness of the Sandernistas that they were fucked by the DNC and Hillary Clinton combined with a whole bunch of other increased awareness moments for everyone else</p>

<p>COMBINED WITH -- if Trump embraces my ideas and sits down with Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney, Jesse Ventura, and me -- a 50 state in 30 day barn-storming tour in which we mobilize the 15% who are nominally members of the Republican and Democratic parties and the 70% who are not members of either, and literally storm the Members home offices -- Occupy -- until the act is passed.  My intent is to have him introduce the Act by the end of this month and barn-storm the country in March and April, among other things this immediately stops dead the violent &quot;American Spring&quot; that George Soros and others are funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best of luck getting the presidents ear, I think a lot of your ideas are great, but I&#39;m just very skeptical about a couple of people being able to change Washington. It&#39;s quite a tide to fight against. Yeah, understatement of the century, I guess.</p>

<p>How dirty is Pence, do you think? I know he was there to make the establishment GOP happy, and I  think the reason congress is doing NOTHING is because they are hoping to impeach Trump and put in Pence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think would be the most powerful and decisive way to destroy the faux credibility of the &quot;fake news,&quot; especially CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Hill, etc.?</p>

<p>It seriously pains me to see so many people that I went to school with that were reasonably intelligent regurgitating the most meaningless, intellectually dishonest, baseless propaganda hook, line, and sinker. They think that the surface-level, symbolic representations of the world served on a platter by MSM (and their respective universities of choice) are the world itself and the absolute insanity of it is threatening my own sanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Donald Trump would allow me the honor and privilege of creating the Trump Channel and the Open Source Agency, I would bury the MSM as well as the secret intelligence community within 90 days.  It is not hard.  It just takes integrity, my unique blend of lifetime knowledge that CIA and others have been repressing for 30 years, and the support of the President.  It will be harder without his support.  I cannot articulate more emphatically my hope that he will talk to me before 1 April; and ideally before I leave for Norway on the 14th.</p>

<p>A lot of websites like TruthDig and the Real News Network use it for managing their public comments and some of my friends have even used it to create their own comment board websites.

The guy in the Florida airport was probably supposed to die on the spot, he actually walked into the FBI claiming he was being driven to violence by a mind-control program, and the morons did not take him seriously -- a priceless opportunity to humanely systematically debrief an alleged victim of CIA (or other -- the paramilities are doing this now also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was busy announcing - on line - that I had a solution to end war globally, well over a decade ago, the CNN crawl line on my local TV advertised a job that I knew was catered to me - in China or in Hong Kong. I forget where. It was a headhunter&#39;s ad. </p>

<p>I was really impressed that, 1) I would be anonymously offered a job, and 2) they hacked into the CNN crawl in order to do it. Who does that? The CIA? The State Department? Upper CNN management? God only knows. To this day I never have figured it out. It could have been a lot of different players. I suspect it was the FBI, CIA or someone in China. But is also could have been MI6 or even Mossad. One thing was for sure, I was NOT interested in the job. </p>

<p>But I was very interested in who would hack into the CNN crawl line in order to offer it to me. That was something I had never,ever seen or heard of before. </p>

<p>Have you looked into the history of how the Americans treat the native Mexican population in California? How about the Doctrine of Discovery? I have a big problem with people like you (white guys) who think Mexican Americans need to be driven out of this country where they have been forever - repeatedly. What is it about you white guys? No seriously, what is it? Why are you against people who live here becoming citizens and voting? </p>

<p>PS, I&#39;m a Californian born and raised. My family arrived in California in 1858. I&#39;m white. Not one Native American tribe that I am aware of ever gave my ancestors permission to come here. If you have a copy of that document, I&#39;d really like to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is negotiable and can also be phased in.  The priorities for right away including redrawn districts counting only citizens (this would lower California seats by four), public funding of campaigns and an end to all lobbyists and political fund-raising, and paper ballots with on site public counting and exit polls which Trump needs or he will lose the House in 2018 and be impeached.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the twelve fixes are a starting point for a national conversation, perhaps with Joan Blades Living Room Conversations as a hub, and not intended to be a take it or leave slate.</p>

<p>The root point is that no issue will get an honest hearing in the US Government (or any state government) as we are organized today.  Electoral Reform is &quot;root.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. My thirty years of parenting has been dedicated to building diverse groups of families that are willing to &quot;group-school.&quot; We have everything from engineers, nurses, farmers, chemists, historians, welders, musicians, candle makers, etc and our kids have become (in my opinion,) incredible thinkers. They know how to farm, they speak several languages, play instruments, can interact naturally with people of all ages and demographics, are well traveled, are good stewards of the planet and are incredibly sceptical of social media. They aren&#39;t all genius by any means, but I can&#39;t help but believe that they are &quot;brighter&quot; than they would&#39;ve been if they had been cattle herded through the conventional system. The weird part is they are ostracized by both sides of the aisle, the left accusing them of being right wing bible thumpers, the right accusing them of being new age hippies. Now we are suddenly &quot;alt-right&quot;. None applies, but it troubles me that so many are afraid of the possibility that they could educate their children possibly better than the current system can.</p>

<p>Dunno. I thought things would be better by now. I&#39;m not sure how you keep up the steam.</p>

<p>Another question, do you think Jimmy Carter being nominated by the dems was a plot to scoop up the votes of the bible belt or was it an orchestrated move by both sides to create a 50/50 division? I&#39;m amazed at how the Republican party suddenly (in my lifetime, lol.) became the Christian party, yet the Dems created this phenomenon. </p>

 (1)  With that being said do you believe it is in our human nature to have a hunger for power. Or is that a sign of a more sinister nature? Reptilian, evil, Satan, or whatever you may choose to call it? 
(2) And whether it&#39;s human nature or something else what is to stop another cabal from rising to power after the deep state is dethroned? No matter what measures could be set in place it seems evil would always find a way unless it&#39;s irradicated and eliminated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FINALLY.  The question I have been waiting for!</p>

<p>First off, I joined the Marine Corps out of grad school (this is almost never done) because I thought I had become too intellectual and wanted to reconnect with my physical side.  It worked, I was a rock, but I was also bored in garrison in peacetime.  A small CIA ad in Stars &amp; Stripes while I was in Okinawa got my attention, I applied, I was their ideal candidate: lives overseas all my life, graduate degree with a thesis on predicting revolution, infantry officer skills.  One out of 20,000 gets in and I continue to recommend CIA -- as fucked up as it is -- to anyone who can get accepted.  One day I would like to make them 1000 times more effective which will not be hard, they are in the shits now.</p>

<p>Second, spying is like being a cop.  90% boredom and 10% sheer terror. I cannot count the hours I spent in seedy hotel room waiting for an agent to show up, or the hours I spent typing up reports (typing is the most important skill in spying, after listening). Worst is when you have to type up the transcript of your meeting with a terrorists,  this take a LONG TIME.</p>

<p>In theory spies are there to get the information that cannot be gotten any other way. They spot, assess, recruit, handle, and sometime terminate (release with a bonus and good will) agents who agree to betray their country for money or other incentives. Rarely do we blackmail.  Rarely do we do anything useful. CIA made a decision a while back to stop doing unilateral spying and rely heavily on receiving information from other national intelligence services, to the point that CIA today has no bench -- no unilateral assets of note and certainly none not already known to the host country service.</p>

<p>Spying is mostly about paying for information, and trying to get at information that is not openly available.  It is actually dysfunctional. A typical US diplomat gets enough money for one reception a quarter and a few lunches. Spies, no matter how junior, have unlimited funding (one of the ways they are easily identified). CIA has refused to be serious about open sources of information, and it shocked the hell out of them when I got the DDCI Bill Studeman to agree with me that we should have a conference on the topic in 1992.  Bottom line is that CIA is not doing what it is supposed to.</p>

<p>Come back with follow-ups, I do not want to run on.  But here are a couple of links:</p>

<p>CIA is the runt of the litter.  NSA is the big dog that costs too much and blackmails politicians.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Important question.  My awakening came AFTER I left CIA. Like being a Jesuit priest, you simply do not question the sacred perfection of what you are a part of.  It was when I created the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, and top secret access to everything and one PC in the corner hooked to the Internet, that I was shocked to see the analysts lined up for the PC.  That is when I discovered (for the first time in my life I was responsible for producing intelligence about the whole world, not just collecting in a narrow lane) that the CIA and the secret world know nothing about most of the world.  There is literally nothing in the secret databases about Burundi, Haiti, Somalia, etcetera.  That was the beginning of the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) revolution.  Here are two links, the first is about how I beat the crap out of the entire IC for the benchmark exercise on Burundi for the Aspin-Brown Commission, the second is my Danish briefing in April 2016 indicting the CIA and others for crapping all over OSINT for 30 years -- they are TERRIFIED of my getting an Open Source Agency, it will not only provide the 96% of the decision support that the President and Cabinet need (which can be shared with the public) but it will justify a two thirds cut of the entire secret intelligence budget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To what extent were you an ignorant recruit? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was an ignorant recruit who believed then and believe now in the mission of the CIA in the ideal. I had no idea how many depraved aspects there were to the CIA (torture, drone assassination, running drugs, money laundering, blackmailing our own politicians, etc).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever regretted becoming involved as an agent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are OFFICERS, not agents.  Agents commit treason.  Case Officers or Operations Officers spot, assess, recruit, handle, and gracefully terminate (severance pay with good will) agents. I have NEVER regretted my time with the CIA, my only regret is that so many senior officers at CIA are totally lacking in integrity.</p>

Sorry analysts are lining up for your personal computer in the corner?<br/>
Also concerning holes in the databases, perhaps a deliberate effort? On some level there must be the &#39;secret databases&#39; but then also this other data in the hands of... mafia elements. You can&#39;t trade on the black market without intelligence on some level. Who&#39;s got the phone number for the contractor who moves a plane full of cocaine?
If the alphabets don&#39;t have the data, wtf are they doing with our money?<br/>
That&#39;s classified, I suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  A top secret system is locked off from the Interent.  This was the one PC with access to the Internet -- back then in 1988, that was &quot;The Source.&quot;</p>

<p>The databases are shit.  I have written about this a lot.  The center of gravity for intelligence is knowing who knows about being able to ask  them.</p>

<p>REAL WORLD STORY: US Southern Command wanted a forecast on the Nicaraguan economy. CIA was as usual in the shits and worthless.  Booze Allen wanted $250K.  When asked, I said I could do it on the fly for $250.  They did not believe me but agreed. I had the email of the recently retired Governor of the Bank of Nicaragua now a green card holder in Minnesota or someplace.  I sent him an email and promised a check, overnight he sat down and wrote a four page summary of the current state and future forecast and emailed it back. Best $250 the US Government ever spent.  I can do that over and over on every topic every day.</p>

Trump talks platitudes, if he were serious he would be demanding the electoral reform act, diversifying his team, and barn-storming the country in March and April.  He is not serious (yet).</p>

<p>Positive: scoring an EARS ONLY for President Reagan listing the specific Senators and Congressmen known to be working for an enemy country as obtained through an overseas operation I was responsible for.</p>

<p>Negative: When my petty little boss in Central American Task Force told me to go down the hall and &quot;case officer&quot; another government employee, meaning I was to lied cheat and steal inside our own agency to get him what he wanted.  That was the end of my social contract with CIA. A few weeks later the Marine Corps asked me to resign and come create the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity and I was glad to pull the plug.</p>

<p>I care deeply about CIA in its ideal incarnation -- I did not know then what I know now about CIA as a Wall Street creature doing great evil, but in principle,  the Republic NEEDS CIA and I would like to first create an Open Source Agency and then help create a much reduced secret intelligence and counterintelligence community that actually serves the public interest.</p>

<p>I had never known of this category -- even more sensitive than EYES ONLY and this is the only instance I know of its use.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Robert, very interested in your work and you seem to be fighting the good fight! </p>

<p>Though I&#39;m iffy about your suggestion for Trump to start his own &quot;Trump Channel&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t this be widely seen as a Trump propaganda network, and be painted as an act of an authoritarian creating his own loyal, state controlled media?</p>

<p>Also, what is your take on Trump&#39;s allegation of the Obama Admibistration tapping Trump Tower? I just find it odd that he didn&#39;t supplement these tweets with any further evidence or announcements. My theory is that this is a tactical choice, where he purposely leads the media into a trap where they vehemently argue that this is a nonsense claim, and then makes them look foolish and transparently partisan when he later backs this up in much more detail. Is this a reasonable assumption, or is there some other inside info you could give us that helps shed light on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>

<p>Another question, if you don&#39;t mind:</p>

<p>I recently saw some videos that displayed the disturbing potential of technologies which can be used in order to convincingly manipulate video + audio of people being interviewed. As in, being able to create a realistic &quot;puppet&quot; version of a public figure, and them inserting the desired manipulations in order to make it appear that the target is saying something that they didn&#39;t actually say. I&#39;ve seen speculation that this was used to manipulate the Assange/Pilger interview, though I&#39;m not sure about the accuracy of this assertion.</p>

<p>My fear is that this technology can be used in order to create false evidence of Trump making statements that he in fact did not make (some have also speculated that this was used to create Trump&#39;s &quot;locker room&quot; comments). I fear that they will be able to basically weaponize this in order to release phony &quot;leaks&quot; of Trump conversations that can be used as &quot;evidence&quot; of him conspiring with Russian officials.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m curious, do have any info about these technologies, or if they have already been employed to create fabricated audio/video leaks of any significance? I fear the power that&#39;s inherant in this, as it could literally be used to create false evidence that leads to Trump&#39;s impeachment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, thinking about that gives me shivers. I have heard you mention this as a serious possibility before, and I&#39;ll admit, during his speech to Congress I was thinking about the possibility of his speaking capabilities basically turning to mush right in front of us. </p>

<p>Are directed electronic weapons also a serious possibility, or do you think there are more viable ways for trump to shield himself from that? I can see how drugs would be the most effective option though. It&#39;s just quite amazing how vulnerable he could be, while ostensibly being one of the most well-protected men in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was threatened with assassination by the Colonels in charge of the country we were supporting (I was responsible for penetrating the extreme left, they thought I was a sympathizer), and I was learning about the rapes, assassinations, extortions and more these Colonels were carrying out on behalf of the wealth families repressing the public, I had doubts.</p>

<p>My real awakening came when I got into heavy non-fiction reading, including these 300 books about intelligence: <a href="http://www.phibetaiota.net/2011/08/worth-a-look-book-reviews-on-intelligence-lack-of/">http://www.phibetaiota.net/2011/08/worth-a-look-book-reviews-on-intelligence-lack-of/</a></p>

<p>Later I was deeply impressed by books about empire, war is a racket, etcetera, and over time -- after leaving the CIA while spending 20 years evangelizing for open source intelligence -- understanding the deep corruption of everything about how our government commerce and society are managed, that I began to understand that CIA was a fraud, the military was a fraud, the  two-party tyranny is a fraud, and ultimately -- this most strongly in 2014 -- electoral reform is root.</p>

<p>Here are my many lists of reviews -- you could usefully spend a long time here reading summaries of important books -- over 2000 of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The critical point I try to make is that no government, no bank, no corporation, no secret agency is &quot;monolithic.&quot;  They have different pieces.  Here for example is something I wrote about CIA: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2012/11/search-seven-cias/">http://phibetaiota.net/2012/11/search-seven-cias/</a></p>

<p>This is really about hand-picked individuals within each agency, especially CIA and Treasury.</p>

<p>War is a profit center. There is absolutely no reason for us to have gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq -- peace is vastly cheaper to assure and the profits from peace vastly greater BUT the profits from war are concentrated for the banks while the profits from peace are evenly distributed among all.</p>

<p>What has been missing, which I have conceptualized standing on the shoulders of many others, is an Open Source Agency that makes possible holistic analytics, true cost economics, and Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE) such that we create a prosperous world at peace -- I explictly forecast that we can accomplish all seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals within 20 years at 20% of the current industrial paradigm.</p>

<p>This is all about awakening the public and doing counterintelligence against all traitors, mostly domestic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robert, thank you for answering our questions. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of confusion, both on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and within the public at large, as to who exactly is on what team in this Deep State war, and what exactly organizations like the CIA (or even the MSM) are trying to accomplish. I find that most people can&#39;t even confidently identify who opposes/props up the DS and what other groups/parties in Washington feel about it, privately or publicly. Could you give us an outline, as you see it, as to who the major players are in this and what their goals are, at least ostensibly? I think this would be invaluable as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moves forward with their scrutiny of the US govt. Again, thanks for your time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the confusion comes when people fail to see the big three levels of which the Deep State is the lowest. I cannot claim to be an expert on the Deep State but I admire the book by Peter Dale Scott, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/review-guest-the-american-deep-state-wall-street-big-oil-and-the-attack-on-us-democracy/">http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/review-guest-the-american-deep-state-wall-street-big-oil-and-the-attack-on-us-democracy/</a> and also the work of Mike Lofgren who focuses on our prostitutes in Congress, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/?s=Mike+Lofgren">http://phibetaiota.net/?s=Mike+Lofgren</a> -- reading Lofgren and Assange, I am convinced the Republican Party is toast, which is one reason I feel so strongly that Donald Trump needs an Electoral Reform Act.</p>

<p>Within each agency, there are over-lapping slices of the Deep State -- the pedophile/Vatican slice, the Zionist/neo-con slice, the Saudi Arabian slice, the Nazi slice (often collaborating with the Zionist/neo-coni slice), and others.</p>

<p>Everything is constantly shifting.  What never shifts is the fact that the US Constitution is worthless today, every one of our institutions have failed, and We the People are screwed. Donald Trump has the power to change all this, but only if he diversifies.</p>

<p>The highest level is the Rothchilds and the blend of the UK Royal Family and City of London modern face of the old East India Company along with the Vatican and the Dragons in China (the good guys, ripped off by the other two for 300 years, that is about to change).</p>

<p>The next level is Wall Street and the City of London and a mix of non-traditional financial centers -- they are the grease between the Masters of the Universe and the Deep State.</p>

<p>Beneath them are a wide variety of institutions from the media to universities to Hollywood to labor leaders and local dignitaries who are all complicit in the general meme of screw the public as long as I get mine.  Charles Hugh Smith has a nice diagram at ZeroHedge, <a href="https://tyrannyrising.com/does-a-rogue-deep-state-have-trumps-back-2/">https://tyrannyrising.com/does-a-rogue-deep-state-have-trumps-back-2/</a></p>

<p>The Deep State is the unelected hand-picked officials from generation to generation who violate the Constitution with impunty and believe that transient polititians (who are one step up from whores and in many cases actual traitors to the Republic) are irrelevant to policy. They work  for different masters, and consider the USGovernment their personal piggy bank and the US public expendible farm animals.</p>

The word is going to be out to let the hired and stupid destroy whatever they turn their attention to.  The 1% are willing to pay any price in OUR blood and property, to drive Trump from office.</p>

<p>A legitimate passport from the right country -- along with the language and cultural skills and skin color that most CIA spies lack -- provides access to the best fishing holes in the world</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How was your production measured?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from recruitments (most case officers in my regional division recruited at best one a year, I nailed five a year every year I was out), what we called Foreign Intelligence Report -- actually intelligence reports considered worthy of disseminating to those authorized to see them -- also five times the regional average.  One fitness report said that among the ten case officers in the Station, I was producing one third of the recruitments and one third of the report -- the other nine, together, were producing the other two thirds.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been 20 years, pay rates have probably changed, back in the day it was anywhere from $250 to $1000 a month at my level of agent, for Ministers and others more senior it was probably closer to $10-20K a month.</p>

<p>In theory we are supposed to methodically find the best possible access to the highest priority target, and then devise a means of meeting and then recruiting exactly the right person. In reality we throw money up in the air and whoever grabs at one of the bills is immediately recruited.  It&#39;s all largely worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heck yeah!  I&#39;ll take eradicating &quot;open&quot; with criminal intent ANY day.  You are absolutely correct about the bribes and the non-questioned narrative (which thanks to people like you, is being increasingly questioned.) </p>

<p>You stress the importance of getting competent people elected.  Corruption aside, the complacency and ignorance exhibited by many in Congress is absolutely appalling - and an extremely attractive avenue for the Soros-ilk to make inroads.  I was shocked to learn that Civil Society, via the OGP, is our Congressional Research Service - Really?!  Nothing biased about THAT!  How many Congressional members realize this or even care?  How many realize that the four or five testimonies in a Congressional hearing are all related to/funded by the same source(s?)  I&#39;ve been researching this in detail, and it&#39;s rampant - in fact, it&#39;s the norm. They do the same thing to get favorable agency decisions.  They are very strategically shaping legislation and policy changes over time - which not only places the laws and regulations on their side, it also effectively removes competition.  For example, they want to market a new type of solar tech.  They fund three or four different solar tech studies (which all, predictably, support their desired outcome,) and they get &quot;the green light.&quot;  Before most manufacturers are even aware of the new standards, etc, the &quot;inside track&quot; group is already shipping their solar panels to customers.  It&#39;s disgusting! 
So, yes, the lobbyists, the bribes, the ignorance - We HAVE to stop this, or their takeover will be complete - and the majority of Americans will have NO idea it has even taken place.</p>

<p>The crimes against humanity that we are responsible for -- the 1,000 bases we maintain around the world to support CIA for the elite smuggling of drugs, gold, guns, cash, and small children should be closed immediately.  Our support for dictators, our taxpayer subsidies for those dictators (and the Zionists, who get $30,000 a year for every man, woman, and child in Israel) is  totally outrageous.  What we have done to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria -- our drone assassinations, our torture and rendition -- all of these add up to Putin being the gold standard for international leadership while we represent the lowest of the low.

    <div class="md"><p>First, thanks for all your efforts. You should put up more videos on your youtube, a patreon account might be in order?</p>

<p>Q)My understanding of the born secret doctrine suggests that any scientific theory developed from the Manhattan project onward, which truly would push understanding deeper than what was know the open literature, would be suppressed or restricted on its face.  Do you think this is too paranoid?   It seems clear from leaked beam weapon docs that the manufacture of weapons was almost more important than collision of particles, and our deep theory hasn&#39;t really produced anything useful since reactors...</p>

<p>Could science be kept in a box of sorts?  I know there&#39;s an entire secret science world to let the national labs communicate...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand we actually enslave some scientists -- they are moved to underground cities and forced to work and never be allowed out.  I have no direct knowledge but my bottom line is that secret science borders on satanism and is not right.  We spend too much on weapons of war and not enough on instruments of peace, in part because the public has been inattentive and there is no transparency in the US budget. 50% of the federal budget could be cut tomorrow and we would be better off.</p>

<p>Does the kind of investigation/talk/action that happens on places like the chans and sections of reddit actually help anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very thoughtful questions. I gave up on all social media a while back -- it was just too much trivia.  Right now it appears to be an alternative to watching cartoons for many people, and not at all instructive or useful. The tools for sense-making and better aggregating civic power are just not there. For me, the invitation to  this particular Reddit was offered so professionally I felt a desire to contribute.  I think of this Reddit as a small flap of the butterfly wing.  Someone reading all this knows someone who knows someone who can tell Keith (Trump&#39;s security guy) that he should tell the boss to diversity.  And then magic happens.</p>

<p>Trump was an accident and has enormous potential. Whatever happens, the Deep State is now on the run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Robert I forgot to ask one more question:</p>

<p>Q) The election is over but I noticed that trolls keep attacking Jill Stein on both her Twitter &amp; Facebook feeds. I&#39;ve supported the Greens ever since Bernie endorsed Killary, but what I can&#39;t understand is I expected the attacks to die down. Is this some sort of revenge by the Democrat Elites on trying to ruin her image well in advance before 2018/2020 elections?  Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is at least three different issues.</p>

<p>I met Jill when we were both running for president in 2012 and when I introduced myself she was like a deer in the headlights.  I formed the impression that she was more posture than substance and too timid to go the distance. Then when she vandalized construction equipment I concluded that she is done.</p>

<p>The Green &quot;Cabinet&quot; is well-intentioned but light-weight. They are just not heavy-weight thinkers who can produce a balanced  budget that demonstrates holistic analytics and true cost economics -- indeed I have never heard the Green Party talk about true cost economics.</p>

<p>Finally the party itself is much smaller than most realize, and is totally oblvious to electoral reform as a winning issue.  I tried to get the Libertarians and Greens to understand that they should run together, a Libertarian president and Green vice president with a coalition cabinet cutting across all political lines, and they blew me off.  ALL PARTIES ARE TOXIC, without exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you Robert for the reply. Yes, I&#39;ve wanted Jill to drop her Campaign Manager David Cobb, as I didn&#39;t feel he was guiding Jill with the best strategies. And yes, it&#39;s a small party that doesn&#39;t have a lot of &quot;know-how&quot; (i.e. light-weight is correct). I kinda think of them as a baseball team, but they&#39;re not scouting the best that they could call into play. </p>

<p>I did like her &quot;Green New Deal&quot;, where (for example) we commit to solar &amp; wind. But maybe because the party is still relatively small they don&#39;t know all the &quot;in&#39;s &amp; out&#39;s&quot; of true cost economics. I kinda applauded her for spray-painting the bulldozer (or whatever that was), but boy, she got attacked a lot online. </p>

<p>Thank you Robert for your work &amp; helping us see the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience the answer is always &quot;all of the above.&quot; I am quite certain that Trump has been tapped by the US Government (both NSA and the FBI) as well as the Zionists.  There are two kinds of tapping: those against communications devices, and listening devices planted in his office by visitors.  I am quite certain the Oval Office is bugged six different ways and everything said there is in Tel Aviv as well as Fort Meade as it is said -- real time.</p>

<p>Our secret intelligence community is out of control -- it is focused on our own politicians and our own public.  The FBI needs cleansing, but once cleansed I would triple it budget and unleash it against everybody in betrayal of the public trust.</p>

<p>There is no lack of evidence on all three Clinton&#39;s being pieces of shit (and Chelsea is probably only half Clinton).

    <div class="md"><p>From an average American point of view, &quot;revolutions&quot; seem to be reserved for Middle Eastern countries and rural European states. It&#39;s unbridled violence and pillaging.</p>

<p>I imagine it&#39;s possible this image is pushed on us to make us seem &quot;above&quot; insurrection or otherwise fighting back. Yet another amazing invention to keep us placid.</p>

<p>My question: do you foresee the Second American Revolution happening as a diplomatic, militaristic, mixed, or even unlikely event? Is there promise for us to pull the &quot;I&#39;m mad as hell and I&#39;m not going to take this anymore&quot; approach, or do we wait for the state to thoroughly destroy itself first?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice.  I did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolutions, in 1976, CIA still has not caught up with me.  You can find that work here:</p>

<p>Since the 1920&#39;s there has in my view definitely been a strategy of propagandizing the US public into not revolting.  Populist revolutions are very rare.  See this excellent work:</p>

<p><a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2007/06/the-populist-moment-a-short-history-of-the-agrarian-revolt-in-america-galaxy-books-the-populist-moment-a-short-history-of-the-agrarian-revolt-in-america/">http://phibetaiota.net/2007/06/the-populist-moment-a-short-history-of-the-agrarian-revolt-in-america-galaxy-books-the-populist-moment-a-short-history-of-the-agrarian-revolt-in-america/</a></p>

<p>A revolution is underway right now in the USA.  I like these two books by Russell Brand and Chris Hedges, note in the second that he says that the last defense of the elites is law enforcement: when law enforcement STOPS defending the elites it is over for them. I would add to that when law enforcement STOPS taking orders to allow Berkeley riots to proceed unmolested (I would have slammed that down in five minutes) then it is over.</p>

<p>We are at a fascinating points in time.  Donald Trump is an ACCIDENTAL president, I won&#39;t argue this point, read the memo with 50 linked endnotes -- he was elected AGAINST the violent opposition of BOTH the Republican and Democratic parties and the 1% as well as the US military senior leaders who are corrupt to the bone.</p>

<p><a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2016/11/robert-steele-the-accidental-president-will-he-resign-the-closed-system-is-still-rigged-and-likely-to-remain-so/">http://phibetaiota.net/2016/11/robert-steele-the-accidental-president-will-he-resign-the-closed-system-is-still-rigged-and-likely-to-remain-so/</a></p>

<p>Whats Trump is missing because he has been in the fight for his life and had to appoint some real traitors (Preibus) and has not had access to holistic thinkers like myself who have been trying to help him since July 2015, is that he can flip the tortilla overnight, he just has to read the memo that one million people have read below, and the underlying ten-pager with graphics that Judas Preibus and Sean Spicer refused to deliver to the President elect in December 2016 hen it could have shaped the Inaugural speech.</p>

<p>What exactly will happen when the Elites, Deep State, et al begin their &quot;end game&quot; ? Will they cause the collapse of the US Dollar?</p>

<p>I strongly believe that we need to offer them a &quot;soft landing&quot; and an &quot;exit strategy&quot; through a Truth &amp; Reconciliation process. The US Dollar has already collapsed, it is worth 10% of what it once was and is about to be replaced by a BRICS currency.  We need to be more creative about alternative currencies based on community and kinship and trust, and focus on keeping our communities healthy.</p>

<p>In your time as a spy, did you ever infiltrate foreign governments?</p>

<p>Duh.  Just about anyone can be recruited with the right combination of money, narrative, and opportunity.  Often you can use &quot;false flag&quot; to good effect, and also &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; pitches.  What kills me is that we spend 90% of our time and money on the 5% or so that might be worth stealing and usually is not, and we REFUSE to be serious about open sources of information in all languages that we do not speak.  </p>

The REAL billionaires rip us all off by manipulating interest and foreign exchange rates, using insider trading, dumping bad stocks on unsuspecting individual buyers, and of course starting wars to make good on their bad bets on futures (e.g. Goldman Sachs bet big on oil going over $200 a barrel, they were wrong, so what Goldman Sachs wants right now is a war in the Middle East so they can hit their futures bets).</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t think John Potash&#39;s book &quot;Drugs As Weapons Against Us&quot; is accurate?  His book is subtitled &quot;The CIA&#39;s Murderous Targeting of SDS, Panthers, Hendrix, Lennon, Cobain, Tupac, and Other Activists.&quot;</p>

<p>Potash thinks the CIA has very, very dirty hands.  Then there&#39;s the death of Frank Olson.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree.  The CIA and their Military Weapons Industry faction of the Junta are thrashing with Trump and his Oil faction of the Junta for sure.  </p>

<p>President Exxon (Trump/Rex Tillerson) wants to drill in Russia&#39;s arctic waters and so is calling for detente (friendlier relations) again with the Russians (like Nixon called for detente and so the CIA got rid of Nixon a little more gently than they dispatched John Kennedy) while the military weapons industry still needs to portray Russia as a mortal threat to continue expanding the Weapons Industry&#39;s trillion-dollar annual budget, which has been crippling our economy since Nine-Eleven, 2001.  On that day the Military Weapons Industry rejoiced and probably had something to do with 9/11 in the form of the Deep State and the C.I.A.  After 9/11, the weapons industry was no longer hampered by Bill Clinton&#39;s peace dividend domestic spending which saw &quot;Defense&quot; spending drop dramatically in favor of supporting our domestic economic growth.  Of course Bill Clinton was representing Arkansas then (he was President Walmart), but now Hillary in New York is neck-deep into the Deep State favoring the ruthless CIA now.</p>

<p>Doctor Jill Stein of the Green Party would have been much better than Trump.  She will challenge both wings of the Junta, both the Weapons Industry faction and the Big Oil faction.  Please consider voting Green next time.  I voted for Doctor Stein 4 years ago too.</p>

<p>Thanks for complimenting the best and only honest / non-criminal party.</p>

<p>Ralph Nader who ran on the Green Party ticket in 2000 is not a lightweight and neither is Jill Stein :-)  </p>

<p>They have the heart, the ideas, and the strong ethical character to make America truly great again.  Ralph Nader has given away 90 percent of his income every year for decades to causes he supports.   A person like that can&#39;t be bought. I think Greens always look for candidates like that to put on their ticket.</p>

Almost two weeks before Malaysian flight MH370 was brought down a Chinese blogger posted about how a group called The Black Hand was going to target a flight from that airline. On that plane were co-owners of a valuable semi-conductor patent. Their deaths lead to Jacob Rothschild being the sole owner. They&#39;re also known as the black hand of the illuminati.

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer is yes.  Long answer is that the more rank you get the more you have to compromise your integrity to get and keep rank. Many if not all of our veterans now suffering silently at home know that Iraq was an elective war based on 935 now-documented lies. Some of them understand that the Pentagon is a massive conspiracy to steal money from the American taxpayer -- the infantry, which is 4% of the force and takes 80% of the casualties, gets 1% of the budget.  The rest of the budget goes to overpriced crap  that never works the way it should and requires 3-6 contractors per uniformed person, to keep operational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never planned to be an author. That happened when one of my generals refused to sign an article I had ghost-written for him, so I published it in my own name.  One thing led to another, I give a lot of credit to the American Intelligence Journal that published me early on (always with pre-approval by a very effective DoD pre-publications review process).</p>

<p>I never planned to leave the government but when CIA ordered the Marine Corps to forbid me to do a second conference on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) I quit government and risked everything on leading the revolution.  While it was enough to support me -- grossing 1.2 million with only one employee in my best year, CIA was able to repress and distort the OSINT revolution for 30 years.  Donald Trump makes my ideas viable again.</p>

<p>Never give up is something I take seriously.  I have had many dark years, but at root I am a) confident of my value for humanity and b) not about to give those assholes the satisfaction of seeing me give up.</p>

<p><a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2012/12/saucers-swastikas-and-psyops-a-history-of-a-breakaway-civilization-hidden-aerospace-technologies-and-psychological-operations/">Review: Saucers, Swastikas and Psyops: A History of A Breakaway Civilization: Hidden Aerospace Technologies and Psychological Operations by Joseph Farrell</a>  </p>

<p>At the end of the review you write:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found this book to be ABSORBING. It has rough edges, the cover detracts from the seriousness of the book and it desperately needs an index, but my bottom line is clear: if I had the authority or influence to get a retrospective study done, the author would be among those commissioned to do a foundational Truth &amp; Reconciliation survey.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You still think this is a good idea?  </p>

<p>(If Fly is still reading Farrell might be a good AMA subject.)</p>

If and when Donald Trump has an Open Source Agency that can give him holistic analytics and true cost economics, he will know with certainty that Monsanto is one step up from the Holocaust and the most evil corporation on the planet with the Koch Brothers (that&#39;s pronounced COCK Brothers) coming in a close second.</p>

<p>REGULATION IS NOT THE WAY TO ERADICATE MONSANTO. Education of the public is how we do it.  Did you know the beer industry refuses to buy wheat that has been touched by Monsanto in any way? Nor does the lentil industry? Monsanto is toxic in every possible sense of the way but only an educated public can eradicate them, this cannot be done by government fiat.</p>

<p>My humble opinion is that Donald Trump the man and Donald Trump the President are the center of gravity.  Nothing else matters.  He is the legitimately elected President and this is FREAKING OUT the Deep State precisely because they know that now he has a bully pulpit and can mobilize the 70% who have been marginalized and disenfranchised by the two-party tyranny.</p>

<p>Your local representative are ass-wipes and corrupt to the bone.  Here is a book that opened my eyes to the degree of corruption there is at the local level, followed by a book from a friend that shows the corruption at the state level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Donald Trump listens to me (my preference) or if an independent coalition cabinet wins in 2020, the public will be establishing the priorities for action via PollMole and the other elements of our Public Channel.  From where I sit we need to stop doing harm to others and ourselves; establish free quality education and health care for all US citizens while shutting out all illegals; and focus on full employment -- meaningful employment.  We need to end absentee landlords (and federal ownership of all land and property).  There is so much to do.  One rough sense of what I would try to do if I were president can be seen at <a href="http://bigbatusa.org">http://bigbatusa.org</a>, see especially the Coalition Cabinet and their marching orders.</p>

<p>If I were helping Trump, see the Memo, a grand strategy is how he gets a grip and gives direction to his Cabinet. I am concerned that his Cabinet is all over the lot and a traitor is in charge of the Office of Presidential Personnel.</p>

<p>You have been a military officer and also created a military intelligence center at the service level.  What are your thoughts on the recent announcement by President Trump that he is increasing the military budget by $54 billion?</p>

<p>Additionally, what is your opinion on blackwater contractors? I think they changed their name but are still operating under Eric Prince.  I know some religious folks who are convinced that Eric Prince is &quot;the blackwater prince, aka the Black Prince&quot;. I&#39;m pretty sure the Black Prince in that context has to do with their views on biblical prophecy.</p>

<p>I really like this question in part because it allows me to be critical of Donald Trump.  I am always troubled when &quot;leaders&quot; believe that anyone who questions them or criticizes a potential course of action is disloyal.  I do believe that one should be silent after the decision is made, but clearly Trump has a shit staff, no strategic perspective, and is making rotten decisions because of them.</p>

<p>First off, the military is documented at 50% waste. Second off the military is consuming 60% of our disposable federal budget (half of which is unConstitutionally borrowed from private banks). Thirdly, our military cannot fight and win wars and most of our officers are inbred liars, especially so at the flag level. To give this Department more money is like pouring gasoline on a fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/robert-steele-donald-trump-strike-three/">http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/robert-steele-donald-trump-strike-three/</a></p>

<p>Now, having said all that, do NOT confuse righteous anger over military fraud, waste, and abuse with being against a strong defense.  The Department of Defense today lacks intelligence and integrity and Jim Mattis, as good as he is, shows no signs of making any changes of substance in this dysfunctional department.</p>

<p>I have spent the past year funded by the US Army Strategic Studies Institute ($9K) to write three monographs, one on Grand Strategy, one on Global Reality, and one on Re-Inventing the US Army (and everything else. The essence of my vision is that w e must immediately close all 1,000 bases overseas, end all support to dictators and all subsidization of Arab and Israeli and other programs against humanity.  My findings are here:</p>

<p><a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2016/10/robert-steele-reinventing-the-us-army-part-iii-strategy-reality-precepts-structure-leadership/">http://phibetaiota.net/2016/10/robert-steele-reinventing-the-us-army-part-iii-strategy-reality-precepts-structure-leadership/</a></p>

<p>If Donald Trump wants to be a serious president he must:</p>

<p>01 Have a Grand Strategy Summit across all threats, all policies, all budgets</p>

<p>02 Cut the entire government starting with Defense, by 30-50%</p>

<p>03 Instruct the Secretary of Defense that within his new sharply reduced budget, he is to design and build a 450 ship Navy, a long-haul Air Force, and a 3 million solider Army (up from one million) with no contractors (down from 3-6 million) based at home with no overseas bases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, what is your opinion on blackwater contractors? I think they changed their name but are still operating under Eric Prince. I know some religious folks who are convinced that Eric Prince is &quot;the blackwater prince, aka the Black Prince&quot;. I&#39;m pretty sure the Black Prince in that context has to do with their views on biblical prophecy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think Prince is particularly evil, he is just a low level businessman who deals in humans as commodities rather than simply ripping off the government with the USS Gerald Ford (Northrup Grumman) or the F-35 (Lockheed Martin). In my vision of the future, there is no place for contractors. The military and intelligence and public services are inherent responsibilities of civil servants. In my vision of the future, you join the government for life and you are not allowed to EVER cross over to the private sector inclusive of after retirement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question FlyTape brings up.  I was confused about Trump&#39;s 54 billion dollar (5 to 10 percent) increase in the &quot;Defense&quot; budget, but he seems to have made it contingent on a 54 billion dollar decrease at the State Department and &quot;foreign development.&quot;  The State Department is actually the Spook Department (State is loaded with CIA spies -- Trump and Tillerson having abruptly fired hundreds of them a few weeks ago), so Trump seems to be playing off the &quot;Intelligence&quot; community with the Military Industry thieves that steal a dollar for every 2 they&#39;re given.  </p>

<p>Trump seems to be saying if &quot;Defense&quot; companies want a 50 billion dollar hike, it will have to come out of the Spooks&#39; budget at the State Department.  Then things crystalized for me more when I heard Nancy Pelosi say that Trump&#39;s proposal will never pass because State won&#39;t stand for such a large cut. </p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my hopeful reading.  I certainly hope Trump won&#39;t increase the War budget by 50 Billion, or I&#39;ll call him Donald Rump again.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t left us yet Robert, does that sound plausible to you or am I way off?</p>

I have no thoughts on Canada other than that it is still too cold to be worth invading but with global warming, may soon be worth a second look if only for the water and the beachside access to the Arctic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noted.  I like Nikki Haley.  The Open Source Agency would fund a United Nations Open-Source Decision-Support Information Network (UNODIN) that would serve as the world brain -- what we get is access to all information in all languages all the time -- what the rest of the world gets is the same thing plus Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE) and digital cash to each village, ending the 80% to 90% waste associated with the UN and NGO bureaucracies.  I wish Nikki would hear of me -- trying to reach her is mission impossible, her front end staff is too stupid to compute big ideas or is part of the Deep State and I am on the banned list.</p>

<p>What I mean by critical mass is at some point every agency would have infiltrated each other to the point of it being acknowledged and/or allowed, maybe even intended.

<p>CIA and NSA are deeply penetrated by Mossad, and NSA is TOTALLY penetrated by both China and Israel at the systems level IMHO.</p>

<p>Yes. Both, but NSA is the one that is doing most of the blackmailing of politicians and insider trading based on its spying on Wall Street.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>Why do retired CIA always come out and &quot;expose&quot; the CIA etc, eg yourself, Ray McGovern et al, when you guys probably have done loads of shady stuff when you&#39;re inside the CIA yourself? Guilty conscience? Have you defied shady orders?
</code></pre>

<p>Out of the thousands of clandestine case officers (spies) -- every one else works out of a cubicle -- most disappear into retirement or double-dipping jobs retirement jobs pushing paper. A few of us become vocal opponents of spying done wrong.  Robert Baer, Ray McGovern (who founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity) and I are examples of the latter.  Part of your problem is that you are LAZY. You have not bothered to go to <a href="http://phibetaiota.net">http://phibetaiota.net</a> and read a single thing I have written.  You have not bothered to see the lists, all with links on line, to my books, articles, chapters, interviews, testimony, and even movies.  So I am answering your LAZY questions out of respect for Reddit, not because I think you deserve an answer.</p>

<pre><code>What is your purpose to do this? Sell books? Get paid interviews? Radio show?
</code></pre>

<p>Moron.  Try the obvious: responding to a well-presented polite, professional request from Fly -- not something you are capable of.  </p>

<pre><code>No witnesses? If your memo has been read by a million people already, then why do you still want to do a &quot;no witness&quot; meeting? Why should the POTUS trust a person like yourself to shed the Secret Service and whatever, when you were an intelligence agent that should be quite skilled at stealing info and perhaps killing people?
</code></pre>

<p>You have no idea.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;You have 30 days to settle the country. A violent “American Spring” looms.&quot; You&#39;re starting one? Somebody from CIA whispered this tip into your ears? CIA starting another colour revolution? Which is it?
</code></pre>

<p>You give Reddit a bad name.  Do you even have an education? When the weather gets warm enough so people can &quot;Occupy&quot; public spaces comfortably, Soros and the many organizations that have received ober 50 million dollars are ready to roll out into the streets.  Berkeley was a test drive.  Note that the Governors, Mayors, and university presidents are all part of the Deep State and against Trump.  For those who are interested in the four-track strategy against Trump, start here: <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/special-three-track-program-to-destroy-trump/">http://phibetaiota.net/2017/02/special-three-track-program-to-destroy-trump/</a></p>

<pre><code>Once a CIA, always a CIA. Why should anyone trust what you&#39;re doing?
</code></pre>

<p>I feel sorry for you. If you cannot figure that out by yourself, based on all the writing and public speaking and testimony to Congressional and Presidential Commissions to be found, with links online at <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com">http://robertdavidsteele.com</a>, then you are barely worthy as worm food.  Certainly I would not feed your ignorant remains to my dog.</p>

<pre><code>In your estimation, how many people are still languishing in Black Sites?

In your estimation, how many tons of drugs does the CIA smuggle per year? Which branch of the CIA does it, or is the whole organisation behind it?

How is the Black Budget funded, other than through drugs?

Does the CIA traffick humans? Sex slaves? Organs? Meat for consumption?

Does the CIA kill whistleblowers?

Which agency killed Michael Hastings?

Which agencies killed 9/11 truthers?

Which is the agency that suicide people? Have you suicided people, or directed their suiciding?

Does the CIA have the ability to remotely control all aircraft through the &quot;Uninterruptible Autopilot System&quot;? Which agencies have control over that?

Does the CIA have the ability to remotely control all vehicles? Which agencies have control over that?

Do you know any politicians, and their staff, that are paedophiles? Please list them.

Which journalists are targeted by the government now?

Which journalists are targeted by the CIA now?

Which journalists are on the hit list now?

Are &quot;Targeted Individuals&quot; really targeted by the government, or are they crazy? Which agency is responsible for targeting them?

In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he claimed that people can travel to Mars through some machine and the air is breathable. Additionally, he claims that the colours were filtered so people see all red on TV. Is it true?

In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he exposed an expansive base in the Ozarks mountain range. What is that facility for?

Are FEMA Camps now being used?

9/11 - Was it an inside job? Which agencies? Name names.

9/11 - Was it a plane? Remotely piloted plane? How was the plane remotely piloted? Was it a missile? Which flights were actually missiles? Where are the passengers if it was a missile? If it&#39;s not a missile, what plane was it?

Directed Energy Weapons. Real? What is the size of such a weapon if it&#39;s real? Meaning, anti-personnel, anti-tank, anti-building, area effect, etc? Space based? Air based? Land/Sea based?

Which agency killed Max Spiers?

Discreet surveillance of Saudi princes, many of them pedophiles and most of them homosexual in a sadistic controlling way, would quickly map their favorite places in London, DC, NYC, etctera.  We are simply not requiring the FBI to be serious in part because many of our federal and state &quot;leaders&quot; get to go to those restuarants, probably without paying, as part of the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Was there a moment in your career when you felt the CIA and or NSA was no longer effective? Or was it more a gradual realization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Important question.  My awakening came AFTER I left CIA. Like being a Jesuit priest, you simply do not question the sacred perfection of what you are a part of.  It was when I created the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, and top secret access to everything and one PC in the corner hooked to the Internet, that I was shocked to see the analysts lined up for the PC.  That is when I discovered (for the first time in my life I was responsible for producing intelligence about the whole world, not just collecting in a narrow lane) that the CIA and the secret world know nothing about most of the world.  There is literally nothing in the secret databases about Burundi, Haiti, Somalia, etcetera.  That was the beginning of the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) revolution.  Here are two links, the first is about how I beat the crap out of the entire IC for the benchmark exercise on Burundi for the Aspin-Brown Commission, the second is my Danish briefing in April 2016 indicting the CIA and others for crapping all over OSINT for 30 years -- they are TERRIFIED of my getting an Open Source Agency, it will not only provide the 96% of the decision support that the President and Cabinet need (which can be shared with the public) but it will justify a two thirds cut of the entire secret intelligence budget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To what extent were you an ignorant recruit? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was an ignorant recruit who believed then and believe now in the mission of the CIA in the ideal. I had no idea how many depraved aspects there were to the CIA (torture, drone assassination, running drugs, money laundering, blackmailing our own politicians, etc).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever regretted becoming involved as an agent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are OFFICERS, not agents.  Agents commit treason.  Case Officers or Operations Officers spot, assess, recruit, handle, and gracefully terminate (severance pay with good will) agents. I have NEVER regretted my time with the CIA, my only regret is that so many senior officers at CIA are totally lacking in integrity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the confusion comes when people fail to see the big three levels of which the Deep State is the lowest. I cannot claim to be an expert on the Deep State but I admire the book by Peter Dale Scott, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/review-guest-the-american-deep-state-wall-street-big-oil-and-the-attack-on-us-democracy/">http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/review-guest-the-american-deep-state-wall-street-big-oil-and-the-attack-on-us-democracy/</a> and also the work of Mike Lofgren who focuses on our prostitutes in Congress, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/?s=Mike+Lofgren">http://phibetaiota.net/?s=Mike+Lofgren</a> -- reading Lofgren and Assange, I am convinced the Republican Party is toast, which is one reason I feel so strongly that Donald Trump needs an Electoral Reform Act.</p>

<p>Within each agency, there are over-lapping slices of the Deep State -- the pedophile/Vatican slice, the Zionist/neo-con slice, the Saudi Arabian slice, the Nazi slice (often collaborating with the Zionist/neo-coni slice), and others.</p>

<p>Everything is constantly shifting.  What never shifts is the fact that the US Constitution is worthless today, every one of our institutions have failed, and We the People are screwed. Donald Trump has the power to change all this, but only if he diversifies.</p>

<p>The highest level is the Rothchilds and the blend of the UK Royal Family and City of London modern face of the old East India Company along with the Vatican and the Dragons in China (the good guys, ripped off by the other two for 300 years, that is about to change).</p>

<p>The next level is Wall Street and the City of London and a mix of non-traditional financial centers -- they are the grease between the Masters of the Universe and the Deep State.</p>

<p>Beneath them are a wide variety of institutions from the media to universities to Hollywood to labor leaders and local dignitaries who are all complicit in the general meme of screw the public as long as I get mine.  Charles Hugh Smith has a nice diagram at ZeroHedge, <a href="https://tyrannyrising.com/does-a-rogue-deep-state-have-trumps-back-2/">https://tyrannyrising.com/does-a-rogue-deep-state-have-trumps-back-2/</a></p>

<p>The Deep State is the unelected hand-picked officials from generation to generation who violate the Constitution with impunty and believe that transient polititians (who are one step up from whores and in many cases actual traitors to the Republic) are irrelevant to policy. They work  for different masters, and consider the USGovernment their personal piggy bank and the US public expendible farm animals.</p>

<p>I do like -- very much -- the overall thrust of the Green Party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for complimenting the best and only honest / non-criminal party.</p>

<p>Ralph Nader who ran on the Green Party ticket in 2000 is not a lightweight and neither is Jill Stein :-)  </p>

<p>They have the heart, the ideas, and the strong ethical character to make America truly great again.  Ralph Nader has given away 90 percent of his income every year for decades to causes he supports.   A person like that can&#39;t be bought. I think Greens always look for candidates like that to put on their ticket.</p>

<p>Part of your problem is that you are LAZY</p>

<p>So I am answering your LAZY questions out of respect for Reddit, not because I think you deserve an answer.</p>

<p>You give Reddit a bad name. Do you even have an education?</p>

<p>I feel sorry for you. -  you are barely worthy as worm food. Certainly I would not feed your ignorant remains to my dog.</p>

<p>Do you not read at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t expect this as a reply.  Your first several questions were ones that I&#39;d thought about myself.  I&#39;m glad you asked, but I&#39;m disappointed to see this kind of reaction.  It bugs me that those who were members of an organization which is openly loathed in subreddits such as this are treated as &quot;allies&quot;, often without question.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen confirmation bias become such an overwhelming part of political discourse that I had wondered if that were the reason for this attitude.  After all, we all like to have the thoughts that we espouse affirmed by an authority figure of sorts.  It&#39;s become increasingly difficult to take the word of anyone anymore.  It&#39;s easier for me to trust someone that has actually risked something, like Snowden, but I may just be ignorant of this dude&#39;s history.  Maybe I&#39;m just becoming overly cynical.</p>
