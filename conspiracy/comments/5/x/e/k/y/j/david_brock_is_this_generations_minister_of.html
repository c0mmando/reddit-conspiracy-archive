<p>So, let me get this straight: you&#39;re a 15 day old account who obviously has a good knowledge of reddit, you&#39;re going around accusing people posting here of being shills simply because they post in subs you don&#39;t like -  digging through their post history in the process, and making up lies about them to others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get that.  I don&#39;t really buy their reasoning that each sub has a different purpose, because they all have the same type of content.  But what am I supposed to do about it?</p>

<p>And T_D mods do some pretty insane shit, and those subs are the only place I can call them out on it.  Am I supposed to allow their propaganda machine to just run unabated?   When they try to <a href="https://www.ceddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5s71w6/you_cant_handle_the_truth/">hide the fact that Trump&#39;s ban isn&#39;t the same as prior bans</a> or that <a href="https://www.ceddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bdfvs/_">there was no assination attempt</a> am I not supposed to say something about it?  Just let them continue pulling the wool over people&#39;s eyes?  ... It&#39;s just not in my nature.  </p>

<p>I personally think the best way to dismantle this whole situation is if the T_D mods started allowing discourse.   Until that happens people will continue to push back.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the Nazi Seizure of Power in 1933, Goebbels&#39; Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. <strong>He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes</strong>. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.psywarrior.com/Goebbels.html">http://www.psywarrior.com/Goebbels.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. </p>

<p>Brock </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2004, he founded Media Matters for America, a non-profit organization that describes itself as a <strong>&quot;progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The Nation has described Brock as a “conservative journalistic assassin turned progressive empire-builder”;[6] National Review has called him a “right-wing assassin turned left-wing assassin”;[7] and Politico has profiled him as a <strong>“former right-wing journalist-turned-pro-Clinton crusader.”</strong></p>

<p>He has been described by Time magazine as “one of the most influential operatives in the Democratic Party.”[2]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2016, Correct the Record announced that it would be spending $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about Clinton.[1][4] The organization&#39;s president, Brad Woodhouse, said they had &quot;about a dozen people engaged in [producing] nothing but positive content on Hillary Clinton&quot; and had a team distributing information &quot;particularly of interest to women&quot;.[5]</p>

<p>In September 2016, Correct the Record announced a project called &quot;Trump Leaks&quot;. Correct the Record said it would pay anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Donald Trump, including audio and video recordings and internal documents.[6]</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareblue">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareblue</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later, he said that the main goal of the website was to get presidential candidate Hillary Clinton elected.[3] During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Shareblue&#39;s &quot;bread-and-butter content&quot; was &quot;exposing what it considers to be news coverage stacked against&quot; Clinton; the group&#39;s major message was &quot;that a shameful false equivalence was causing the media to soft-pedal Mr. Trump&#39;s many transgressions and overplay the few it could find on Mrs. Clinton.&quot;[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if Trump starts executing journalists let me know, because right now the mainstream media is saying whatever they want about him and so far the consequence has been being barred from press briefings. Something Trump and Hillary have both done to an extent </p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/hillary-clinton-media-press-problem-226944">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/hillary-clinton-media-press-problem-226944</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;From the Clinton side of it, certainly we have concerns that she is starting out with print organizations at a level of remove that is concerning to us,” Gearan said. &quot;There are certain institutional norms that are in place at the White House for the way press access is treated. Those are not by right or law, they are as a result of negotiations and custom over a considerable amount of time. We certainly hope at this point in time there’s no consideration by the Clinton campaign that if she becomes president, she’d relax or go back on any of the current set of accommodations that are provided to the press in the White House.” </p>

<p>The 2016 cycle marks the longest a candidate has gone without a protective press pool for the last three elections. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama’s coverage started in June, Sen. John McCain’s in July, as the Huffington Post noted last month. In 2012, Mitt Romney received protective pool coverage in early August (that year the Republican convention was held the last week of August).</p>

<p>&quot;It’s a false equivalency,” said the Washington Post’s Anne Gearan, who is part of a team chairing the Clinton press pool for the remainder of the election but noted she did not know why the Clinton campaign hadn’t allowed a protective pool yet. “We’re advocating for access for the Clinton press pool. Whatever Trump does is immaterial as far as we’re concerned.&quot;</p>
