    <div class="md"><p>So, somehow you think this scenario is <em>safer</em> if we all succumb to a one-world global order? Like, if we just hand power over peacefully, TPTB will suddenly become altruistic, dutiful and efficient? </p>

<p>I think your problem with Trump right now is that he hasn&#39;t acted in a way that you find conventional. I think you are more accustomed to sneakiness under the guise of &quot;transparency&quot;, and this new way of presidential behavior (and mostly the way it&#39;s being reported,) has shooken you up. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big pro-Trump person, but I appreciate the fact that his election created a fracture in the system and some people have woken up to the lifelong programming we&#39;ve been exposed to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly make a fair point. No I don&#39;t want us all to just succumb to some global dictatorship. But I think we should recognize that a global layer of government could be very beneficial to us and we should start talking about it openly so we can get control of it and make it the way we all would like it to be. Globalism has unfortunately turned into a dirty word it seems. </p>

<p>Also I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian setting and there were so many Christians I encountered who look at global government as a sign of the end times. They automatically associate it with evil. I think this association is why Alex Jones&#39; globalist fear mongering resonates with so many people. </p>

<p>Whatever globlal layer of government comes about, we should hope to make it democratic and transparent. </p>

<p>To your point about Trump acting unconventional, it&#39;s true to some degree. I prefer a politician to at least pay lip service to my values. It is very dangerous though when you have a politician that is good at lying to your face. Trump is agitating a healthy resistance movement. So I can see the good in that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump was an intended part of any plan. They will adapt the plan to include Trump.</p>

<p>Certainly, the US political left believes it will benefit from pushing a narrative of pessimism and chaos, domestic and abroad. They&#39;re already a willing arm of the DNC&#39;s propaganda machine; no reason for them to stop the shilling now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I will admit that I have not listened a lot to Steve Bannon. Would you say his comments <a href="https://youtu.be/cYhnnN1eLxM">in this video</a> are straight up faked or taken out of context somehow? I know Vox is not likely to be a news source this community trusts. I visit a lot of different news sources. I find their stuff informative most of the time. They certainly have a slant to the left of course. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;Trump is literaly HITLER!&quot; and calling people &quot;racist&quot; was getting kind of silly so using a word like &quot;xenophobe&quot; makes you sound slightly smarter than the average progressive.</p>

<p>Deep State is not a song by The Cure. There&#39;s no delineation or meaning other than what they are. As referenced above, if you prefer psychopaths that murder, run drugs, literally worship Satan, and manipulate the minds of the public at large, you have lost your god damn mind.  I suggest you research who these people are.  They&#39;re psychic Vampires feeding off misery and evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but there was a split within the Global and U.S. deep states, </p>

<p>The split is between the ones who want to continue with formal national governments, and groups of nations, like EU, agreeing to a more standardized set of human rights and environmental protections</p>

<p>And the ones who want to acquire control of the governments entirely by the few in the new global owner class, and not allow interference by governments on behalf of people or the planet.</p>
