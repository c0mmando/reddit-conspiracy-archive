       I put up a post here in r/conspiracy about a year ago that looks rather disjointed to me now upon re-reading, about [unknowingly] being in the eye of the MKUltra storm in the 1960's - 70's.

      <p>
       I just got a PM from a university student in San Francisco who is researching these cults/government orgs/survivor stories asking me for information.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I put up my original post I had spent weeks wandering the internet digging into the weirdnesses of my Mendocino county of the 1970's - the old Mendocino State Hospital, Jim Jones and the People's Temple from Redwood Valley, The old Moonie camp in Boonville, and reports of the 'Mendo Witches' connected to Charles Manson and unsolved murders in the Anderson Valley [CA].
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not save
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the links I found. None of them. (I'm old, what am I saving this shit for?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am now one of a small and dwindling number of old timers who were there when this shit was going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am asking redditors here who have more patience, better resources, and more internet savvy than I, to contribute whatever information they can search up to contribute to this investigation of  - - MKUltra, the Mendocino State Hospital, Mendo Witches cold cases, Charles Manson, Jim Jones and the People's Temple, the Boonville ranch of the Rev. Rev. Sun Myung Moon (Moonies), and anything else that is relevant for the time and place.

       No idea. I just got the PM out of nowhere linked to my original post from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which I couldn't find in my post history, but when I googled MKUltra/Mendocino county/reddit looking for it, my original reddit post turned up as the first search return. That's probably where our university student found it.

       <p>
        Hi there,
I'm ***** and the daughter of a second wave back-to-the-land'er of Mendocino County. I read your thread about the many conspiracies that have happened over the years up here. I'm wondering if you have any advice on finding out more information about some of this stuff, or people in the community that are still alive that would be willing to talk.
I'm currently studying journalism in the city (SF), and want to start putting more research into my home. I'm particularly interested in the history of the state hospital, The People's Temple, the Moonies, Camp Winnarainbow/Hogfarm, and some other cults.
Any suggestions?
Thanks a ton, and love to you. From one Mendonesian to another.

       This site's search feature is a good starting point when you are looking for reliable details on certain shadow government topics.  Look up one thing and the information you find inevitably contains links giving you even further information. Quite the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       bibliotecapleyades.net
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great site for finding the real story about many topics (and one that even die-hard truth researchers don't seem to know about for some reason) is Jim Stone's website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimstone.is
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so hot with timely information that it sometimes gets hacked/taken down, but he's his own expert webmaster and always figures out a workaround.  If you have trouble accessing his site at the above address, put only this right in the address bar:
      </p>
      <p>
       82.221.129.208
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry that I don't have time at the moment to give you more specific information on each of your topics, but these 2 sources should help you help yourself with them just fine.

       Jim Stone is a fraud and a loser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Jim Stone NSA?
      </p>
      <p>
       In his 2002 article James Heikkila, a.k.a. Jim Stone, claimed that he is “a National Security Agency trained Electronic Warfare specialist.” His official title according to Heikkila was “MOS33Q10, Electronic Warfare Intercept Strategic Signal Processing/Storage Systems Specialist.” However, that title is not NSA, it’s US army. Look it up, you’ll see it for yourself.

       psyop.ninja/the-jim-heikkila-stone-distortion/
      </p>
      <p>
       What's Jim Stone's real name?
      </p>
      <p>
       His real name is James Milford Heikkila. Taking all his pseudonyms together, it's Jim (James) Annas Heikkila Stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know this by comparing the photos of Annas Hiekkila and the one of Jim Stone, as well as matching personal info such as his failed musical career.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an arrest warrant for him in Wisconsin relating to child support.

       Are the CIA really trying to kill Jim?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably a paranoid fantasy or marketing ploy.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a neighbor in Mexico:
      </p>
      <p>
       One day, around the 1st week of July he came out of his room &amp; asked me if I´d heard the firecrackers at 6 am that morning. "Yup, it´s Mexico." I replied. "No, It is a warning for me from the CIA. They want me to know they know where I live." okayyyyyyyyyy.....

      <p>
       From the same neighbor:
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and for any of you who fall for his crap of his starving and living in the street etc and donate to him. He is building something in his room using power tools he buys brand new with your money. Power saws, electric drills. I once watched him eat 2 kilos of hamberger on rolls with tons of catsup, all in 1 sitting. It was REALLY gross. He claimed his muscles would double in size within a few hours. That was his reasoning for eating the 2 kilos. THAT is where all your donsatoins go... power tools, radios, scanners, new modems and tons of food. Oh and he pays someone to wash his clothes and eats out a lot. So Jim really does need more money to keep up his lifestyle.

       Okay you're free to believe that a man who was never NSA was never a nuclear engineer, fled to Mexico to avoid child support is nonetheless the best source of analysis on Fukushima nuclear attack (which he plagiarised btw).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the MSM wants to "debunk" conspiracy theories they have Jim Stone do a story on it and trot out his sorry past. Like MH370 where he insisted the 4chan "I posted this from my anus" post was real based on non existant meta data (THE NSA HACKED IT! HONEST!!!!!!)

       Try as I might, I have yet to find a perfect source of information.  The best I can do is research the FACTS being reported from as many as I can and judge accordingly.

       I'm not a professional researcher or anything but I came to suspect that Charles Manson was suffering from dissociative disorder due to his early sexual abuse in an orphanage... In one stint in prison he was heavily into Scientology and their teachings... I think at this point he was either programmed or deprogrammed by Scientologists who were interested in him but also knew he was a psychopath and tried to keep their distance... After this is when he might have been subject to MKUltra styled meddling and reprogrammed resulting in his current mental state... I wasn't digging into Manson specifically... I was looking at early Scientology... so my theory is that Scientology is either a vetting arm of the CIA or an anti-shadow government group seeking to un do the work of MKUltra agents... in the end there were quite a few brutal murders of Scientologists in California around that time with highly ritualistic violence against them... so my personal opinion is that they are at war with the CIA... hence the disinfo campaign to discredit them, their high security standards, and the odd ongoing nature of their later shenanigans with the

       Infiltrating numerous branches of the government isn't exactly standard operating procedure for a cult.

       Interesting connections you make here. I've always been intrigued by this. Had a family member in the Manson family (died before the murder spree of natural causes) and family who became Scientologists in the mid 70's. Have heard a lot of hush hush late night dinner table talk about all this, but kinda keep it quiet because it comes across pretty weird. Definitely the Scientologists were/are (maybe just believed they were? Used to be?) in direct war with the CIA MK Ultra. They truly believe their techniques are anti-brainwashing and can uncover and and undo deliberate brainwashing.

       I was getting in over my head doing research on it and decided to just back off cause it was a complicated web that I could never truly hope to untangle on my own... But it still niggles at me... I made a topic here a few months back that wasn't too well received... I'll see if it is still kicking around and drop a link below....

       I checked out your post. It's really interesting you came up with that. I say that YES, they at least believe, they are anti MKUltra, whether or not they actually are I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some really interesting stuff when you get past the fluff. Posts about Scientology are never well received but I could probably get you info if you have an angle you want to research. Feel free to let me know.

       I can't help you with your posts but I will offer up my theory on late 60s and 70s weirdness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the cults during that time and the high number of serial killers were devised as a means to scare, squash and turn people against the anti war anti industrial war complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those movements of peace and social change were a real threat to the power structure. It is my belief these groups were infiltrated and led down paths of self destruction.
