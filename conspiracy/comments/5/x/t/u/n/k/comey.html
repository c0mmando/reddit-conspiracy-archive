One minute he is the hero, the next is persona non grata - seems like they are trying to decimate his reputation for all parties so everybody across the board just dismisses him and the FBI as compromised -anybody else noticing the bizarre Comey narrative?  The more I keep seeing this trend occur, the more I am gaining some weird traction in faith in him playing out this really long game plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion (and this is only an opinion), I get a feeling that he is playing a long game here - I don&#39;t think he had the manpower or the proper positioning to combat this level of opposition/corruption - I think he has been playing ball and letting the &#39;smaller&#39; crimes through (like the laundering or the email servers or wire taps) while he builds his own network and case against this - this would have been planning at least a decade in advance for it to be true - but I am inclined to feel this way because he is a gatekeeper, and the media isn&#39;t doing him any favors - they are trying to turn the public against him on ALL sides - something is amiss with the FBI</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know what he intended?  And how do you know his agents have the same information that Comey has?  If there is any truth to the global elite concept that is pushed around here, then Comey likely has information that could get him and/or others killed at the drop of a hat - if he doesn&#39;t disclose certain bits of information to his agents, that could be for his own safety, and the safety of his agents and their families - if he is playing a long game, its likely he is generally alone with his thoughts - the only person you can really trust with a secret is yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey has the power and responsibility to reopen investigations into 9/11 and Anthrax.  The FBI has major roles in both.</p>

<p>But Comey is not merely in a position to reopen investigations.  He is in the position of <em>maintaining cover-ups that are ongoing.</em>  That includes Penn State, Ray Gricar, and Michael Hastings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know what he intended?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a question you yourself ignore repeatedly.  You &quot;feel&quot; his motives over &amp; over:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think he is up to his own little game</p>

<p>I think he is holding on for dear life and biding his time</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he had the manpower or the proper positioning to combat this level of opposition/corruption</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are all much smaller things in a much more grand conspiracy - 9/11 was just one of many actions performed as a limb to an even bigger machine.  Its hard to say &quot;9/11 was huge!  How could it be just a limb.&quot; -well because if 9/11 was the causation to get us into a war where hundreds of thousands were killed and nations were wrecked, then yea on a humankind scale, 9/11 becomes minutia - it would be like charging a cartel lord with possession of narcotics and risking him getting off easy, when in reality he should be charged with King Pin - </p>

<p>See, we think too small.  We take one event and blow it up to global scale, when in reality they are all several thousands of &#39;tiny&#39; events in a big intricate machine - you cant stop it by chipping off the exterior, you gotta kill it at its core.</p>

<p>I believe Comey knows this - for the past few decades, he was trapped in the ectoplasm of all of these undesirables and had to helplessly watch as the worlds&#39; most powerful terrors did whatever they wanted - meanwhile, he played ball, built his case, built an army of agents, and is waiting for the opportune moment to strike a real devastating blow</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Sheer projection with no supporting evidence.  I see nothing in Comey but a Neocon who is being given credit by the right-wing the same exact way liberals gave credit to Obama.  The exact same phrase, in fact, is being used now that was used in 2008:  &quot;Just wait, he&#39;s playing <em>4-D Chess</em> or <em>12-D Chess</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2008, Obama was portrayed as the Good Guy with no supporting evidence but a persona.  In 2017, it&#39;s exactly the same with Comey.  His &quot;backstory&quot; is a CIA legend constructed to make him look like he has integrity.  </p>

<p>But Comey&#39;s backstory came from the Bush Administration.  There&#39;s nothing to back Comey&#39;s story up but Bush officials.</p>

<p>If Comey had the integrity to announce that FBI played an inside role in 9/11, that would be so explosive that any &quot;more grand conspiracy&quot; would begin to split and unravel.</p>

<p>&quot;We think too small&quot;?  No &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t.  One single precedent of acknowledgement of Deep State involvement in JFK, Watergate, 9/11 or Anthrax starts the ball rolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he errs on the side of caution. Trump makes the mistake of injecting himself into the public conversation on literally everything. He gives people a lot of material to interpret however they see fit, and it hurts him more often than it helps.

<p>Trump&#39;s got the goods on Obama spying on him and his team so Comey&#39;s claim that Trump&#39;s accusations are groundless and ought not to be acted on, second hand or not, has tipped his hand in no uncertain terms as far as I&#39;m concerned and Trump has every right to demand his resignation over it and should damn well demand it.</p>

Clearly if Comey had an ounce integrity he would have stood his ground against that. As for all the clearly illegal involvement of the FBI in planning and setting-up undercover terror acts and recruiting and paying whatever low-lifes they could scrounge up to carry them out so they could then turn around and bust them... what more really needs to be said?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad some Ody else has noticed this. I feel the same way. I consider myself to be a good judge of character, and something I cannot put my finger on, on Comey. Personally I believe Comey is a soldier, and I love the man. I am rooting for him. I&#39;ve got a lot of hope put in comey. He certainly marches to the beat of his own drum. He seems deeply conflicted. But he seems like a man of principle .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.....He&#39;s an Irish catholic from New Jersey that&#39;s how we roll. ; )    Comey&#39;s one of the good guys he&#39;s just stuck between a rock and a hard place for now but he&#39;s playing the long game like a champ...In my opinion he will be the POTUS one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I noticed this exact thing. Investigates Hillary. Doesn&#39;t prosecute. Investigates Hillary again. Doesn&#39;t prosecute again. Now supposedly backed out of looking into the wiretaps. But no actual quotes from him or FBI on it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell, if he himself is actually weak and indecisive, or if there is a massive shitstorm brewing all around him, and he is just clinging on for dear life. He has the look of a weak man, but appearances are deceiving. He has worked with the banks and the establishment, but he has also not totally sold out and gone sideways like Clapper. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to become the director of the FBI as an incompetent though. And even if he is, he obviously knows alot of information. And Trump has shown that he is perfectly willing to fire those who displease him (Sally Yates). </p>

<p>I believe I have great people evaluation skills. I can get a good read on a person from very little exposure very quickly. But Comey is one of those people <em>that I just can&#39;t get a good read on.</em> And that truly is the scary scenario. At least with other corrupt people I know where they stand.</p>

<p>For some reason I have a feeling that he is the biggest piece in this puzzle to taking down the corrupt ruling class. He may literally destroy the political establishment or even the country with his action. It&#39;s not the type of decisions that one makes lightly. He is probably building such a case that nobody can dispute it. Further, he is likely securing the safety of himself and his family. If he fucks up, shit will be going down for real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The No Agenda Show had a theory that Comey is actually doing Trump a favor here. The Justice Department can&#39;t deny that this &#39;wiretap&#39; happened because we know that it did. The only question is how legal it was.</p>

<p>This actually doesn&#39;t hurt Trump in that case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know what he intended?  And how do you know his agents have the same information that Comey has?  If there is any truth to the global elite concept that is pushed around here, then Comey likely has information that could get him and/or others killed at the drop of a hat - if he doesn&#39;t disclose certain bits of information to his agents, that could be for his own safety, and the safety of his agents and their families - if he is playing a long game, its likely he is generally alone with his thoughts - the only person you can really trust with a secret is yourself</p>
