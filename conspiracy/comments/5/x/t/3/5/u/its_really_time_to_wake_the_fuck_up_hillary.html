    <div class="md"><p>I think the OP&#39;s point was that regardless of who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;; whether Trump is being wrongfully picked on, or not, is not the subject matter for this subreddit. It has nothing to do with a &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Now, if you want a conspiracy regarding Trump, research the reasons why the Jews are destroying Trump&#39;s presidency when he is the most &quot;pro-Israel&quot; and most &quot;pro-Jewish&quot; president we have ever had. </p>

<p>Maybe they are &quot;destroying&quot; his presidency and Trump is playing along with it to divide Americans even further. It&#39;s all scripted. Now, that would be a conspiracy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, lots of people already think he has been showing it, and they&#39;re doing their best to point it out.  </p>

<p>The problem is the source of their information.  It can&#39;t be trusted.</p>

<p>Neither can Trump himself be trusted.  So where do we get the truth from?  Where do we go to see what Trump&#39;s actions REALLY mean?  No one is impartial.  Everyone has an angle.  No one can be trusted to give you the truth in the news.</p>

<p>So then what?  Wait?  Doesn&#39;t that seem dangerous?  I guess we could move on the offensive, but without actual proof, well, that&#39;s dangerous, too.</p>

<p>So then what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re argument is a version of false equivalence implying that Trump is being attacked out of proportion to Obama. That&#39;s bullshit. Obama never colluded with the Russians against his American political opponents. That&#39;s where the current administration is dipping their toes in the waters of treason. And that&#39;s why there&#39;s no comparison between how the media treats Obama vs. Trump on lying. </p>

<p>Yes, without controversy, both these guys and every other president ever is a liar. Some lied to protect others, some lied to protect themselves. Some lies got people killed. Some were in avoidance of shame. Most we&#39;ll never know about, but some are clear. And they belie questionable motivations. Do you think we should ignore the Russian connections with the Trump administration? Even if it&#39;s possible that means Putin controls they guy you voted for?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re getting at here. The people who want an independent investigation would have LOVED to let the Trump campaign fail miserably, they just didn&#39;t have this information before. The reason it&#39;s coming out bit by bit is probably because Trump keeps insulting the intelligence communities. Pissing people off who work for you is like insulting the waiter and sending your food back so they &quot;get it right this time!&quot; Not likely to produce good results.</p>

<p>I generally grant this principle, except in cases of defense of self or others. Thus, a police force who arrests rapists and murderers is morally justified, as is a military that defends against foreign invasion.</p>

<p>The Cabal is real. The manipulation of the deep state and the MSM are real... all conspiracies connect to the hidden hand of power. Actual murderers and pedophiles have been running the country - the world - for decades, and now they want to destroy Trump because of the threat he represents to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your frustration and distrust of those around Trump - to be clear I do not trust all of them either. Some of them are definitely villains... I would have preferred Sanders, but Clinton literally cheated him out of the race... but what outcome would you have preferred and what solutions do you suggest? </p>

<p>If you are awoken to a global Cabal that has manipulated us, you must see some of the things happening now with politicians and media trying to overthrow Trump. If you are &#39;woke&#39; you can easily see who is behind it, and that these people need to go to jail.</p>

<p>If you are &#39;woke&#39; you know that pedogate is real and these people must pay.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see that Loretta Lynch is calling for insurrection? That everyone who sided with Clinton and Obama are out for Trump&#39;s blood? Isn&#39;t that at least a partial clue into the mindset of those who have held power for all these decades?</p>

<p>And for the record, I am also anti-Zionist... pro ET disclosure, and a supporter of all the other non-political conspiracies. Trump is not a likable guy, he is surrounded by bad people - but the people who oppose him are so much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on how you define defending him. Do you mean defending his policies - something no-one anywhere is really doing? The fact is that the country did vote toward the right and a lot of people on reddit cannot accept conservativism whatever. But Trump is also legitimately being attacked by the media and the DNC outright. Much of that is raging hypocrisy and represents a potential conspiracy that the hard leftists don&#39;t want to see. Is Trump a threat to the NWO? So therein lies what you might call Trump support from this sub. Being this is &#39;conspiracy&#39; that means we don&#39;t have he same set of issues you have. We probably don&#39;t believe in global warming and we don&#39;t support multi-culturalism much. Probably the real issue is: you don&#39;t belong here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having them in her home is silly, I&#39;m for helping the homeless but i don&#39;t want them moving in.  If she&#39;s for having them in her country and having her tax dollars go towards supporting them, that sounds   reasonable. JK Rowling is infamous for giving huge sums to charity. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what she said about immigrants, Googling it pulls up many pages suggesting refugees should move into her house. To me, it sounds like she took a stance and opponents are attacking her personally and her assumed motivations rather than her argument.</p>

It becomes magnified when the person spouts all these ethical ideas, but then never acts upon them apart from maybe re-posting something on facebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think there will be a day where user anonymity must be tied to a real person across the internet? Like if I had to tie my Reddit account to Facebook (but my real name remain private to other users)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I doubt it honestly. That&#39;s part of what makes something like Reddit work. The fact that you can say whatever you are <em>actually</em> thinking with nearly no consequences. The karma system is a good way to &quot;<em>limit</em>&quot; what can be said on few of being the outcast. Plus people change their opinions and views all the time, if you tied that to a real account with names, then that person would be <em>branded</em> by users forever and never allowed to grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarifying my point. This is what I meant. It&#39;s anonymous, but if I want to create a new account I would have to delete my current one and verify I&#39;m a real person. Right now we can have essentially an infinite number of accounts with a finite number of internet users. 1 person can reflect the &quot;opinions&quot; of what appears to be 100 people and no one would really know. What appears to be the majority could in fact be a very small minority.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole concept of &quot;paid shills&quot; but it&#39;s an inherent flaw in any system that is built on total and complete anonymity and lack of control. It&#39;s a system failure that will carry over to any Reddit replacement without addressing the main concern.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I misread, that would be another better step. But then I guess it&#39;s left to consider; how easy is it to create a fake Facebook (or w.e method used), and do you want another website to have your personal information. </p>

<p>Interestingly enough there are a lot of websites that can guesstimate a lot of information about you, based of your reddit account answers. It&#39;s decently accurate (considering you don&#39;t lie), and I&#39;m not sure I would like anyone (including <em>just admins</em>) knowing my personal info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure it is an interesting concept and presents a lot of problems. I&#39;m not on one side or the other for the matter... just thought it could provoke some good comments. </p>

<p>I did see another post using an algorithm that shows information on users based on posts and it is pretty crazy how accurate it was for me. Some glaring errors in it, but it was about 75% accurate to describe me. </p>

<p>I wonder if we could use a central login method tied to your PII but then encrypt it so nothing could be tied back to you personally other than the verification that you are indeed a real person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Reddit actually wanted to improve its site, it would be easy to identify patterns and get rid of accounts like this that do nothing but enervate its integrity.  However, we all know Reddit does not care about free speech.  In fact, they actively suppress it in favor of their political leanings and allow spam like this to proliferate in order to manipulate its ever-slimming base of human users.  I am completely okay with this as it only quickens the demise of this geriatric site and opens the door for a new, better alternative.</p>

I am flattered to be listed with the likes of KingJames, Subnautica, NationalDenbt, Lily_levisour, chickyrouge.  3 of those I respect incredibly so for their independent thought.

I know I personally am Trump neutral and sometimes lean anti-Trump (especially in cases of why the heck he chose who he did for his cabinet).</p>

<p>And we post organic posts, and think organically - there is no protection here.  I find it interesting that a young account like yours is so angry and so detailed.  </p>

<p>^ Says one of the biggest Trump spammers on this site.
This dude sits in new and controversial and protects Trump all day. A bunch of accounts just like this are astroturfing. They switch accounts often, but don&#39;t need to, because they&#39;re protected here.
KingJames, Subnautica, NationalDenbt, Lily_levisour, chickyrouge. Nothing but pro-trump astroturfers who have co-opted this sub.
Likely, these are all sock puppets for a small group of powerusers. They&#39;re saying russian is the one being paid, but projection is now how this place gets by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is a hot topic lately. The 2016 shit show got everyone fired up. One of my best friends pretty much stopped talking to me for a while because I wouldn&#39;t STFU. I had to make a conscious effort to not mention politics at all when we spoke to eventually get a decent conversation out of him. Before that he kept conversations brief and to the point. It took me about a week to finally snap that I&#39;d burned all my political currency and another two weeks to get past the walls he&#39;d put up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend was a liberal but he&#39;s been leaning the other way. His father in law is almost constantly watching Fox News. I think his influence has had it&#39;s effect. The kids spend a lot of time with the father in law so my friend is over there a lot picking them up and dropping them off. I guess I was trying to influence my friend back to what he once believed. </p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m trying to get rid of the labels Republican and Democrat. IMO, they&#39;ve dominated politics in America for long enough. There are more than 2 flavors of ice cream for a reason. It&#39;s unnatural to try to group such a large number of individuals into only two types.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, people are pretty tribal. They&#39;ll stick with &quot;their team&quot; no matter what. If they loose they&#39;ll just try harder the next time around. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking into a new political movement. I don&#39;t know all that much about them yet but I do like what they appear to stand for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thinkprogress is compromised, owned by moneyed interests. IDK about OurRev since it&#39;s Sanders&#39; but it could have the same fate.  The site this person linked also has a <a href="https://partyofreasonandprogress.org/blog/2017/02/04/spot-fake-news-avoid-perpetuating-stupidity/">whole article</a> about fake news and how we should be ignoring headlines like &quot;Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Investigated For Child Trafficking&quot; and &quot;Top Official Set to Testify Against Hillary Clinton Found DEAD.&quot;</p>

<p>Wh... why ignore those things? Ignore the deaths of people like Seth Rich or John Ashe? The article says this kind of awareness perpetuates stupidity but I think that&#39;s a case of projection. I think articles like this, which showed up on any facet of MSM including fucking <em>POLYGON</em>, are meant to dumb us down and lower the common denominator for rational thought. The elite is maniacal.</p>

The weird part is now that I know so much more about various things thanks to the season I basically am afraid to ever bring up politics around most of them again outside of like 2 people that are pretty hip to things like surveillance or MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I also went on a retweeting spree after seeing a constant wave of anti-trump stuff. I had to cool down though, it&#39;s easy to get so worked up about this stuff that you lose some self-consciousness. Same with some of the stuff here. You see a few Hillary or Trump shill posts and then assume all of the related posts are shills. I have also done this lol. Anyways, good comment and thanks for sharing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because as we all know, conservatives are soooo good at talking to people not in their conservative bubble. Which is why they regularly say things like liberals are traitors, or not real Americans, or come up with constant conspiracies about liberals being pedophiles etc. Even in your post, you&#39;re saying &quot;regular Americans&quot; to refer to non-liberals.</p>

<p>Everyone is an American. There is no such thing as a &quot;real&quot; or &quot;regular&quot; American and conservatives use language like this, it reinforces that divide by painting themselves as  only true, patriotic Americans, and anyone that disagrees with them as &quot;others&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot; and not &quot;true&quot; Americans. When the reality is that we are all Americans that have differing view points.</p>

<p>The only time anyone talks about a &quot;regular&quot; American should be when they talk about the working class which is 90% of this country, regardless of political leaning. The only people that don&#39;t understand &quot;real&quot; Americans are the wealthy on both ends of the spectrum that pit the working class against each other in petty political squabbles. The sooner we all realize that, the better off we&#39;ll be. We shouldn&#39;t be fighting against each other, we should be fighting against the politicians and CEOs that pick our pockets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the world is as fucked as it is right now is because people refuse to look in the mirror and hold that person accountable.  We look to immediately point the finger at external authority structures.  We are to blame because we have allowed things to get this far gone.  Yes, the human population has been systematically manipulated and put under deep mind control programming.  But that is also because we have not cared enough to do anything different about it.  Most people really don&#39;t care about changing themselves from within, much less trying to effect change from without.  We need to stop handing our authority away and making excuses for our own individual agency.  Accepting our role in this fucked up chess game is the first step toward truly liberating ourselves and this planet.</p>

<p>We know that there are groups that utilize forums to shift narratives and what not. We don&#39;t know how influential, big, or successful they are and we also don&#39;t have a surefire way to identify a person who is here for that purpose.</p>

<p>Your account is too new? Probably a shill. Old account but &quot;came here from r/all?&quot; Probably a shill. Account with high karma? Must have been sold off to the highest bidder. </p>

<p>Outside of a few identifiable posters we have no way of knowing who is genuine, and even they are suspect now because they could have been given an offer they can&#39;t refuse. It&#39;s just really fucking crazy. I posted the day after Trump got elected that it would be interesting the direction this sub takes.

<p>First of all you have to show intent. It can&#39;t just be a byproduct of your actions. Here&#39;s the classic example. You have party A, party B, and party C. Party A blackmails party B into breaching a contract with party C. Party C sues party A for TI. </p>

<p>For Reddit to win a suit they would have to show a specific company either stopped contract negotiations or breached a contract because of CTR.

<p>Tortious interference with contract rights can occur where the tortfeasor convinces a party to breach the contract against the plaintiff, or where the tortfeasor disrupts the ability of one party to perform his obligations under the contract, thereby preventing the plaintiff from receiving the performance promised. <strong>The classic example of this tort occurs when one party induces another party to breach a contract with a third party, in circumstances where the first party has no privilege to act as it does and acts with knowledge of the existence of the contract.

<p>Company A hires Company B to shill (<strong>intent</strong>), thus breaking Reddit&#39;s  Content Policy &amp; User Agreement. If Reddit&#39;s users started abandoning their service for Voat <strong>because there is so much shilling on Reddit</strong> I think you&#39;ve got a case there. Though IANAL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can&#39;t just be a scenario where they might have lost out in business deals because users left the site. If that was the case they could go after users who simply stopped logging in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense because users leaving the site doesn&#39;t disrupt the ability of any part to perform their obligations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of Reddit.com is 100% gamed. The voting doesn&#39;t follow some &quot;objective&quot; algorithm. A huge percentage of the accounts are bots. The entire site is basically run by marketers. The admins are running a business - not a &quot;community.&quot;</p>

<p>The only misunderstanding here is that any every thought that reddit.com was a &quot;community&quot; or that voting wasn&#39;t &quot;rigged.&quot;</p>

<p>FFS, one of the major stories about reddit.com is the first few years it was mostly fake accounts run by the admins to give it the appearance of popularity. The first admin account had unlimited karma <strong>and it was a long running jokes.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s like online poker - how could you ever think it was NOT rigged?</p>

Between brain washed die hards spouting divisive bs on both sides (thanks CTR/T_D invasion) this sub has successfully been infiltrated and destroyed even well documented proof bearing research is debated heavily ie; PG. Now there was always skeptics but holy shit the astroturfing against it is unlike any other on almost every thread there&#39;s at least 1-2 &quot;this is such a stretch bs blah blah&quot; comment.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is dead it&#39;s now a front lines for the willing and unwilling shills from both main parties of the American government going at it deflecting and brigading any nonagenda matching thread. Even when we aren&#39;t seeing unusually high lurk numbers. </p>

<p>Reddit has been compromised. We know this people talk about it here all the time, but they fail to acknowledge that conspiracy is the sub that has it worst. 
Blatant censoring in subs is one thing but this is a more quiet method. </p>

<p>Hell even this comment is bad because it&#39;s attacking the community any OGs to the sub who haven&#39;t been caught up in their political support know what&#39;s up. I&#39;m still on a search to find a good replacement, maybe something private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t filter, but if you hit the tag icon next to their name, you can make up a tag.  Worst offender people I give a &#39;shill&#39; tag and color it red.  Some people really micro break it down.  I don&#39;t have time for that.  :)</p>

<p>Also, when you hover over someone you like, you can hit the +friend button.  That works well to highlight people whos opinion you might respect higher than others.</p>

<p>Using sockpuppets is both against the rules of the site and suspicious. </p>

<p>If someone is using a sockpuppet, it&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to hide something. I&#39;ll never put any trust in any post coming from an obvious sockpuppet.

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Sanders supporter myself, and post comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x00kq/this_literally_just_got_posted_on_4chan_and_call/deebjpc/?context=3">advocating progressive approach to economic policies</a> all the time, and they get upvoted very well on this sub.</p>

<p>Phony attempt by astroturfers to make it look like there is some sort of Trump hate fueled unity on the left will only reinforce our perception of how fake the &quot;official&quot; DNC party line is.</p>

<p>They shoved Clinton down our throats despite Sanders beating Trump in most polls, which tells me that people signing the checks to Democratic party actually preferred Trump to Sanders.</p>

<p>That the same people are now whipping their PR jockeys into a frenzy trying to make Trump look bad in order to get the left to fall in line again is the level of hypocrisy I haven&#39;t seen in a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an honest question, I&#39;m not trying to start an argument just a discussion. Let&#39;s say the Democrats would prefer Trump to Sanders and let&#39;s say Sanders had won the nomination. Do you think the Trump-Russia claim would have been made or pushed as hard? I&#39;m sure this narrative hurt Trump in the polls and would have benefited Bernie. What I find odd is that since the democrats seem to be so anti-Russia, they never attacked Sanders for visiting the Soviet Union after his wedding. I don&#39;t believe there was anything nefarious about the visit, from what I understand it was an official state trip that happened to fall on that date. If Trump had made an innocent trip like that, it would have caused major outrage and speculation from the Democrats about his ties to the soviets or KGB. I personally believe Hillary threatened Sanders and maybe his family if he didn&#39;t fall in line. What&#39;s the guy to do at that point? He didn&#39;t have the resources or the entourage to fight back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He certainly would&#39;ve pushed the limits of what could be done &quot;within the system&quot;. Presidency also a position that allows you to steer a lot of public debate your way.</p>

<p>Obama may have a very questionable record of what he actually did as a president, but he inspired a lot of public debate about economic justice, which I believe contributed to mainstreaming of ideas started by OWS.</p>

<p>Sanders popularity beyond fringe left was likely a result of that. With Sanders being president the Overton window would&#39;ve continued the shift towards more progressive discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not weird. But Trump also isn&#39;t really part of the system. For example, the system is pushing the Russia conspiracy. That&#39;s the system / government&#39;s doing. </p>

<p>Why would this sub be interested in doing the investigative work the government is already doing? That&#39;s like this sub trying to corroborate the government&#39;s 9/11 story. It&#39;s ridiculous. The government has its own story, and we don&#39;t need (or want) to be farming the same land.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this sub so thoroughly rejects the Russia stuff. If you have another Trump conspiracy that our government isn&#39;t already trying to force down our throats, then let&#39;s talk about it. But unfortunately the Russia stuff will never play well here.</p>

The FBI has greatly helped Trump become the president.
The White House is filled to the roof with the oligarchs that have pulled the strings of the world so far.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Trump is part of the system because both sides of congress didn&#39;t really want him there, but we elected him anyway. That makes him part of the system obviously. Really clutch analysis on your part.</p>

<p>And they&#39;re already investigating Russia. And they&#39;re going to keep investigating Russia. Just because Democrats won&#39;t shut the fuck up about a bipartisan congressional investigation doesn&#39;t mean bipartisan investigations aren&#39;t already happening.</p>

<p>Democrats want a circus like Benghazi, which is understandable. But both intel committees and the FBI are already actively investigating this. Stop blindly regurgitating dumb Democrat talking points. Hey buddy -- they&#39;re already on it. You can shut up now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not butt hurt about your sense of humor. Well, your sense of humor does suck, but people like you have turned an investigation about government pedophilia into some narrowly defined thing about one pizza place. That&#39;s not what happened.</p>

<p>That one pizza place happened to have some sketchy circumstantial evidence at the height of the investigation on Reddit. But it was never about that one pizza place. It started off as an investigation into John Podesta&#39;s weird sexual habits / art collection, then expanded into his role in covering up pedophilia and human trafficking.</p>

<p>Once it got to that point, it expanded into something much greater, including the highest levels of government actively involved in trafficking + covering up investigations. Yet you&#39;re sitting there making jokes about pizza like you know the whole story. The Podesta brothers are freaks. They also happen to be Democrats. That shouldn&#39;t invalidate the entire conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every conspiracy almost ever has been about the deep state, about how the media will deliberately lie and implore bias to make a candidate against their agenda look bad, and how anyone seeking to fight the deep state will be crushed and ridiculed.</p>

<p>OF COURSE Trump is going to be a part of this discussion. This isn&#39;t a place for only your fantasy conspiracies to come to fruition. We literally have evidence of pedophilia among the elites and you want us to talk about aliens just because those elites happen to be a part of your political alliance that you are emotionally attached to?</p>

<p>This is ridiculous, people are defending Trump because he is clearly an enemy of the deep state and is the culmination of much of what conspiracy &quot;theories&quot; set out to expose and correct. You literally have someone who beat the deep state, lying media, propaganda, and shills, and is firing and destroying deep statesman in the intel agencies and crushing pedophilia, and you&#39;re asking us to not take sides and instead talk about aliens and Antarctic bases? What happens when we find the elite on Antarctic bases are part of your political leaning? What happens when Trump is getting rid of them in the background? Find some other farfetched fantasy conspiracy theory? Get out of here. Anyone saying to not talk about Trump hasn&#39;t been paying attention to conspiracy theories for any significant amount of time. All the theories have been coagulating in 2016 with the election, pedophilia, media propaganda/collusion, funding rebel groups, paying websites to shill, funding terrorists in the Middle East (for many reasons as many conspiracies explain), etc. AND TRUMP IS AT THE CENTRE OF ALL OF THAT AND WE&#39;RE SUPPOSED TO NOT TALK ABOUT HIM!?</p>

I think OP may actually be a pro-Trump shill spreading the narrative that we have to be on the defensive against anti-Trump voices.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, I hope OP knocks it off.  There&#39;s already enough to be done without anyone stirring the pot to make things worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying that we should be constantly suspicious that everyone is a false-flagging agent trying to ram our political groups and movements in the ground. Rather, I’m saying that we should avoid creating constructs that outright facilitate these sort of tactics. <strong>People who cause problems while claiming to share our allegiances</strong> should be viewed in the same light as those openly against us, and subject to the exact same dissuasion tactics we would show them if they had declared themselves our opponent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis added.  Anyone who opposes Trump should oppose the sort of shill campaigns that have raised up his popularity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As Marine Le Pen said, &quot;Now, the split isn&#39;t between the left and right, but between the Globalists and the Patriots.&quot; </p>

<p>The people fighting to expose the successful plan by a Globalist secret society to infiltrate our government are not explicitly Trump supporters. They are Patriots.</p>

<p>However, the people being paid to shill for CTR or ShareBlue, or liberals who have been tricked into echoing a false narrative, crafted by the Mainstream Media, are unwittingly siding with the Globalists. </p>

<p>This is not LEFT and RIGHT anymore. It&#39;s FREEDOM vs OPPRESSION.  </p>

<p>Which side are you on? The PATRIOTS? or the GLOBALISTS?</p>

<p>You want us all to sit nicely while our country is used as a front for a human trafficking and drug ring? While they fund terrorists and then spend millions of our taxpayer dollars to &quot;fight&quot; them? While they illegally surveil and wiretap millions of Americans covertly?</p>

<p>You&#39;re the only one being partisan here, by failing to see through the bullshit LEFT/RIGHT dichotomy the media laid out for you. </p>

<p>Taking down Globalists doesn&#39;t make you a Trump supporter. It makes you a Patriot and an American. America has fought against Globalists plots since we were a scrappy little colony. Their tactics have just frown much more secretive and insidious. </p>

<p>You&#39;re either fighting to expose the Globalists, or you are part of the millions of people brainwashed into helping their agenda of destruction, by staying silent.</p>

<p>&quot;All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.&quot;

<p>Just my opinion, but I&#39;m just not sure how you back away from some sort of globalism at this point without a lot of people here in the US getting fucked over even more. </p>

<p>Again, just my thoughts but I definitely do not align myself with super nationalistic ideas. Just seems kinda old fashioned and indicates to me ignorance of the issues we face today.

<p>But how does that prove that he benefits from a global government? </p>

<p>He was against the EU, because the regulations caused him to make LESS money in Europe. The only people who benefit from a Globalist Oligarchy are the few people in charge. And he&#39;s nowhere near rich enough to sit at that table. </p>

<p>He holds stock in plenty of companies that outsource work and hire HB1 employees in the U.S. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All these things are examples of him taking advantage of GLOBALIZATION. </p>

<p>I asked for proof that he was benefitting from GLOBALISM. </p>

<p>Globalism means: the operation or planning of economic and foreign policy on a global basis.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t part of the small group of people making decisions and policies that will impact and impoverish the rest of the globe. But I bet if you search r/conspiracy for the term &quot;Globalist&quot;, you&#39;ll see who I&#39;m referring to. </p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve spent 14 trillion on wars designed to seize other nation&#39;s property for the enrichment of the U.S. instead of putting that money back into our citizens&quot;</p>

<p>Trump hasn&#39;t spent 14 trillion on wars. He&#39;s only been president for a month and a half. He increased spending in DEFENSE. It is a separate budget from the Military, a common mistake. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately many Americans confuse defense spending with military spending. The two terms are used almost interchangeably. But there is a huge difference.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The military budget is something very different from the defense budget. The military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the United States, but to enrich the military-industrial complex, benefit special interests, regime-change countries overseas, maintain a global US military empire, and provide defense to favored allies. The military budget for the United States is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://eaglerising.com/38482/theres-a-huge-difference-between-military-spending-and-defense-spending/">Source</a> </p>

<p>The Military budget, in part, goes to the Military-Industrial-Complex, the same people who are currently trying to overthrow Trump. </p>

<p>Trump has vowed to restructure the military spending budget drastically, I presume in hopes to exert some leverage, as the President has ZERO power over the Military-Industrial-Complex. </p>

<p>It&#39;s gonna be an interesting fight to watch play out, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>That is not true at all. Its the exact same budget. Calling the military budget &quot;defense spending&quot; is old and straightforward propaganda, dating from when we renamed the &quot;Department of War&quot; to the &quot;Department of Defense&quot;.  Whatever your &#39;source&#39; (eagelrising.com? really?) says is just false.</p>

<p>Trump has also talked repeatedly about invading Syria, seizing middle eastern oil, increasing our nuclear arsenal and attacking Iran. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t actually read much, huh? Your google search, which brought up your ridiculous eaglerising.com source also brought up the somewhat saner American Conservative, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Brooks has a headache:</p>

<p>To be honest, my brain has hurt ever since Ron Paul made that distinction between military spending and defense spending in the debate the other night. Was the invasion of Normandy military spending or defense spending? What about the Battle of the Bulge? I’m totally confused.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a difficult distinction to grasp, isn’t it? It is a euphemism to refer to spending on military deployments and installations that have nothing to do with the defense of the United States as “defense spending.” This is politically useful for those in favor of larger military budgets and an activist, militarized foreign policy, since they can portray opposition to their latest proposal as an unwillingness to defend America. Americans have been pretending that spending on unnecessary wars has some relationship to national defense, even when the supposed threat being countered doesn’t exist and the U.S. and its allies start the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IE, there is 0 legal or monetary difference between military and defense spending and it is a rhetorical trick to justify bigger military budgets.</p>

<p>As for Trump&#39;s enthusiasm for military adventurism: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/25/trump-talk-keeping-iraq-oil-sparking-concerns.amp.html">Here</a> is him talking about seizing middle Eastern oil. He does this as president in an address to the CIA.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about this, but it seems like you&#39;re argueing that the &quot;FREEDOM&quot; side is the side that wants to ban Muslims from the country, drop out of NATO, shut down public schools, shut down the EPA - how does that represent freedom? How can a person be free while they&#39;re being restricted from free movement, threatened by war, unable to educate their children, force to drink lead filled water and polluted air? That doesn&#39;t sound like freedom to me, unless I&#39;ve misread your post.</p>

<p>I agree? How can one be free when that is happening. Donald Trump did not cause those things. He has been President for month and a half.</p>

<p>Those things are byproducts of our government being systematically built to support a Globalist ruling elite, rather than taking care of its people and infrastructure.</p>

<p>You are making my point for me. </p>

<p>You said Trump wanted to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ban Muslims from the country, drop out of NATO, shut down public schools, shut down the EPA&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ban Muslims? False. Read the executive order. </p>

<p>Drop out of NATO? False, Trump likes NATO, but is not a fan of the UN, rightfully so. </p>

<p>Shut down public schools? Really? C&#39;mon now. </p>

<p>Shut down the EPA? False. Deregulation gives Americans more freedom. Not less. </p>

<p>You will have more success in your debates if you show proof supporting your statements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, it&#39;s not Trump that is doing those things, in many case it&#39;s the Republicans and the globalists that&#39;s hes&#39;s put in his cabinet. The goals of people like Tillerson and Devos seem self-evident. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ban Muslims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump: &quot; Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&#39;s representatives can figure out what is going on&quot; - it&#39;s literally <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration">on his own website</a> - how&#39;s that for a source? I&#39;d love to hear a comment on that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drop out of NATO? False, Trump likes NATO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re both a little right and a little wrong. What he said was that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/">the US won&#39;t support NATO members if they don&#39;t pay up $$$$</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shut down public schools?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d urge you to do some more research on this. Here&#39;s a crappy blog that sums up my reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2017/01/20/betsy-devos-mean-end-public-education-america/">Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick to head the Department of Education, has long sought to end free public education and replace it with vouchers and for-profit charters — even though 85% of American kids attend public schools.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here are some journalist sources: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/betsy-devos-and-the-plan-to-break-public-schools">BETSY DEVOS AND THE PLAN TO BREAK PUBLIC SCHOOLS</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betsy-devos-christian-schools-vouchers-charter-education-secretary">BETSY DEVOS WANTS TO USE AMERICA&#39;S SCHOOLS TO BUILD &quot;GOD&#39;S KINGDOM&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shut down the EPA? False. Deregulation gives Americans more freedom. Not less</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False and false. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/03/epa-funding-may-be-cut-25-percent-under-trump-according-to-draft-copy-budget.html">Fox news source shows that EPA funding could be cut by 25%</a>. And even worse, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/environmental-protection-agency-bill-drafted-abolish-matt-gaetz-congress-a7556596.html">shut down completely</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/r-trumps-epa-budget-proposal-targets-climate-clean-water-programs-2017-3">More freedom to be poisoned by lead, maybe. </a></p>

<p>I hope that helps support some of my arguments. </p>

<p>YES. This is incredibly uncommon and is amplified by the fact that said investigation involves illegal acts commited by a sitting President. Many are looking at this as an admission of guilt as it gives credibility to the conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where I&#39;m at. This post speaks so much truth. It it mind boggling that this sub is not all over the Russia thing. Like Trump&#39;s fucking NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER resigned over this shit, his past campaign manager resigned over this shit. His CURRENT Attorney General had to recuse himself because he was caught lying under oath about talking to Russia for what Trump supporters say is (no reason at all). It is just waayy to many times and coincidences for this to be a nothing burger. </p>

<p>People need to stop being so fucking partisan and biased especially if they are going to frequent this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are in response to all the Trump bots in this sub. And a message to all the Hillary Shills here: I also want you to know that you are not helping. Fuck the system. Fuck every government in existence. Since when do conspiracy theorists defend the government? It&#39;s utter bullshit what we&#39;ve become. We used to be labeled as wackos who believed in UFOs and alien abductions. Now we are actually seen as people who defend the establishment like none other. Disgusting.</p>

<p>I think a free thinking person can fight against or fight for any system including government.  I am not going to say we should hate all government.  Why would a rational free thinking person bash a well working benevolent healthy government?</p>

<p>Bashing the system like you with your &#39;fuck the system fuck every government&#39; is just as partisan and UNTHINKING as the zealots screaming pro-republican or pro-democrat.</p>

<p>Some of us here are not so much defending the establishment as we are defending a best-chance scenario given the choices we were given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. My thoughts on paid &quot;trolls&quot; or &quot;shills&quot;. I dont think its as wide spread as users, at least many of them on r conspiracy, think it is. And it certainly isnt, or at least shouldn&#39;t be effective. Its just my observation, but people that comment on political subs usually already have their minds made up. The articles might have some sway on people. But I think the bigger issue is most of us consume media that aligns with our bias. So many of the &quot;shills&quot; are volunteers actually. We are all guilty of this to some degree. And lets face it, if a billionaire is going to buy people, they are probably buying politicians. At least thats where i spend my money.</p>

<p>It has always been a community looking for the truth - but now we find the truth conflicting with peoples ideologies and they are abandoning the truth. Trump  bots? There aren&#39;t any. Shills, yes, there are many due to some major wikileaks coverage. Unfortunately, the donald is the closest thing reddit now has to exposing falsehoods and dragging them into the light.

There used to be a far more Libertarian-like sentiments. Discussions about free energy and spiritual manipulation. On the history of the RCC and Freemasonry.  Now, it seems like any spiritual talk is about drugs or aliens. </p>

<p>There&#39;s disturbing bills in our Congress right now. Trump keeps tweeting dumb shit or allowing the media to distract itself by defending itself and bills that erode rights, further damage the environment and setting the stage for another great recession are just sailing by... </p>

Look further into the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program">HAARP array</a>.  So we know that, at least to some degree, weather and the climate are manipulable and governments and military groups possess the tools with which to do so.  The conspiracy side of it is the resulting line of questioning - what are the methods used?  Are they harmful to people or the environment in any way?  What are the long-term effects?  Is there a large-scale program to alter weather that the public is unaware of?  Using this technology can individual weather catastrophes be artificially generated and unleashed?  Have they been?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not real, man. The contrails you see are just condensation created as a byproduct of lift, and clear skies turning overcast is literally just *weather. </p>

<p>The mysterious jets &quot;spraying&quot; chemtrails are just commercial flights, many being flown out of my home airport and being piloted, serviced, and fuelled by people I know.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a small industry- everyone knows everyone- and it&#39;s not feasible that even a dozen planes could &quot;spray&quot; without everyone knowing about it. In fact, it&#39;s one of the biggest jokes we&#39;ve got.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a pilot, not a shill. </p>

<p>The science behind contrails and wingtip vortices are actually pretty interesting if you&#39;re unfamiliar with it.</p>

<p>Most contrails are just jet exhaust, which warms the air giving it the potential to accept more water vapor, and then adding the vapor itself. Once it cools to the dew point, it forms long areas of stratus clouds that flatten out depending on winds aloft, ambient temperature, and persistence of condensation nuclei.</p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly the same as the white exhaust smoke you see coming out of your car on a cold day, only thousands of times amplified. </p>

<p>You might also be thinking about clouds seemingly forming from the wingtips of commercial jets:</p>

<p>Lift is just a low pressure area forming along the top surface of a wing, and a high pressure area underneath. Air is a fluid, so it naturally wants to flow from a high to low pressure area, in this case from the bottom of the wing to the top.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="http://www.boldmethod.com/images/learn-to-fly/aerodynamics/wing-sweep/spanwise-flow.jpg">spanwise flow</a>, the separated airflows meet up at the wingtip, with the high pressure area literally wrapping around and creating a <a href="http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/aero/images/53.jpg">vortex of air.</a> Obviously with enough decrease in pressure, the air will reach it&#39;s condensation point and form visible clouds. </p>

<p>This is all simplified somewhat, but what you see is just moisture and air following the same rules and principles we see and observe daily. </p>

<p>Even if we were spraying you guys with chemtrails, you&#39;d see the exact same contrails because they&#39;re a natural byproduct of lift in certain conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem with making a sub on conspiracies in general is that you&#39;ll see a whole lot of people who, for instance, find evidence of the podesta emails being linked to other DNC heads and browse he sub.  Those people are not usually the ones who believe in the JFK assassination conspiracy, or to a greater extent the moon landings or 9/11.  Then there are the flat earthward and matrix theorists that are one step above those.  All those different levels of conspiracy mixed with different political opinions really makes this a divided sub, and when things get too contested and flaming starts there needs to be some kind of wake up call.</p>

<p><strong>Manafort (Former Trump Campaign Advisor)</strong> - RESIGNED</p>

<p>Seemingly has ties to Russia (and was paid by Russia) : </p>

<p><strong>Tillerson (Trump Secretary of State)</strong></p>

<p><strong>DNC Hack</strong></p>

<p>Russia was directly responsible for the hack according to all government sources we have and additional independent sources that worked on behalf of the DNC. We&#39;ve since announced sanctions and additional retaliation for those actions.</p>

<p>If we see sanctions getting rolled back at all its more or less the final nail in the coffin. Everything since the Dossier seems to confirm the info in the Dossier. Or we just happen to have an awful lot of Russia ties for seemingly no reason at all.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: </p>

<p><strong>Are we still doubting that Dossier? Or is the Flynn resignation due to a Russia scandal enough to start getting through to people to maybe take it a bit more seriously</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>NSA has only moderate confidence that Russia even &quot;interfered&quot; with the election. CIA and FBI (I think) said they have high confidence. Confidence is a crucial word here. Also important, is the fact that that &quot;intelligence agencies&quot; stated they weren&#39;t sure if potential interfering was to undermine confidence or to help trump. Furthermore, zero evidence has been provided that Russia was responsible for the hack outside of the generalized conclusions of &quot;confidence&quot; I mentioned previously.</p>

<p>These &quot;conslusions&quot; of Russias theorized general and undefined ends.... are actually completely separate from the theories of trump actively working with Russia for whatever they theoretically aimed to do. </p>

<p>The only evidence of so-called &quot;trump-collusion&quot;:
* a fucking server that happened to exchange data with another server in Ukraine or some shit (servers do all sorts of shit and communicate with servers around the world all the time)
* an unsupported dossier alleging outlandish shit (also evidence this was from paid opposition research from either bush or clinton and used information from a fucking 4chan larp)
* Sessions doing his fucking job and going to ambassador training event that was organized by Obama&#39;s state dpt. and answering a question sort of poorly
* Flynn doing his fucking job and losing credibility with his team through poor communication</p>

<p>Another funny thing is that Clinton&#39;s team called &quot;RUSSIA&quot; on day one of DNC leaks before there was even a possibility that they could have actually investigated that.... and they didn&#39;t even let the United States FBI look in to the source of the &quot;hack&quot;. Then they blamed the Podesta &quot;hack&quot; on Russia as well even though his password was literally password. </p>

<p>Its all a crock of shit. And for people that have been involved with conspiracy oriented material for a long time.... The fact that the entire MSM and establishment (including deep state REPUBLICANS) are actively working against Trump, speaks volumes. </p>

<p>I am a lefty by heart and I am not a Trump apologist... and calling out obvious bull shit is not shilling for Trump.</p>

<p>More and more of the dossier is being proven true and many of the Russians implicated in it have turned up dead in recent months.</p>

<p>Sessions lied under oath about talking to the Russian ambassador. And it&#39;s been proven he used campaign dollars for that business trip so he was in fact there talking to the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump affiliate.</p>

If he fucks up enough, you will have several generations of apathetic voters wanting to do everything in their power to stop it from happening again. It would ostensibly be a political revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p>Trump has a relationship with Putin, which he has denied in recent times:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier</a></p>

<p>Dossier claims possible gain of 19% share of Rosneft and not long after 19% is sold to a currently unknown party :</p>

<p>The spy who created the Dossier is highly regarded and wouldn&#39;t just make things up:</p>

<p><strong>Flynn ( National Security Advisor)</strong> - RESIGNED</p>

<p>Seemingly has a relationship with Putin :</p>

<p>The White House knew about Flynn communication with Russia : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html</a></p>

<p>Flynn has now resigned (right after the above article was posted) : </p>

<p><strong>Manafort (Former Trump Campaign Advisor)</strong> - RESIGNED</p>

<p>Seemingly has ties to Russia (and was paid by Russia) : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Tillerson (Trump Secretary of State)</strong></p>

<p>Tillerson gets put as Sec of State, has a relationship with Putin:</p>

<p>Right after Tillerson is confirmed House removes transparency rule :</p>

<p><strong>DNC Hack</strong></p>

<p>Russia was directly responsible for the hack according to all government sources we have and additional independent sources that worked on behalf of the DNC. We&#39;ve since announced sanctions and additional retaliation for those actions.</p>

<p>If we see sanctions getting rolled back at all its more or less the final nail in the coffin. Everything since the Dossier seems to confirm the info in the Dossier. Or we just happen to have an awful lot of Russia ties for seemingly no reason at all.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: </p>

<p><strong>Are we still doubting that Dossier? Or is the Flynn resignation due to a Russia scandal enough to start getting through to people to maybe take it a bit more seriously?</strong></p>

<p>I did say that I think the investigation will be interesting and I look forward to the &quot;truth&quot; on the matter coming to light for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to dissect. </p>

<p>People only see what they want to see.</p>

<p>Have you ever actually been on t_d? This sub isn&#39;t anywhere close to that subreddit. People are just doubtful about the &quot;Trump is a Russian plant&quot; narrative because one, MSM is pushing it heavily, and two, there hasn&#39;t been any hard evidence. As I said, over half of the Trump comments/submissions here would be deleted if they were posted in t_d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you have to remember that the US presidential election is a big deal and this year&#39;s was especially polarizing. People on both sides are mad and there&#39;s so much shady shit flying around its only natural that many conspiracy theories will spring up. That being said, I agree that enough is enough and I&#39;m pretty tired of every subreddit being filled with election/political material. That&#39;s why subs like politics, the Donald, Hillary Clinton, sanders for president, etc exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sign of the times. This is war. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</em></p>

<p><em>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</em></p>

<p>I think, as I have said before, this sub needs to crack down for a short period of time and just delete posts that are not related to conspiracy and are simply posts that are off-topic. Posts that are taking advantage of this subreddit&#39;s &quot;No Censorship&quot; policy and shitposting garbage on to this subreddit to the point where it is not even recognizable as a conspiracy subreddit at all.</p>

<p>We are now at, and have been far far past the point where something needs to be done. Action needs to be taken, and it has to be <em>drastic, significant and meaningful action</em>. </p>

<p>Half measures will not fix this subreddit now.</p>

<p>I believe that the mods and some of the longtime regulars of this sub need to find a way to get together and make a decision on the course of action(s) that needs to be taken in order to reclaim this sub and make it a conspiracy subreddit again. </p>

<p>The bottom line here is that it is time to do something, it can&#39;t keep going on like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left has nothing to gain at the current time from using shills, they also would likely have learned from Hillary losing that it&#39;s not very effective. Reddit is mainly people under 40, and people under 40 are usually liberal, there&#39;s not much more to it. </p>

<p>Trump was a very controversial candidate, lost the popular vote by a pretty big amount, and many people disagreed with him but voted for him because they liked Hillary even less. People are interested in what he&#39;s going to do and many are expecting him to fail, so the media is feeding into that narrative and talking about it because it gets them more views and ad revenue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve now hit a paradigm shift in government. It&#39;s no longer a struggle between the People vs Government and Party 1 vs Party 2 for control of the Government. Now, it&#39;s Government feeding on itself. Within the next four years we may actually see a former or sitting President go to prison and a person not elected by the People become President. This is potentially Fall of Rome level stuff all caused by conspiracies and cover-ups (possibly treason with a historical enemy of the State). I don&#39;t think this subreddit is best served by ignoring the problems. In fact, I think it should be made a default sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few months age there was a very selective effort to shut down any discussion of DC based pedophelia and CST. I was personally hit with several accounts that would just not let up, until  I typed the words they wanted to hear &quot;there is probably nothing to Comet and CST.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve argued with people, even rabid people online since the mid 1990&#39;s. I know what I know. </p>

<p>As a result, I rarely post here, wind up caught in partisan bickering with bots, or just miss the posts due to downvotes.</p>

<p>There appears to be an organized attempt to alter this subreddit. I am hopeful the mods can keep away from being corrupted by organized propagandists, and this returns to an area free of political theater. The political conspiracy theories have many outlets on reddit now.</p>

<p>OP is right, people need to wake up and realize what we are possibly losing here.</p>

Democracy isn&#39;t a natural state, it needs constant maintenance. Your country in particular, though it is not alone in this in the world, has been sitting without any preventative maintenance for a long time (arguably 40 - 60 years or longer). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What memes? Trump <em>is</em> Hitler. He has zero respect for human rights or the democratic process. There is a very real chance of his efforts at keeping Muslims and Mexicans out of the US escalating to violence, much like how Hitler&#39;s plan to deport the Jews escalated to murder. And there&#39;s an equally real chance of him rigging or cancelling the 2020 election, or using the false flagged &quot;violence&quot; of anti-Trump protestors as an excuse to crack down on political dissidents (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/physicalremival">in fact, this is already happening</a>).</p>

<p>Remember, we&#39;re talking about a man who praised the Tiananmen Square massacre, who supports torturing terrorists for no reason other than as a form of cruel and unusual punishment, who believes that the city of New York owes nothing to five young men falsely convicted of rape (when he himself called for their execution), who believes that the Geneva Conventions hold America back, whose solution to the problem of police brutality against black people is to flood black neighbourhoods with police and take away black people&#39;s right to bear arms, and who has never once, in his entire political career, <em>ever</em> had a kind word to say about freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It must be hard to be a Trump supporter, damn near <em>everyone</em> on the planet thinks your guy is a dickhead whos too incompetent for the job and likely corrupt, but we also don&#39;t give a fuck about hillary.</p>

<p>So when they see the constant non stop flow of aalll this justified trump hate, they just don&#39;t know what to do, they can&#39;t accept the fact that the majority of earth thinks they&#39;re an idiot for being on the side that theyre on, shit I know I wouldn&#39;t want too.</p>

<p>So when you have evidence of actual shills how could you not have a field day? &quot;Oh, this many people don&#39;t <em>actually</em> disagree with me, they&#39;re just being paid! Cheeky hillary paying people to talk negatively on reddit about the most hated man currently on earth, she sure has a lot to gain from it!&quot;</p>

<p>CTR induces their employee to breach said employees contract with Reddit by participating in vote manipulation.

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of how any of you feel, this is the simple truth. We are more divided, we question our own community more than we question the people who pit us against each other. This is a fact. </p>

<p>This sub 2 years ago was a much more secluded corner of critical thinkers, yes we still had some mad hatters, yes we still had #FALSEFLAGATEMEME bullshit but we let that steep for a few days then dug into it. This place is one of the <strong>Most</strong> toxic places on reddit now, becasue we are <strong><em>always</em></strong> at our <strong><em>own</em></strong> throats instead of the people pitting us against eachother. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very disheartening to even <strong><em>attempt</em></strong> to bring this subject up because everybody just says, look at the shill, HEY GUYS THIS GUY ONLY HAS A 2 MONTH OLD ACCOUNT FUCK HIM AND HIS LACK OF CREDEBILITY, LOL ok, or something else that doesn&#39;t add to the conversation in <strong><em>any</em></strong> way. </p>

<p><a href="/u/citationdependent">/u/citationdependent</a> this goes out to you since you are the highest voted comment without providing any evidence. If this guy is a shill then provide evidence that he is. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t misunderstand this notion, I&#39;m not saying <a href="/u/russian321">/u/russian321</a> <strong><em>Is not</em></strong> a shill, I just see no evidence pointing out that he is in fact a shill for whoever . If he is, fuck him, if he&#39;s not then <strong><em>you</em></strong> (whoever is saying he&#39;s a shill without proving it) can go fuck off with your baseless claims.</p>

<p>I was around here when 9/11 happened, nobody was this adverserial  towards other conspiracy theorists, everyone just wanted facts that were backed up by <strong><em>evidance</em></strong>. The number one thing this sub is lacking right now is actual critical thinking.</p>

<p>The CIA labled <strong><em>us</em></strong> becasue we didn&#39;t accept their narrative then, why the fuck are you guys deepthroating the cock <strong><em>AND</em></strong> balls of the narrative that is being given to you now? Figureatively speaking of course. </p>

<p>Side note fuck spelling correctly everytime you post anywhere, we are not perfect at everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Made <a href="/r/ConspiracyWorld">/r/ConspiracyWorld</a> for quick discussions. This sub gets pretty heated and that&#39;s good, the thing is many fruitful conversations just end in &#39;where&#39;s the proof?&#39; Most of the time I just have 15 min. I still like this place for US base conspiracies. Although the problem here seems to be preference. Mods can&#39;t control who&#39;s popular. I guess the opposition just doesn&#39;t have enough clicks.</p>

<p>My two cents here if they don&#39;t want to go in this direction would be to limit the number of posts per topic. There&#39;s a lot of conspiracies just not enough time or space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some clarification is in order with this post. People say I&#39;m defending Trump when I point out the Russian story is bogus bullshit because it&#39;s coming from known purveyors of disinformation. This doesn&#39;t mean I am a Trump supporter, it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t believe Trump is full of shit, it just means I am not going to give into the &quot;Two Minute Hate&quot; because the media is telling me to. I think that people should step back and consider for a moment that the attacks directed at Trump leave us several possibilities: either Trump is the real deal and he poses a threat to the Deep State, or we are meant to believe he does. Either way, I refuse to take part in the rabid foaming at the mouth. It takes little time to point out the Democratic ties to the Russians, or the ties of anyone in politics to foreign powers that influence our policies. The fact the Democrats are acting surprised and pretending they are entirely innocent should be evidence enough that both sides are full of shit.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think that the OP mistakes what &quot;conspiracy&quot; is for. Conspiracy theorizing, or at least I always believed, is not about anti-government or anti-establishment, is rather about asking questions about things that the mainstream refuses to ask questions about. It was, I always believed, about being skeptical of <em>everything</em>. It seems that it has instead steadily devolved into anti-government, anarchist bullshit. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how overwhelming the support from the left is. I seem to remember her losing the election because she through Bernie under the bus and the leftist voter base told her to go fuck herself.  All she  had going for her was not being literally Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has become an absolute shill factory. When SandersForPresident became a legitimate threat to the status quo, they started sinking in their claws. Look at the front page. It&#39;s dominated by like 20 anti-Trump subreddits that have popped up over the past couple months, and all of the default subs are totally compromised. It&#39;s sad because it&#39;s obvious and (most) redditors aren&#39;t mouth breathers. Very boring website now.</p>

There are essentially zero people on this sub defending Killary, and, in most cases, the defense of Trump is justified; there is significant evidence indicating that this particular <em>&#39;President of the Goddamn United States&#39;</em> is not in league with the PTB. I don&#39;t like Donald Trump and I certainly didn&#39;t vote for him, but virtually everything that&#39;s going on with him right now deserves the attention of conspiracy researchers &amp; theorists, and it&#39;s actually in our best interest to help head off (through simple truth telling) this clear effort to impeach him and insert a loyal puppet.</p>

<p>belief, religion, tradition, philosophy, opinion, perspective, prevent Lucidity.</p>

<p>They act like a filter, which limits, distorts, shapes and colors all perceptions.</p>

<p>Therefore, your brain never Perceives anyone or anything as it actually is.</p>

<p>Moreover, they invent the illusion of division, separation, and disconnection among human beings, which leads inevitably to conflict, violence, and suffering.</p>

<p>See the danger.</p>

<p>The brain must be Totally Free in order to Perceive what is...the isness, the fact, the act, the actual...what is actually taking place from moment to moment, free of any interpreter or censor.</p>

<p>Then and only then can there be Love, Peace, Joy, Kindness, Goodness, Compassion (Passion for All), Beauty, Creativity, Feeling, ExperiencING, Lucidity, Truth, Wisdom...in Communication, Communion, Relationship with everyone and everything, for the very first time, in each and every moment of daily life.</p>

<p>So first Inner Total Freedom. Then and only then can there be Outer Total Freedom in the society.</p>

<p>Only such a brain can usher in a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.</p>

<p>Without Inner Total Freedom, we will only be moving from one form of tyranny to another form of tyranny, calling it growth, progress, or evolution.</p>

<p>The guy has taken on these people publicly and you&#39;re grouping him in with them? He&#39;s called out the Bushes multiple times, despite them being from the same party..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is right. Any man or woman who seeks power only wants just that, power. If you voted then good for you but your vote is useless in a government that is made only to help the rich. This sub has turned into a page of alt right. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, there has been posts about non biased things but it gets shot down by those that love the president but he is just as much as a hack as the others. He has his darkness and we the people should take down those who are in power and give the power to the people. </p>

<p>Our voices are not heard and our lives are no concern to Washington. We all have been lied to and kept secret. Every time I&#39;m about to leave this sub I see posts like these and see how many care about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is precisely why there will never be a &#39;revolution&#39; in the way everyone thinks there will be unless drastic circumstances force one (like the power being shut off).  Because the internet gives people a platform to argue about the small intricacies of an issue rather than accepting there is an issue and doing something about it. This thread is a perfect example of that. It&#39;s not a case of &#39;the government doesn&#39;t have the people&#39;s best interests at heart&#39;, it&#39;s a case of &#39;this particular part of the government isn&#39;t as good as this one, and this person would definitely have had less of the people&#39; s interests at heart, but this person will do better because of this issue, how can you think that about that issue you&#39;re a fucking shill, etc etc etc etc etc&#39; until the end of time. By all means continue to argue amongst yourselves, that&#39;ll solve the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to keep up with who&#39;s a shill and who&#39;s not a shill these days within the truth movement. Now I realize I&#39;ll probably be accused of being a shill, but it seems like the term gets thrown around pretty liberally, but I guess every group needs it&#39;s buzzwords. Now what would be great is, in an attempt to identify these pesky individuals maybe someone could do a &quot;Daily Shill Report&quot;. The question is though, how would we know they aren&#39;t a shill themselves. Another good idea is maybe someone could do a video like &quot;A Trusty Guide to Identifying a Shill&quot; or &quot;The Top 10 Reasons Why You Might Be A Shill&quot;. Once again though, anyone taking on this arduous task would need to be vetted very carefully for shillary themselves by a trusted board of certified individuals who aren&#39;t shills either. I do have to say trying to keep up with these shills seems like exhausting work especially when we already have to deal with all these damn racists and Nazis as well.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The president, though he may be rich and therefore nothing like us, is not a typical politician. The &quot;elite&quot; that play dress-up at rituals in the woods got really mad when he was running. The media takes a shit on him every day. Whatever you believe about his intentions, Alex Jones himself supports Trump. </p>

<p>Now this could all be a ruse and planned from the beginning, of course. It could be the same old shit. For NOW, I&#39;m gonna wait and see. I&#39;m not willing to shit on him simply because he&#39;s rich and part of the government now. </p>

<p>I find it funny that people who enjoy conspiracy theories are completely unwilling to give Trump a chance. In my eyes, he was the first person elected that I could conceivably imagine shouting &quot;THEY&#39;VE GOT ALIENS, I SAW THEM!&quot; on Twitter. </p>

<p>When nothing has changed a few years down the line, I&#39;ll be right there with you, saying fuck Trump. I&#39;m not going to feel like a fool, I&#39;ve always been cautiously optimistic and skeptical. </p>

<p>I agree? How can one be free when that is happening. Donald Trump did not cause those things. He has been President for month and a half.</p>

<p>Those things are byproducts of our government being systematically built to support a Globalist ruling elite, rather than taking care of its people and infrastructure.</p>

<p>You are making my point for me. </p>

<p>You said Trump wanted to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ban Muslims from the country, drop out of NATO, shut down public schools, shut down the EPA&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ban Muslims? False. Read the executive order. </p>

<p>Drop out of NATO? False, Trump likes NATO, but is not a fan of the UN, rightfully so. </p>

<p>Shut down public schools? Really? C&#39;mon now. </p>

<p>Shut down the EPA? False. Deregulation gives Americans more freedom. Not less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He certainly would&#39;ve pushed the limits of what could be done &quot;within the system&quot;. Presidency also a position that allows you to steer a lot of public debate your way.</p>

<p>Obama may have a very questionable record of what he actually did as a president, but he inspired a lot of public debate about economic justice, which I believe contributed to mainstreaming of ideas started by OWS.</p>

<p>Sanders popularity beyond fringe left was likely a result of that. With Sanders being president the Overton window would&#39;ve continued the shift towards more progressive discourse.</p>
