       I'm not sure about everyone else's area, but in ohio its been snowing one day and then 70 degrees the next few days. Constantly rising or falling 40 degress is not normal, but I don't see anyone seriously discussing it. Like will this affect crops or our atmosphere or something?

       It's the new normal. It gets more and more strange every year. Two years ago it was in the 80's in Chicago in February. This year there was no snow in January or February- the first time that has happened in 146 years. Spring comes earlier and earlier every year...

       "Geoengineering" aka weather manipulation using HAARP and chemtrails.  There's been a massive increase in the amount of chemtrails seen in our skies all over the country and around the world in the last year or so.  They're essentially trying to control and weaponize the weather.  Man try to control mother nature is destined for disaster on a grande scale.

       Start paying attention to sunsets, especially on clear and sunny days. Even if the sky is 100 percent clear during the day and the forecast calls for a clear night, clouds will suddenly start forming on the horizon. Every. single. day. I don't remember the last time I saw a cloudless sunset.

       Weather patterns here in Vegas are goofy too. It is usually brisk and pleasant this time of year. We get like 2 weeks of what other places would probably call Summer, that we call Spring...before the blast furnace turns on. But, it has been really chilly, and then really warm on and off. It is like the weather doesn't know what it wants to be.

       Chicago had no snow in January or February. 6 consecutive days with temperatures above 60 degrees in February. A few days of temperatures at or above 70 in February.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people fail to realize about global warming is that it doesn't cause climate
       <em>
        change
       </em>
       , it causes climate
       <em>
        decay
       </em>
       -- erratic weather that can't be predicted and sometimes can't be survived by local plants and animals. So drought one year. Flooding the next. Heat in the winter. Cold in the summer. And more storms. (Like the February tornado that passed south of Chicago a couple nights ago.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime, critters that weren't supposed to survive the usual deep freeze survive and wreak all kinds of havoc on plants, animals and people-- see emerald ash borer, Japanese beetle, scarlet lily beetle, lyme disease, west nile, etc. Mixed them all together, stir the pot erratically and you eventually have an ecosystem collapse on your hands.

       If HAARP is doing anything, it's trying to mitigate how the planet is reacting to CO2 levels. But it ain't working.

       I can't say about the weather in your state, but we have had an usually snowy winter in some places out west.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided a while ago that climate and weather are too complicated for a lay person such as myself to form any strong opinions on the causes of these things. I have read about haarp and I think it's plausible that the ptb would engineer weather patterns for various reasons. I also think climate change/"global warming" is plausible. So anyway, take my comment with as many grains of salt as you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as this year goes, I was reading at the start of the winter that this was a La Niña year, and that they were predicting more snow in my area due to that. As I understand it, El Niño / La Niña are fairly predictable multiyear cycles of the temperatures of the pacific currents, and mess with the winters in the US in ways that are relatively predictable. It has to do with evaporation, effects on air temperatures etc, but the gist of it is that this has been a wacky winter but it is consistent with the forecasts I had read about in nov or dec.

       Was 75 yesterday in NJ and tomorrow it's supposed to snow and be in the thirties. Then next week back up into the 60's. Extremely weird weather this whole winter
