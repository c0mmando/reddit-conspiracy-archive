<p>In this newest video Robert David Steele, who came onto the pizzagate scene late, attempts a limited hangout. First he says he want to make clear that he thinks the truth should come out, but no arrest should be made. He says he thinks it is best to get all the truth out, move the guilty aside, and then not seek criminal charges, but move on and reconcile. Focus on supporting America and Trump with them gone and not dwell on the past. He says this at 6:40 mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/TqyKJ0R_ytM?t=6m40s">https://youtu.be/TqyKJ0R_ytM?t=6m40s</a></p>

<p>Once a spook always a spook?</p>

<p>This is what spooks do. He shows up at the 11th hour with this &quot;arrest are petty and counterproductive&quot; nonsense.Look at how the two host nod in agreement. &quot;yeah definitely agree&quot;. We need to move forward not focus on the past. Is there anybody in there right mind that feels if everything comes to light, arrest are not needed? You can do this with impunity and walk away? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the problems with those who say &quot;once a spook always a spook&quot; is that they lack intelligence. An intelligence person would examine the eight books I have written critical of secret intelligence, note that of those books have Forewords written by former Chairmen of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and wonder if perhaps my being the most published critic of secret intelligence in the English language might signify that I am a professional intelligence officer who seeks to redirect the craft of intelligence away from spies and secrecy promoting war and waste, toward open sources fostering peace and prosperity for everyone.</p>

<p>An intelligent person would examine my various vidoes, including my recent RT video with Sean Stone where I tear John Brennan a new asshole in the air, and perhaps conclude that I am what I appear to be, a totally transparent intelligence (and electoral reform and governance and economic and social) reformer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you will reconsider your rather harsh stance on whistleblowers - both CIA and others.  In order to be a whistleblower, one has to either be &quot;crazy&quot; OR value integrity to the degree they are willing to face harassment/retaliation (while still employed,) risk their job (and in many instances their <em>career</em> - there is a difference,) lose their reputation/perceived credibility, and experience other collateral damages like marriage dissolution, loss of friends, and financial ruin.  No one in their right mind is going to choose this path without firmly believing that something very wrong is occurring, and it needs to stop.  Unfortunately, the system is constructed in such a way, that, to go through the &quot;proper channels,&quot; the whistleblower is reporting to the very people committing the wrongs - or at least the people who are motivated to protect the wrongdoers (one reason why the corruption is usually top-down - people who &quot;cooperate&quot; get promoted.)  Many whistleblowers only &quot;come out&quot; to the public after <em>years</em> of going through the &quot;proper channels&quot; has proved fruitless.   Despite so-called &quot;Whistleblower protection laws&quot; there is no real protection for whistleblowers.  Even when it gets to the point where there&#39;s an actual investigation, Senate hearing, etc, and it&#39;s obvious to everyone that the whistleblower is telling the absolute truth, they still get no support - Even if every member of Congress is shaking their heads at the &quot;wrongdoing,&quot; do you ever a whistleblower get their job back?  Do you ever see a public statement vindicating the whistleblower for telling the truth?  No. In fact, you are more likely to see the &quot;guilty&quot; quietly permitted to resign (with full retirement pensions,) discreetly transferred to another agency/area (in the position or even a promotion, ) and have much of anything they did, admitted or not, be sealed/protected from disclosure to any future employers, etc.   </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the best way to prevent future criminals, is to let the current criminals off, scot free, with no accountability?</p>

<p>I would think arrests, trials, and jail are the only ways we stop this and keep it from happening again.</p>

<p>Epstein was exposed, but the recent filing from Boies Schiller law firm says that he was continuing to operate an international sex trafficking ring while under investigation and after being released from prison. The Clintons have been exposed, but are still in the spotlight, with rumors of running again in 2020 or for NYC mayor. Their Foundation is still running, as well.</p>

<p>Exposing the truth is not enough. These people must be stopped.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a pretty public figure and appears in a lot of interviews over time, and has a good amount of extensive ones that are recent.

Just head over to youtube and search his name and look for a recent interview. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be disappointed. I do hope we get better verification though.</p>

Without being inside the beast and understanding its cancers, you cannot heal it.  Intelligence matters -- intelligence is decision support. We need to do evidence based governance in the public interest.  My big awakening when I briefed Occupy on electorla reform and then ran for president briefly (Reform Party) was that no amount of good intelligence -- which we do not have -- matters if you have a corrupt two party tyranny that fronts for Wall Street.

<p>Do you then discount the work of many researchers that <em>some</em> form of exotic weaponry was used in the destruction (dustification) of the twin towers?</p>

<p>Sorry to abuse the term, but A&amp;E911 has been accused of approaching &quot;limited hangout&quot; status, as they appear to ignore evidence that mere conventional explosives couldn&#39;t have produced the extent of the damage on that day. That combined with the lack of significant seismic recordings and the randomly &quot;toasted&quot; cars in the vicinity suggest another level was at play.</p>

<p>For a detailed overview of the &quot;3 levels&quot; that carried out 9/11, I highly recommend Joseph Farrell&#39;s book: <em>Hidden Finance, Rogue Networks and Secret Sorcery: The Fascist International, 9/11 and Penetrated Operations.</em></p>

<p>Farrell argues that Cheney and his ilk were merely part of the 2nd &quot;level&quot; of 9/11 planners. The <em>3rd</em> level showed its hand with the complete destruction of the towers (via unknown tech) and the acquisition of PROMIS, which allowed for penetration of &quot;the entire U.S. command structure, gaining access to top secret codes, databases, and, as its utilization by several major U.S. Defense contractors implies, may also have gained access to a variety of hidden technologies and their platforms.&quot;</p>

<p>Farrell continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, there is a space-based connection in PROMIS, one that, if penetrated, might have panicked the level two planners and plotters of 9/11 beyond anything we can imagine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These neo-Cold Warriors are trying to convince Trump that he must maintain the Obama aggressiveness and militancy toward Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and other countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This policy was originally written by the Republican George Bush administration. It&#39;s the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, and it has been accepted quietly and implemented by both parties ever since. </p>

<p>Donald Trump has been all over the board on international relations, sometimes going with the &quot;neo-Cold Warriors&quot; and sometimes against them. This is mostly all talk. His stance on making relations better with Russia is wonderful, but it does not ring true -- except to the extent that there are trillions of dollars of investment opportunities for him and his Establishment Swap friends.</p>

<p>This is not a recipe for lasting peace with Russia. This is a recipe for disaster. On the other hand, the ridiculous and absurd Russia-bAiting by the Democratic and MSM establishment is no alternative. It seems like Hegelian dialectic to me -- both parties taking (ostensibly) opposite sides on an issue so that everyone can dig their feet into the partisanship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As protests and riots continue and spread – high school students are now being organized by professional agitators and covert social media campaigns designed to foment civil stress against the President-Elect,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Republican Party -- with the help of the Chamber of Commerce and Koch brothers, have been doing this for decades. Exxon has been a major player -- and now we see the Exxon CEO in the Trump cabinet.</p>

<p>I share your concern about a &quot;purple&quot; revolution. The moment the United States steps outside of the legal process that has been in place since 1789, we risk an outcome like Egypt or Syria. </p>

<p>&quot;Agitation&quot; is an interesting word. Such things always happen. However, agitation does not produce crowds like we saw at the Women&#39;s March. Some protests are very real, whether they include agitation or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has been slow to recognize that he [needs to]  to unify the country by educating the 73% who did not vote for him, on how the system is rigged twelve different ways</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the risk of sounding like MSM, Trump will not &quot;unify&quot; the country with his viewpoints on minorities. FDR unified the country. Look at how he did it. </p>

<p>Maybe Trump doesn&#39;t <em>want</em> to recognize your excellent work on exposing how the system is rigged. On the contrary -- Trump talks about &quot;illegals&quot; voting and voter fraud. He has completely missed the boat. Paul Joseph Watson is not a credible source and someone who should <em>never</em> be cited. He and the entire Alex Jones crew are pure Republican partisans. I recommend that you read up on elections at the Brennan Center.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone not supporting a peaceful transition of power to this miracle President is a traitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Miracle president? You need to step back!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greg Palast has outlined how Arizona, Michigan, and North Carolina specifically, were wins engineered by the Grand Old Party (GOP)’s Operation Crosscheck, led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Koback. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he did, and his numbers explain the difference between &quot;winning and losing.&quot; But you try to explain them away ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Stanford University documented the theft of the nomination from Bernie Sanders by Hillary Clinton, using electronic ballot tampering,[5] Donald Trump was silent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe he was silent because his buddies in the Republican Party rigged the Democratic primaries, or maybe HRC was working with the Republicans only to be back stabbed later on -- sort of like they did with Saddam Hussein. After all, <em>who</em> has been rigging elections since 2000 after GWB stole the election. You do know that GWB stole it, right?</p>

<p>While I&#39;m on the subject of back stabbing, Donald Trump&#39;s peace claim for Russia does not ring true either. As we see now, Republicans are grumbling, but they are supporting Donald Trump in more important ways. The idea that Republicans would suddenly turn their backs on the George Bush Russia policy is laughable. Most likely, they are trying to fool Russia. Despite the Donald Trump support all over RT (where I saw you speaking recently), I am sure that the government of Russia is skeptical, and may have its own double-cross in mind. </p>

<p>As we have learned since the election, Republican James Comey is being kept on by Trump. He was the Linda Tripp of the Obama administration!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump and the GOP purging of 1.1 million black voters did not win this race</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is r/conspiracy, and you are denying or minimizing factual information to create a coincidence -- or as you would prefer to call it -- an &quot;accident.&quot; </p>

<p>But you overrate the <em>substance</em> of the WikiLeaks emails, the Clinton Foundation, and other things. While you are correct these things are significant and show that HRC is a part of the corrupt establishment, too often you take these things all the way to Republican partisan positions no supported by the evidence.</p>

<p>Regardless of that, your math doesn&#39;t work. The difference in the numbers that Greg Palast presents still may be regarded as the deciding factor. It works like this:</p>

<p>Any one of these things could have swayed the election to HRC but <em>all were required for Donald Trump</em> to come out ahead. Therefore, what Greg Palast found was <em>as much the deciding factor</em> as any of these other things. You are plain wrong on this, and the math says so.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear throughout your article -- Democrats are the evil establishment, and Republican Donald Trump is the savior. </p>

<p>I have a simpler idea. Donald Trump was chosen by the establishment -- perhaps by the leaders of <em>both</em> parties -- to claim &quot;outsider&quot; status to rehabilitate the Republican Party and make important reactionary changes befor ethe demographics make it impossible to do so.</p>

<p>And the corporate MSM played along -- first by promoting Donald Trump nonstop for about 15 months, then by suddenly taking its Hegelian side and superficially supporting HRC with low-brow polarizing content.</p>

<p>I think what you&#39;re probably referring to is overblown, and entirely depends on what you mean by minorities.  We don&#39;t see the same types of &quot;discrimination&quot; against Asian minorities that we see against Blacks, as Asians are among the highest earning groups, much more so than whites.  Jews are a minority also yet they disproportionately occupy all the most powerful positions in government, finance, media, academia, etc. Our affirmative action laws are discriminatory against whites, Asians, and Latinx.   There is discrimination all around, and the fact is, white people are the true minorities on the planet - I can&#39;t blame any of the racists or white nationalists one bit for wanting to &quot;check out&quot; and have a place for themselves, since all of their countries are being invaded, against their will in many places, which will change their cultures, general behaviors, and demographics forever.  It&#39;s the people that make a country, not it&#39;s laws, not it&#39;s magic dirt, and we have a variety of different people on the planet with different behaviors, beliefs, and standards.   Is the racist the society the one I want to live in? No, but I believe they should have their sovereignty and freedom of association if they so choose.  I&#39;m very much anti-authoritiarian in that way.</p>

<p>He claims CIA is, among many other things, spreading Phoenix-style programs in other countries around the globe--Iraq, Afghanistan, etc...</p>

<p>It makes sense to me--we know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ca1HsC6MH0"><strong>James Steele</strong></a> helped train Iraqi police forces as torture/death squads...out of this came ISIS.</p>

<p>My theory is that Julian Assange is a limited hangout to cover up the much darker truths about what really went down in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why on Earth would we want to disengage the empire with a hollowed out manufacturing base at home?</p>

<p>At the very least it seems rational to maintain it until we rebuild here.  The creditworthiness of the nationstate and value of the dollar derive from military prowess and not much else these days.</p>

<p>The last thing we want to do is an ill-conceived withdrawal allowing the dollar to be chucked from world reserve currency status - continuing the predatory cycle of international banking cabal moving through and using a variety of nationstates in their perpetual fiat-&gt;gold-&gt;fiat-&gt;gold cycle.</p>

<p>The only viable way forward is to exploit our virtually unlimited credit line to start making trillions of dollars of good, productive investments which will in turn obviate the need for the empire, but also make it stronger than ever as a resurgent engine of wealth.  Withdrawal must be done from a position of strength, not weakness - unless you are counseling us to pursue it as part of the CIA&#39;s longstanding balkanization strategy against nationstates capable of opposing the cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of thing seems naively appealing but has very fundamental flaws.  Some years ago before 9/11/01, William Cooper created the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence.  The idea of open source intelligence networks is nothing new.</p>

<p>But, it didn&#39;t get us anywhere.  Why?  The &quot;deep state&quot; or &quot;powers that be&quot; assassinated people that were doing this sort of thing.</p>

<p>If you want a truly open source intelligence platform, we have to first address the problem that the United States is at present a closed, totalitarian society whose government assassinates intellectually capable and morally upright dissidents.</p>

<p>While Mr. Steele&#39;s ideas might have some merit (as did CAJI) he is putting the cart before the horse here.  For an open source intelligence agency to truly be viable, what we really need is to restore the first amendment in some way.  And on this point he offers no viable solution, which renders the whole idea irrelevant.</p>

<p>There are technological solutions however.</p>

<p>One thing we might do is to create whistle blower centers in every major city in the country.  There can be a variety of options available, like live streamed cameras whose feeds are also archived.  The servers / backbone of such a system of course has to be open source to the public for transparency.  There should be options to plug in a flash drive and upload contents to the public immediately, to inhibit the possibility of the deep state&#39;s assassins preventing this process from working on more detailed and lengthy whistle blowing processes.</p>

<p>This sort of technological solution need not be limited to whistle blowing centers, though they may receive more immediate crowd attention.  There is no reason why we can&#39;t put an open source design &quot;cell phone&quot; onto the market (government should put them out to every citizen at no cost) that is not individually identifiable.  One time anonymous keys for communication would enable people to connect to public archive servers and submit data anonymously from anywhere in the world.  A few satellites over America that are designed in a public transparent manner would thus grant Americans something they have not had in a long time: the ability to speak freely.</p>

<p>These sorts of systems will render Mr. Steele&#39;s concerns about the failings of intelligence agencies completely irrelevant.  It is not, and has never been the case, that the intelligence community is &quot;failing.&quot;  It is failing the American people, but that is by design.</p>

<p>The problem is that the people have no free speech.  We must address root problems, not superficial redressing that ignores the elephant in the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not an argument friendo.  Neither of us can prove whether I have read it or not (I have).</p>

<p>The problem for you is you&#39;ve already conceded my point.  Telling us about presidents getting assassinated and massively pedophile networks despite hard evidence being absent from the public commons means: (1) whistle blowing is effectively and systematically suppressed (i.e. we have no free speech, as I asserted), or (2) you are just making shit up out of whole cloth (I don&#39;t believe that and you certainly wouldn&#39;t admit it)</p>

<p>So, we&#39;re left with only one choice: free speech doesn&#39;t exist, we&#39;re not in an open society, therefore open intelligence can&#39;t be a solution.</p>

<p>I realize you are unable to acknowledge this truth given that you are a company man, but it still needs to be said.  I&#39;ll cover what you can&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steele is not allowed to tell the full truth and even worse he is required to hustle lies mixed into what he says (muh aliens).  My point is not to be hostile towards the worthy aspects.  As another huge fan of Cooper and CAJI, the open source intelligence is obviously appealing.  What must be said, but Steele cannot deal with, is that there are fundamental problems that prevent open source intelligence from working right now (his agency assassinating people who try to engage in such things).  I gave a couple examples of how we can start to remedy those problems and thus make open source intelligence actually viable rather than a cosmetic change to save the CIA&#39;s approval ratings.</p>

<p>What is going on here is that the CIA has launched a full court press to redeem itself to the public because they know we are all onto them.  We cannot and will not tolerate a simple rebranding by them (&quot;open source intelligence&quot;) without <em>truly</em> making it open source: resuscitating free speech in society.</p>

<p>The company does not approve of that, only of the rebranding process to perpetuate the con, so Mr. Steele cannot speak to how to address the lack of free speech in society or how we might remedy that.  I&#39;m commenting to fill that gap, not to reject the open source idea altogether.  Even better, by forcing the issue into the open Steele and his bosses at the CIA will have to tweak their propaganda to accommodate, so I am also working to grant him broader scope to speak.  Really I am more on his side than even he is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(his agency assassinating people who try to engage in such things)</p>

<p>When you say &quot;his agency&quot; isn&#39;t it pretty clear he&#39;s saying things that are severely damaging, far more than a limited hangout like Snowden? Just the pedophilia stuff is enough to crash the whole system.</p>

<p>Do you have any hard evidence it&#39;s limited hangout, or just piecing together circumstantial? You can lie if you need to.</p>

<p>How does one join the CIA?</p>

<p>How connected is the CIA to foreign intelligence agencies i.e. MOSSAD?</p>

<p>What role does secret societies i.e. Skull n bones, bohemian grove, monies, jesuits, etc play in vetting/recruiting future IC ops?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does one join the CIA?</p>

<p>Apply by mail with a thoughtful resume.  Preference is given to veterans who speak foreign languages and have advanced degrees.</p>

<p>How connected is the CIA to foreign intelligence agencies i.e. MOSSAD?</p>

<p>VERY.</p>

<p>What role does secret societies i.e. Skull n bones, bohemian grove, monies, jesuits, etc play in vetting/recruiting future IC ops?</p>

<p>Integrated at the highest levels in that there is a globalist agenda that the dark side of CIA support, but invisible to 90% of the good people trapped in thats bad system.</p>

<p>Can Julian Assange be trusted? What role did growing up in a cult play into his radicalization?</p>

<p>Everyone has multiple masters and multiple agendas.  On balance I think he has been a force for good.</p>

<p>Does the CIA do ANY good for the American ppl, or are they just domestic terrorists?</p>

<p>Short answer is no in their present form -- as General Zinni has pointed out, they provide less than 4% of what anyone needs, but see my various links elsewhere on what needs to be done -- I would eliminate NSA, NRA, NGA, and ODNI, but I would EXPAND CIA with signals and imagery directorates, triple FBI and create an Open Source Agency that would be the baseline for what can be done with open sources and methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about keeping the money moving.  I and other experts agree that we would have a better government if it were cut by 50% or more.  Furthermore, I do not believe the government should be allowed to tax citizens or anyone directly.  We are the United STATES of America. Taxation should be the Automated Payment Transaction Tax collected by each STATE, with an allocation to the ADMINISTRATIVE federal government (which should not be allowed to own land or anything else).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This de-evolution of government that folks like Pieczenik and Alex Jones are pushing alongside you is deeply misguided.</p>

<p>For anyone versed in the basics of conspiracy like people on this forum, we know that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and indeed this conspiracy can be easily traced back thousands of years, often referred to as &quot;mystery babylon&quot; or &quot;saturnic cults,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>One thing that mankind seeks to achieve through the nationstate is to create alternative structures that can overcome this monolithic conspiracy against us through the ages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the evil conspirators, among them the CIA from which you hail, pursue policies of balkanization as you well know.  The de-evolution of power through the CIA&#39;s balkanization abroad and the immense suffering laid upon our fellow human beings in the aftermath of such programs lays bare the bankruptcy of the de-evolution mythos that is now being pushed.</p>

<p>At the same time, we can immediately note the great benefits of (some) centralization: the dredging of canals organized by Washington, construction of the first major canal systems under Hamilton, the transcontinental rail network and interstate highway system produced the world&#39;s first majority middle class and great awakening against the den of vipers whom we oppose.</p>

<p>Thus, it becomes obvious that we are not interested in the size of government but rather its effectiveness.  Organizations of immense size are capable of even greater achievements.  The proper dissident, as opposed to the empty CIA-styled balkanization peddler, asks not why is the government large, but do the fruits correspond to what should be expected at such a size.</p>

<p>We have no interest in becoming another Greece subject to the whims of bankers with more capital than their nationstate, but instead prefer to overwhelm the international cabal&#39;s scope with our own size and leverage it to both independence and great achievements.</p>

<p>We could enumerate a wide swath of multi-trillion dollar investments with returns on capital far in excess of anything private enterprise can deliver: NAWAPA, a maglev train system, a Bering straight bridge, a space elevator, and so on.  It is within our current technological ability to end water crisis, energy crisis, and so on.</p>

<p>Hence it becomes readily apparent that the most direct route to alleviating human suffering is through an even larger government than we have now, albeit more rationally and humanely directed in its pursuits.</p>

<p>The post enumerates multi-trillion dollar infrastructure programs at the end:</p>

<p>The assertion is that the quality of world would be increased by these and that their pursuit justifies bigger government (on a quality basis) rather than bigger government being a good in itself (which to some extent it <em>can</em> be because it represents an organizing force of sufficient scope to put down mystery babylon).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quit trolling.  This is a direct quote from my post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, it becomes obvious that we are not interested in the size of government but rather its effectiveness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an era where technological advancement has been suppressed for decades (like our own), there is much work to be done and thus government can be both large and highly effective/productive (lots of catch up to do).  One need only look at the pothole roads or dilapidated schools to see as much. </p>

<p>I am not an ideologue claiming big government is always good or small government is always bad.  Ideologues like lolbertardians or communists are all mentally challenged.  Rational decision making is dependent upon circumstances.  It can make sense for government to by 50% of GDP one year but only 10% of GDP a few years later because it ran out of worthwhile things to do.  Fetishization of the size is a direct attempt to distract you from analysis of merits.</p>

<p>So do you wanna overthrow the entrenched power structure first or turn it loose on these ideas you guys are talking about?</p>

It&#39;s the domination, control, forcing people to go one way or another that&#39;s the problem.

<p>&quot;Globalism&quot; is a made up term by people who actually want fracturing of the nation-state. You can rule the world with a single government, or by ensuring that no government is powerful enough to resist your cabal.</p>

<p>You&#39;re presuming government corruption (I agree), and then conflating it with the size of government, which is generally unrelated.</p>

<p>There are good monarchs, and bad &quot;limited governments.&quot; There is some correlation with limited government and less corruption, but you&#39;re making them synonymous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough, it was not until the USG destroyed my business in 2006 (stripped my clearances for declaring 7,500 foreign contacts, all legit) that I started doing serious wandering in the wilderness. I got the clearances back but it cost me $6M in lost revenue and turned me toward deep thinking about Applied Collective Intelligence and Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE). Now I am thinking about creating an alternative coalition government that destroys the Deep State, since it is increasingly evident that Steve Bannon is not going to let Donald Trump talk to anyone with any ideas in competition to those of Bannon (I love Bannan and his 10% lane, he is dangerously stupid to be blocking Trump from talking to me and Cynthia and Dennis and Ron Paul most urgently).</p>

&quot;dangerously stupid to be blocking Trump&quot; 
Trump seems to be blocking himself quite nicely.
this:
talking to me and Cynthia and Dennis and Ron Paul most urgently
sounds really good.

    <div class="md"><p>Love this question.  I coined the hastag #GoogleGestapo and told Brendan &quot;I am not a potted plant&quot; Sullivan (he is Google&#39;s top lawyer) in email that there is a racketeering investigation against Eric Schmidt, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.  There are in my view two solutions:</p>

<p>01 Everyone everywhere should ask their state Attorney Generals to start racketeering investigations against Google and its surrogates (e.g. AdRoll and YouTube) as well as Facebook and Twitter, and of course include Eric Schmidt the architect.</p>

<p>02 We need an alternative to all of them based on blockchain and not controlled by anyone.  My virtual CTO (arnoldit.com) tells me that for $50M we could patch some pieces togethe and offer the public a scalable alternative to all of them.  I also recommend Micah Sify&#39;s excellent book, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2014/10/review-the-big-disconnect-why-the-internet-hasnt-transformed-politics-yet/">http://phibetaiota.net/2014/10/review-the-big-disconnect-why-the-internet-hasnt-transformed-politics-yet/</a> and my Foreword to Arnold&#39;s book on CyberOSINT, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/2015-robert-steele-foreword/">http://phibetaiota.net/2015/01/2015-robert-steele-foreword/</a>. In tring to help Trump I had hoped to earn the right to create the Open Source (Technologies) Agency which would in passing bury Google and all the others who take the law into their own hands (e.g. PayPal cutting off Wikipedia, that should have been a $100M lawsuit against Theil personally).  Here is what I want to build.  OMP has already approve it at $2B a year but Trump has to ask for it. <a href="http://robertdavidsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/D3C-Presidential-Innovation-Memorandum-3.3.docx">http://robertdavidsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/D3C-Presidential-Innovation-Memorandum-3.3.docx</a></p>

<p>QUOTE (32): What has taken place over the last generation is a highly complicated merger of crime and policy, of stealing and government. Far from taking care of the rest of us, the financial leaders of America and their political servants have seemingly reached the cynical conclusion that our society is not work saving and have taken on a new mission that involved not creating wealth for us all, but simply absconding with whatever wealth remains in our hollowed out economy. They don’t feed us, we feed them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this one time, at reddit, someone did an AMA at reddit where they claimed they were Richard Gage of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2nkcoa/richard_gage_ama_on_rconspiracy_was_not_richard/?st=izuz9kaj&amp;amp;sh=cf67d1da">https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2nkcoa/richard_gage_ama_on_rconspiracy_was_not_richard/?st=izuz9kaj&amp;amp;sh=cf67d1da</a></p>

<p>the official story is that it was an impostor, but i don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>this AMA was well publicized for weeks if not months in advance... so how Richard Gage could not have been aware of this AMA is beyond me. &quot;Richard Gage&quot; rolled in with a team, one user claimed to be an actual engineer. </p>

<p>the reason this AMA was ultimately called a fake was because Richard Gage could not control the conversation. </p>

<p>in particular, he could not explain the cause of 9/11 WTC pot hole. </p>

<p>&quot;Richard Gage&quot; tried explaining 9/11 WTC pot hole away as a &quot;100 million year old [previously] molten mica&quot;, </p>

<p>when Gage was challenged to explain where the skyscraper footings would have once been, somehow on top of this very unevenly surfaced &quot;100 million year old mica&quot;, which obviously would have had to be either excavated or filled in to build a skyscraper on top of it. there is neither evidence for excavation or fill in the WTC pot hole pics </p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=9%2F11+WTC+pot+hole&amp;amp;t=ha&amp;amp;atb=v33-6__&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=9%2F11+WTC+pot+hole&amp;amp;t=ha&amp;amp;atb=v33-6__&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images</a></p>

<p>Richard Gage, supposedly an architect and/or engineer, representing &quot;architects and engineers for 9/11 truth&quot; could not explain how this skyscrapers foundation was built, and he couldn&#39;t explain where the foundation went...</p>

<p>it was at this point that the AMA was declared a &quot;fake&quot;, and that &quot;Richard Gage&quot; was an impostor.</p>

<p>imho, it was actually Richard Gage doing the AMA, and Gage exposed himself as the shill that his really is, and he knew it, so he had to back out of the AMA. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my back-page <em>theory</em> on Seth Rich for David S. Please pass it along if you find any merit. And again, thank you.</p>

<p>Think I&#39;ll go to my grave believing Karl Rove called the hit on Seth Rich! I&#39;ve posted below a long FB post I got off the internet -  I came across this in my research of Karl R. and I feel it links to Seth Rich.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve linked Luke R. youtube video of Karl R. July 31, 2016 and also AJ only to get time stamps but I swear I saw video or image of Karl R. prior to this date and prior to the death of Seth. I&#39;ve scoured aimlessly...I&#39;m pretty sure Seth met up with him via name dropping prior to his murder. I&#39;ve no resources/skills to track Rove but he uses UBER and flies cheap... Honestly, I think KR found out Seth had already exchanged the DATA and KR ordered the hit. Sounds crazy, right?</p>

<p>This is how KR would appeal to SR for common ground?</p>

<p><strong>Cliff Arnebeck</strong>
July 26, 2016 · 
ARNEBECK LAW OFFICE</p>

<p>Dear 
I believe former star <em>Philadelphia prosecutor</em> <strong>Beverly Campbell was assassinated because Karl Rove operatives believed she was about to reveal to you</strong>, before it unfolded, the wholesale corruption of the electronic voting process in the 2016 Democratic Party Presidential Primary.</p>

<p>The first secret revelation from Mark that Bev shared with me—in strictest confidence, with the caveat that she would deny telling me if I ever attributed it to her—was that: “911 was an inside job.”</p>

<p>On July 17, <strong>2008 I pointed out that Karl Rove had breached the general rule of a successful racketeering enterprise by employing his</strong> IT/Webmaster guru, Mike Connell, across the full spectrum of his criminal activities. Mike Connell’s presence was a sure marker of Karl Rove’s involvement. It is now my belief that Karl Rove made the same mistake in having Beverly’s Mark serve as his chief of executions as to all executions in which he was involved.</p>

<p>We learned through our opposition research team from the 2012 election cycle that Benghazi was but the first of three planned attacks upon American overseas government personnel, to serve as props for Karl Rove’s Operations Security (“OpSec”) advertisement. This ad argued that President Obama’s decision to reveal to the public how the take down of Osama bin Laden was accomplished was to serve his selfish political goal of being reelected President and that the disclosure of these methods jeopardized overseas personnel of the United States.</p>

<p>Because of Mark’s high level of service in the CIA and pay grade of $3.5 million afterwards that he claimed to Bev, Mark would have been a likely candidate, if he was not the person finally settled to orchestrate these planned attacks – beginning with Benghazi. I believe Mark gave the stand down order to CIA contractors a few moments away from being able to rescue Ambassador Stevens.</p>

<p>Cunnyngham’s innovation and Karl Rove’s application of it for the benefit of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential Primary campaign is common knowledge among employees of SmarTech at which its CEO, Jeff Averbeck, continues to work exclusively on behalf of Republican candidates.</p>

<p>In the past the unadjusted exit polls published by the media have been a reasonably accurate measure of the actual votes as cast by the voters. In this 2016 Democratic Presidential primary election, however, they are not. The current exit polling was designed to anticipate a substantial amount of fraud in Hillary Clinton’s favor. Thus, while these polls show Sanders getting dramatically more votes than the reported tally, in fact his actual vote percentage as cast by the voters is dramatically more. In Ohio, for example, where end of day screen shots of exit poll results showed Bernie Sanders receiving 10% more than those recorded for Hillary Clinton, Sanders actually received more than enough votes to achieve a substantial majority of those cast, entitling him to the majority of Ohio’s delegates to the Democratic Convention.
The last reported exit polls before their final adjustment to conform to the reported result show Bernie winning the 2016 Democratic primary. He actually won it by a landslide. There is no credible basis to believe that the reported votes in an easily hackable electronic vote counting system controlled by the very global corporate cabal that wants to rule the world has any validity whatsoever.</p>

<p>Karl Rove’s team covers Republican officials. Rove’s partner on the speaking circuit, James Carville may have been involved, without the knowledge of the Clintons in influencing Democratic officials. Rove’s mentor, R. Doug Lewis, has influenced election workers of both parties. Alwaleed bin Talal, Nathaniel Rothschild and George Soros have directed financial &amp; press support in aid of this criminal undertaking. The mainstream global corporate owned press suppresses the exit polling indicative of massive fraud in this election.</p>

<p>In my July 7, 2016 letter to Attorney General Lynch I described FBI Director Comey’s fundamental conflict of interest in having served as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Legal Affairs Institute of the US Chamber of Commerce. His Institute engineered the Citizen Untied decision of the US Supreme Court to overturn a hundred years of campaign finance regulation against corporate corruption of American elections. Then, pretending to act as both a career prosecutor and career investigator Director Comey terminated the investigation of Hillary Clinton for violation of security laws with her private email system.</p>

<p>I will now go further. When you, Mr. President, proposed an executive order to require federal contractors to disclose all their political expenditures, the US Chamber of Commerce stated that if you did so, “All options would be on the table.” If Bev Campbell’s CIA friend’s report of an implicit threat against your life is true, why was the US Chamber of Commerce not immediately interrogated under oath by the FBI and Secret Service?</p>

<p>Is the fact that James Comey is Karl Rove and Tom Donohue&#39;s top lawyer in service to the global corporate cabal, have something to do with the absence of FBI Cyber security investigation of the obvious evidence of massive theft in this election?</p>

<p>Are the overwhelming majority of Democrats who supported Bernie Sanders supposed to shift their support to Hillary Clinton because their votes have been fraudulently flipped or destroyed? If there is such a strong basis for uniting Democrats to be sure to defeat Donald Trump, why are Democratic Party leaders, including Hillary Clinton, backing Bernie Sanders--the man who is outpolling Donald Trump?</p>

<p>Why should any American allow Karl Rove to steal another Presidential election? Perhaps with Karl Rove’s help Secretary Clinton may be able to “beat” Donald Trump, the same way she “beat” Bernie Sanders. But that way she, as the candidate of the global corporate cabal, will have won–not the people. And, whatever may be Donald Trump’s faults as a citizen candidate, it is obvious to the broad public that has supported him that the global corporate cabal’s contempt for Mr. Trump is based upon his refusal to embrace their highly profitable campaign to overthrow the democratically elected leader of Russia.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,
/s/ Clifford O. Arnebeck, Jr.</p>

I hereby attest and affirm under penalties for perjury that the statements of fact set forth in the above letter are true and correct, based upon either my personal knowledge, or the sources that have been consistently reliable over years of my working with them, and the opinions expressed therein are my true professional opinions to a reasonable degree of certainty. I have written this letter with knowledge of the threat against my life that has been made by Mark R.

I intend that this letter be used by any prosecutor or citizen in any federal or state court of law court in any state, or any international tribunal, whether I am alive, dead, or incapacitated to prosecute, criminally or civilly, Karl Rove as the principal perpetrator of the fraudulent manipulation of the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary Election.

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Melania is one of the very best things about Donald Trump.  He won in part because she passed the smell test with the 27% voting for him.  &quot;Russia is bad&quot; is part of the neo-Nazi neo-con narrative.  You have to remember that Allen Dulles and CIA saved the Nazi leadership and their treasures -- the fascists did not lost WWII, they escaped to the US and Argentina and then were restored in Germany, Japan, and Italy by CIA using the gold we captured in the Philippines that created the Black Lily Trust.  This story is told by the Seagraves in <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2003/09/gold-warriors-americas-secret-recovery-of-yamashitas-gold/">http://phibetaiota.net/2003/09/gold-warriors-americas-secret-recovery-of-yamashitas-gold/</a></p>

<p>More recently, from 1998 - 2001, the USA has been running a neo-fascist Gold War against Russia, with Buzzy Krongard of Brown and Root (affiliated with Deutchbank) sitting next to George Tenet (who prostituted his office and let Dick Cheney tell 935 lies after 9/11 to justify elective wars from Afghanistan to Iraq and beyond) as the campaign manager.  That story is told here: <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/911/black_eagle_trust_fund">http://www.wanttoknow.info/911/black_eagle_trust_fund</a></p>

<p>What I would emphasize is that the USA has been in multiple wars not authorized by Congress, including a persistent war against Russia using economic tools, and We the People have been clueless about the misbehavior of our government (and Wall Street) for all these years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Libertarian.  Gary Johnson -- whom I let drive my 1964 MGB when we were in New Hampshire together some years ago -- is a good well-intentioned man who has lost too many brain cells to drugs long ago.  Today he is a fitness freak, but the damage has been done. The Libertarian leadership is myopic, arrogant, and perhaps stupid as well. Despite STUNNING success at getting the party on every ballot, these morons really think they can win with two old white guys, and an absolutist platform. In my view all parties are toxic because they insist on a party ticket, a party line, and fulfilling party promistes to big dollar donors.  My own views on a winning strategy are at <a href="http://bigbatusa.org">http://bigbatusa.org</a>.  I would be interested in being the Libertarian Party candidate in 2020 on two conditions:</p>

<p>01 that they meet with me immediately and agree to make a demand for an Electoral Reform Act the non-negotiable condition for supporting Trump going forward and </p>

<p>02 that they agree  I can pick Cynthia McKinney as my VP and a Coaltion candidate (however, I would support a Ron Paul - Dennis Kucinich ticket in preference to me, but I think I have a better grip on the total picture).</p>

<p>Not going to happen.  I wrote to the executive director of the party a few weeks back, he is blowing me off.  These people don&#39;t really want to win, they just want to posture.</p>

Remember that Eric Schmidt is the architect of #GoogleGestapo, and that during the election Google rendered tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal undeclared campaign contributions to the Clinton campaign with search manipulation (stripping all searches fro Clinton + Crime to just Clinton while adding + Hitler to all searches for Trump.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read where the list of people killed in First Class included opponents. Mass murder has been popular for a very long time.  We still shoot down entire civilian aircraft to kill one person. Although some histories exist from a public point of view, there has never been a really good multicultural history done from the bottom up, or with pattern analysis, etcetera.  Much of what we are told is history is actually a big lie -- for example, we stole most of our land from Mexico in a war based on lies. We committed eight distinct covert acts of war against Japan in order to force their hand on Pearl Harbor, and on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, Cynthia McKinney is a perfect example of how the media can shape a story to control how viewers think/feel about a subject/person.  The first time I remember seeing her was when she was on nightly news getting berated for walking through the entrance of the Capital building.  They showed her screaming at the guards &quot;I&#39;m a member of Congress...you know that!!&quot;  </p>

<p>I immediately detested her and, without knowing anything about her or her positions on political topics, became a victim of our own media.  It wasn&#39;t until I got into 9/11 when I realized how wrong I had been--that I had allowed the media to shape my impression of Mrs. McKinney.</p>

<p>After viewing many of her videos I have a great deal of respect for her and realize she was actually doing her best to expose the corruption--hence she was attacked and framed by the media. </p>

<p>The same type of Dirty Trick was played on our nation by the MSM during the Iran Hostage Crisis.  ABC news began late nightly updates to help enrage the citizens of America; the newspapers began counting the days atop the headlines in the morning.  I often wonder how many times did ABC (or the New York Times) mention that the Iranians were acting this way as a result of the 1953 overthrow the CIA pulled off against Mossadegh (sp?).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve pretty much solved aging.  The government has a national security directive in place against publishing drugs that are effective against malignant cancers (rapid cell division) without major toxicity issues.</p>

<p>That&#39;s important to aging because aging has roughly two causes: (1) stem cells turning off over time, (2) accumulation of junk that the body can&#39;t clear.</p>

<p>With anti-cancer drugs that can be applied repeatedly (not toxic or carcinogenic themselves) you can turn the body&#39;s stem cells back on and revitalize youthfulness.  Absent such non-toxic cancer treatments, you want your stem cells regulatory mechanisms that cause them to shut off as you age in place or you&#39;ll get cancer and die very quickly.</p>

<p>Secondly, the body is very good at clearing small waste and large waste, but there is an intermediate zone that tends to get stuck and accumulate in cells.  (Very small things can diffuse out, very large things can be removed mechanically)  We have pretty robust immunotherapeutics coming down the line that can target this intermediate zone and therefore start clearing out accumulated debris related to aging (misfolded proteins in the brain etc.).</p>

<p>The government won&#39;t allow this stuff to really move forward in a holistic way because (1) it promotes a scarcity myth to justify a lot of the bad stuff it does to the lower level people involved, and (2) although we have the technology to support a healthy planet with many billions more people on it, the government can&#39;t allow robust economic growth because a thriving middle class is an existential threat to the freemasonic cabal that seeks to lord over mankind.</p>

The ideology is identical to Soros&#39; Open Society -  yet CS, via the OGP, monitors the WethePeople petition site, is the gatekeeper to all government websites, oversees the FOIA process, and is entrenched in our government agencies.   How is this not a threat to our sovereignty and national security?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To what extent do you think that open source technologies such as bitcoin are influenced by TPTB? I have been following bitcoin since pre $1 days and have witnessed extensive shenanigans in the scene. I don&#39;t buy the success stories of individuals such as Musk and Peter Thiel and the fact that Peter Thiel is such a high profile player in the scene, as well as some of the allegations of child offenses against bitcoin foundation members and Satoshi&#39;s fairy tale story makes me distrust the entire scene slightly. </p>

<p>I appreciate that the cat is out of the bag with respect to the technology, but I wonder how well it can succeed when the movement is being corralled by people who I suspect have shared interests with those who wish to dominate and control us.</p>

<p>I think if people actually get to any kind of position of influence without being in bed with TPTB, that they&#39;ll end up getting suicided like Swartz did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth &amp; Reconciliation is a very practical strategy -- it&#39;s about creating possibilities for infinite wealth for the many, instead of vindictive justice for the few.  Here are a few thoughts on pedophilia and punishment, it applies to other less henious crimes including treason:</p>

<p>ALSO, as a professional intelligence and counterintelligence officer, my real target is not the pedophiles, but the people that have been blackmailing them.  I would love to do the dirty on every blackmailer.  My focus is on restoring the Constitution and ending the Deep State -- the pedophiles are a stepping stone, not the endgame.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Funny how people overlook this. I&#39;m reminded of recent discussions revolving around a given party &quot;supporting pedophilia.&quot; Usually that support is bound by a lower age range, typically 13-14.</p>

<p>It&#39;s somewhat astounding that people who accept the existence of the pedophilia blackmail ring do not seem to realize that the most direct method for undermining the blackmailer is to undermine their leverage. &quot;Limited legalization of pedophilia&quot; could instantly cut the number of blackmailed officials dramatically.</p>

<p>I just thought I would put that out there. I don&#39;t support such a movement, but I at least appreciate that if the conspiracy is real, that would be the most direct method for confronting it.</p>

<p>How does T and R deter recidivism by &quot;preventing another generation of pedophiles emerging?&quot;  From what we&#39;ve seen from many of these people, they&#39;d give their &quot;mea culpa&quot; and return to the same activity - be it direct sexual contact with children or &quot;merely&quot; trafficking them.

<p>How does it make any sense at all to give &quot;incentive for them to give up all the others&quot; and in the end let everyone go free?
Technically you only say &quot;no jail&quot;, that could mean death as well, idk if that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying here?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes sir, I&#39;ve raped, tortured and sacrificed dozens, maybe hundreds of children, and we mind-controlled some of them to eventually take over the USG. He, he, he and her were also part of it. Ok, can I go now and go back to what I&#39;ve been doing for decades?&quot;
RDS: &quot;Sure, thanks for your honesty, have a good day sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Does this sound about right to you? I mean, are you fucking kidding me?</p>

<p>It&#39;s truly disturbing, because most everything else you say resonates with me, and I highly respect some of the people you surround yourself with, most notably Cynthia McKinney and Ron Paul, but the &#39;no jail&#39; part makes absolutely no sense.
I hope in case you ever make it to an election for president or whatnot, that you&#39;ll have changed your opinion on this by then.</p>

You wrote: &quot;The contributions of Julian Assange and Wikileaks cannot be over-stated.

<p>There are really two parts to the answer.</p>

<p>First Julian would be nothing if individuals were not prepared to offer him truthful insider documents that reveal the hypocrisy and criminality of our so-called leaders. What happened to the Democrats is going to happen to the Republicans soon.</p>

<p>What I was focusing on is the fact that the narrative from Wikileaks would have been buried by the MSM if a number of us had not stepped forward to challenge the lies by John Brennan.  Below are a few of my pieces and one appearance on Russia Today that called out Brennan (and Clapper) as liars.  This helped in a small way avoid the flipping of the Electoral College with these lies.</p>

<p>Below in reverse chronological order (in the last one see UPDATE 17 listing, with links, all the people who testified that the Russians did not hack the election, it was all insider leaks or a single legitmate Romanian taxi driver who got lucky on Podesta, and NYPD detectives).</p>

CIA protected Blandon who was one of many close to CIA, DEA, and FBI allowed to smuggle planeloads of drugs into the USA.  Col James Sabow, USMC was assassinated by US Marines at El Toro Air Station back in the day, he was about to blow the whistle on contractor aircraft flying drugs into California all day long.

Many accomplishments to be proud of but on balance too annoying and unlikely to be a satisfactory conversation....plus I generally do not do podcasts. I consider science today to be dishonest and retarded. Association with Dawkins is a negative for me. My touchstone is John Caputo, who is at the intersection of philosophy and theology and whose book, <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/2015/05/review-truth-philosophy-in-transit/">http://phibetaiota.net/2015/05/review-truth-philosophy-in-transit/</a> I found very satisfying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear Robert,
What are your opinions on The Zeitgeist Movement by Peter Joseph?
How about Jacque Fresco&#39;s work in Venus, Fl? 
I know to get a complete answer you&#39;d have to look analyze a lot of their work. 
I can summarize The Zeitgeist Movement by: A movement based on changing value systems like our Monetary System through the ever evolving field of sciences through a general System&#39;s Engineers point of view. It gets a lot of inspiration by R. Buckminster Fuller and his broad non-specialized work. 
Thanks,
Brett</p>

From my analysis it seems it&#39;ll be the psychological disposition most people already have. The &quot;indoctrinated&quot;, &quot;brainwashed&quot;, or &quot;psychologically subverted&quot; shall I say. Especially when people are ignorant about things since most of their lives are focused on work, pay bills, relax. By ignorance I don&#39;t mean to be harsh, it&#39;s just a simple fact of not knowing what you don&#39;t know. Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Steele, </p>

<p>I have seen the videos you and Steve Pieczenik posted on Youtube regarding a &#39;Deep State Coup&#39; and state sponsored Pedophilia rings. I have also read material you&#39;ve posted and material from interviews you&#39;ve given. </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is stated on Wikipedia and elsewhere, you have extensive expertise in crafting military Psychological Operations. Did these skills come in play during formation of your public statements about this election or claims of pedophilia rings containing elected officials and other business elites? </p></li>
<li><p>A followup to the pedophilia question: Are claims of pedophilia - like Pizzagate - being used to foment a political purge, much like Mao did during the Cultural Revolution?  </p></li>
<li><p>Your claims about a &#39;deep state coup&#39; provide no backing evidence. They are - like Robert Steele&#39;s dossier - based entirely on your say-so without any named sources or documentation. What public evidence can you provide to bolster the case that these claims are true and accurate? </p></li>
<li><p>Your statements appear to focus primarily on a partisan support for a particular Presidential candidate in opposition to another. Do you have a partisan preference? And if so, has it impacted your statements regarding these claims of a &#39;deep state coup&#39;? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I really prefer people ask one question at time.</p>

<p>Pedophilia broke when the Romanian taxi driver suckered Podesta and then citizens stepped in to investigate. Up to now pedophilia has been OFF LIMITS to law enforcement as well as the MSM. I was as surprised as anyone that PizzaGate, now PedoGate, emerged, that is a sign the Deep State is breaking up and losing its grip.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is a lesbian pedophile traitor and criminal. To say that I have been a Never Clinton is to put it lightly. I started supporting Donald Trump in July 2015 but my focus has always been on electoral reform, not on a particular candidate.  I offered electoral reform eight times to Bernie Sanders in 2015-2016, he and his staff blew me off eight times.  I offered it to O&#39;Malley, Bloomberg, and Kasich also.  When I offered it to Trump I was blown off in turn by Roger Stone, Corey Lewandowsky, Paul Manafort, and whoever intercepts the mail for Donald Trump himself. In December when I had my Spy Xmas Msg to DT delivered to Judas Preibus via Certified Mail, he evidently threw it away and did not deliver it to DT.</p>

<p>If and when you start to read broadly, you will find that I favor the elimination of all parties, and with the twelve electoral reform fixes, 100% citizen engagement and evidence-based governance in the public interest.</p>

<p>I have no idea about Hillary Clinton&#39;s sexual preferences. What evidence do you personally know of to support the claim she&#39;s engaged in criminal pedophilia? </p>

<p>WRT: Trump, numerous press outlets have reported on connections between he and his campaign staff&#39;s connections to Russian state and business interests. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-candidate-for-state-has-close-ties-to-vladimir-putin-1481033938">reported on Rex Tillerson&#39;s ties to Russian oil interests</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Fox News reported on Michael Flynn&#39;s <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/21/trumps-national-security-adviser-pick-raises-serious-questions-about-putins-influence-over-us-policy.html">apparent connections to Putin</a>. As ABC News reported, Flynn subsequently resigned after reports emerged that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-michael-flynn-resignation-raises-dark-questions-surrounding/story?id=45486020">he&#39;d met with the Russian Ambassador</a> without informing the Vice President. </p></li>
<li><p>According to the NY Times, Michael Cohen - Trump’s campaign attorney, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html">met with Russian officials to discuss lifting Russian sanctions</a>, after vociferously denying such meetings having taken place in the Steele Dossier. </p></li>
<li><p>According to Poitico, Richard Burt, a former Trump campaign manager, <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/">sits on the board for Russia’s Alfa Bank</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">Interagency Intelligence Community Report on Russian US election interference</a>.</p>

<p>And the Steele dossier, which I won’t link to. </p>

<p>This is just a short list of the many associations between Trump and Russian interests personally, as well as through his campaign staff. </p>

<p>My question to you: As an old cold warrior, do these reports concern you? And if not, why not?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Robert and thanks again for doing this!</p>

<p>What do you think of Steven Greer&#39;s speeches about how his Deep State contacts have told him that the false flag UFO attack would be orchestrated during this administration?  </p>

<p>What do you make of John Podesta&#39;s public interest in UFOs?</p>

<p>What kind of evidence, given by a whistleblower or insider, do you think could possibly &quot;blow the lid off&quot; in a catalystic way, any of the major conspiracies?  Ie, JFK, UFOs, 9/11.  Do you think any kind of &quot;leak&quot; could actually accomplish this?  Something so big, with such providence, that it could dominate mainstream media and bring about significant change?  </p>

<p>What binds the Deep State together?  If Allen Dulles was a progenitor of the Deep State, how did the reigns of power get passed on?  Ie, has there been an unbroken chain in the CIA who have always known about JFK, and UFOs?</p>

<p>Do you think Adm.  Hillenkoetter was a &quot;good guy&quot;?  Do you think Bill Colby was murdered -  if so, over what?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long list - I am happy to take reading suggestions in lieu of answers, for any of the above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You all really need to ask ONE question at a time.</p>

<p>I have managed a false flag, I take Greer seriously but don&#39;t think it will come to that.  Podesta has a foundation for knowing that there is stuff that needs to be disclosed.  A tape of George Bush talking about how easy it was to fool the American people for so long on JFK, a tape of Dick Cheney bragging on how he pulled off 9/11.  Stuff like that is coming.  PizzaGate is the beginning of the end of the Deep State.  Money, secrecy, citizen apathy. Colby might have been murdered -- or simply had a heart attack while canoeing.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://phibetaiota.net">http://phibetaiota.net</a> search for JFK, 9/11, Colby, etc, there are 20,000 posts from over 800 people, it&#39;s a treasure trove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.  I am intimately familiar with CIA operations in that country. I have heard of different forms of cancer inducing guns, and of course it is a simple matter to get someone close to him to administer poison. However, based on years of experience, I tend to consider CIA very inept and if I had to bet my life on it, would lean toward Chevez dying of natural causes.  By the by, Cynthia McKinney, a future AMA, earned her PhD with a thesis on Huge Chavez as a leader.</p>

<p>Apply by mail with a thoughtful resume.  Preference is given to veterans who speak foreign languages and have advanced degrees.</p>

<p>VERY.</p>

<p>What role does secret societies i.e. Skull n bones, bohemian grove, monies, jesuits, etc play in vetting/recruiting future IC ops?</p>

<p>Integrated at the highest levels in that there is a globalist agenda that the dark side of CIA support, but invisible to 90% of the good people trapped in thats bad system.</p>

<p>Can Julian Assange be trusted? What role did growing up in a cult play into his radicalization?</p>

<p>Everyone has multiple masters and multiple agendas.  On balance I think he has been a force for good.</p>

<p>Does the CIA do ANY good for the American ppl, or are they just domestic terrorists?</p>

<p>Short answer is no in their present form -- as General Zinni has pointed out, they provide less than 4% of what anyone needs, but see my various links elsewhere on what needs to be done -- I would eliminate NSA, NRA, NGA, and ODNI, but I would EXPAND CIA with signals and imagery directorates, triple FBI and create an Open Source Agency that would be the baseline for what can be done with open sources and methods.</p>

<p>we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and indeed this conspiracy can be easily traced back thousands of years, often referred to as &quot;mystery babylon&quot; or &quot;saturnic cults,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>One thing that mankind seeks to achieve through the nationstate is to create alternative structures that can overcome this monolithic conspiracy against us through the ages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the evil conspirators, among them the CIA from which you hail, pursue policies of balkanization as you well know.  The de-evolution of power through the CIA&#39;s balkanization abroad and the immense suffering laid upon our fellow human beings in the aftermath of such programs lays bare the bankruptcy of the de-evolution mythos that is now being pushed.</p>

<p>At the same time, we can immediately note the great benefits of (some) centralization: the dredging of canals organized by Washington, construction of the first major canal systems under Hamilton, the transcontinental rail network and interstate highway system produced the world&#39;s first majority middle class and great awakening against the den of vipers whom we oppose.</p>

<p>Thus, it becomes obvious that we are not interested in the size of government but rather its effectiveness.  Organizations of immense size are capable of even greater achievements.  The proper dissident, as opposed to the empty CIA-styled balkanization peddler, asks not why is the government large, but do the fruits correspond to what should be expected at such a size.</p>

<p>We have no interest in becoming another Greece subject to the whims of bankers with more capital than their nationstate, but instead prefer to overwhelm the international cabal&#39;s scope with our own size and leverage it to both independence and great achievements.</p>

<p>We could enumerate a wide swath of multi-trillion dollar investments with returns on capital far in excess of anything private enterprise can deliver: NAWAPA, a maglev train system, a Bering straight bridge, a space elevator, and so on.  It is within our current technological ability to end water crisis, energy crisis, and so on.</p>

<p>Hence it becomes readily apparent that the most direct route to alleviating human suffering is through an even larger government than we have now, albeit more rationally and humanely directed in its pursuits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth &amp; Reconciliation is a very practical strategy -- it&#39;s about creating possibilities for infinite wealth for the many, instead of vindictive justice for the few.  Here are a few thoughts on pedophilia and punishment, it applies to other less henious crimes including treason:</p>

<p>ALSO, as a professional intelligence and counterintelligence officer, my real target is not the pedophiles, but the people that have been blackmailing them.  I would love to do the dirty on every blackmailer.  My focus is on restoring the Constitution and ending the Deep State -- the pedophiles are a stepping stone, not the endgame.</p>
