       Good move. I think it's going down. It's not going to be pretty. Max Keiser on Keiser Report RT News is one of the only people talking about this. That's where I found out the hedge funds are coming back to US from Great Britain.

       I keep hearing good buzz about DASH.  I even downloaded their wallet, but have yet to buy any.

       That said, no one but you knows what "forever" means in this context.  I get transactions through within a couple hours (at most), even if it's midnight or a weekend.  To me that's fine.

       Gold isn't very portable though, and hard to defend. If the government recalls all gold (was that ever rescinded), you would need to fight off Law Enforcement Officers to defend that gold.

       Tatikios, did you even read the link or the book 'The Prize'?  Why is oil priced in US Dollars then?
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who don't want to click the link, relevant portion:
"Two years later, in an effort to maintain global demand for U.S. dollars, another system was created called the petrodollar system. In 1973, a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the United States in which every barrel of oil purchased from the Saudis would be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under this new arrangement, any country that sought to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia would be required to first exchange their own national currency for U.S. dollars. In exchange for Saudi Arabia's willingness to denominate their oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars, the United States offered weapons and protection of their oil fields from neighboring nations, including Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1975, all of the OPEC nations had agreed to price their own oil supplies exclusively in U.S. dollars in exchange for weapons and military protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       This petrodollar system, or more simply known as an "oil for dollars" system, created an immediate artificial demand for U.S. dollars around the globe. And of course, as global oil demand increased, so did the demand for U.S. dollars."

       Petrodollar must means surplus generated by oil sales.

      <p>
       It's not a currency and it doesn't refer tk the USD.

       I've known there isn't a physical or digital currency called a 'petro dollar'.  I was using the 'petro dollar' in its larger sense of all the geopolitical baggage that comes with pricing oil in USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petro dollar term came about because my of US was sending so many USD to the middle east in the 1970's to buy oil the US needed a way to get the dollars back to prevent devaluation of the USD and to prevent inflation while trying to gain some kind of control back from OPEC.  So we pushed to get all oil priced in USD to prop up the currency's value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, every country that has tried to go off the USD for oil pricing the US has taken direct and hard action.  From manufactured crisis (Iraq) to regime change (Libya and others), action has always followed to apply very direct pressure to keep oil priced in USD.  All to protect this 'petro dollar'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think we've been talking about the same thing but haven't been communicating well.

       We are definitely going to war with Iran in the next decade but they havent actually dropped the dollar. They still sell oil for dollars and havent dumped their foreign exchange.

       Those headlines for a few days was a non event, all they did was drop the dollar from financial reporting which was just a symbolic move to spite the US after the travel ban. Its like switching from Fahrenheit to Celsius, they just now use a different currency in their reporting.

       Can't disagree with that scenario as the spark point. If US just try to go in it won't be a "popular" war. You can bet your ass the mainstream media is going to sell it for all they are worth. Which is not much. It's going to be a hard sell regardless, because most countries are already watching for it. I'm really thinking Russia and China are going to announce a Middle East summit very soon.

       I was answering the thought that Russia would not involve itself. I think it's obvious to anyone that has been in or around the Gulf that as soon as the Straits  arc up, the petro-dollar is effected. No shipping through the Straits of Hormus means no oil out of the Gulf.

       It's not about transit of oil. It's about military placement. If Saudi Arabia makes deal with China the whole geopolitical picture changes. Saudi king is on 30 day trip to meet China, Japan, Malaysia, Jordan, Maldives, and couple others right now. Back in 2015 it was Putin who helped Saudi Arabia and Iran reach an OPEC deal. Russia and China now use Yuan for oil sales. Saudi Arabia is going to start shipping oil to China via Maldives. What currency is China going to use to purchase that oil? If it's not US dollar then Saudi Arabia may ask US military to leave.

       USA would win the war if they invaded, thats a fact. This would be an actual war of aggression against a democratic country though, unlike against Hussein who was universally disliked.

       I cant agree. They might but then the recent track record isn't strong.  I think it would lead to conscription and we saw what occurred in Vietnam with the public opinion when that started.

       I agree. Our military footprint over there is not optimum. If India (who is now using Rupees to purchase oil) gets involved  it's an impossible scenario.

       I see Turkey and Saudi Arabia as the weak links right now. Personally, I have to say Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India have the most leverage in this scenario if they decide that Iran has the right to make this move. We will know soon enough. As far as the 5th fleet.. the Chinese DH-10 would come into play and Russia just did this -Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump NYT Feb. 14, 2017.

       I see Turkey and Saudi Arabia as the weak links. I don't put much stock in the fleet considering the Chinese DH-10 and there's a Feb, 14, 2017 NYT article about Russia violating the treaty regarding deployment of their new cruise missile battalion. Administration officials said the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is still located at Russia’s missile test site at Kapustin Yar in southern Russia near Volgograd. The other was shifted in December from that test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country, according to a senior official who did not provide further details and requested anonymity to discuss recent intelligence reports about the missile. 
And then there's India.

       The Kish Bourse was officially opened in a videoconference ceremony on 17 February 2008, despite last minute disruptions to the internet services to the Persian Gulf regions. Currently the Kish Bourse is only trading in oil-derived products, generally those used as feedstock for the plastics and pharmaceutical industries. However, officially published statements by Iranian oil minister Gholamhossein Nozari indicate that the second phase, to establish trading in crude oil directly, which has been suggested might one day perhaps create a "Caspian Crude" benchmark price analogous to Brent Crude or WTI will only be started after the Bourse has demonstrated a reasonable period of trouble-free running.

       Turkey can not be trusted. And Turkey sides with Saudi and NATO, not Iran.

       One moment, it's shooting down Russian fighters thanks to American intelligence while buying oil from ISIS, training them and offering them safe refuge, the next, they signed the pipeline deal with Russia to make the casus belli in Syria disappear.

       Saudi Arabia is making oil deal with China. If Russia/Iran/Syria/Saudi Arabia form new petro currency, Turkey will go along. Saudi Arabia may be locking it all in place right now while visiting China, Maldives, Japan right now. Foreign Minister of Maldives just went to China. This is probably going down. They're not going to let the US take Iran.

       Saudi oil deal with China through the Maldives changes everything. Turkey/Pakistan will side with new petro currency. Iraq/Afghanistan are highly unstable and will be a total nightmare for the US to mount an offensive from and nothing is stopping Iraq from siding with new currency.  India is in midst of financial meltdown just like Italy and Greece. Mexico is in complete defiance of the US right now (geographically important, not military important). Canada is being a sniveling bitch. The EU is looking at the possibility of total collapse thanks to the refugee crisis. If there was ever a time for Russia/China to make their move it's now. China is already preparing for a trade war with the US. All of the sanctions placed through the UN won't mean diddly to Russia if this happens. Saudi Arabia is visiting all of Asia pretty much, not visiting US. So this scenario makes some sense.

       From what I can tell, the Saudi is just putting some infrastructure in the Maldives and those other countries since they're part of the trade route to China. I'm not sure why that changes everything. Please elaborate, thanks.

       Iraq can be strong armed. The US can just support ISIS more, air strike less, and the Iraqi Army will be retreat.

      <p>
       China is preparing for a trade war, because the US wants a trade war. It's kinda like how Russia is preparing for a hot war. Because the US wants a hot war.

       It changes everything by opening the door to the very real possibility of all of them forming their own petro currency. If the US dollar gets replaced it will crash us. They won't have to go to war with us.

       NYT - Jan 9, 2017 - An Indian man holding invalid currency notes as he stands outside the Reserve Bank of India in New Delhi. Do you read the news? Greece - CNN-How's this for déjà vu? Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads. Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an "explosive" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Italy-The Guardian -Nov 28, 2016 - Quiet crisis: why battle to prop up Italy's banks is vital to EU stability. ... This week the European Central Bank agreed the financial details of (another) bailout package for the banca, which was previously rescued in 2013.

       Change of currency notes to tackle black money stashed in cash. How has that got anything to do with any economic crises? Don't get me wrong, people had to stand in long lines to exchange their money, so what? Contrary to your belief, that act has pumped more money into Indian reserve bank. Are you talking facts about India yet? Indian Economy is growing at 7%. India has strategically been non aligned and historically never invaded any country. Come 3rd world war, India will be non aligned and will still buy oil from Russia, Saudi, UAE, Iran etc.

       I don't think the investigation was ever going to reveal anything substantial. But even with everything stacked against it, they still point the finger at one of America's allies. It's sickening how America remains allied with them, let alone prevents any proper investigation.
      </p>

       I think it's pretty obvious that it was an inside job, but if we just go on what has been official reported, Saudi Arabia shares a large portion of responsibility.

       Disagree. Majority of US population does not want war with Iran. Also, many people tired of doing Israel's grunt work. Nation is divided, Trump is at war with media and intelligence agencies. So when you say US wants them dead, I have to ask what you mean by US.

       Disagree. I voted Trump because he didn't want war. Hillary was the one saying we needed to create no-fly zone in Syria. Which definitely would have sparked it up with Iran and Russia. Trump does not have my support for war with Iran. I know I'm not alone in this. That's the reason I posted this story.

       You misunderstand the thread. It's about the US dollar being replaced by another currency regarding oil. It's not about Iran having it's own currency.

       You mention just Iran. Are any other places like Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, etc going to stop using the US dollar for oil?

       When a country stops trading in US Dollars then that money eventually floods back into the US, that means the fed will have to produce less dollars, that means interest rates will go up, that means inflation, that means your buying power dwindles. The US currency is on a razor wire, while it may be able to handle Iran changing, other countries following suit could tip the whole apple cart over and crash your economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran is also mortal enemies with Israel and Saudi Arabia, so Washington will be getting lobbied hard to go to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if Russia and China step in you now have a proxy war being fought in Iran involving the US, NATO, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and whoever else is gonna step up. That will most likely spill over and then the next thing you know Nuclear Holocaust.

       Russia and China are moving away from the dollar.   The reason the US dollar holds its value is because you need US dollars to buy oil.  Once there is a large enough option to buy in other currencies and the US dollar is no longer necessary, countries won't have to have large reserves of it to facilitate oil trade.

       Why does it matter? Its not like they were an ally of us, and we don't even get most of our oil through Iran. We get something like 4% were a larger ally of Saudi Arabia who I doubt would change from the dollar because their entire economy is based on selling oil to us. And they give us about 8% of us and they hate Iran also.

       So, Saudi Arabia getting ready to ship a shit ton of oil to China isn't important? As we proclaim we will do everything we can to become oil independent? Who do you think Saudi Arabia will side with for their own future interests? These decisions get made on long-term realities. Iran knows they are next on our "we have to go to war with them". The whole world knows it. I think they're all getting tired of it.

       By the time that were oil independent we won't be based on oil, electric cars are going to take over in probably less than 20 years and by that point oil will be a non issue. And by that point China's and India's economy will probably be larger than ours anyways. We have to get used to the fact that in the future we simply won't be the #1 economy so using the dollar for everything might be dumb anyways. I doubt it would change though, there would have to be a reason to switch to the yen and I have to imagine it would be simply easier to stay with the dollar.

       So, it wouldn't benefit a country/group of countries to have its currency be the established petro currency for the next 20 years? That's plenty of reason. And China has already been trying to get the petro dollar switched to the Yuan.

       Trump and the Republicans are desperate for a war. Republicans have been planning an Iran invasion for years. This will most likely be our next middle east conflict.

       However the next war will probably be what Russia wants, since the Russian faction of the New World Order now controls the US government through blackmailing Trump.

       Good one. Look, can you give me a break here? I'm on my phone and I can't shorten URL when I try to link stories. I try to post dates and headlines to make search easier.  There's plenty of proof for this happening.

       They must be pressured to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why one of the last "hit-list" countries just happens to wait for all the other "hit-list" countries to be taken over to do this action.  Like if they wanted to do this they could have done it decades ago (and been taken over.)  But they just decide to do it when another regime comes into office?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I know they are all dominoes that eventually will have a R***schild central bank - and we all know that is the goal.  But why make it so obvious?  It's like the narrative is clearly: "Go against the Central Banking System = Military Takeover."  Why do it now?  Are they being ordered to do it?  If so, isn't that TPTB basically broadcasting that that is the ultimate goal?

       Russia being in Iran to help Syria may have something to do with the move. With the majority of our government saying Russia is the bad guy, why wouldn't they try to force a play with China? With the US threatening trade war with China why wouldn't they go along with Russia on this? I agree completely with the R***child central bank end game scenario. Russia and China do not have those central banks in their countries. It's an advantage. If they takeover the petro dollar they become more powerful than the central banks. That...is world war 3.

       Good reply.  So you think it's more Russia/China "influencing" Iran to drop the dollar to provoke the U.S. into an international war?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Iran is allies with Russia/China.  Not sure about the previous ones that just "decided to drop the dollar:" Iraq, Libya.  Were those countries also influenced by the R/C coalition?  Were all of those failures to goad the U.S. into WW3. (Or maybe they weren't failures and stretched our army out..)

       Makes sense if you're looking at chess pieces that TPTB control of EVERY country.  But, not sure if it's still two factions warring.

       Gaddafi in Libya tried to do it on his own, same with Saddam in Iraq. As far as Iran announcing it..look what happened after they did. Saudi king visits most of Asia all this month. 
And then there's this article in Reuters that no one talks about. Putin was working on this in 2015.

       China just cancelled coal imports from North Korea, that's why the oil deal with Saudi Arabia is so important. Their air is fucked up. But this story about solar panels being the near term solution doesn't work for the amount of production China has. I think North Korea is going to get real quiet because they haven't been invited to the party. Iran knows what's coming, that's why they will push for Russia/China alliance. Probably by meeting with Syria/Turkey/ Saudi Arabia to establish new Middle East stability treaty.

       Iran has pushed for years to have the euro replace the dollar as the currency for international oil trade. In 2007, Tehran failed to persuade OPEC members to switch away from thedollar, which its then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called a "worthless piece of paper".Feb 8, 2016 Reuters.

       OK..again. we are discussing petro currency. Iran is only going to accept Euros for the buying and selling of oil. All oil purchases are made with the US dollar.  If you come back to this to disagree, bring a linked source with you.

       Why did the US invade Iraq?  Why did the US/NATO destroy Libya in 2011?  Was it the US aim to "save" Libya or Gadafi's decision to create the "gold dinar"?  And what is Libya like today?  Why is the US supporting an insurgency against Syria?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US can only sanction Iran right now.  If it were possible that the US wouldn't suffer consequences the US would have already bombed Iran long ago.  You have to go back to Iraq, Libya and now Syria, and how quickly the US was able to go after those countries.  Russia is another example, the US was able to create certain circumstances through its coup in Ukraine.  Now the US/EU have sanctions on Russia.  The same scenario, the US would have bombed Russia long ago but Russia is not as easy to do as Iraq, Libya, and Syria.

       Not wrong.  I was trying to tell you that for some countries the US was able to act decisively and bomb those countries right away.  You have to understand that the US can't just bomb Iran and Russia for drifting away from the petrodollar.  The US has to use other methods like sanctioning those countries, and again, the US uses different pretexts; Iran non-existent "WMD", "Russian aggression" etc.

       I didn't miss that. That's why I voted Trump. But if he says war with Iran, I do not support it. We have to tell our government we're sick of this shit. Our boys don't need to go die for oil currency. Fuck that.

       That's stupid, Trump is waaaaaaaaay more likely to start a war with Iran. Hillary was talking about the scenario where Iran nukes Israel. She was also talking in 2008, before we realized Iran could actually be some of our most useful allies in the Middle East. She actually wants to pivot to Iran and away from Israel.

       They predicted in 2004 that a war with Iran was about to begin.

       Reason: switching to the Euro for oil purchases.

       We could've left Libya alone. Wouldn't have the African refugee crisis if we had. Everytime a country threatens to go off the US petro currency we do a regime change. It's economics. Our currency will become worthless without the petro status.

       I've been trying to tell people for months, the flywheel US economy is crashing. Oil is being phased out after reigning king for hundreds of years, the debt bubble is exponentially growing, the trade deficit growing exponentially as well, wealth accumulating at the top and being siphoned out of the economy, consumerism taking over production. We're watching the US being sucked dry, and economic collapse is eminent within the next three years.

       Iran is no longer using the dollar for financial reporting, but will continue to use the dollar in oil trade, at least for now. No threat to the petrodollar quite yet, so all out war will still be pushed off till later.

       Aside from the "petrowars" here's Hillary saying she's gonna stop the rebirth of the Soviet Union
"“There is a move to re-Sovietise the region,” the US secretary of state told a news conference in Dublin hours before going into a meeting with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It’s not going to be called that. It’s going to be called a customs union, it will be called Eurasian Union and all of that,” she said, referring to various iterations of a Moscow-backed plan to deepen economic ties with its neighbours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        “But let's make no mistake about it. We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it.”
       </strong>

       Good move. I think it's going down. It's not going to be pretty. Max Keiser on Keiser Report RT News is one of the only people talking about this. That's where I found out the hedge funds are coming back to US from Great Britain.

       When a country stops trading in US Dollars then that money eventually floods back into the US, that means the fed will have to produce less dollars, that means interest rates will go up, that means inflation, that means your buying power dwindles. The US currency is on a razor wire, while it may be able to handle Iran changing, other countries following suit could tip the whole apple cart over and crash your economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran is also mortal enemies with Israel and Saudi Arabia, so Washington will be getting lobbied hard to go to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if Russia and China step in you now have a proxy war being fought in Iran involving the US, NATO, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and whoever else is gonna step up. That will most likely spill over and then the next thing you know Nuclear Holocaust.

       Disagree. Majority of US population does not want war with Iran. Also, many people tired of doing Israel's grunt work. Nation is divided, Trump is at war with media and intelligence agencies. So when you say US wants them dead, I have to ask what you mean by US.

       Russia and China are moving away from the dollar.   The reason the US dollar holds its value is because you need US dollars to buy oil.  Once there is a large enough option to buy in other currencies and the US dollar is no longer necessary, countries won't have to have large reserves of it to facilitate oil trade.
