<p>I would like to extend a special thanks to Robert David Steele for doing a huge AMA on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>.  We have had many great AMA guest here over the years <a href="/r/conspiracy/wiki/amas">/r/conspiracy/wiki/amas</a> but I have never seen a guest hang out with the community for 3 days and genuinely discuss all manner of things with such enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Even the announcement sticky was overflowing with questions for, and answered by Robert.  I&#39;m going to have to list the announcement sticky in our AMAs archive somehow because even there Robert was buzzing with energy to share information with all of us.  Regardless of what your opinion is about Robert&#39;s ideas, you must give him a huge thanks for taking to time to answer almost every question presented to him.</p>

<p>Thank you Robert! I hope you get your A-team a meeting with Trump because we need unity like that, the 70% of disenfranchised but eligible voters having a voice again through Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, Ralph Nader, Dennis kucinich and yourself.</p>

<p>The &quot;Trump risk&quot; will be for naught if the GoP establishment just steps in and runs the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever the merits of Steele&#39;s <em>revelations</em>, the guy rudely insulted a user who had what I thought were a list of 28 pretty damn good conspiracy- and credential-related questions. Steele&#39;s reply that the user &quot;made Reddit look bad&quot; and was &quot;barely worthy as worm food&quot; and &quot;I wouldn&#39;t feed your ignorant remains to my dogs&quot; for simply asking what he deemed &quot;ignorant&quot; questions was totally out of line and uncalled for and made him look easily rattled and mean. Then after insulting the user,  Steele oddly turned around and answered several of their good questions (to the best of his compartmentalized knowledge). </p>

<p>Further, rather than being objectively analytical, he came across as avidly self-promotional and rather self-important (i.e., Trump needs to read his brief and meet him alone for an hour or the alt-revolution will be doomed). </p>

<p>Otherwise, not bad infotainment, OP.</p>

<li><p>Why do retired CIA always come out and &quot;expose&quot; the CIA etc, eg yourself, Ray McGovern et al, when you guys probably have done loads of shady stuff when you&#39;re inside the CIA yourself? Guilty conscience? Have you defied shady orders?</p></li>
<li><p>What is your purpose to do this? Sell books? Get paid interviews? Radio show?</p></li>
<li><p>No witnesses? If your memo has been read by a million people already, then why do you still want to do a &quot;no witness&quot; meeting? Why should the POTUS trust a person like yourself to shed the Secret Service and whatever, when you were an intelligence agent that should be quite skilled at stealing info and perhaps killing people?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;You have 30 days to settle the country. A violent “American Spring” looms.&quot; You&#39;re starting one? Somebody from CIA whispered this tip into your ears? CIA starting another colour revolution? Which is it?</p></li>
<li><p>Once a CIA, always a CIA. Why should anyone trust what you&#39;re doing?</p></li>
<li><p>In your estimation, how many people are still languishing in Black Sites?</p></li>
<li><p>In your estimation, how many tons of drugs does the CIA smuggle per year? Which branch of the CIA does it, or is the whole organisation behind it?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the Black Budget funded, other than through drugs?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the CIA traffick humans? Sex slaves? Organs? Meat for consumption?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the CIA kill whistleblowers?</p></li>
<li><p>Which agency killed Michael Hastings?</p></li>
<li><p>Which agencies killed 9/11 truthers?</p></li>
<li><p>Which is the agency that suicide people? Have you suicided people, or directed their suiciding?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the CIA have the ability to remotely control all aircraft through the &quot;Uninterruptible Autopilot System&quot;? Which agencies have control over that?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the CIA have the ability to remotely control all vehicles? Which agencies have control over that?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know any politicians that are cannibals? Please list them.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know any politicians, and their staff, that are paedophiles? Please list them.</p></li>
<li><p>Which journalists are targeted by the government now?</p></li>
<li><p>Which journalists are targeted by the CIA now?</p></li>
<li><p>Which journalists are on the hit list now?</p></li>
<li><p>Are &quot;Targeted Individuals&quot; really targeted by the government, or are they crazy? Which agency is responsible for targeting them?</p></li>
<li><p>In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he claimed that people can travel to Mars through some machine and the air is breathable. Additionally, he claims that the colours were filtered so people see all red on TV. Is it true?</p></li>
<li><p>In one of the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; episodes by Jesse Ventura, he exposed an expansive base in the Ozarks mountain range. What is that facility for?</p></li>
<li><p>Are FEMA Camps now being used?</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 - Was it an inside job? Which agencies? Name names.</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 - Was it a plane? Remotely piloted plane? How was the plane remotely piloted? Was it a missile? Which flights were actually missiles? Where are the passengers if it was a missile? If it&#39;s not a missile, what plane was it?</p></li>
<li><p>Directed Energy Weapons. Real? What is the size of such a weapon if it&#39;s real? Meaning, anti-personnel, anti-tank, anti-building, area effect, etc? Space based? Air based? Land/Sea based?</p></li>
<li><p>Which agency killed Max Spiers?</p></li>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that come off as kinda shitty? It&#39;s totally disrespectful from the top, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, he descended from MSM-heliosphere into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and expected MSM questions? Upvote that shit or downvote it or ignore it...that&#39;s what they preach here, right? Otherwise, insulting and dehumanizing the Redditor in question was totally unnecessary. And then to turn around and answer his questions was beyond the pale. Maybe Steele is bi-polar and was off his meds, but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s not the kind of &#39;deplorable&#39; quotes that a political organizer / potential Libertarian candidate wants out there in the web-o-sphere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fly, thank you.   Other than the preening jerk (who can even manage to fuck up a thank you thread) I was quite delighted to find a bunch of serious people with good questions.  And with your leadership, I went back and answered all the jerk&#39;s questions.  For those who want to learn more I would suggest browsing the book reviews at <a href="http://phibetaiota.net/reviews/">http://phibetaiota.net/reviews/</a> -- over 2000 other minds summarized across 98 categories; then seach in simple terms at <a href="http://phibetaiota.net">http://phibetaiota.net</a> (e.g. false flag, pedophilia, deep state); and after that, if you want to explore my 30 years of writing and speaking out, <a href="http://robertdavidsteele">http://robertdavidsteele</a>.  This was a vastly better time than I was expecting.  Am on Common Sense with Dave Hodges at nine, will do another final 30 minutes at the AMA right now.</p>
