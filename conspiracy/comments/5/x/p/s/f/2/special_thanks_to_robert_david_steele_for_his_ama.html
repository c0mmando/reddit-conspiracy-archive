       RDS AMA
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to extend a special thanks to Robert David Steele for doing a huge AMA on
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       .  We have had many great AMA guest here over the years
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/wiki/amas">
        /r/conspiracy/wiki/amas
       </a>
       but I have never seen a guest hang out with the community for 3 days and genuinely discuss all manner of things with such enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the announcement sticky was overflowing with questions for, and answered by Robert.  I'm going to have to list the announcement sticky in our AMAs archive somehow because even there Robert was buzzing with energy to share information with all of us.  Regardless of what your opinion is about Robert's ideas, you must give him a huge thanks for taking to time to answer almost every question presented to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you Robert! I hope you get your A-team a meeting with Trump because we need unity like that, the 70% of disenfranchised but eligible voters having a voice again through Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, Ralph Nader, Dennis kucinich and yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Trump risk" will be for naught if the GoP establishment just steps in and runs the show.

       Whatever the merits of Steele's
       <em>
        revelations
       </em>
       , the guy rudely insulted a user who had what I thought were a list of 28 pretty damn good conspiracy- and credential-related questions. Steele's reply that the user "made Reddit look bad" and was "barely worthy as worm food" and "I wouldn't feed your ignorant remains to my dogs" for simply asking what he deemed "ignorant" questions was totally out of line and uncalled for and made him look easily rattled and mean. Then after insulting the user,  Steele oddly turned around and answered several of their good questions (to the best of his compartmentalized knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, rather than being objectively analytical, he came across as avidly self-promotional and rather self-important (i.e., Trump needs to read his brief and meet him alone for an hour or the alt-revolution will be doomed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, not bad infotainment, OP.

       You have to admit that the 28-question guy came across kinda shitty, and Steele specifically asked that individual comments be kept to three questions because his replies were difficult to manage.

         Why do retired CIA always come out and "expose" the CIA etc, eg yourself, Ray McGovern et al, when you guys probably have done loads of shady stuff when you're inside the CIA yourself? Guilty conscience? Have you defied shady orders?

         No witnesses? If your memo has been read by a million people already, then why do you still want to do a "no witness" meeting? Why should the POTUS trust a person like yourself to shed the Secret Service and whatever, when you were an intelligence agent that should be quite skilled at stealing info and perhaps killing people?

       Totally disrespectful? Do you mean disrespectful enough to rate a 'you're-not-fit-for-dog-food' response? Don't think so, but there again I'm probably too low on the food chain for my opinion to count either.

       So, he descended from MSM-heliosphere into
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and expected MSM questions? Upvote that shit or downvote it or ignore it...that's what they preach here, right? Otherwise, insulting and dehumanizing the Redditor in question was totally unnecessary. And then to turn around and answer his questions was beyond the pale. Maybe Steele is bi-polar and was off his meds, but I'm guessing that's not the kind of 'deplorable' quotes that a political organizer / potential Libertarian candidate wants out there in the web-o-sphere.

       Not only have I downvoted your post for completely failing to contribute anything, you're way over the line into trolling. Stop wasting everyone's time, no one cares what you think when you act like an asshole for absolutely no reason.

       Chiming in to say thank you. It was my favorite guest ama in conspiracy in a long time and plenty of things to think about now. Keeps sounding like the war will be made overt by May as one side or the other will be forced to act to rally public support against the other.

       Fly, thank you.   Other than the preening jerk (who can even manage to fuck up a thank you thread) I was quite delighted to find a bunch of serious people with good questions.  And with your leadership, I went back and answered all the jerk's questions.  For those who want to learn more I would suggest browsing the book reviews at

       (e.g. false flag, pedophilia, deep state); and after that, if you want to explore my 30 years of writing and speaking out,

       I did not comment in the AMA but read all your replies. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge, experience and ideas with us. Thank you for providing a lot of great sources too. I particularly enjoyed the Ellsburg-Kissinger piece and 'Dishonesty in the Army Profession' monograph. It was mind-blowing to me.  Keep up to good work.
