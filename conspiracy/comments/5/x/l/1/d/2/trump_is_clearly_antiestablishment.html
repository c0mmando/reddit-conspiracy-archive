       I see on this sub untrustworthiness of Trump.  I agree that we shouldn't necessarily back his every single move. For example, I disagree with his position on Snowden.  However, that being said, he literally said in his inaugration speech that a small group of people were running the country (the elites, the bankers, the globalists, you know the people were supposed to be against on this sub?) and that he was gonna take them down and hand the country back to the people.  There's many other reasons I can cite saying he's anti-establishment, yet that right there should be enough proof.  Wake the fuck up conspiracy

       How can you be your own brand of establishment?  I'm pretty sure you're missing the picture here.  As far as I'm concerned the 'establishment' is the shadow govt., the neocons, globalists.  There is only one type of establishment in America - those pushing a globalist/ one-world agenda, and he has openly spoken out against it.

       How is his cabinet a swamp? He picked who he thought was the most qualified people to carry out his policies for the position. Just because they have experience in the industry doesn't mean they are part of the swamp.  Would you have preferred he picked out a couple people off

       Trump has his issues and has an ego, but there is no denying that he measures his ego and success by what people think of him. It is actually refreshing to see a president bitch about negative opinions and lies about him rather than pretending that it doesn't exist.  President who keeps score by seeing how many people like him and criticising those skewing those numbers is better than a president that only cares for his donors, influential friends, and deep state buddies.

       This. His ego alone is what will drive him to try to be the GOAT president imo.

       yea it's not looking good, i'm afraid. He's pretty incompetent. How can you not straighten out your messaging? He's so easily trolled and manipulated by his twitter feed. If I was in his position, I would not have time to fuck around with twitter anymore! His ego is fucking taking over.

       How is his cabinet a swamp? He picked who he thought was the most qualified people to carry out his policies for the position. Just because they have experience in the industry doesn't mean they are part of the swamp.  Would you have preferred he picked out a couple people off
