       Your "strategy" seems like it's a way to further disrupt this sub, and yes, that will get you banned. We want to de-escalate the political bickering, and the best thing that everyone can do is to ignore that sort of content. If you retaliate, it just creates more noise.

       I say fuck this the internet is about 1 step away from entirely censoring us. Be ready to hit the streets and inform everyone of the truth. We are all divine beings living in a world where there is a lesser definition of evil than you currently believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently 225 Trillion dollars worldwide in debt to bankers. We treat each other like crap because they feed us garbage and treat us like worthless slaves. The earth is flat and I will destroy anyone in a battle of intelligence who would like to fight me.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to that herbs and fruits are the cures to everything in the world. To add more to that herbs and others could also be used as birth controls. We are being taken advantage of to the fullest and it's time, the jig is up.

       Just wondered if it was a part of your big plan. Your plan sounds a bit like vote manipulation with multiple accounts to me, be careful you don't get all your accounts suspended by the admins. If it's something else ignore this.

       We can always try, but if you refresh anything that has touchy information within you can see the vote count change every time you refresh. You would be fighting a battle hardly anyone would see to be honest with you. The internet is conscious.

       Try your idea I will be down to see how you guys do, but until you have thousands of up/down votes at your disposal I don't think you really stand a chance.

       that's a basic tactic though. Try to slander a user with bullshit, then hop on their alt accounts to agree with themselves or get some others to join in to create an astroturfed raid on someone.

       Thankfully, the people who are into that can't go outside of the script their given without fucking up so all you gotta do is toy with them until they come off as so stupid that no one believes their claims.

       I say we just keep contributing content and convince more actual people to vote in the new queue. I gave it a shot yesterday:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5xp0us/what_you_need_to_know_about_trade_secret/?st=izyo0cie&amp;amp;sh=360bcae2">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it was largely ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do my best to vote in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing would be stickies. If we could come up with a collaborative post with tons of information, maybe the mods will be nice enough to sticky it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, don't forget to venture out into the normal side of Reddit and contribute there. I spend way more time out there than here because there are more people on the fence you can reach. Your efforts will have more impact.

       If we see a post that has been posted, and is being massively shill downvoted, we can piggy back on top of it to boost you to the top (considering your post is a good contribution). Same with downvoting shill comments and posts.

       Here's a random idea. We could put our heads together, maybe in this thread, and try to find all of the posts that get buried, then only include information that has bipartisan support so there's no bias involved. Put it all in one thread and ask the mods for a sticky. We could do this on a weekly basis. Or I'll do it myself if noone is interested.  I'll be digging.

       If we get enough people together, we would each only have to spend like 30 minutes contributing to some kind of megathread per week. The only problem would be rounding up enough conspiracy theorists to collaborate on something. We are like cats.

       Man, you are awesome. I used to lurk here daily, yet sadly I hardly ever come here now. But it's good to see you are still around and making great posts. I really think you've educated many folks through your efforts here and elsewhere on reddit. This sub might have sunk to a low place but it definitely takes some of the sting out seeing great users like yourself still around fighting the good fight.

       I populate my Friends list with people who I've seen make consecutive good (acurate, researched from correct sources, making intuitive connections etc) comments or if they make a comment that 100% would be a no-go area for official shills (eg PG as of late).

       This also helps me navigate and gauge threads by looking for orange comments or lack thereof. Big surprise, flat earth threads are all blue except the bottom for me. Tells me that for my standards, the sorting process works.

       Damn, relax homey.  I was thinking we could pick one from this curated list.  I don't think enough people check out this community's confirmed conspiracies.  If the whole idea is to get people to see how controlled and manipulated we are by tptb why wouldn't consistent exposure to the bigger picture stuff be beneficial?

       I think people are just really passionate about different things. Confirmed conspiracies are great because they reinforce the point that these things are worth studying, but I think what gets people really passionate are the ones that remain unsolved. The frustration is that I think a lot of people feel the government and authorities are compliant with some of the worst behaviors - Corruption is the real issue on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are to fight corruption, it requires one to question reality and the status quo because corruption starts with complacency. When people look back over history and see that - in general - anybody with any kind of power or influence get off from all sorts of crimes, do we expect any different moving forward?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what people get passionate about. Confirmed conspiracies are great, but they are books that have been written. A lot of people here want to see a book being finished themselves - they want to see a story ended. I think that's what you're coming up against here. Just my 2 cents.

        The Black Panther Coloring Book was released in 1968 and follows the journey of black people from Africa to America, where they apparently all got huge knives and started killing cops. It sort of makes the Black Panthers look like crazy, irrational assholes, which was the point, because it was made by the FBI and sent to white families across the country.

       So it's only ok when it comes from a "respectable" and well funded organization called "Correct the Record" or "Shareblue"?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not fair. We have the truth on our side. I want this truth to get out, and I am willing to do anything to achieve that goal. I didn't anticipate having to deal with a coordinated Internet shill campaign, but if that's the case, it's a force to be reckoned with. Why can't we combat this ourselves? Fuck these people.

       With this now they'll have an argument, you accuse them of working for Shareblue and being paid and they'll say "WELL YOU DO IT TOO, SO HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT A TRUMP SHILL"?

       All im saying is when someone is spreading disinfo, make a claim and post a source that refutes it. If someone makes a post that attributes the sex trafficking arrests to trump's presidency, remind them there is no evidence to support that he has even ACKNOWLEDGED our investigation, let alone criminally pursuing elite pedophiles.

       Over 70 links on astroturfing
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">
        can be found here.
       </a>
       A lot of governments do this. Corporations do it. Superpacs do it. It's not a theory or unproven. We are talking about verified, admitted to, factual information. There are Trump shills and Hillary shills. Everything is in that link. If you are interested in shareblue and CTR, here ya go:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three ways you can obtain evidence of astroturfing. 1) Publicly admitting to it. 2) Confessions from the workers. 3) Leaving behind evidence on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all 3 of these from CTR and similar operations.

       That last one isn't all that surprising. They admitted to it on their own website, but it's kind of weird they left actual proof behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confessions. These also should not be surprising. If all of these governments and corporations hire shills, some will obviously go online and admit to it. Due to the fact that some people have signed non-disclosure agreements and fear repercussions, most confessions don't come with proof of identity. I'm not going to fluff this evidence up and make it something it's not. Some could be trolls for all we know. Make up your own mind for each one.

      </ul>
      <p>
       Here they don't specifically say "we are going to shill on Reddit" like CTR did, but it's a reasonable conclusion based on reading the memo and the fact that Shareblue and CTR have the same personnel and funders. They probably learned from CTR's mistake of publicly declaring your specific intentions.

       That BBC article about automated bots is based on a deeply retarded report. They defined "automated" as anyone with greater than 50 tweets a day, including RT, or with "bot" in their username. And they analysed the 1% of hashtag traffic released by Twitter API to make the conclusion, when they don't even know how Twitter selects it.

       Political bots exist. That's already a fact. This was they decide to estimate the ones supporting trump and Hillary. Normal people don't tweet 50 times a day, so it's weird that there is a cluster of these abnormal people who tweet about a politician.

       If you didn't notice Shareblue shill Russian321 posted a thread just like this saying Fuck Clinton, Trump, Bush, Obama, etc. The one at the top with like 7,000 upvotes that was like 50% downvoted last I checked

      <ol>
       <li>
        You don't like Trump (By your previous posts its obvious) and you dislike seeing him highly regarded here. It makes you so mad you are willing to invest time in censoring Trump supporters opinions

       OR
      </p>
      <ol>

        You work for a shill company and you guys have realized trying to sway the opinions of Conspiracy theorists in favor of Democrats is impossible so you are willing to compromise and try to neutralize them

       Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin. Guys like McCain, Lindsay Graham, and Paul Ryan are the exact same as Pelosi, Hillary, Podesta etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't part of that republican/democrat group. If you think he is then you are fucking blind. Theres a reason that group is trying at every step of the way to undermine Trump. For crying outloud two of Trumps biggest enemies are Republicans McCain and Graham. McCain was the one who handed over the fake Dossier to the FBI

       Trumps not one of them. The fact you lump him in with them shows you are biased beyond repair

       that's what i thought as well tbh especially after the long reply he gave me about "they are propping up Trump / Sessions pedo arrests as false proof that Trump is god".

       Yes, if he suddenly starts talking about gun restrictions, open borders then YES!

       but for now? what has he done to make us abandon him?

       its as if the only thing we can do is be sceptical of everything. what if theres someone whos genuinly possibly able to solve the problem?

       Maybe instead of worrying about the outside trolls, you should start policing your own. I have lurked reddit for years, but created an account just back in August. I like this sub, but you are the meanest, closed minded, wanna be elite/exclusive people I have ever met on reddit. I could post about my saggy balls on r/2xchromozones &amp; get more support than from some of the "old guard" here. Maybe instead of your crusade against shills you should look around. Example since this is conspiracy... "is pizza gate simply CTRs way of discrediting this sub &amp; running off casualy intrested people?" It did pop up around the same time &amp; makes utter nonsense. I see there has been more "clickbait" on here, but just don't click it &amp; do a better job moderating it. (That quickly became a manafesto, sorry)

       I've noticed the same thing on YouTube comments of Truther videos I'm not big into the scene but enjoy watching some of the more wacky ones. Everybody is constantly calling each other shills in their classic all caps motif. I began occaisionally testing this and within minutes I'm being called all kinds of shit. If I feel up to it Ill usually bat them around a bit with some bullshit rhetoric and they just go nuts. Looking at it from the outside it seems most are extremely paranoid and deluded, much of the time not rationally thinking things through. This is not to say I don't believe certain things I'm fairly red pilled but many of these people grasp at straws on many things and I believe much of the shill paranoia can be attributed to your run of the mill troll that do it for the lolz cause it sure as hell doesn't take much. I'm sure I'll be labeled a shill for this comment lol "His account is new that means he's a shill!"

       Well, we have identified several of their motives (and like I said, having the support and help of you guys would be great on this, chime in).
      </p>
      <p>
       -disrupt, annoy, clutter any discussions that are disruptive to TPTB
      </p>
      <p>
       -Push the idea that this discussion platform is dead, and has been taken over by Donald trump supporters, an has morphed into a conservative political echo chamber being repair
      </p>
      <p>
       -In addition to #2
       <sup>
        ,
       </sup>
       also make liberals feel unwelcome here, by making many snarky comments attacking the left political ideology
      </p>
      <p>
       -Push an anti-Jewish narrative, and possibly even a racist narrative
      </p>
      <p>
       -Show unwavering support for Donald trump, to give the illusion of community support for conservative values.
      </p>
      <p>
       -disrupt any and all discussion of child sex trafficking by the elite, BURYING "Pizzagate", and
       <strong>
        crediting the trump administration with all of the sex trafficking arrests
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply need to slap down any attempts to push this shit. Downvoting comments, upvoting GOOD submissions that encourage free thought and non-political views on important news. It's not that hard, but some of you guys are WAYYY SMARTER than I am, and could help out a LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in b4 someone quotes the way smarter comment and says "that's for certain"...

       Heh, those are a good set of points.  Basically thought this was happening, but good to see others also observe this behavior here.  Also occurring in other leftist subs like

       Yes, and great question by the way!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why.
      </p>
      <p>
       They allow a small circle of posters to exist here, that try to rally the idea that Trump and Sessions are going to pursue the pedophilia and human trafficking. Most of them are shills, many of the organic posters here know that no credit should be given to trump for any of these recent arrests, and that these arrests are all part of a "limited hangout" anyway, where only small time/mid level busts will happen, leaving the higher ups secure and the integrity of the GLOBAL ring intact and secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       By allowing posts in support of Donald trump and his administration's "pursuit of the pedophiles" to reach the front page, it gives the ILLUSION of community support for the new regime,  and makes it seem like the trump administration is earnestly and honestly going to criminally pursue these people (which is total fucking horseshit obviously).
      </p>
      <p>
       This perfectly makes the sub appear to be a conservative leaning forum, and sets them up for these kind of comments,
      </p>
      <p>
       "God damnit, this place is such a trump fuck fest...I swear it's the Donald 2.0 these days"
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to politiciZe and make this sub appear to be a republican echo chamber. This totally whitewashes our TRUE stance and message of rejecting the two party system; and makes it harder or lurkers and new visitors to take us seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are essentially doing whatever they can to mesh the "conspiracy culture/community", which is picking up steam, with conservative and alt right politics. Politicization is a key to keeping your message from reaching the masses. This is how they operate.

       Or you could just cultivate a healthy environment for discussion instead of trying to police a shill movement you have no way of monitoring. Creating a black list of shill users based on your bias is a recipe for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tag users I suspect of shilling for my own sanity but I would never share that list with others because ultimately I have no proof of their guilt and I can admit that I am not some flawless arbiter. This reeks of controlled opposition.

       Simply engaging in discussions honestly and without hidden agenda is threatening enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was posting in r/politics during election season, simply trolling my submissions and comments were not enough for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I did not back down they resorted to harassment and stalking and eventually banned me (by the mod who was involved with "donald duck" campaign later exposed by Project Veritas).

       well i didn't even mention pizzagate? so not sure why you're inclined to single out my user name randomly and comment, which i just picked because i thought it was funny.

      <p>
       Also, just because im against david brock/shariablue (which actually has connections to the whole pizzagate thing) doesn't mean I'll just follow a thread to the T and not comment on it anymore. Pizzagate would definitely fall under "anti-corruption" in my eyes.

       I'm on board for this. I have been part of this sub for years now and can spot a shill when I see one. I don't think many of us are "pro" either side of the political spectrum but most interpret any criticism about the "anti-trumps" as being "pro-trump". It's so frustrating.

      <p>
       Ultimately, I think most of us see the propaganda for exactly what it is. Propaganda.

       Yes, I'm a fucking coward; I'm too busy; I have kids; I would get knifed or start to be known as "that crazy guy...." Many excuses, but I've thought about it. I'm trying to agree with you that we often overlook the connections and potential discussions we can have away from the computers.

       Ok, there's a war taking place. That war is centered around the most explosive, conspiracy disclosing few months ever to occur in history, no doubt. These things are inherently tied to politics. There is no mentioning them without mentioning the players. It certainly seems like this could shut down a lot of talk on some pretty important topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like nothing better than to stick it to CTR but its not unreasonable to consider that this idea could possibly be coming from their own attempt at shutting down certain talk.

       I should have mentioned that political THEATRE is what we're trying to stray away from. Yes, discussing what our government is doing is necessary since they are the oppressors, but political leanings and political theatre is what we want to stray from.

       Good luck with that. I don't think you actually understand how the Shilling process works. Its not just getting a group of individuals together and upvoting something. Its also "TEXT" based subterfuge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already admitted to being a shill on a post i made here and i can tell you that this sub has been "compromised". It will never return to how it was prior to the "T_D" coming here.

       I used this account to Shill on r/the donald for 4 months before they banned it. I'm still shilling on r/politics as a liberal and am on r/twoxchromosomes pretending to be female.

       In american english, "cuckold" hasn't been used as an insult for like hundreds of years, until people from /pol/ starting using it to refer to liberals.

      <p>
       Just makes people sound like immature children, to me. Also, I've literally never heard someone use it IRL, ever. It's like calling people "faggot." Sounds edgy on the internet, makes you sound like a fucking moron in real life.

       You can't beat the truth with anything.  You can try to drown it out, you can try to shout out other truths louder. You can condemn those who speak the truth.

       I know I'll get downvoted for this, but did anyone ever think that there's an overlap between trump supporters and conspiracy subs is because the reason a lot of people voted for trump is because they're conspiracy theorists to some degree? Hence the excitement when he calls the news fake news and accuses Obama of wiretapping him, just to say the least?

       I still have a healthy skepticism, but yes, I'm a Trump supporter. The mass smear campaign from the corporate owned media alone was a sign to me that maybe something is truly different about him. I've seen quite a few election cycles, and I've never seen ANYTHING like this before.

       They buried Ron Paul and have him NO attention when he ran. That's how the media REALLY deals with true outsiders.

       The media attacking trump not only gave him free publicity, but have him "street cred" from conspiracy theorists and conservatives for some reason...

       Oh, most definitely. If he would have tried to act like a "professional politician" he would have been ignored by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe that Hillary handlers arranged for him to be her opposition, because they thought he was such a clown that no one would actually vote for him. And it backfired on them, which is why their media lap dogs are attacking him incessantly. People forget that Trump ran for president in 2000 as well for the reform party. And if you read his books, he's had the EXACT same views about politics for decades.

       Yes OP is ignoring the fact the Conspiracy theory community loved Trump from the start because he wasn't a Career Politician. Add in the fact Alex Jones supports Trump and you can see why Conspiracy theory forums seem to support Trump

       Just call them out when you see them and ask them to leave. They stand out like dogs balls in this sub. Remind them that this sub doesn't degenerate into bitch fights and arguments and people here are the best on reddit and their presence isn't compatible with the flavour of the sub.

       I'm a Trump supporter and a conspiracy regular.

       Also I hate David Brock and his Moloch worshipping vault dwelling virgins with avengence.

       i would like to mention that after getting in a debate against one of these Sharia Blue people, that one of them took the time to DM me personal hate. It had nothing to do with politics. It was pure hate. It is also worth noting that I never once insulted these men but simply called them out on their bullshit.

       Well, shareblue is working. It's making everyone argue and call everyone out for being a "shill". Divide and conquer. Seems to be working as planned. And it pains me to say that.

       Well, we have identified several of their motives (and like I said, having the support and help of you guys would be great on this, chime in).
      </p>
      <p>
       -disrupt, annoy, clutter any discussions that are disruptive to TPTB
      </p>
      <p>
       -Push the idea that this discussion platform is dead, and has been taken over by Donald trump supporters, an has morphed into a conservative political echo chamber being repair
      </p>
      <p>
       -In addition to #2
       <sup>
        ,
       </sup>
       also make liberals feel unwelcome here, by making many snarky comments attacking the left political ideology
      </p>
      <p>
       -Push an anti-Jewish narrative, and possibly even a racist narrative
      </p>
      <p>
       -Show unwavering support for Donald trump, to give the illusion of community support for conservative values.
      </p>
      <p>
       -disrupt any and all discussion of child sex trafficking by the elite, BURYING "Pizzagate", and
       <strong>
        crediting the trump administration with all of the sex trafficking arrests
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply need to slap down any attempts to push this shit. Downvoting comments, upvoting GOOD submissions that encourage free thought and non-political views on important news. It's not that hard, but some of you guys are WAYYY SMARTER than I am, and could help out a LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in b4 someone quotes the way smarter comment and says "that's for certain"...

       If we get enough people together, we would each only have to spend like 30 minutes contributing to some kind of megathread per week. The only problem would be rounding up enough conspiracy theorists to collaborate on something. We are like cats.

       All im saying is when someone is spreading disinfo, make a claim and post a source that refutes it. If someone makes a post that attributes the sex trafficking arrests to trump's presidency, remind them there is no evidence to support that he has even ACKNOWLEDGED our investigation, let alone criminally pursuing elite pedophiles.

       There was no way the media could ignore Trump, that's why he did all that crazy stuff in the beginning. It was a manipulation tactic.

       Political bots exist. That's already a fact. This was they decide to estimate the ones supporting trump and Hillary. Normal people don't tweet 50 times a day, so it's weird that there is a cluster of these abnormal people who tweet about a politician.
