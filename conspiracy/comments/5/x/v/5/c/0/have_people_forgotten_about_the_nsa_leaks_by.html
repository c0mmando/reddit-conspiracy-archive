    <div class="md"><p>Obama <em>had</em> to have ordered it. The Department of Justice was targeting a political opponent . . . and wouldn&#39;t have dared do it without a direct order. </p>

<p>They knew it was Nixon Watergate shit, and would never in a million years have randomly sought to do it. These are career flaks. Yes-men.</p>

<p>No one would have stuck out his own neck to going to the FISA court and trying to target Trump (as we now know happened from the documentation.</p>

<p>The White House tried two documented times: In the first try, they wanted to open a criminal probe into Trump (under the guise of saying that he might have ties to Russian banks). No such ties could ever be found. Now that the criminal probe failed, they decided to turn it from a &quot;criminal&quot; probe to a &quot;national security&quot; probe [hence going to the FISA court].</p>

<p>The FISA court is known for being a rubber stamp. They almost always approve requests to tap people&#39;s phones and email. Yet in this case, even the FISA court turned down the Obama Administration&#39;s request.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it was patently a Richard Nixon Watergate attempt to spy on a political opponent.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s repeat this: The FISA almost never turns down requests. They have something like a 99.98% rate of saying,  &quot;Yes&quot;. But even the FISA court knew that this didn&#39;t pass the smell test.</p>

<p>This was merely Obama spying on a political opponent, and turning the information over to the DNC as opposition research (who then leaked stuff to the Press).</p>

<p>Long story short: Obama <em>did</em> order it, and, no, it wasn&#39;t legal.</p>

<p>So to sum up: 1) No, no Russian ties exist, and 2) No, the intelligence community is not allowed to random spy on US presidential candidates in the middle of an election and leak that information to the DNC as opposition research.

<p>Get out of here with that bullshit Trump talking point. </p>

<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), representing 17 intelligence agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leaked its documents to WikiLeaks.[5] In early January 2017, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified before a Senate committee that Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign went beyond hacking, and included disinformation and the dissemination of fake news often promoted on social media. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/06/us/politics/document-russia-hacking-report-intelligence-agencies.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/06/us/politics/document-russia-hacking-report-intelligence-agencies.html</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election</a></p>

<p>Independent cybersecurity firms also believe that Russian intelligence hacked the DNC. In June and July 2016, cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike,Fidelis, Mandiant, SecureWorks and ThreatConnect, stated the leak of emails in the 2016 U.S. elections was part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups, called Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear,also known respectively as APT28 and APT29. Other actors working in connection with APT28 were called Sofacy, Sednit and Pawn Storm, collectively labeled by SecureWorks as Threat Group 4127 (TG-4127). ThreatConnect also noted possible links between the DC Leaks project and Russian intelligence operations because of a similarity with Fancy Bear attack patterns. DC Leaks had published material from NATO General Philip Breedlove and from George Soros&#39; Open Society Foundations.[69] Fancy Bear was also suspected of hacking the world anti-doping agency in relation with the exclusion of Russian athletes from the 2016 Olympic Games.<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a>; <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf</a></p>

<p>Russia has a long history of cyberwarfare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_Russia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_Russia</a></p>

<p>Russia and the Soviet Union have a long history of espionage in the United States. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_espionage_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_espionage_in_the_United_States</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_espionage_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_espionage_in_the_United_States</a>. </p>

<p>Trump admits in a press conference that Russia was probably behind the DNC hacks, but he also said it could have been another country. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference.html</a></p>

<p>On January 6, 2017, Reuters reported on a secret briefing given to Barack Obama by U.S. intelligence agencies on January 5, and scheduled to be shown to Trump a few days later. According to this assessment, the CIA had identified specific Russian officials who provided hacked e-mails to WikiLeaks in an effort to influence the presidential election. The hacked material sometimes followed &quot;a circuitous route&quot; from Russia&#39;s military intelligence services (GRU) to WikiLeaks, thus enabling WikiLeaks to claim that the Russian government was not the source of the material published on its website. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-celebrate-idUSKBN14P2NI">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-celebrate-idUSKBN14P2NI</a></p>

<p>In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. said Trump&#39;s businesses &quot;see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.&quot; &quot;And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There&#39;s indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble,&quot; he said.

<p>Donald Trump Jr. gave a speech to a pro-Russian group that advances the Kremlin&#39;s foreign policy interests.

<p>Trump&#39;s presidential campaign manager, Paul Manafort, resigned amid reports that he worked on the political campaign of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had been forced to flee office because of his pro-Russian stance. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/15/donald-trumps-ties-russia-go-back-30-years/97949746/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/15/donald-trumps-ties-russia-go-back-30-years/97949746/</a>. </p>

<p>Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned for lying to the Vice President about his conversation with the Russian ambassador. </p>

<p>No, my source is 17 different intelligence agencies that all independently came to the conclusion that Russia hacked the DNC, in addition to several private cybersecurity firms. Unless your conspiracy theory is that James Clapper single handedly forced all of these agencies to claim that Russia hacked the DNC, then the fact that Clapper ALSO believes Russia hacked the DNC doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

<p>also it doesn&#39;t logically follow that just because somebody lies once then every single other thing they say is a lie. Trump has been caught lying several times. Do you think everything Trump says is a lie?</p>

<p>Go back and read those sources. They are mostly non-Obama related and non-political. You can&#39;t just call somebody political beacuse they are saying something you don&#39;t like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you specifically cited the discredited Clapper.</p>

<p>And as for the &quot;17 intelligence agencies,&quot; that&#39;s a cannard, too. Only 3 agencies are involved with such assessments. Not 17.</p>

<p>The whole &quot;17 agencies&quot; claim was a Hillary Clinton talking point. And it was made up by James Clapper and Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Go to Google. Key in the search terms &quot;Only three agencies&quot; and &quot;responsible for national security assessments&quot;.</p>

<p>Not seventeen.</p>

<p><em>Three!</em> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a CBS report on it: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-on-russian-hacking-released-by-intelligence-community/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-on-russian-hacking-released-by-intelligence-community/</a></p>

<p>Of the three agencies, one of the reports came from the Director of National Intelligence: James &quot;Lies-to-Congress&quot; Clapper.</p>

<p>The other was Muslim-American (and Obama stooge) James Brennan, from the NSA.</p>

<p>And the last is James &quot;Dirty Cop&quot; Comey at the FBI.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making up that nickname. That&#39;s what the rank-and-file members of the FBI call Comey: Dirty Cop.</p>

<p>He&#39;s chosen as the Clintons&#39; foil every time they come up under investigation [from White Water to Benghazi] and he always seems to let them walk.</p>

<p>So you have three Clinton and Obama stooges who are responsible for the claim.</p>

<p>And then they gave their assessment to the other intelligence agencies (who never even reviewed it).</p>

<p>I&#39;d take their word over the word of some random person on reddit or the man who said that Ted Cruz&#39;s dad murdered JFK any day. It&#39;s honestly laughable that people in this sub continue to take Trump&#39;s tweets at face value even though he regularly spouts baseless bullshit and never offers any proof. If there really was a secret court order to spy on Trump, why doesn&#39;t he declassify it and make it public? He&#39;s the President now, he can do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. The state of New Jersey didn&#39;t investigate him for the full 12 months they should have before granting his casino a license. There were multiple links between Trump and mafia but once his license was granted state investigators buried evidence to cover the fact that they were negligent before.  He even tried to sue one of his tenants for making alterations to her apartment which was right below his, but she countersued claiming to have evidence of corruption and kickbacks that would require the Attorney General to get involved. Trump ended up paying her a half million dollar settlement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m sure Obama ordered the wiretaps directly himself... it makes perfect sense. Wiretap your political opponent during the election, an election Obama probably thought Hillary was going to win. But then she loses. Trump becomes president and then for some reason Obama decides to leak the fact that he ordered a wiretap on trump. Because fuck it, why not?</p>

<p>I mean if Trump wants to find out how/why they wiretapped his tower, he doesn&#39;t have to ask congress for an investigation. He&#39;s the president, he can literally go ask the DoJ to hand over any evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone claiming Obama&#39;s administration didn&#39;t violate the fourth amendment by spying on Trump is a liar, shill, and/or useful idiot. We already know unequivocally that FISA approved a wiretap and we know that those spy fucks were spying on Michael Flynn because they leaked what they found to the fucking media after illegally spying on him. </p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, Trump is terrible, but you know what else is terrible. Violations of the fourth amendment. The surveillance state. The fucking CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obamas plan is working just as planned. To take the heat off the dems and to focus all the media attention on trump and the Russians. Isn&#39;t it odd that 17 days before Obamas reign is over that he silently changes how classified, not always true, just assumptions of information is processed. Instead of going to just the NSA, its given to all 17 different subsidies. So leaks will be so much harder to pinpoint given all the different hands it goes through.  Try telling that to someone from OCCUPY DEMOCRATS. They&#39;ll block your ass </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s plausible that Trump was tapped on the same level as everybody everywhere, there&#39;s doubtless entire tape libraries dedicated to him alone. What seems implausible is that Obama would explicitly tap Trump by named individual or the building itself by name. It&#39;s just illogical when the NSA can just search for Trump in their vast libraries of recorded shit. Not a tinfoil hatter it&#39;s just accepted reality at this point. Why should Trump be above the rest of us?</p>

<p>The MSM did not get much into it, but it turned out the IRS was actually targeting progressive groups at a higher rate. There were so many conservative groups popping up the number of conservatives was higher, but percentage wise, progressive groups were more targeted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama <em>had</em> to have ordered it. The Department of Justice was targeting a political opponent . . . and wouldn&#39;t have dared do it without a direct order. </p>

<p>They knew it was Nixon Watergate shit, and would never in a million years have randomly sought to do it. These are career flaks. Yes-men.</p>

<p>No one would have stuck out his own neck to going to the FISA court and trying to target Trump (as we now know happened from the documentation.</p>

<p>The White House tried two documented times: In the first try, they wanted to open a criminal probe into Trump (under the guise of saying that he might have ties to Russian banks). No such ties could ever be found. Now that the criminal probe failed, they decided to turn it from a &quot;criminal&quot; probe to a &quot;national security&quot; probe [hence going to the FISA court].</p>

<p>The FISA court is known for being a rubber stamp. They almost always approve requests to tap people&#39;s phones and email. Yet in this case, even the FISA court turned down the Obama Administration&#39;s request.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it was patently a Richard Nixon Watergate attempt to spy on a political opponent.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s repeat this: The FISA almost never turns down requests. They have something like a 99.98% rate of saying,  &quot;Yes&quot;. But even the FISA court knew that this didn&#39;t pass the smell test.</p>

<p>This was merely Obama spying on a political opponent, and turning the information over to the DNC as opposition research (who then leaked stuff to the Press).</p>

<p>Long story short: Obama <em>did</em> order it, and, no, it wasn&#39;t legal.</p>
