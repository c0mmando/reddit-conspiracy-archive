       Perhaps not a conspiracy in the purest sense, but I think this paragraph reveals a bit of insight into how late-night hosts (and other television personalities) are straightjacketed by forces greater than themselves...how these men and women may not even necessarily be "shills," but comedians trying to do their job while navigating a hostile corporate environment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Q: It’s also interesting how the late-night hosts have gotten softer with their interviews at the same time as they’ve gotten more biting with the news. Is something valuable lost when the discussions between the hosts and guests are always so pleasant?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         A:
        </strong>
        Well, at some point
        <strong>
         publicists took over the talk shows
        </strong>
        . They were the people that booked the guests, and they had six or seven guests, so
        <strong>
         you had to be awfully nice to Guest A if you wanted to get to Guest B or C
        </strong>
        . I was not aware that this was going on until people started saying, “So-and-so is not going to be back on the show if you don’t be nice to so-and-so.” And I said, “What do we care?” And they’d say, “Well, because they also manage so-and-so and so-and-so’s sister, and we want those people on the show.” I realized not early into it that we were a tool for the careers of other people, which mediates what you’re going to talk about: In 2015, [Harrison] Ford broke his pelvis in an emergency plane landing at an L.A. golf course. In February, he accidentally landed on an airport taxiway in Orange County. “I’m Harrison Ford, and I can’t talk about landing a plane on a golf course.” I’m not saying it even makes the show worse.
        <strong>
         I can remember having a conversation via the sales department about Tylenol, and we had Bill O’Reilly on the show
        </strong>
        , and we were talking about something in the news, not particularly unpleasant but just something in the news.
        <strong>
         Tylenol called up and said, “You know what? We’re just going to lay out [
         <em>
          not advertise
         </em>
         ] tonight. We’ll be back.”
        </strong>
        And rightly so. If you want to see adversarial conversation, you have cable-news channels all day long.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, take what Tylenol did, and consider that tons of advertisers do the same thing...and if you do something too controversial, a large chunk of your network's potential income is endangered, and suddenly you're not only risking your own job, but the
       <em>
        jobs of everyone you employ
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably nothing revelatory for long-time conspiracy fans, but I enjoy seeing parts of the media world's seedy underbelly be exposed in mainstream forums (by mainstream entertainers) like this.

       Sure, Dave. It's just capitalism at work that describes what goes on with late-night TV and Hollywood. That's why you continue to go to work every day, having scripted, shallow interviews as a corporate slave even though you're in the $50+ million club. Cool story...from an occultist

       33rd degree Mason....at least. Let fellow 33rd (at least) Mason Brian Williams spout, in great detail, his "heroic helicopter story" on his show. There's more, but I'm not up for the effort right now. Google around.

       It's not just "late night" or "Hollywood". I remember having to call on a customer who hated my company but was forced to meet with me every month. Each meeting was about the "whore" he knew from my company that had a child out of wedlock and the rest how my company was a gang of pirates. After about six months I got him to talk about his boat but I never got his respect or business. Like Bob Dylan said " you're gonna have to serve somebody" and unless you're a lucky sperm club member I'm sure you have a story of your own nondualove.
