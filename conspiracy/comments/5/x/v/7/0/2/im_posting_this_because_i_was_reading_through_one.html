Come on come on
I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,
"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.
Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare.
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.
Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.
"It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said.
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.
I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.
Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.
And that's how it's supposed to be.
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed, and that's the way it is
      </p>
      <p>
       [Bridge w/ changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
aww yeah
[Repeat]
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no changes. All I see is racist faces.
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.
I wonder what it takes to make this one better place...
let's erase the wasted.
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.
And only time we chill is when we kill each other.
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.
And although it seems heaven sent,
we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.
But some things will never change.
Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.
Now tell me what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.
You gotta operate the easy way.
"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way.
Sellin' crack to the kids. "I gotta get paid,"
Well hey, well that's the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Bridge]
      </p>
      <p>
       [Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.
Instead of war on poverty,
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.
But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.
You gotta learn to hold ya own.
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.
But tell the cops they can't touch this.
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.
That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.
Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh

       regarding lincoln, i've always believed it was a false flag. the only ones with anything to gain in his assination were the radical republicans. the south had everything to loose, and it did loose everything, because he had already anounced that the south woukd be let in with a very lenient reconciliation program, and as soon as he died the radical republicans went jacobin on the south..
      </p>
      <p>
       however, it is not the case that he was pro-freedom. the emancipation proclamation was the most cynical thing ever written in our history. likewise, like them or loathe them, his decision to not let the south leave and the way he ran the country was tyrannical.
      </p>
      <p>
       the civil war about "slavary" but not its morality, its economics. the north wanted to force the south to buy and trade with them, not england. they had been trying to strangle them with tariffs for sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
       the truth of the matter is that american civil was should more properly be understood as the last stage of the english civil war.

       I was just talking to my wife about 2pac the other day. She didn't understand what I was trying to explain, and then a 2pac song came on over the radio with perfect timing. 2pac was trying to teach his people self-respect, can't fuckin have that.

       People love to idolize celebrities that die, Bill Cooper lived and breathed his philosophy. Tupac on the other hand, was just a rapper, he encouraged the degenrate parts of his own society through his music which he did for money and because he said a few things in some interviews that vaugly display what we all know is the current state of this country, he is somehow a martyr for truth. 
They dont give a fuck what these rappers say, because people dont care. Im guessing you believe Kanye is the next messiah for truth. If people cared they could look all the great information for themselves,but thats not cool. No what celebrities do is cool, so as  soon as you can hop on this bullshit enlightened bandwagon you do because its cool. When your celebrity shuts up you quit talking about bringing down the system. Celebrities make parrots not revolutions or change. Im using "you" here generally.

       Exactly, the guy was just a teen idol that got shot from pissing off the wrong street thugs. Just because he was on MTV doesn't make him a revolutionary. But because he got shot now people can attach mystery and conspiracy to his name. Chuck D was way more politicaly radical than Tupac, but he never ate a bullet for his homies, so he is just a normal dude. Tupac is a revolutionary icon though, this is a bit ridiculous.

       Tupac's power when he was alive shouldn't be underestimated. People, esp the black community, loved Tupac and his positive message (yea he did talk some gangster shit too) and he brought people together while often teaching in his music about love and respect and breaking the chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could have galvanzied a large group of people and was openly anti-TPTB. And you know what happens to those types of people.
