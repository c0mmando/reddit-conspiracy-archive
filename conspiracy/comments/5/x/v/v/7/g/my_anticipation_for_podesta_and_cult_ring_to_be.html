    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how this works...</p>

<p>They don&#39;t use kids with a community out looking for them. They take orphans, trafficked children, and procure their victims from the black market. These kids don&#39;t live normal lives - they are treated like animals. They have usually been unimaginably scarred and many do not have the basic skills to even ask for help if they were given a chance. The reason you don&#39;t hear about victims is because they either become the &#39;master&#39; themselves, or they die. You can assume that somebody would escape, but when the victims are without a voice there is little hope. You often see this with serial killers who prey on prostitutes and addicts - they can get away with it a lot longer by preying on people without communities who will come looking for them. We had a local serial killer who would feed his victims to his pigs - it wasn&#39;t until they dug 20 feet down in his pig pen that they started to find teeth and shit. </p>

<p>So if your victims are traumatized children who are not conditioned to the regular world, how are you ever going to get caught unless you massively screw up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Pretty much all the basics that I&#39;ve read but I would really like some links on those that were silenced/killed for trying to come forward like Monica Peterson or Max Spiers.....also, I never knew about that WAPO article. It&#39;s funny how in 1 year a media outlet can completely change their interest in the subject.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you looking for victims specifically from Comet Ping Pong. I should have prefaced by calling it pedogate, not pizzagate. Your right there are no confirmed Comet Ping Pong victims that came forward besides that IAMA victim from last month that had the sub retried deleted. But there thousands of stories of child trafficking that are out there. I don&#39;t have time to send you a thousand links though....let&#39;s stop narrowing the focus on pizza and then the lines start to become clearer. It&#39;s almost like that name was part of the cover up. Since we say &quot;pizza&quot; instead of &quot;pedo&quot; the vast nature of this crime gets delegitimized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate evolved to envelope every sex crime, human trafficking crime, or child abuse crime after a couple months. Ask yourself why. Why did they begin to say &quot;the Franklin scandal is part of it! So is Penn state! So is the Catholic church!&quot;?</p>

<p>Because after a couple months, people realized pizzagate was going nowhere fast. So they began to latch onto every true case just to muster up some credibility. Thing is those cases have nothing to do with Alefantis or Podesta.</p>

<p>Then they began taking credit for every future arrest made in relation to a sex crime, not just pedophilia. Ask yourself why. I believe it&#39;s to maintain relevance, to keep people pushing it.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has caused 0 arrests. None. 6 months and not one person has even been implicated in a specific sex crime. Not one. &quot;But look at all the arrests!&quot; That&#39;s fascinating, but they have nothing to do with pizzagate. Show me one person pizzagate has pointed out as a pedo that has then been charged with a crime relating to sex and/or children. Just one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I had a buddy in NYPD look into arrest records today between pedo arrests in first 3 months last year compared to this year. I was hoping to see something good but there were actually 4 more pedo arrests last year in that time period then there were this year. I was hoping there would be more. It doesn&#39;t seem like NYPD is doing anything different right now. So I am skeptical as to the arrests that people bring up. I hope they are just building cases since Anthony Weiner laptop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The legal case regarding Wiener&#39;s laptop actually goes to court. Some who claim to have friends or sources in the NYPD have said that this is when some questionable things may be brought up and uncovered, but it seems like a long-shot.

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you want that. What do you want to get off watching the evidence? I want it to be exposed so nobody else is harmed. You must not have kids then or your just a psychopath. I wonder what motivates you to squash the theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha the theory is bullshit put out by pedophiles to cover thier tracks. Lol you think with all this info out, if it was true theyd be locked up by now? </p>

<p>Ive been studying these pedo rings for over 10 years, you just jump on the bandwagon and think you know everything... gtfo. Anytime a pedo elite gets busted, it happens right away. If podesta got busted right when pg started then we would have this major ring, but he didnt. Because it all bullshit.</p>

<p>No accusations, no victims, no alleged victims, just a bunch of leaked shit without sources. #thankstrump</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I know everything. That&#39;s why I posed questions so I can learn more....so are you saying that you&#39;ve been wasting your time for 10 years. It seems like that would make you a believer then? Why investigate so long if it&#39;s BS? You could have become a lawyer or doctor in that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol i believe tptb control a large pedo ring, but havent seen a shred of evidence to connect it to pizzagate. Thats why i think its fake. Plus trump is a pedo, but nobody cares cause podesta, amirite?
While people here are chasing lies, there are real victims of crimes out there begging for help..
These people never get exposed unless they do it themselves because they need to cover up the larger ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I have heard of his connections to Jeffrey Epstein too so who the hell knows. He hasn&#39;t ever alluded to the subject so I guess your right, probably nothing will be investigated. The only thing that is weird is that these people are all scrambling as if they fear him (and it&#39;s not because of there devotion to the people). It seems like he knows stuff that will destroy them. Otherwise if they had something on him they wouldn&#39;t be grasping at threads to delegitimize him. It&#39;s all very strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how do we revolt? I know that&#39;s a silly question but since the media squashes everything because they are the first line of defense then how do citizens get together where they have to be taken seriously. Do we all throw on Guy Fawkes masks and match on Washington? Is anonymous involved and is there anything they can do? Is Julian Assange just a puppet for TPTB? I know I have questions but you seem like you know your shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act like pizzagate has evolved with the help of someone pushing the narrative. This isn&#39;t WAPO or New York Times. The investigations are being done by citizens like you and I. Those same citizens have showed their faces (in some cases) so it&#39;s not like they are hiding an agenda. I agree that everything is being balled up and generalized which should stop. Every pedo arrest in the country is not related. There are just other sick fuggs in this world too. I don&#39;t think we should stop our focus on Podesta or HRC and everything leaked from their emails. If it gets too watered down then everyone forgets they were supposedly involved. </p>
