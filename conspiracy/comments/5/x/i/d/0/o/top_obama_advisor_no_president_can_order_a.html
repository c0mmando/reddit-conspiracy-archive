<p>It wasn&#39;t too long after that when Eisenhower was caught in a LIE before the whole entire world.  The U2 flight over the USSR pulled Ike&#39;s pants down--and the whole world knew Ike Eisenhower, a sitting US president, was a LIAR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 1960 U-2 incident occurred during the Cold War on 1 May 1960, during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the premiership of Nikita Khrushchev, when a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down while in Soviet airspace. The aircraft, flown by Central Intelligence Agency pilot Francis Gary Powers, was performing photographic aerial reconnaissance when it was hit by an S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile and crashed near Sverdlovsk. Powers parachuted safely and was captured.</p>

<p>Initially the United States government tried to cover up the plane&#39;s purpose and mission, but was forced to admit its military nature when the Soviet government came forward with the captured pilot and remains of the U-2 including spying technology that had survived the crash as well as photos of military bases in the Soviet Union taken by the aircraft. Coming roughly two weeks before the scheduled opening of an eastâ€“west summit in Paris, the incident was a great embarrassment to the United States[2] and prompted a marked deterioration in its relations with the Soviet Union. Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to three years of imprisonment plus seven years of hard labor but would be released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a prisoner exchange for Soviet officer Rudolf Abel.[3]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no president can legally order a wire tap, but that is begging the question.</p>

<p>my understanding is that the accusation is that the wire tap was illegal. presidents may order illegal things all the time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty against state surveillance but sharing information should be a priority if it has to by law, be collected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No president can order a wiretap, yet here we are.</p>

<p>General Flynn was taken down with a wiretap NOT ordered by the President.
Now, apparently, Trump has learned that they tried it on him also.
And Merkel.
And everyone in the French elections.
And Brazilian president before Olympics.</p>

<p>According to Snowden, that list of people being wiretapped, but NOT by the President, is also you and me.</p>

<p>With that list, if he didn&#39;t want it done, he missed about 400,000,000 opportunities to stop it.</p>
