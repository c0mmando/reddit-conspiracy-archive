It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he knew they were underage and not 18, 19... that should be examined. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to say that a pedophile would hide the truth from pretty much everybody in his life. I don&#39;t think the quote is concrete evidence that he was aware of the magnitude of Epstein&#39;s crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, this is a very sophisticated blackmail control fabric that exists to keep politicians in line.  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s run out of the deep state.  If you want to figure out who runs this blackmail control fabric, you have to realize that politicians are selected for office based upon their compatibility with it.</p>

<p>And then, once you fully digest that, it becomes clear that the people controlling this are the ones with the power to get candidates elected.</p>

<p>Let that sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to adjust your point of view to understand the situation  properly. Consider trump &amp; the deep state as two walls of the same house. What really matters is that the &quot;house&quot; controls and maintains the status quo. This fringe drama in whatever form, be it pedophiles, campaign violations or unwarranted surveillance, is meant to keep you distracted from the real problem. Democracy in the USA no longer exists, but yeah maybe ousting some pedophiles will solve all our problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think partially, probably. But ignoring all of the pedophilic speculation, he is a threat to the establishment - the same way we wanted someone like Bernie to have been if he hadn&#39;t been displaced and then pushed into complacency to support Hillary&#39;s campaign. </p>

<p>Everything from all of the x-industrial complexes, to the yellow journalists, to the growing push for globalization... it&#39;s all in threat now. And you have to know the push back against him is for those reasons.</p>
