       I always see claims that russia has rigged our election in favor of trump but how exactly did they do this? falsified votes? my question is what did russia do that is clearly rigging in favor of trump. I acknowledge that they tried to spread disinfo but i do not think that counts as russia rigging our election. please inform me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: russians hacking dnc emails doesn't qualify as rigging imo so please offer alternative answer besides that

       well i was kind of hopping someone aligned with the narrative would provide some evidence to back up their claims and i thought maybe you would be that person but your statement doesn't express your side so i kinda just assumed, im sorry :(

       You also assumed in against you for some reason. I just tried to answer your question from what I have read. I read the other day they wanted to go back to paper voting because of this. So I assumed what I said.  Heres CNNs take:

       So far the charge is that they hacked the DNC and John Podesta and leaked the emails to Wikileaks.   I don't think the wikileaks releases had any real impact on voters however.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT
      </p>
      <p>
       There's another theory that's quite clever that is the investigative worth of Louise Mensch and goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       When Weiner was busted for sexting a fifteen year old girl,  he said publicly but later keep quiet about it, that he thought it was a "catfish" deal, where someone pretends to be someone young and attractive and communicates with a target over the internet, but the person is a fake creation of a duper.
      </p>
      <p>
       However there is an actual fifteen year old girl in North Carolinawho went to the police and is currently involved in the investigation as the victim.  But her father has some shady connections to cyber hackers in North Carolina, who themselves were busted for stealing former CIA head John Brennan's personal emails and giving them to wikileaks!
      </p>
      <p>
       When the N.Y. FBI confiscated the laptop Weiner had used to send the fifteen year old lewd messages, they of course also found a folder with Hillary Clinton emails. But it turns out they were duplicates that had already been made pubic by the FBI.  It was assumed that Huma must have been responsible for then getting there, buy she said she never used that laptop, which is believable! But she was so embarrassed by yet another scandal and divorced Weiner immediately, so that pubic statement too got lost on the shuffle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's the theory:  hackers (Russian?) Catfish Weiner, remotely plant the batch of duplicate emails on the laptop during the communicating, bust him to the FBI, knowing they'll find the emails and it'll blow up the at the time closed Hillary private email server investigation.  And of course, that's just what happened. And whereas the wikileaks stuff DIDN'T really swing the election, the Comey letter really DID!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Trump supporter, so I kind of how it isn't true, but am open to it. Even if he did conspire to steal the election Good Bless him I say

       Watergate was first reported in February of 73 and approval to begin impeachment didn't come until '74, so I don't expect things to happen overnight.

       Literally the only thing it comes down to in that narrative is "the Russians hacked their emails and showed everyone what utter, despicable crap we're in to"
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you want to believe that Russia did that (and Wikileaks has pointedly said it was not a Russian) then Russia did us a favour the US government couldn't see fit to do.

       So do you feel there should be an independent investigation on possible Trump Administration ties to Russia, in the interest of transparency?

       Sure, as long as we're adding Pelosi, McCain and Hillary to that investigation. I mean if we're going to investigate ties to Russia with zero supporting evidence in the interest of transparency, lets get all this other shit transparent already.

       They didn't rig anything, this is the media taking the disinformation stuff and saying that that is Russia 'hacking' our elections. Basically the only real disinformation is from our own media. Russia's involvement is questionable on all levels actually, the DNC leaks most likely had nothing to do with Russia and came from an inside source. Podesta is an idiot who used an extremely weak password which lead to his emails becoming compromised. It all boils down to insiders leaking, and Podesta being stupid and the media perpetuating the Russian hacking myth to attempt to sway people into believing the election process was sullied by an outside source and that Trump is illegitimate. Even Obama himself claimed our elections were safe from hacking.

       The email dump so close to the election probably did make a difference, but the Comey Weiner email bs did the real damage.

       Have you really?  I have not seen one person claim that Russia rigged the election.  The claiming being made is that Russia influenced the elections through the use of online trolls and propaganda and that there were illegals deals made between Russia and Trumps people.
