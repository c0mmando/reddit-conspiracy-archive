    <div class="md"><p>So far the charge is that they hacked the DNC and John Podesta and leaked the emails to Wikileaks.   I don&#39;t think the wikileaks releases had any real impact on voters however. </p>

<p>BUT </p>

<p>There&#39;s another theory that&#39;s quite clever that is the investigative worth of Louise Mensch and goes like this:</p>

<p>When Weiner was busted for sexting a fifteen year old girl,  he said publicly but later keep quiet about it, that he thought it was a &quot;catfish&quot; deal, where someone pretends to be someone young and attractive and communicates with a target over the internet, but the person is a fake creation of a duper.  </p>

<p>However there is an actual fifteen year old girl in North Carolinawho went to the police and is currently involved in the investigation as the victim.  But her father has some shady connections to cyber hackers in North Carolina, who themselves were busted for stealing former CIA head John Brennan&#39;s personal emails and giving them to wikileaks! </p>

<p>When the N.Y. FBI confiscated the laptop Weiner had used to send the fifteen year old lewd messages, they of course also found a folder with Hillary Clinton emails. But it turns out they were duplicates that had already been made pubic by the FBI.  It was assumed that Huma must have been responsible for then getting there, buy she said she never used that laptop, which is believable! But she was so embarrassed by yet another scandal and divorced Weiner immediately, so that pubic statement too got lost on the shuffle.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the theory:  hackers (Russian?) Catfish Weiner, remotely plant the batch of duplicate emails on the laptop during the communicating, bust him to the FBI, knowing they&#39;ll find the emails and it&#39;ll blow up the at the time closed Hillary private email server investigation.  And of course, that&#39;s just what happened. And whereas the wikileaks stuff DIDN&#39;T really swing the election, the Comey letter really DID!</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Trump supporter, so I kind of how it isn&#39;t true, but am open to it. Even if he did conspire to steal the election Good Bless him I say</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t rig anything, this is the media taking the disinformation stuff and saying that that is Russia &#39;hacking&#39; our elections. Basically the only real disinformation is from our own media. Russia&#39;s involvement is questionable on all levels actually, the DNC leaks most likely had nothing to do with Russia and came from an inside source. Podesta is an idiot who used an extremely weak password which lead to his emails becoming compromised. It all boils down to insiders leaking, and Podesta being stupid and the media perpetuating the Russian hacking myth to attempt to sway people into believing the election process was sullied by an outside source and that Trump is illegitimate. Even Obama himself claimed our elections were safe from hacking.</p>
