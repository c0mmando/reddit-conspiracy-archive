       Your question is basically political and not about conspiracies.  The problem isn't that you have bias.  The problem is that this is not a politics-based sub where it would matter if you have bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because Trump supporters aren't finding freedom of expression anywhere else, you are running rough-shod over this subreddit, trying to turn it into your political forum.  Please go somewhere else.

       The long-time denizens of this sub know better than to think there is a good party and a bad party.  The newcomers tend to frame the situation as "Obama and democrats are bad, Trump is good."  Some of them are actual conspiracy theorists who mistakenly believe that Trump has been prosecuting child sex trafficking.  We know that Epstein met Roberts at Mar-a-Lago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The typical Trump supporter doesn't test well in logic tests where both outcomes are false.  They tend to think in either/or reasoning: if this thing is false, the opposite thing is true.  They have a limitation in considering the possibility that two opposite things could be simultaneously true, or simultaneously false.

       If you speak out against Trump, you're automatically labelled a sheep or shill. As if it's impossible to believe Trump
       <strong>
        <em>
         and

       Hillary are scumbags.

       Yep.  To the people with the limited either/or mentality, it seems like it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       impossible.  Brain scans (fMRI) show that they don't conceive of the duality possibility, they only conceive of the exclusivity in the either/or possibility.  So they literally don't know it's possible that Trump and Hillary are both scumbags.

       There are more of us here than you think. We just aren't as vocal and understand that we probably aren't going to change anyone's personal political affiliations or ideologies. And there's just too many on both sides to try to redpill, it would take too much energy. Every once in a while I jump in and say something, but I don't feel like arguing with political ideologues all day.

       Is anyone but me starting to feel like Trump might have been °chosen" by the shadow gov and powerful wealthy people? The amount of help he got was insane and he went against MSM and more powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to be an anti-zionist, but could they have anything to do with it? Netanyahu was quite pleased by him winning and the dems loosing.

       Also, the biggest thing Obama did before leaving office was letting the UN vote on settlements go through.

       Obama didn't start these programs he was just the latest to take advantage of the rules. If I recall bush gave money to extreme religious right wing groups Clinton did the same as Obama. I m pretty sure this tradition started with either Reagan or Nixon. When I'm doubt the trail usually leads to those bums. That's why it's not a story. It's wrong and unethical but that's how it works. I don't hear many trump fans complaining about the money trump is making off taxpayers or his pay to play schemes.... you can't have it both ways

       Not only is this story old, but it's fundamentally misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama didn't directly oversee any slush fund. What he did do was allow the DOJ and State Department to run wild without being held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the cause of that is beyond Obama. It can be accredited to the establishment democrats that played behind the scenes for 8 years.
