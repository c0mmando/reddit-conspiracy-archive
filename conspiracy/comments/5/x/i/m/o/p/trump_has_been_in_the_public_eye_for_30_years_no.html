<p>But frankly part of Trump&#39;s appeal is his past and even the scandalous parts.</p>

<p>That couldn&#39;t have anything to do with the dozen new scandals he&#39;s had since he&#39;s become President, could it?</p>

<p>His National Security Advisor had to resign within 23 days for lying about talking to the Russians, and his Attorney General had to recuse himself from Russia-Trump ties investigation because he lied about his own contact with them. </p>

<p>This video of Trump from 1988 makes me believe in him.  What he is saying here sounds like the same things he is saying now.  I know a lot of people here dislike him but he is our president and currently our only hope of real change. Unless everyone wants to quit bitching and do something productive, but that seems unlikely.  Flouride and chemtrails doing their job I reckon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump University was an unaccredited diploma mill, where Trump ripped off people trying trying to make a better life for themselves for MILLIONS. He settled in court, but still made millions more than what he was forced to pay back. And if ripping off his contractors six times by declaring bankruptcy doesn&#39;t give you pause, maybe the fact that he&#39;s been named in more than 50 lawsuits since his inauguration will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last part of your comment is the one part I really do not care about.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been named in 50 lawsuits since the inauguration? OK. That means absolutely nothing until one of them actually amounts to something. I could sue him tomorrow for absolutely any reason I wanted. It&#39;s called lawfare.</p>

<p>Trump U was a scam, and he should have probably gotten hammered much harder over that one. From what I gathered, he wasn&#39;t all that involved other than through his name and bank account. He still likely knew it wasn&#39;t worth what people were paying and that they were taking advantage of it. He should have shut it down long before.</p>

<p>Going bankrupt while building skyscrapers is nothing new. Lots of great builders have done it. Many times, through almost no fault of their own. Going bankrupt in Atlantic City is a non-issue. He wasn&#39;t the first, and he won&#39;t be the last. </p>

<p>While he has some stunning failures in his professional past, he has also had some great successes. He has changed skylines and created tens of thousands of jobs (many permanent ones, mostly temporary construction.) along the way.</p>

<p>If people wanted to hit Trump with some actual scandals, they should try cheating on spouses, mob ties (not Russian ones), and Trump U; not that he was a businessman at the top of a very difficult profession who sometimes had failures. That&#39;s just humanizing him, not attacking him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has been a celebrity my entire life. Three marriages, all sorts of scandalous stories, multiple bankruptcies, mob ties - he&#39;s written in his books about sex orgies at Studio 54 - some shady business deals.</p>

<p>The idea he is somehow &quot;controlled by the Russians&quot; or that he is LITERALLY HITLER is of course just Democratic party silliness.</p>

<p>But frankly part of Trump&#39;s appeal is his past and even the scandalous parts.</p>
