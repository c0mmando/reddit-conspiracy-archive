       Trump has been a celebrity my entire life. Three marriages, all sorts of scandalous stories, multiple bankruptcies, mob ties - he's written in his books about sex orgies at Studio 54 - some shady business deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea he is somehow "controlled by the Russians" or that he is LITERALLY HITLER is of course just Democratic party silliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But frankly part of Trump's appeal is his past and even the scandalous parts.

       That's my feeling as well. Though if something substantial ends up coming to light I'll definitely change my stance.
I'm watching and waiting to see if something sticks. But it just seems like they have been scrambling to try to craft something these last few months.
Interesting time to be alive and witness all this unfold.

       That couldn't have anything to do with the dozen new scandals he's had since he's become President, could it?

       His National Security Advisor had to resign within 23 days for lying about talking to the Russians, and his Attorney General had to recuse himself from Russia-Trump ties investigation because he lied about his own contact with them.

       Trump claims they were all fabricated but that's just his alternative reality... the media did make up a few exaggerations but for the most part they have been extremely easy on him and given him a pass he gets them ratings.

       Modern American history would perhaps be a better caveat.

       If you've been around for more than a few elections, this one was definitely different than anything we've ever seen, considering the amount of leaks and scandals coming out against both sides.

       Obama is being accused of stealing 3 billion dollars from taxpayers and the media won't touch it. There is clearly bias. If Trump had been accused of the same thing, it'd be the biggest they've ever ran on him.

       This video of Trump from 1988 makes me believe in him.  What he is saying here sounds like the same things he is saying now.  I know a lot of people here dislike him but he is our president and currently our only hope of real change. Unless everyone wants to quit bitching and do something productive, but that seems unlikely.  Flouride and chemtrails doing their job I reckon.

       Trump University was an unaccredited diploma mill, where Trump ripped off people trying trying to make a better life for themselves for MILLIONS. He settled in court, but still made millions more than what he was forced to pay back. And if ripping off his contractors six times by declaring bankruptcy doesn't give you pause, maybe the fact that he's been named in more than 50 lawsuits since his inauguration will.

       The last part of your comment is the one part I really do not care about.
      </p>

       He's been named in 50 lawsuits since the inauguration? OK. That means absolutely nothing until one of them actually amounts to something. I could sue him tomorrow for absolutely any reason I wanted. It's called lawfare.

       Trump U was a scam, and he should have probably gotten hammered much harder over that one. From what I gathered, he wasn't all that involved other than through his name and bank account. He still likely knew it wasn't worth what people were paying and that they were taking advantage of it. He should have shut it down long before.
      </p>

       Going bankrupt while building skyscrapers is nothing new. Lots of great builders have done it. Many times, through almost no fault of their own. Going bankrupt in Atlantic City is a non-issue. He wasn't the first, and he won't be the last.
      </p>
      <p>
       While he has some stunning failures in his professional past, he has also had some great successes. He has changed skylines and created tens of thousands of jobs (many permanent ones, mostly temporary construction.) along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people wanted to hit Trump with some actual scandals, they should try cheating on spouses, mob ties (not Russian ones), and Trump U; not that he was a businessman at the top of a very difficult profession who sometimes had failures. That's just humanizing him, not attacking him.

       there's a big difference in what is deemed a scandal for a businessman and a scandal for a politician, especially the prez of the US.

       Trump has been a celebrity my entire life. Three marriages, all sorts of scandalous stories, multiple bankruptcies, mob ties - he's written in his books about sex orgies at Studio 54 - some shady business deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea he is somehow "controlled by the Russians" or that he is LITERALLY HITLER is of course just Democratic party silliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But frankly part of Trump's appeal is his past and even the scandalous parts.

       Modern American history would perhaps be a better caveat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been around for more than a few elections, this one was definitely different than anything we've ever seen, considering the amount of leaks and scandals coming out against both sides.

       I was talking about Trump University and pussy grabbing not being on the scale of other recent political scandals. The media really wanted it to be, they just couldn't fabricate a narrative around anything else.
