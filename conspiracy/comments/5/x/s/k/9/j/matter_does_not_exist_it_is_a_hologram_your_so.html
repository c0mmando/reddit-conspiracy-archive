       Ask yourself: Why is this world so bad? For many it is a nightmare. Controversy everywhere. Scarcity. Poverty. Pain. Suffering. DEATH...Why? Because you have chosen to believe your holographic projections have existence beyond your observation. That they have density and are actually "physical". Ha Ha Ha..

       Cling to that Latte on your desk. The BMW in the parking lot. Say to yourself: this guy is crazy. he is a loser. blah. blah. blah. It changes NOTHING. These "objects" are HOLOGRAMS. Your sensation of touching and interacting with them are only "THOUGHTS". "Physical Sensation" is a ridiculous illusion and is merely "thought". Thank you to all the people downvoting this: Cling to your terrified belief system of LIMITATION. You are awesome!!!

       Limitless upvotes and interest for topics of absurd political nonsense. You are only denying your true nature. Why is this reality so horrific? Because we have chosen to identify and believe that concepts of extreme LIMITATION have a so called MATERIAL EXISTENCE. They do not. Yet you continue to relentlessly resonate with them. Go into the "Silence". There you will see this absurd nonsense as nothing but accepted belief in "LIMITATION"..

       What's the alternative, though?  Help me understand what you're asking me to update my beliefs/understanding on, and not just the word "thought", please.  If matter does not exist, and just thought does, now what...?  How do I embrace this concept in my world of observed thought matter?

       It means ANYTHING can be changed. ANYTHING.  Why would a HOLOGRAPHIC BODY have to die? Someone gets hit by a car and the "expectation" is serious injury and maybe death. This is accepting a timeline of cause and effect illusion. Individualized "Now Moments" do NOT have to be LINEAR. It means most things we have been taught and accepted as a species are wrong and many are full fledged lies. Matter does not exist. Objects are Holograms with "SENSORY ILLUSION". Feeling something as being solid, wet etc. is a "THOUGHT" and nothing more. These images and sensations also have NO INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE outside of the observer. Linear movement is incredibly persistent, but is the biggest illusion of all. Life exists in a series of "now moments", that are like individual frames of movie film. I believe we can change some of the expected frames of that "film". A man is walking down some stairs for example. It is a series of projected "now moments" that appear fluid and go in linear fashion. Most of the projection is done by the MATRIX FOR YOU. When a conscious being overrides the Matrix Projection he/she can then project their own reality. The man walking down the stairs instantly is on a beach, then a ski slope etc. etc. How could someone ever accumulate "Karma" that is judged upon them? It is an illusion. All you really experience is individual "Now Moments" that have NO RELATION to each other whatsoever. The illusion of cause and effect is incredibly strong and persistent, but in actuality is an ILLUSION.

       I love this concept.  I've had several instances ("now moments"?) where it felt like there was a shift from the expected outcome to an intented outcome, if that makes sense.  For example, I'll merge driving lanes and realize there was a car close to me that I could/should have hit, because I didn't notice it soon enough, yet I didn't hit it, or it's no longer there.  And afterwards, I'll reflect on the experience, and I imagine a hologram-like version of the event, where my car passes through the other car. This prob sounds far fetched, I know.  The only difference, though, is it seems to happen more on my behalf than me 100% intending it.

       this is what i am talking about. you changed the moment and therefore the timeline. you temporarily projected over the matrix intention. you are doing it and when it seems "on your behalf" that is your inner conscious taking control. when i practice i go slow and do this in a safe environment. a great way to do this is get a wastebasket that is roughly a foot high. roll up pieces of paper towel into small balls. thrown the balls into the basket from numerous different spots and distances. change the pathway in which you see it in multiple frames. multiple "now moments". see the intended directional change with eyes closed and then opened. do this over and over. see it happen exactly as you want it. the project the outcome.

       Goosebumps!  I've thought this very thing, several times!  I've come to understand there's a "voice" in my mind (not the "I hear voices" kind), and it's always right when it brings my attention to something, even trivial things.  Every time I act on those thoughts I achieve 100% success in my daily endevours.  It's almost like a subtle advice thought, not like a zombie control thing, just an quick, attention-grabbing thought which I can either aknowledge or ignore.  I've been trying to hear that inner voice and act on it more and more.  It's like I know deep down, it's a true voice.  Again, I'm not talking about "Jodie Foster's Dog spoke to me telepathically and told me to shoot someone" voice.  It's my inner (soul) voice, if that makes sense.  It's not conversational, just a flash thought focused on something specific, and I already know what the intention is.

       Hi. Yes. Your inner self will communicate with you, usually with thoughts or images. Most often seen in "the silence" of deep meditation. There is a creative force that flows into eternity. The Archons and Global Elite through their false teachings of ignorance and the blind acceptance of "limitation" have caused mankind to block themselves from this "force". When you see person in the wheelchair, visualize them standing up and walking. When you see the homeless person on the corner, see them smiling and prosperous. When you see the bird dying on the side of the road, see it strong and vibrant. These simplistic acts add to change the vibration of a world in despair into one of reclamation. Experiment and share your knowledge with others :)

       as you get better and more confident. go outside when it is very windy. you are now working on sensations. "feel" the wind as you make the gusts faster and then slow down. eventually you will move onto clouds. change their shape. make them expand or dissipate. mankind is incredibly lazy. hardly anyone does serious "visualization training". the matrix doing almost all of the projecting. this is the "downfall of man". the mind has atrophied. the masterful artist who once painted eternity has become a lethargic and mindless slave...

       I believe there is something more to our reality. I dont know what it is, but i do know that to an atom, the human body is a universe it is unable to comprehend. I'm sure that is the case on many levels. Do you have some of this literature from the top minds that believe this theory? I'm interested in learning more. Some of the stuff i've read from the realm of astrophysics suggests reincarnation, which is the path i've been researching lately, but your theory is interesting too.

       Correct analysis, wrong conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts are just a part of the illusion, much like sight, sounds, smells, and objects. Thinking is not what we are, it's something the universe does in multiple, simultaneous, subjective focal points of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that truly exists is quantum fields and their behaviors (which we describe as "energy" and "force" that interact to make "matter"). There's a debate on whether consciousness is derived from these interactions, or if it is a fundamental quantum field in and of itself; one that interacts in a way that causes us to experience what we call consciousness within our minds (much like we experience gravity and/or magnetism). Jury's still out on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, consciousness is not thought. Your conclusion is akin to saying "seeing is God" or "smelling is God". Thought is something that the universe is doing.

       not saying "seeing" or "smelling". i am talking about sentient self awareness. my opinion is that "energy" and "force" are projections that are subservient to awareness :)

       Well, awareness and thought are two very different things. Thought is the running narrative and/or dialogue in your head while awareness is the ability to interpret and confirm patterns of excitations within quantum fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought is an attribute of materialism, as well. Can you show me an example of thinking that occurs outside of the patterns we call matter?

       The double split experiment (which I'm assuming is what you are misinterpreting) does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       show that an "observer" must be conscious, merely that a wave collapses into a particle when it is
       <em>
        measured
       </em>
       , like with a laser beam. Consciousness is not required to collapse the wave into a particle, nor is it required to create excitations within quantum fields. It's an unfortunately common misinterpretation, popularized by such pseudo-science "documentaries" as The Secret and What The Bleep Do We Know, but be assured that whoever tells you that consciousness is required to create excitations in quantum fields (or to collapse the particle-wave duality) has an ill-informed understanding of quantum mechanics. Use it as a litmus test for who you are getting your information from.

       Correct. And the results of the experiment when
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       measurement is taken is also observed by the conscious individual, showing that
       <strong>
        no effect
       </strong>
       has taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see a difference in the two results. A) measuring which slit the wave-particle travels through, and B) not measuring which slit the wave-particle travels through. In A, we see two straight lines, in B we see an interference pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       We consciously observe the end result regardless, but it is the act of measuring (not consciousness) that collapses the wave into a particle. If it was conscious observation of the end result that collapsed the wave, then we'd never be able to observe the interference pattern that is created when we
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       measure which slit it goes through.

       We have no hard scientific evidence to show that, so I'm surprised you state it so conclusively. I'm not saying I'm right and you're wrong, I'm simply admitting that we don't actually know beyond question what consciousness is, how it functions, nor where it manifests from.

       It requires up quarks, down quarks, gluons, muons, and bosons, as well. If you have definitive prove that consciousness creates all of these quantum fields, I'm sure that quantum physicists would love to see it. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, we don't know where consciousness emanates from. I'm a non-materialist, so I'm not railing against your theory, but I'm most confident in admitting it's still pretty much a complete mystery. Claiming anything about consciousness definitively is a bit premature, at best, and possibly just naive, at worst.

       The fact that it seems like I'm simplifying, is because it is something that is indeed simple. It is in fact, that which cannot be further simplified. Up quarks, upvotes, muons, mucous, bosons and bosoms, all appear within the field of consciousness. Quantum physicists are operating within a playing field that is looking outward at the things within consciousness. It's tricky to see because the eye cannot see itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where consciousness comes from is a question based upon a flawed premise. It assumes that it must come from somewhere. That it must have some origin story. It is the origin. Alpha and omega.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call me naive, but you do so as consciousness. Consciousness is the only thing that is unfalsifiable. Descartes' Evil Daemon logic exercise is a great way to explore existence.

       Again, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with anything you're saying, and I didn't mean to call you naive, specifically. However, claims such as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Up quarks, upvotes, muons, mucous, bosons and bosoms, all appear within the field of consciousness.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Show me the definitive evidence which proves that. I don't know it to exist, and from everything I've seen, there is still a rigorous debate on the topic. I don't understand how you can comfortably claim one theory to have absolute authority on the subject when we aren't even close to a consensus on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is something you believe in the absence of evidence, then that's called faith, and you're allowed to have faith in whatever you want... however, if that is the case, then further debate on the topic seems futile. I'm not interested in trying to change your faith, I'm just here to discuss what we know and what we don't know.

       No, it assumes that we don't actually know... which, again... we don't actually know.

       Nothing that you have claimed or even mentioned is absolutely, objectively, unfalsifiably true. There is only one thing that is absolutely true, and that is the fact of consciousness. It is the foundation, substrate, the system within which any and all claims can be made. I am not making any claims or offering any proofs, so much as just saying go look for yourself. It is self-evident. It is the only thing that is truly self-evident. It is the evidence of self. The self-evident self.

       Is the universe a hologram?  A dream?  Maybe, but so what?  What is aware of the dream?  Aware of the hologram?  The Matrix is such a beautiful metaphor, one of the most important philosophical works ever produced, but the point is not that Neo woke up from the false/simulated reality of The Matrix into the real world, it is that all he did is move up one level. He isn't done, he hasn't finished the game, all he learned is that there is a game. Further. Keep going inward until there are no more questions. Going outward and you're just describing the movie, analyzing a dream. Isn't it more important to realize that you're sitting in a theater?  To then contemplate that there must be a source to the flickering lights?  There might even be a world outside the theater...

       See, this I agree with. However, we're sitting in a theater that we don't even know if it has doors, much less whether the doors open inwards or outwards. You're claiming that the world outside is the only thing that fundamentally exists, and that somehow the world outside is indicative of how the doors swing in the first place. I don't buy into that.

       The experience of consciousness is not debatable. Are you not aware?  It is the only thing that isn't debatable. Check out Descartes' Evil Daemon and see what you think. It exposes objective reality as falsifiable. The only unfalsifiable thing is the self trying to falsify things. It's a reductive process. Test everything to see if it is absolutely true, burn all that's false, and Truth is all that remains.

       Not that I'm an expert on the subject but "thought" or "consciousness" is a mystery to the brightest minds. "Consciousness isn’t something scientists like to talk about much. You can’t see it, you can’t touch it, and despite the best efforts of certain researchers, you can’t quantify it. And in science, if you can’t measure something, you’re going to have a tough time explaining it."

       I don't believe for one moment this stuff about simulations. It just seems like another way to convince the people that what they see is not real, without consequence. What REALLY matters is when you escape it, (heaven, nirvana, exit the matrix etc) according to them, as anything less is traitorous to our pure forms , our souls or our minds or whatever you want to call it.

       But truly , your body is not as inconsequential as people would make you believe. Just remember that you are a product millions of years in the making. From the start of life on this planet has come YOU, your consciousness passed down from person to person, before ape to ape, before smaller ape to smaller ape, way before that microbe to microbe... But your essence HAS NOT changed. Only through trial and error developed a body sufficient enough to actually reflect on what you see..
      </p>
      <p>
       What you see is important, for it is the only thing we have. We must continue passing down our consciousness, through our children, or even the things we create. Pieces of music you make harbour your creative energies derived from complex universal events that transpired within your own experience, and that also can be shared amongst the living. Our planet and the other celestial bodies went through other complex evolutions to get to where they are now. Do they think their in a simulation? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never believe that what you feel and experience is not real, for something that took so much time and dedication to perfect (your body and your consciousness), is never meaningless.

       first of all even the so called matter "out there" is never actually seen. at best you are getting a copy produced by your brain.

       Ask yourself: Why is this world so bad? For many it is a nightmare. Controversy everywhere. Scarcity. Poverty. Pain. Suffering. DEATH...Why? Because you have chosen to believe your holographic projections have existence beyond your observation. That they have density and are actually "physical". Ha Ha Ha..

       At this point this "shared reality" is a computer simulation. So in a way you are correct.

       look at the two responses to your other question. if everyone consistently practiced visualizing and projecting the holographic sphere around them the matrix would fall away.

       Are you arguing that mathematics are dependent on consciousness? Or simply that it requires consciousness to understand the mathematics?

       The fact that it seems like I'm simplifying, is because it is something that is indeed simple. It is in fact, that which cannot be further simplified. Up quarks, upvotes, muons, mucous, bosons and bosoms, all appear within the field of consciousness. Quantum physicists are operating within a playing field that is looking outward at the things within consciousness. It's tricky to see because the eye cannot see itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where consciousness comes from is a question based upon a flawed premise. It assumes that it must come from somewhere. That it must have some origin story. It is the origin. Alpha and omega.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call me naive, but you do so as consciousness. Consciousness is the only thing that is unfalsifiable. Descartes' Evil Daemon logic exercise is a great way to explore existence.
