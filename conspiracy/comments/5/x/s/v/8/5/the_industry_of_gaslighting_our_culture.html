       Gaslighting - manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity
      </p>
      <p>
       People typically experience gaslighting at an individual level, one spouse may gaslight another in order to gain control over the relationship, for example. Here are the signs of one individual gaslighting another:
      </p>
      <p>
       They deny they ever said something, even though you have proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use what is near and dear to you as ammunition.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wear you down slowly over time, intensifying the gaslighting as they go
      </p>
      <p>
       Their actions do not match their words.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know confusion weakens people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They accuse others of the problems they have, called projection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaslighting is a powerful technique, which is why it's so unfortunately common in a world where people are desperate to control each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using gaslighting on an entire population to better control it is not a new technique. Yellow Journalism was doing it a hundred years ago. Kings did it, with their proclamations. "Your negative feelings about life aren't real, you just don't understand. But don't worry, I'm doing what's best for all of us so you'll just have to trust me." or something of the likes is a refrain heard over and over from authorities throughout history. Self-preservation often trumps compassion when people feel as though they might lose their position of power. As unfortunate as that is, it seems to be the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here we find ourselves at a point in history where again the ruling power structure is on the defensive and finds itself challenged. And again we see it resort to gaslighting an entire populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the internet changes the game. Social media and online chat and message boards gave people ways to communicate like never before, making geographical distance irrelevant. A golden era was available, that i quickly disappearing, as companies and governments realize the propaganda potential of this network.
      </p>
      <p>
       People thought communication on the internet was genuine and organic, and it was. Now it has become corrupted just like yellow journalism, but many don't realize. Many still think this is organic culture, and I even get fooled myself. It is not organic, it is manufactured culture. Creating false consensus. Making us all look like we are one way, when we're actually another. Hoisting a banner over our heads that few of us actually agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am very glad to see people investigate these things and bring them to light, like Correct The Record (CTR) and now Share Blue which has replaced it. And perhaps some in this sub may investigate the opposite side of the aisle in this regard as well. That is equally important, because it is the system as a whole that is corrupted at all levels, not just one half of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not only is this happening politically but it's happening in the corporate world, with advertisements. And even with different governments around the world, each trying to convince you they're the true good guys here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we real humans are stuck in this echochamber of manufactured bullshit, many people believing it to be real. If "The Matrix" ever were a real thing, this is it. Many do not want to be unplugged because they're so emotionally invested in "their side", aka Tribalism has hijacked their thought processes through an emotional override, wedding them to their ideological stances. Even if those stances don't make sense, they do it to fit in and be on "Team good guys" whoever they think that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       All our major forums for public communication across the internet are being exploited and destroyed by paid and automated messaging that dilutes our real culture and attempts to replace it with a fake one that is crafted by those already in power, gaslighting us all in the process.

       I haven't watched the TV in a little over 9 months.  Reddit is my most consistent exposure to this gaslighting.  I have two opinions that I think are minority opinions but here they are.  One, I believe the astroturfing and brigading to be much more prevalent than even those aware of it's existence realize.  I'm talking upwards up 50% of Reddit accounts are phony in some way.  Two, I believe people see through it.  I believe the scales have swung our way massively but we have no figured out how to cut through the noise and communicate with each other.  My biggest worry is that the population will fight for a political side regardless.  I truly truly hope people are starting to figure out that we do not need our government or politicians.  That we can fight together, against all of them, to take back our free will.  The last step is rejecting our government together and acknowledge political affiliations as the prisons that they are

       I too believe that that the scales swung our way, but it is more of a feeling that things have gotten bad enough that people are waking up and not taking it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it has nothing to do with astroturfing, but more with economic policies that are not working for regular people, the conversation that OWS started and Bernie Sanders continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astroturfing is an attempt to stem the tide, but it looks like it may only alter the course, not the destination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the desperation of those astroturfing attempts only speeds things up. One of the best outcomes of this election season is how obvious the shilling was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is something that I came to realize only recently, you don't need to obsess over being able to detect the shills with 100% certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you are questioning the motives, who benefits from the policies or narrative being promoted, look for good independent journalists to help you understand current political events as opposed to taking random internet comments at their face value, you are a lot better off.

       When the soviet union was reaching collapse the state owned media outlets kept pumping out confused and contradictory narratives that everything was fine and under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the average citizen knew that the system was falling apart because they could see it with their own eyes, and knew the state owned media outlets were lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing is now happening to the US empire, except many people do not see what is happening because of the vast propaganda apparatus the US empire has amassed - MSN news media, social media, astroturfing etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US empire has been involved in overt and covert wars continuously for 15 years spending trillions yet gaining nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the political, financial and intelligence oligarchy are now split between those that want to bring the US empire to a close and return to a nation state and those that believe they still control the leavers of global domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so the MSN news media and highly astroturfed social media keep pumping out a confused and contradictory narrative (gas-lighting) that economy is fine - the stock market is in massive bubble and debt levels are unsustainable - and that Trump is a Russian puppet - physiological project resulting from a failed attempt to install an actual puppet presidential candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this at a time when the country is so divided that people are fighting at protests and rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US empire is finished.

       The corporate interests &amp; their political friends have milked the economy dry for their short-term profits and we've gone full-force into Late Capitalism. The question now is where does it go from here?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've asked myself repeatedly what the trigger will be that sets it off since the next financial crisis will be worse, and could be the final nail in the coffin for a sustainable US middle class. I disagree with you about Trump since I think he's got too much baggage and fits the right-wing propaganda battle currently going on but good post.

       Enter the Obama birth certificate issue. They made the birth certificate a terrible, easily spotted, low-effort forgery on purpose. They want anyone who actually looks at it themselves to know obviously it's a phony, just to make them appear angry about a "racist" issue while the other half of the population displays to those who looked at it themselves that they are a mindless herd who are not capable of independently investigating anything or taking an article based on the points and evidence in it, rather than if the title is "Washington Post" or "New York Times".
      </p>
      <p>
       Very smart game to divide the population on purpose. Gaslight 'em by making them question reality itself.

       There is a massive irony in all the search results for "gaslighting" that accuse Trump of doing it, considering one of the most identifiable methods of gaslighting is projection (accusing your opponent of doing what you're actually doing)

       While the crux of the post makes sense, I really wish people would stop throwing needless jargon around. This "gaslighting" thing originated elsewhere, was referenced in a recent post on
       <a href="/r/lifeprotips">
        /r/lifeprotips
       </a>
       , then
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       , now here. I suppose add to the list of shilling, psyop, false flag,____gate, cointelpro, etc.

       Though seemingly convenient, these types of terms really detract from the core argument.

       I'm glad that you're giving this more publicity, but could you at least credit me since I wrote this whole thing and it took me kind of a while?

       off. It's actually a pretty shitty thing to do in my book, especially given the fact that it takes a whole 2 seconds to acknowledge that the post was authored by someone else. He's forever tagged as a plagiarist in my book. Hard to take someone like that very seriously.

       Agreed, but at the same time he's promoting my exact message, so it's hard to be mad in a way since that is my actual goal. But yeah, if he had taken the 2 seconds it would've been nice, oh well
