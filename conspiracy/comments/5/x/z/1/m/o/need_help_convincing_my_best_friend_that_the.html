    <div class="md"><p>Gravity is a metaphysical construct. Even the masonic gatekeepers at CERN will tell you they don&#39;t know what gravity is, but their models theorize, derived mathematically based on other theories, that a &#39;gravitron&#39; could be responsible. But it&#39;s all a lie. You don&#39;t need the concept of gravity to explain why heavy things stick to the ground and lighter things can fly up. It&#39;s density and electromagnetism, that&#39;s all. No magic invisible force that keeps us on a sphere</p>

<p>Newton wasn&#39;t some genius scientist. He spent most of his life in the occult doing alchemy (witchcraft). That is precisely what his so-called principles of mathematics was, too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flattard calling me an idiot.  That&#39;s rich.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an oblate spheroid because if you removed all the water from the planet that&#39;s what it would fucking look like.  It&#39;s hard to get a full picture of the Earth from satellite photos because they are incredibly close to the planet.  You call the photos fake yet you have no source or proof to back up that claim other than &quot;BUT NASA&quot;.  Let me clue you in - there&#39;s dozens of worldwide space programs that have nothing to do with NASA at all and they also agree that the Earth is a globe.  You create a false equivalence by saying that global Earth is a theory and not the <em>accepted scientific viewpoint by the overwhelming vast majority of people</em> on the planet, and try to turn it on me like I&#39;m the crazy one here, you fucking dunce.  The shadow of the Earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse is only one small piece proof that completely invalidates Flat Earth Theory because you have nothing to counter it and you know it, so you&#39;re just going to try to move the goalposts instead.  I could also say that literally anybody with a good pair of binoculars can prove the curvature of the Earth by watching ships disappear over the horizon, or that FET doesn&#39;t take into account simple things like plate tectonics or volcanism that we know exist, or the fact that flat-earthers don&#39;t even believe in fucking gravity.  This is a fruitless argument because you&#39;ve made it quite clear that no amount of absolutely stone-cold evidence will ever sway you, and refuse to understand that the burden of proof is on you, not me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, so the vast majority of people believe global warming is human-caused, so that&#39;s also a fact, right? The vast majority of theoretical physicists interpret QM such that there are multiverses, so that&#39;s also a fact, right? Listen, I&#39;m not going to waste much time with you because you think gravity exists as something more than an explanation to describe what we observe. This means you&#39;re not trained in a field of science and this, coupled with your attitude, makes me think you&#39;re a bit of a retard. Anyway, more to the point:</p>

<p>NASA admits doctoring every globe picture and you can prove this yourself by examining them in various ways. Look it up before writing a headache-inducing paragraph of nonsense, you retard. They&#39;re all fake. This means that we do not have a real picture of the globe. Ask yourself why that is, and continue to investigate, if you have the capacity to see past your (obviously limited) education.</p>

<p>First you mentioned the curved shadow on the moon, yet a progressively curved shadow can be seen on the moon while the sun is fully visible, completely dismantling the theory that it is the earth causing the shadow by blocking the sun. Second, what makes you think the sun and moon paths on a flat model cannot move up and down during their orbits above a plane, thereby causing an eclipse periodically? The math can be worked out to match the observations, what&#39;s important is to collect observations and develop a more and more infallible model. There is no proof of a round earth.</p>

<p>You claim you can see ships going over the curve with binoculars? Dude, you know you can zoom in with a camera and the ship will reappear, right? There is literally no proof of curvature. The fact that you mentioned this proves to me you have done zero investigation and yet have the audacity to ridicule and parrot off shit you know nothing about?</p>

<p>So yes, you&#39;re currently an idiot like most people, but perhaps you can take what I said to you today and take advantage of it by learning to investigate for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I google imaged for that source, I tried to find a hallway and the sea-level horizon side by side as that is a very simple way to understand how our visual perception operates in this context. But you&#39;re going to want to abandon your instinctual desire to dismiss sources outright that do not align with your current beliefs. The road to flat earth will teach you this; the 0.0000001% of the world do not own mostly everything because they allow you to think freely, nor are many of them outspoken about reducing the global population if they thought the masses were not controlled as such.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking the right questions, but you may not be ready to jump so far without putting first great doubt into whether we are on a spinning ball hurling through space (as a forewarning). But a simple answer to start with is this: just because you may see &#39;planets&#39; above (in digital telescopes, or, more typically, via illustrations), does not necessitate that we too are on a sphere, much like we do not assume a billiard table is flat because the balls on it are.</p>

<p>But digging deeper, you realize that the planets only appear as such, as opposed to the bright stars that they appear to the naked eye, because of digital telescopes (e.g. manufacturer&#39;s like Orion, a Freemason enterprise just like NASA) and from NASA&#39;s fancy CGI (other space agencies are equivalent, but they&#39;re much worse at faking it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just read both of those and I am not sure what you are trying to say they prove. These aren&#39;t even about relativity.</p>

<p>They go on to describe how the solar system moves using the motion of Jupiter&#39;s moon in relation to Jupiter itself by measuring the speed of light over distance and the time it takes for the light to reach certain points at certain wavelengths. You just said the planets and stars aren&#39;t real, this only evidence against your own claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised you actually look into it. The significance of what you&#39;re describing is a failure to detect the earth moving through &#39;aether&#39;, a medium that we are travelling through (to fit the non-stationary models). In order to maintain the notion that we are moving, instead of accepting that this experiment showed we are stationary, Einstein came along insisted the explanation was that light moves at the same speed whether it is from a moving source in the direction of movement or away from it and borrowed the Lorentz transformation idea that the measured distance in the direction of movement is actually shrinking (this developed into the conceptually idea of &#39;space-time&#39;).</p>

<p>Quite the fancy workaround instead of just admitting we are stationary. You have to look into the anti-God positions these men had to really understand why they would go through such mental gymnastics to achieve the heliocentric model; they despised and feared the oppressive church (rightfully so), and therefore opposed the idea of God</p>

<p>As to your second question, because I can tell you&#39;re curious:</p>

<p>They&#39;re heavenly bodies of light, just as our ancestors have always regarded them as. What else do you think they are? Balls of fiery hydrogen and helium? All we have to go off of is their brightness and this by no means is a sound method of deriving their distance nor their substance.

    <div class="md"><p>Very complex question. The simple bit is that they&#39;re light sources above us, most likely unreachable due to the firmament. Sound ridiculous? Once you realize NASA has not went to space, you can begin to seriously ask this question as a real possibility. Then you can look into US government operation Fishbowl under operation Dominic (and note the symbolism behind these names are very real, not arbitrary as you may think they are before learning how obsessed these occult groups are), look at &#39;sundogs&#39;, the halo around the sun (happens to the moon too) at note how an observational experiment can be conducted with literally an upside down fishbowl and a light source (representing the sun, or moon) can emulate this same phenomenon, and also you can look at other phenomenon that supports this such as the existence of rainbows. </p>

<p>The complexity comes from the fact that these stars are literally revolving around us in perfect clock-work fashion and have been for our ancestors, all of whom seemed to regard them with the highest esteem, as evidenced by the pyramids, elaborate astronomical architecture, and of course entire belief systems. What significance do the stars serve? </p>

<p>We think they serve us nothing in a heliocentric model because why would they if we are just on a branch of one of billions of other galaxies in the visible universe? There&#39;s no relevance to their positioning to the meaning of our lives here on earth. But in the geocentric model on the other hand, it&#39;s to the contrary. </p>

<p>This is going to sound religious, faithful, and perhaps irrational until you follow the logic, step by step. You&#39;ll see that we live in a geocentric universe - we can move the objects in the &#39;solar&#39; system model freely so long as they perfectly match observation - and this was believed to be the case until some very devious and even malicious activity took place among astronomers, beginning with Galileo (the earth was assumed to be spherical, contrasted with the typical story we are fed that people used to believe it was flat...they didn&#39;t...the common sense view is that we are on a ball as well because they saw boats disappearing haul first on the horizon as you mentioned earlier)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure there are billions of billions of them?</p>

<p>As to their order, what we know is they certainly do this each day: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0</a></p>

<p>Moreover, there may or may not be something to the perceived constellations, perhaps they serve as stories, embedded in our reality for us to understand certain truths about why we are here, perhaps they are literally spirits, but know that the occult is literally into witchcraft and they do in fact use astrology. I don&#39;t know anything about astrology though; perhaps they only use the wandering stars. I used to wave this off as pseudoscience not too long ago, so it&#39;s new for me.</p>

<p>As to why they don&#39;t dissipate over time...all we can do is observe it, measure it with methods we deem honest and legitimate, and see what they do over time. Getting &#39;red pilled&#39; to the flat earth awakens the soul and one looks upon the world with fresh eyes, questioning everything from the natural science level to the spiritual level and the connection thereof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure we understand how it behaves? Because Einstein&#39;s theories express EM irradiation of the stars as coming to us in a vacuum, bent and affected by space-time and their positioning is strictly calculated in accordance to how far we think the sun is from earth, which is itself strictly calculated in accordance to assumptions starting with Eratosthenes, who placed it at 5 million miles (based on the shadows he perceived, but you could get the same effect, do the same trigonometry and get the same observed result) and then by Huygens, who used numerology and mysticism, &#39;guessed&#39; earth was the same size as Jupiter (he used Jupiter because it appeared to have affects just like our moon), which - surprise, surprise - NASA validates as correct today.</p>

<p>So you see, we don&#39;t understand &quot;how radiation behaves&quot;. When it comes to cosmology, we are dealing with the Freemasons who have built-in unquestionable underlying assumptions from which all other calculations must spawn from. And now they are using technology and elaborate lies about technology (e.g. the ISS, Hubble telescope, probes) to further protect this system; they believe it&#39;s far too important of a worldview to keep us in. </p>

<p>You think it&#39;s crazy how 6 corps own essentially all media in the US? Think about that in terms of technology manufacturing monopolies owned by the very same people. In the near future, our planes (an in-our-face joke of a term given that we are on a flat plane) could have windows electronically designed to add curvature to the earth (<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5829395/how-boeings-magical-787-dreamliner-windows-work">http://gizmodo.com/5829395/how-boeings-magical-787-dreamliner-windows-work</a>).</p>

My parents always told me to read the bible and to never question that either, good thing I like to question or I&#39;d be in church every sunday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you wont debate someone on the topic, you are being closed minded. I&#39;m not someone to debate about FE because I dont consider myself someone that believes it, but I do debate and let people show their evidence instead of stating that you are shutting the topic down. I have seen plenty of FE threads and watched as the ones that say anything pro-FE are ridiculed, yet you look in the other direction on the round earth and its just a huge circle jerk. I really dont care either way just think its funny when people like yourself show no evidence for your side yet you want everyone to take it. I was raised extremely religious and would always question GOD and the bible when I was a kid and I can see the same tactics that they would tell me with the people saying it is 100% Round. Dont ask questions, I&#39;m sure Newton, Einstein, and Tesla never did, right?</p>

We are in a new era where information that has been thought to be the truth for years has either forged or fabricated intensely, so why is it that you are so adamant to ask questions or debate someone on a topic?

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose that it is the equinox.  On the flat earth model, that means the sun is directly over the circle of the equator.  Now, let’s calculate the sun’s altitude.  At 45 degrees latitude, at exactly noon, we measure the angle to the sun.  If you have an accurate measurement, it will be 45 degrees.  If we draw a line from where we are standing, to the equator, then to the sun and back to us, we’ll have made a nice right triangle.  Since one angle is 45 degrees, we know the other is as well.  That means that the distance to the equator from where we are standing MUST be the same as the distance to the sun from the equator.  Incidentally, that’s a little over 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Now, let’s pretend, at the same time, we have another person in Antarctica, making the same measurement.  But they’re going to wait until their local midnight.  This means the sun will be on the opposite side of the equator, its maximum distance.  It’s about 6213 miles from the north pole to the equator, so we can triple that distance to get Antarctica to the opposite side of the equator, 18639 miles.  But, we now have another right triangle!  Let’s just plug in what we know in <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">this</a>   handy calculator and find out the angle to the sun.  Side b will be the 18639 (the observer to the far side of the equator), and side a will be 3000 (the height of the sun).  Angle A will represent the angle to the sun.  This is the LOWEST the sun will ever get for that point, since we waited until local midnight.</p>

<p>I got 9.14 degrees.  To give some context, the width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10 degrees.  That means the sun should be no less than a fist’s width above the horizon at all times for the equinox.  For most every other city in the world, it should be MUCH higher.  High school trigonometry proves the earth can’t be flat; the law of perspective says so!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I google imaged for that source, I tried to find a hallway and the sea-level horizon side by side as that is a very simple way to understand how our visual perception operates in this context. But you&#39;re going to want to abandon your instinctual desire to dismiss sources outright that do not align with your current beliefs. The road to flat earth will teach you this; the 0.0000001% of the world do not own mostly everything because they allow you to think freely, nor are many of them outspoken about reducing the global population if they thought the masses were not controlled as such.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking the right questions, but you may not be ready to jump so far without putting first great doubt into whether we are on a spinning ball hurling through space (as a forewarning). But a simple answer to start with is this: just because you may see &#39;planets&#39; above (in digital telescopes, or, more typically, via illustrations), does not necessitate that we too are on a sphere, much like we do not assume a billiard table is flat because the balls on it are.</p>

<p>But digging deeper, you realize that the planets only appear as such, as opposed to the bright stars that they appear to the naked eye, because of digital telescopes (e.g. manufacturer&#39;s like Orion, a Freemason enterprise just like NASA) and from NASA&#39;s fancy CGI (other space agencies are equivalent, but they&#39;re much worse at faking it).</p>
