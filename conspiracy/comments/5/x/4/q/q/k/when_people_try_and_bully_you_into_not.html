       Yes, there were most definitely people who went too far by going to people's facebook's and harassing them, etc., and there are lessons to be learned from the whole debacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, at the same time, those pictures were given to the public by the government. In my opinion, they were red herrings, and so when people quickly found the source, and found that it made no sense for the person to be a suspect, things started smelling really fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They tried to replicate this recently with the "pizzagate shooter". Remember that person was an actor, with an IMDB page, and that the single bullet conveniently hit a specific hard drive in the back office.

       Be responsible, but don't be discouraged. Seek the truth, always.

       There was DEFINITELY something going on with the Boston bombing. The backpacks on the video tape doesn't match the ones in evidence. Different colors.

       I've been hearing/reading a lot about how the 2 brothers were known, and the FBI had been training/grooming them, but the brothers went haywire and attacked the marathon instead of whatever target they were supposed to. I don't remember a lot of the details though, I think I read some on here and probably heard others on a podcast.

       according to
       <a href="/u/TheRealSeanGannon">
        /u/TheRealSeanGannon
       </a>
       , the older tsaernaev brother was a "mosque crawler" working for the FBI.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an FBI asset. He was an FBI asset for a LONG time. Those times he got thrown out of the Cambridge mosque for being “too radical”? He was a “Mosque Crawler” – one of those FBI informants that pretend to be a radical so he can wrap up real Muslims in FBI stings with 20-year sentences. The people of that mosque were the good Muslims, people that just wanted to be good Americans, a better life for their children, and to not make more problems for their Muslim brothers. They tossed him out on his ass. They also probably suspected he was an informant as well.

       seems like he could have just as easily been set up as been "radicalized" (which frankly, doesn't make a ton of sense).

       Reminds me of Newburgh 4. The informant set the bomb and the patsy unconnected it. Perhaps it would have gone off despite the immediate sting/arrest. Though in this case the mosque crawler was the informant and wasn't in trouble.

       and maybe you don't know who that guy is.  the guy who wrote that article is a high profile boston PD officer who did MMA at the same gym as these chechen guys (tsaernaey, plotkinov, todashev...) who were clearly all part of the same program.

       You and I could belong to a swim team. Then, you go and suicide bomb a restaurant. Does that mean I should be complicit in your stupidity, simply for the unfortunate fact of sharing the same geographical location with you on a weekly basis?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is the Chechens were on terror watch lists, Russia warned the US, and the US did nothing (because they didn't have actionable evidence).

       I feel like you didn't read the article...  He is in a counter-terrorism cell in the boston pd, and is claiming that they use HIS MMA gym to recruit informants.  He is claiming that he knew tsarnaev as both a fighter and an informant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy from the florida nightclub shooting was also tight with NYPD counter-terrorism guys (probably FBI/ HSA fusion teams- maybe with some CIA mixed in).  He traveled to SA with them through a Columbia University program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pointing out that these guys are clearly CIs.  The question is whether they are being set up as patsies or if they are actually being radicalized.  and then the question is WHO is actually doing that.  It's very likely someone with access to the CI program- either way.

       people blab all the time.  there are any number of things that can be done for damage control.  For instance, perhaps there's a program to discredit his claims online, likely by calling him a liar and assassinating his character.  That's generally how PR companies do it.

       you used a syllogism- you presented it as a logical inference.  If people leak information they die.  because he is not dead, he must be lying about leaking information.  Now perhaps that's why todashev was killed.  Maybe he had more information and was threatening to leak it.  We don't know.

       Maybe, but we can't ascertain that the blabber is telling the truth just because someone else died. His words exist in a vacuum - his. So if he's alive, his words don't mean anything.

       It COULD be a lie, but the only reason I can see that making sense is if he's working in his capacity as in intelligence agent to spread disinfo- perhaps to infiltrate other networks.

      <p>
       or it COULD be true- in which case, yeah- he's probably putting his JOB at risk (probably not his life).  But he already claims his job is at risk.

      <p>
       It doesn't negate the possibility that he is telling the truth because he thinks it's the right thing to do.  His being told to leak disinformation, also doesn't mean that tsaernaev being a mosque hopper is untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often disinfo works by putting out real information, but then pairing it with false info.  So when he says that tsaernaev was radicalized in russia- perhaps THAT'S the disinfo (if you are right and he is acting as an agent).  Perhaps he was actually set up in a false flag, while still acting as a CI.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think there is a lot of evidence that points to Tsaernaev being a CI for the FBI.   In fact, I would be very surprised if he wasn't.  But that doesn't negate the possibility that he was working for other agencies as well.

       I'm well aware. I just think it's sad that we live in a time where we can't trust anyone or anything unless we actually know the person in real life or saw the event happen. Name any source of information and someone, somewhere will denounce it as paid opposition or worse, fake news. So I guess when I ask someone to "prove it" I'm not expecting much of a factual response because we're all muddying the waters. Sigh.

       What surprises me is that there was a fire at the JFK library at the same time. All of JFKs information was set to be declassified in 2015. How do you get one of America's most Patriotic cities to *not" pay attention to the fire at the presidential library of the cities favorite son?

       they were originally supposed to be released like 5 months after the date of the bombing, 50 years after JFK died. In late 2012 The National Archives pushed it to 2015 and again later to this year.

       Yeah, that stuck in my craw as well. As well as all of those houses they just entered weather you wanted them to or not. Kinda reminds me of those roving bands of police that disarmed folks right after Katrina.

       are you referring to what reddit did to that poor guy who killed himself or the fact that the boston "bombing" was a hoax?

       the only tragedy that happened in regard to boston was his death, the rest was a farce, which makes his death all the more tragic.

       Again, what does Islamophobia have to do with it? That's a really broad piece of "evidence". Gun powder... ok nothing happened. Again, meaningless evidence. Legless man, ok so now it's just some dude that looks like him? You aren't sticking to your own evidence? The backpack issue is based on a few grainy photos.

       Look, I'm not saying there wasn't something fishy going on. But if someone challenges you and you throw a hissy fit, that doesn't exactly help your case.

       I was on Twitter all day saying how the bomber was innocent, you wouldn't believe the amount of death threats and hate I got. But I don't think he was innocent now, I think he was hypnotized to carry it out like Sirhan Sirhan was when he shot Robert Kennedy

       Yeah, what turned the corner for me on the Boston bombers was seeing a naked man in handcuffs being led into a cop car and then he happened to be run over and killed a couple hours later.
       <br/>
       Also , the younger brother in a fucking boat in someone's back yard that was lit up for 10 minutes....
He just seemed to vanish from the earth after he was brought into custody....
Oh and he couldn't talk either.
Sure thing FBI.... Oh and then there was that little shooting in Florida with an agent and an associate of the brother's.

       Do you remember the related case where the FBI went down to Florida to interrogate the MMS friend Todashev they went to his apt and left 4 hours later and he had seven bullets in him and 3 shot from the back. This one is pretty concrete

       Boston here, was 25 floors above the finish line and witnessed the horror of the whole thing, lived the entire lockdown and the manhunt. The thing that really seemed strange to me was the naked guy filmed getting arrested the night of the shootout. They made him strip down completely naked before he was detained, but I don't remember any follow up on who the hell he was.

       I feel like you didn't read the article...  He is in a counter-terrorism cell in the boston pd, and is claiming that they use HIS MMA gym to recruit informants.  He is claiming that he knew tsarnaev as both a fighter and an informant.

       The guy from the florida nightclub shooting was also tight with NYPD counter-terrorism guys (probably FBI/ HSA fusion teams- maybe with some CIA mixed in).  He traveled to SA with them through a Columbia University program.

       Just pointing out that these guys are clearly CIs.  The question is whether they are being set up as patsies or if they are actually being radicalized.  and then the question is WHO is actually doing that.  It's very likely someone with access to the CI program- either way.

        this argument gets used all the time with such confidence. and it really strikes me as ridiculous.

       It's not ridiculous.

       If someone has top-secret information, and you blabber about it, you're gonna die. If someone has top-secret information, and you lie about it publicly, you're gonna live.
