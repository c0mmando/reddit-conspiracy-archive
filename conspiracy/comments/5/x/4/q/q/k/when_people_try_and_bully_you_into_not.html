<p>I&#39;ve been hearing/reading a lot about how the 2 brothers were known, and the FBI had been training/grooming them, but the brothers went haywire and attacked the marathon instead of whatever target they were supposed to. I don&#39;t remember a lot of the details though, I think I read some on here and probably heard others on a podcast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to <a href="/u/TheRealSeanGannon">/u/TheRealSeanGannon</a>, the older tsaernaev brother was a &quot;mosque crawler&quot; working for the FBI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an FBI asset. He was an FBI asset for a LONG time. Those times he got thrown out of the Cambridge mosque for being “too radical”? He was a “Mosque Crawler” – one of those FBI informants that pretend to be a radical so he can wrap up real Muslims in FBI stings with 20-year sentences. The people of that mosque were the good Muslims, people that just wanted to be good Americans, a better life for their children, and to not make more problems for their Muslim brothers. They tossed him out on his ass. They also probably suspected he was an informant as well.</p>

<p>I feel like you didn&#39;t read the article...  He is in a counter-terrorism cell in the boston pd, and is claiming that they use HIS MMA gym to recruit informants.  He is claiming that he knew tsarnaev as both a fighter and an informant.</p>

<p>The guy from the florida nightclub shooting was also tight with NYPD counter-terrorism guys (probably FBI/ HSA fusion teams- maybe with some CIA mixed in).  He traveled to SA with them through a Columbia University program.</p>

<p>Just pointing out that these guys are clearly CIs.  The question is whether they are being set up as patsies or if they are actually being radicalized.  and then the question is WHO is actually doing that.  It&#39;s very likely someone with access to the CI program- either way.</p>

<p>people blab all the time.  there are any number of things that can be done for damage control.  For instance, perhaps there&#39;s a program to discredit his claims online, likely by calling him a liar and assassinating his character.  That&#39;s generally how PR companies do it.</p>

<p>you used a syllogism- you presented it as a logical inference.  If people leak information they die.  because he is not dead, he must be lying about leaking information.  Now perhaps that&#39;s why todashev was killed.  Maybe he had more information and was threatening to leak it.  We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Maybe, but we can&#39;t ascertain that the blabber is telling the truth just because someone else died. His words exist in a vacuum - his. So if he&#39;s alive, his words don&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>Dude, at this point- I&#39;m not following your logic.  </p>

<p>It COULD be a lie, but the only reason I can see that making sense is if he&#39;s working in his capacity as in intelligence agent to spread disinfo- perhaps to infiltrate other networks.</p>

<p>or it COULD be true- in which case, yeah- he&#39;s probably putting his JOB at risk (probably not his life).  But he already claims his job is at risk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the kindof thing someone in his position would just make up for the hell of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t negate the possibility that he is telling the truth because he thinks it&#39;s the right thing to do.  His being told to leak disinformation, also doesn&#39;t mean that tsaernaev being a mosque hopper is untrue.  </p>

<p>Often disinfo works by putting out real information, but then pairing it with false info.  So when he says that tsaernaev was radicalized in russia- perhaps THAT&#39;S the disinfo (if you are right and he is acting as an agent).  Perhaps he was actually set up in a false flag, while still acting as a CI.</p>

<p>But I think there is a lot of evidence that points to Tsaernaev being a CI for the FBI.   In fact, I would be very surprised if he wasn&#39;t.  But that doesn&#39;t negate the possibility that he was working for other agencies as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my biggest nagging doubt about the whole ordeal is this.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/6SnmB">Mr. American Sniper</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8ggfp">Chris Kyle</a>, was president and I believe the founder of <a href="http://imgur.com/a/RAwQU">Craft International</a> after his time overseas.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/0APam">you see</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/f9p8v">Craft International</a> was all over the place <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cOuRA">before, during, and after</a> the Boston Bombings. </p>

<p>This alone isn&#39;t a cause for much concern, they are a private security firm after all. And it is not inconceivable that a private event such as the Boston Marathon would hire a private security firm.</p>

<p>What bothers me is the sequence of events.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/99W00">Chris Kyle is murdered under bizzare circumstances on February 2, 2013.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/3YjMR"> The Boston Bombings occurred on April 15, 2013.</a></p>

<p>Now, I myself that I have no proof of any connection between these two events. However, deep down I feel these Chris Kyle&#39;s death and the Boston Bombings are somehow intertwined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, what turned the corner for me on the Boston bombers was seeing a naked man in handcuffs being led into a cop car and then he happened to be run over and killed a couple hours later.<br/>
 Also , the younger brother in a fucking boat in someone&#39;s back yard that was lit up for 10 minutes....
He just seemed to vanish from the earth after he was brought into custody....
Oh and he couldn&#39;t talk either.
Sure thing FBI.... Oh and then there was that little shooting in Florida with an agent and an associate of the brother&#39;s.</p>

<p>I feel like you didn&#39;t read the article...  He is in a counter-terrorism cell in the boston pd, and is claiming that they use HIS MMA gym to recruit informants.  He is claiming that he knew tsarnaev as both a fighter and an informant.</p>

<p>The guy from the florida nightclub shooting was also tight with NYPD counter-terrorism guys (probably FBI/ HSA fusion teams- maybe with some CIA mixed in).  He traveled to SA with them through a Columbia University program.</p>

<p>Just pointing out that these guys are clearly CIs.  The question is whether they are being set up as patsies or if they are actually being radicalized.  and then the question is WHO is actually doing that.  It&#39;s very likely someone with access to the CI program- either way.</p>
