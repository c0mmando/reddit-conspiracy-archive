<p>I was just reading some articles regarding encryption and passwords, TLDR: Some states force you to hand over the password or risk jail/fines/criminal conviction, while others say it&#39;s 5th Amendment proof&#39;d.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/police-can-force-you-to-give-up-your-iphone-password-florida-court-rules/">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/police-can-force-you-to-give-up-your-iphone-password-florida-court-rules/</a></p>

<p>The Federal government is bloated and sucks. It&#39;s time to return power to the state, especially the more responsible ones that create insane revenue.</p>

<p>Note: I&#39;d post this in politics, but we all know that subreddit has gone to sh!t.</p>

<p>Edit: So much stuff about Trump/Russia... come on ya&#39;ll, most of that shit doesn&#39;t affect you. Some of it, sure, but most of it is MSM faux-outrage-distraction.</p>

<p>Of course, obviously Trump wanted military power behind them.</p>

<p>No. If he has the people behind him he will. The military is made up of American countrymen, if you expect them to slaughter their own countrymen for you, you better damn well have the support of the vast majority of people and a damn good reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with your sentiment but not your analogy(metaphor?)  i work in transportation and your giving people too much credit as far as driving is concerned, people are stupid/reckless/impatien/self-absorbed.. i actually fall kind of on the totalitarian side of things when it comes to driving, stricter laws, re-test every five years... once you hit a certain age you have to take a mandatory physical/health screen(like a D.O.T greencard) its one of the most dangerous things we do on a day to day basis and people dont take it as seriously as they should</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and btw im agnostic, i just had a feeling you&#39;d be bothered by the satan comment, i decided it was all b.s. a long time ago... the books are bunk(all the &#39;holy&#39; books) conspiracies don&#39;t need magic/moloch to be true.. .the biggest conspiracy in my eyes is our lack of representation.. every other conspiracy follows from that one, we the people have no real say , we need ranked choice voting ,we need to abolish the parties/lobbyists , maybe make participation in government an obligation.. but i dont presume to have all the answers.. i just think that&#39;s the place to start.. we have no voice, we are mute.. and trump isn&#39;t the populist people think he is, just another oligarch, playing on peoples stupidity/emotions.. i hope im wrong.. but the future doesn&#39;t look bright.. people are stupid, we are stupid. may imaginary bearded dude in the sky bless you</p>
