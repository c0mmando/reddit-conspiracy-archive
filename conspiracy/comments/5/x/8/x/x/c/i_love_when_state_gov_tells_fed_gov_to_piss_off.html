       Colorado, Washington, etc. want marijuana and hemp, so state governors flagrantly execute their constituents' desire despite Drumpf, his AG, and his administration's hint at cracking down.

       I was just reading some articles regarding encryption and passwords, TLDR: Some states force you to hand over the password or risk jail/fines/criminal conviction, while others say it's 5th Amendment proof'd.

       The Federal government is bloated and sucks. It's time to return power to the state, especially the more responsible ones that create insane revenue.

       I mean you're just describing martial law now, and if we ever are under martial law no one but God will be able to predict the consequences of that. To be clearer, sure Trump can enforce those laws but he will ruin the power his office has over people if the reason isn't suitable in the eyes of the public. .

       When the Supreme Court ruled against Andrew Jackson he said the following: "Let the Supreme Court enforce their ruling". He prevailed, and the Supreme Court could do nothing. Don't you see why Trump was sucking up to the military during his whole campaign? If he has the military behind him, he will be able to do whatever he pleases.

       No. If he has the people behind him he will. The military is made up of American countrymen, if you expect them to slaughter their own countrymen for you, you better damn well have the support of the vast majority of people and a damn good reason.

       So the AG didn't say that they will enforce federal laws even if they are different from the state. Isn't the principle of states rights allowing the states to make decisions affecting its citizens and not to be forced to do what the federal government wants them to do?

       i agree with your sentiment but not your analogy(metaphor?)  i work in transportation and your giving people too much credit as far as driving is concerned, people are stupid/reckless/impatien/self-absorbed.. i actually fall kind of on the totalitarian side of things when it comes to driving, stricter laws, re-test every five years... once you hit a certain age you have to take a mandatory physical/health screen(like a D.O.T greencard) its one of the most dangerous things we do on a day to day basis and people dont take it as seriously as they should

       That is what damn near very conversation I have boils down to... I hope you know, I'm trying to push you.. Speak your mind, and don't let people put you down. In a weird way, that is my point...

       and btw im agnostic, i just had a feeling you'd be bothered by the satan comment, i decided it was all b.s. a long time ago... the books are bunk(all the 'holy' books) conspiracies don't need magic/moloch to be true.. .the biggest conspiracy in my eyes is our lack of representation.. every other conspiracy follows from that one, we the people have no real say , we need ranked choice voting ,we need to abolish the parties/lobbyists , maybe make participation in government an obligation.. but i dont presume to have all the answers.. i just think that's the place to start.. we have no voice, we are mute.. and trump isn't the populist people think he is, just another oligarch, playing on peoples stupidity/emotions.. i hope im wrong.. but the future doesn't look bright.. people are stupid, we are stupid. may imaginary bearded dude in the sky bless you

       If you haven't learned by now, I really don't give two shits for outsiders, sorry (not really).. Come at me with something intelligent. If you don't, I will treat you, how I treat
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       people.. Just how it works, and I'm very well know and respected here... I don't speak for the sub, but I'm speaking to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       You're clearly a Statist, and I'm vehemently opposed. Take it however the fuck you want...

      <p>
       Too-da-loo, or grow some and stick around. Tis up to you...
