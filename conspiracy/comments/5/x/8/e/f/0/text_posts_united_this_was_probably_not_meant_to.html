       Totally agreed. There are some shady ass blind links posted, and we'd be much better off with text posts that have links within their body; but at the same time, conspiracy theorists are the least likely people to be chastised into action, and dude sounds like a little b#tch.

       I bet they got some out of this world cookies here to pay satan and his gross giant cock that he fucks everyone with.    It is all fake to make up for what is even more fake.  Our American concept of capitalism.  This all helped make the internet seem like a viable way to make money, which it will never be.   An Apple phone costs 15 dollars in the real world.  We will never live in this imaginary world and everyone supports this insanity and exploitation of every day people.  That is the conspiracy.   News has always been faked as long as people could make record of the fact.  Bullshit is our best friend.  Being fake is a way to live, well.  People eat that shit up.

       And keep in mind, 80% of the people you meet online are either not who they claim to be or bots. As long as you recognize this and continue to think critically, you'll always find your way to the real "news".

       Well just know I am only trying to appeal to people like you even though I suppose you are older than a teen maybe.  Well congrads on when you were born and shit and all, but I bet I am as old or older than you and if we were to take acid in a small room together I would rather make you into a meal.  Cause you are a cookie cutter kinda guy it would seem.  Good for you for being old as fuck and shit though.  How's bout maybe bored teenagers is not the reason this entertained you more than most reddit posts?

       Oh I rember you , you're  the guy that got pissed off because you thought you weren't getting the attention you think deserve , you thought all your posts were being buried and nobody would comment and your points stayed same for awhile , so instead of saying something about it on your main account you created this one so you can lash out without losing out on on those precious virtual validation points . But the truth is your posts weren't buried and they didn't get traction because you're a boring ,petty ,disgusting ,little shit stain of a person , one whom if was ever in my presence would get the ass beating of a fucking life time because people like you are worthless mouth breathing food eaters with no real function in life but to be that piece of fucking shit everyone hates in real life and in the web , fuck you you don't post here again if it's so god damn bad you fucking little faggot

       The intelligencia awakes people.  That is why they still exist.  They are mostly tireless.  And it is "Intelligentsia".

       Linguistics are a pain in the ass for people who even have shit grammar.   I'm part polish, and it has nothing to do with why I know how to spell it.  You fuckers.

       The conspiracy.  It is called misusing capitalism and impoverishing everyone.  Even marx talk about exactly what we have been busy thoroughly fucking up for 50 years.   He knew your shit better than you do.  That's why all academics reference him to this day.  He wrote the best ideas down for you to decide about, you fucking pussy.  All smart and well read people know this already.

       Marxism is an elite conspiracy to claw back the gains workers make through capitalism.  It's meant to bring feudalism back.  It uses frame-inversion techniques to confuse the issue and engineer consent from its victims.

       Just dont want to see you assholes eating your pets.  Not everyone should become Venezuela.  That is the current current of the wind though.  People having no fucking idea.
  People been doing it for so many years.   It is called slavery and they have it pretty nailed down.   The most creepy thing that ever happened to people only because we can stop doing it.

      <p>
       This site is the fucking antichrist.  I can see it now, literally.  It is fucking twisted the way they display thread messages.  How did you people who are adults put up with this kind of shit?  Did you not write you sentences in order?   Should that not be like, how it works and shit?  In order?
 It is far more easy to let a thread go and watch it, but these morons have taken that to the next level of holographic fuckery.   Are we proud to be a part of this?  It is actually kinda sick and I see why they do it.  It is really scary and transparent!

       That's how they get you to listen to music too.  They dull your minds to the point where you know nothing better about music.  They then sell you shit on your cellphone proving that you all represent the end of human kind.
