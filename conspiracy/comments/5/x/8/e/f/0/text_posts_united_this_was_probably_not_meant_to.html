<p>I bet they got some out of this world cookies here to pay satan and his gross giant cock that he fucks everyone with.    It is all fake to make up for what is even more fake.  Our American concept of capitalism.  This all helped make the internet seem like a viable way to make money, which it will never be.   An Apple phone costs 15 dollars in the real world.  We will never live in this imaginary world and everyone supports this insanity and exploitation of every day people.  That is the conspiracy.   News has always been faked as long as people could make record of the fact.  Bullshit is our best friend.  Being fake is a way to live, well.  People eat that shit up.</p>

But the truth is your posts weren&#39;t buried and they didn&#39;t get traction because you&#39;re a boring ,petty ,disgusting ,little shit stain of a person , one whom if was ever in my presence would get the ass beating of a fucking life time because people like you are worthless mouth breathing food eaters with no real function in life but to be that piece of fucking shit everyone hates in real life and in the web , fuck you you don&#39;t post here again if it&#39;s so god damn bad you fucking little faggot </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how they get you to listen to music too.  They dull your minds to the point where you know nothing better about music.  They then sell you shit on your cellphone proving that you all represent the end of human kind.</p>

<p>I Don&#39;t even like Nirvana too much but you little ass-lickers would love kurt&#39;s music and then suck his cock all day long if it was part of the 2016 selection of cock suck music.  You people are the fucking antichrist. </p>

<p>Shake that booty, and be sure to make more kids than your family could ever put a roof over!  Keep suckin that dick!</p>

<p>Miles Davis, fuck you.</p>
