       <strong>
        A quick case for virtual reality:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just this year, scientists reveal substantial evidence that we live in a holographic universe. This was reported by many news outlets, even considered breaking news by some--and rightly so. I’m sure many of you read reports on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html">
        https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While a holographic universe on its own does not necessarily imply a virtual reality, it nonetheless shows the direction of mainstream scientists thinking--finally!
      </p>
      <p>
       We’ve had evidence of our reality being virtual since the 1900’s but scientists of that era did not have computers or video games to even comprehend what a virtual reality was to begin with. This is finally changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is just the beginning…
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing we need to understand is that science is vehemently against verifying that we live in a virtual reality. There is a massive resistance by the higher ups in the science community against this hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The reason?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the majority of human history, people have believed false claims such as angels holding the stars in the sky and the earth being the center of the Universe. Religious leaders once ruled the masses. They were the high priests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious leaders fought tooth and nail against the scientific community, the likes of Galileo and Newton, whose testable ideas challenged their metaphysical assertions. If science proves we live in a virtual reality, the high priests will again be empowered, claiming Jesus, Mohammed, or Buddha as the programmer. The scientific community does not want to breathe life into the very ideas they have died to denounce.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fear not
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Times change. New generations carry less and less of the stigma of previous generations. The up and coming scientists care less about the sanctity of science and more for the truth--regardless of the costs. Science today is beginning to seriously consider the possibility that we live in a virtual reality. Elon Musk has publicly said it is an idea to consider seriously. As this idea becomes more accepted, more studies will verify it, and our paradigms will be shifted. This will be in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It will forever change the way we look at the world.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How do we know we live in a virtual reality?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many macroscopic and microscopic phenomena that cannot be explained by our current understanding of the universe. They are literally mind boggling and defy all logic. But when we view these phenomena as byproducts of a VR, each one of them can be explained. Here are a few examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Let’s begin, where it began
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Big Bang:
       </strong>
       The universe was created out of nothing from a point of infinite density and thus began space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       VR systems begin with an influx of information. Thus begins space and time. Think of it like turning on the video game GTA. You have just caused a mini big bang from the perspective of the computer player in the video game.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Quantum minima:
       </strong>
       Light is quantized--it comes in discreet packages. We believe matter to be the same. As we keep peering into atoms and smashing them we will eventually reach the planck length, a quantized point in space that makes up the fabric of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       Pixels. All objects that arise from virtual reality are made of tiny bits. If you keep zooming into your GTA game, you will eventually be unable to zoom any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Light speed:
       </strong>
       The speed of light is fixed. While Einstein figured this out, he, and nobody to this day can figure out why.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       A finite processor has a maximum processing speed. Your GTA game has a maximum information processing speed, dictated by the system and software you are using to play it. The maximum speed of light is the result of a finite processor.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Quantum entanglement:
       </strong>
       Two particles separated by light years apart can affect each other. For example, change the spin on one, and the other one instantly changes spin. Since nothing, not even information can travel faster than the speed of light, how is this possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       A computer processor running a VR can affect all “pixels” regardless of distance that separates them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Mass and speed phenomena:
       </strong>
       Space curves near a massive body. Time dilates at high speeds such a light speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       If the VR processor is overloaded at maximum speeds, its processing outputs must be reduced (time). Regarding mass, think of a black hole with a huge mass in an infinitely small space. Time will slow down near this huge mass because of the huge processing power needed to simulate the black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Quantum transitions:
       </strong>
       Quantum mechanics suggests that reality is a series of state transitions at the quantum level. Things do not move linearly smoothly but from transition state to transition state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VR explanation:
       </strong>
       Digital processes simulate event continuity as a series of state transitions, like the frames of a film. Think of your GTA game, the scene is not actually moving, but transition states are being played so rapidly it appears as a continuous movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       VR also explains the
       <strong>
        Fermi paradox
       </strong>
       . Because the universe is so massive, statistically, it should be teeming with life. Intelligent species over time that evolved long before us should be travelling around and colonizing the universe. We see none of this. From VR perspective, Earth may truly be the only planet with life. The rest of the universe is a probabilistic wave that only exists when we focus in on it with telescopes. This lowers the processing power needed to simulate our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the universe doesn't exist until we look into it, at which point it renders information for us to see. This has been proven with particles of light, atoms, molecules, and even viruses. That these objects can exist as real material and a probabilistic wave that only exists when we measure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of your GTA game, when the computer is facing forward and looking straight at a car. The scene behind him does not exist until he turns around at which point the computer processor renders a scene. Quantum physics experiments show our reality to behave the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many scientists believe there is no limit to macroscopic objects behaving in a probabilistic way since all big things are made of these probabilistic little things. The only thing limiting us from showing a baseball doesn’t exist until we measure it is the money needed to run the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living in a very interesting timeline. Probably the best timeline... and this is not a coincidence.

       It's idiotic bullshit.  THIS reality is the only reality that exists.  The elite have been trying to gaslight the people into believing their grip over us all that is quickly failing IS NOT REAL.  It most certainly is.  From the "Mandela Effect" psyop to this bullshit.  It could not be any more blatant.

       Evidence it. To state so matter of factly that this is the only reality that exists, well state facts. Making statements without facts is not what allowed the human race to make discoveries; theorising about what could be is what did.

       If I had incredibly poor memory, there's no way I could've gotten straight As in school. I never had to study because of my ability to accurately recall information that I had written down in my notes, or had read in textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the unaffected and the ones who naively believe it is some grand government conspiracy are the ones with incredibly poor memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you would make such a sweeping generalization about an entire group of people just goes to show how little you know about it and how uninformed you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the insignificant, collectively misremembered details in pop culture that have the affected convinced, but rather the details that they are most familiar with, and therefore have the most accurate recall of.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that I've learned in my experience is that the most heavily affected people actually share a common trait: good memory. How could so many people with "incredibly poor memory" be so successful in school, which necessarily requires accurate recall of all sorts of information? How could so many of those people be inducted into gifted programs if they had incredibly poor memory?

       Disclaimer: I'd love to have an intelligent discussion about this based on logic and deductive reasoning, so if you feel inclined to make accusations without justifying them then please do not bother responding.

       You stated this well. There are some Mandela Effects that I definitely feel have changed. The thing is, I began searching for truth of the nature of our reality years before the ME became a thing. Scientist have been slowly discovering this since the late 1800s, when the first double slit experiment was done with photons. It was set up in a different way and it was termed differently, but it was still the same basic concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       To pass this off as a PsyOp is to sweep decades of scientific research under the figurative rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not mean that our reality is not real. It's the same as it was yesterday. We just have a better understanding of what we reside in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovering the ME just helped me accept things as they are, so I could move on to the next step of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say this is a new thing, that is a PsyOp (I'm definitely not saying you're the one who said that. I know it was the user above you. I'm just trying to add to the conversation.), is to say that you have done little research into quantom physics.

       John Wheeler was the early prominent physicist that believed in digital physics. He believed information was being processed at the fundamental level of reality and that observers were creating the observed reality. This was just in 1990. Before him, no high ranking physicist had the balls to state this obvious conclusion.

       Basically he calls it the Awareness aware of itself Method, or something to that extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been using these methods for a quite a bit now and have had OBE's from it, have reached a palpable transparent happiness, can go hours completely thought free, and become One with everything more and more including an inner light of awareness coming to fruition as well. This stuff is legit, and I'd say is the goal for us all here, enlightenment and transcendence

       It might be more popular right now because we all can experiment the end of the argument.
But this is not conspiracy level for me as nobody around us profit from this existential crisis.
Talking crisis, what does it means for our own consciousness... Are we just generated A.I. program to " Ask Why??? ". I would love to have some fictions writing about the reason of it.

       True. Pixels are easier to comprehend. Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't vector graphics be more analogous to some sort of underlying fundamental lattice structure in the universe?

       Vectors are scalable so they would behave more like computational functions that create graphics as patterns. So rather than a pixel of a 1x1 red dot you would see a vector "area" shaded red that's like a form generated from a mathematical concept. Your analogies still hold up

       Really well made post!
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are in a virtual simulation at what point does the program end? When purpose has been fulfilled? A program has an overall goal otherwise no intention to make one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can reality reacting to being observed have a different cause? Could brain waves, or an overall collective consciousness also explain this. (which in turn would be similar to master OS).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly if movement is based on FPS then couldn't we stop frames? in certain points of space. Like lag a system? Time/Frames of movement would be manipulatable. In turn would mean a beginning, and end to micro animations. You  could flip thru time like a book, or skip frames like a video editor does. I think proving that first would be very substantial to this theory.
      </p>

       The idea that we are inside a simulation is provable by science. The purpose of the simulation however is pure speculative territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be future humans as the programmers, or it could be artificial intelligence that we previously created in another timeline that wiped us out and is now causing the simulation to see where it came from, or it could be that Earth is a school ground to build up karma and evolve. A training school if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brain waves and a collective consciousness are speculative as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes near black holes time stops at the event horizon. This is a lag. Also look into A Bose–Einstein condensate where a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state. This might be analogous to attempting to "freeze frame" a sliver of reality.

       We suffer because our reality is a reflection of our collective actions. We are obviously in a learning phase on how to behave, treat each other, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffering is not always sinister. Sometimes we learn best by suffering. Also, we shouldn't view suffering with such concreteness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our consciousness is eternal in nature, and simply filling into an avatar for the moment, what is a life time of suffering in a sea of eternal existence? Suffering becomes a fleeting moment, a barely recognizable and remembered event.

       Maybe it's an experiment to see how long it takes to go from the Big Bang to an intelligent species that completely understands the fundamental laws of the universe.  Suppose there is one particular particle that can only be understood when you have a Grand Unified Theory of Everything and the only way to prove the theory is to create that particle.  Perhaps the universe is nothing but a gigantic Useless Machine that will turn itself off when someone creates that particle for the first time and proves the theory.

       Do I understand this correctly? This theory says that we are living in a kind of computer simulation? Who made the system? What is the point? Are we part of the Simulation or are we "Players"?

       Look at it this way, humans today can simulate tiny corners of the cosmos just a few femtometers across. (A femtometer is 10
       <sup>
        -15
       </sup>
       metres.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That may not seem like much, but that's besides the point. The point is we can do it. And if we had powerful enough computers we could simulate the entire Earth or even universe. With the advent of quantum computers this will be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look into reasons why we might simulate an "Earth?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Those reasons might be strikingly similar reasons for a programmer to start our own universe...
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be deep meaning, or it could be that they simulated our universe
       <strong>
        just because they could.
       </strong>
       I hope for the former!

       And within that simulation there would be simulated programmers making simulations of the simulation, right? Perhaps we are living in a simulation within a simulation or one of many iterations?

      <p>
       You are a player, both the player and the NPC, the playes is learning from your life and each reincarnation is learning how to improve his experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Peake you will eventually have the life of your dreams, then, the player has done it's thing and moves on with another life.

       better yet, you would understand food is a hologram. the belief of needing food is an accepted "limitation". it is incredibly ingrained on the group conscious and subconscious minds, so major work would have to be done to remove it. but in true reality a holographic body with no mass would never need to "eat" illusory holographic food.

       I'm 1000% sure you're talking out of your ass.
Holographic universe is the laziest existential argument to explain our reality. It's also completely impossible to run a simulation this advances.

       How do you know what the aliens call themselves? Is their reality not a simulation as well? Simulations all the way down

       Not true, it fluctuates over the years - same with the force of gravity.

       Look it up - a council of scientists meet every x years and find the average from all the varying results around the world (from scientists measuring the speed of light/force of gravity) and the average is reported as the current speed/force.

       Awesome. Truth being exposed that each of us is the universe itself observing what it is. When it isn't looking at itself, how can it be in the way we comprehend? It can't. Time for ego death! Thank you.

       It is the prevailing model in the scientific community among others. Some scientists even believe in parallel universities branching off every time we make choices. Quantum physics actually implies this happens. Some believe in multiple big bangs happening all the time.

       No not at all. VR makes the case for a creator stronger. Although it doesn't make the case for any one specific religion to be more right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without VR, you're left with a materialistic universe, independently existing with or without us, simply going through the motions. Much less room for a creator in this deterministic universal model.
      </p>
      <p>
       VR doesn't say anything about the qualities of God, but at least it implies their existence.

       Most have been conditioned to believe there is an innate purpose to existence from birth and we as humans generally question our surroundings and try to find meaning and patterns from the chaos formed around us. It's basically human nature to want for there to be more to our reality, it's comforting for there to be a clear purpose/meaning to life.

       Yeah, that whole paragraph is questionable. I think OP is using the misrepresented argument for the double-slit experiment. People misunderstand this experiment all the time. It's not that light or atoms are consciously behaving different under observation or measurment, it's that the very devices used to measure are influencing the results due to interference with the light and atoms themselves. I like the post, but the leaps in logic and excessive use of the term "proven" give me pause.

       my understanding is that when the devices were left in place but turned 'off', that they did not influence the outcome. So it actually is the conscious observation of results that influences the outcome.

       Your explanation is The Copenhagen interpretation. One of the most prominent physicists Steven Weinberg states that the Copenhagen interpretation is now widely felt to be unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to remember that back in the 50's and on it would be career suicide for a physicist to imply that our macroscopic world behaved in quantum mechanical manner (example: didn't exist until measured). So physicists came up with the Copenhagen interpretation--which was almost a cop out so they wouldn't have to deal with the consciousnesses problem. Einstein was against this interpretation even back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays there is less and less of this stigma and more research is finally being done.

       In a nutshell, you could conduct an experiment to prove that a virus is either: an actual physical virus, or a probabilistic wave function (not a real physical thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early quantum days, this was done with electrons, then photons, and scientists believed there's no way larger objects could behave this way. They attributed this weirdness to the fact that these were tiny sub atomic particles and this observation would break down for larger objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays, this experiment is being done with bigger and bigger objects. Some believe there is no limit. An entire planet--hell--a universe, can theoretically be shown to be physical and non physical--depending on how you want to look at it.

       I like the case is stronger for us being a cell in a large animal or something, and it's not really that we haven't found life on other planets it's just that our technology is so far behind, we've only started sending surveillance robots to mars, we have no idea what's beneath the surface of other planets yet, and the scale of other planets in our solar system alone compared to mars, we're still discovering animals on Earth after 1000's of years, Jupiter alone is more than 10 times the size of Earth.

       Two things I dislike about this argument (not that I hate it overall, it just needs to be stated differently IMO).
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Saying that we're in a 'virtual' reality begs the question that there is some other primordial "reality" that produces this one via a computational process. It subordinates this reality to some other one, when there is no evidence that this is the derivative reality. It suggests that what we've learnt about our universe couldn't be 'real' – but they're taking as their notion of what's 'real' simply as what we thought was 'real' when physics was a bit younger. Why retain it?
       </li>
       <li>
        The problem with trying to decide whether this reality is 'virtual' or not (let's just say computational) is that everyone is already existing solely within a virtual/computational reality – one that there's actually no option to experience anything outside of – and that's the virtual reality created by our minds. That's what you're living in – inside your head! To quote Bob Wilson probably quoting someone else, you have three heads – the one that you can feel with your hands, the one that you are perceiving the inside of (what appears to be the perceivable universe) and the one that is actually perceiving something and turning it into the experience that you're having. That head isn't directly perceptible.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So, all these arguments for why reality might be virtual collapse because they're actually just descriptions of something we already know is virtual, algorithmic and based on vector/fractal graphics, and that's the one produced by your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impossible to know anything about anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to me, whenever this gets mentioned it just sounds like a very long winded way of saying "did you know that everything you perceive is actually inside your head??" – but most people accept this.

        It doesn't beg the question necessarily. Our universe working on a VR model could be the by product of infinite big bangs happening with different sets of rules for all these universes. We could just find ourselves in the the one with the VR model. The reason we say this arises from a computational process outside our universe is because we create models of this ourselves that we relate to (video games, simulations, 3D movies).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There will come a day when computers are so powerful you won't be able to tell real life from a VR headset. Most scientists believe this is possible with enough computational power. Now, when we do create this indistinguishable 3D VR world, you now have a verifiable model of how our universe could work since we have replicated it. There would be more evidence to support a computational universe than not.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You can reduce our world to simply being all in your head--that's a philosophical discussion that cannot be argued against by sheer virtue of being impossible to observe the world outside your reference frame. But I think if you believe that the intricate devices we design to measure our world to such accuracy are simply working by chance--and not that they're accurately measuring "something" out there accurately, is a big leap to take.

       Sure. Re your last point – I don't think physical scientific instruments are measuring 'nothing', just that they exist in this reality and (as far as I know) only measure phenomena that are also in this reality. I.e., you couldn't use a thermometer in a VR sim to measure the temperature of the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience so far, alternative realities accessible through psychedelic drugs absolutely reveal the computational, vector-graphics nature of what we experience. The objects in these worlds are even polite enough to fill in missing textures with a checkerboard patter so you can still understand the surface topology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen places as real-seeming and engaging as this reality, but are just computational spaces, like being in the movie Tron.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know, we really are living inside a big computer. But, I know I can't tell that for certain, because as I said, one is already inside a big computer and can't see out. Given that the brain appears to be this reality's best answer to undertaking computation, I suspect that if there is a greater reality, it works in the same way. I think that we've created computers and the VR worlds within them by unconsciously channeling those means, such that reality does seem very 'VR'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, I'm saying that we're questioning whether we live in a 'VR' because we've made our own VRs that look a lot like an aspect of this reality that we don't normally see, but do perceive on some level.

       It is a virtual reality but not in a machine. We are all pieces of creator consciousness inside the dream of creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since nature is fully recursive this the dream metaphor explains our existence perfectly.

       I loved GTA Vice City (back when I was a gamer).  I didn't know games were capable of such realism.  There was a pause in gaming for me prior to GTA VC.  Was a big SOCOM fan too. Hitman 2 Silent Assassin.

       Thanks for posting, its a theory, and its a perfectly valid theory still. I'm not saying a believe it but when I look at the information available on religion in this context specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I start to think what if this is all just really a test or simulation if you will, we are placed real conscious beings placed in this virtual world once we are "born/created/produced/manufactured etc..." and we are taken through a series of randomly generated procedurally generated tests each leading down very different paths.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that our true species who are responsible for this simulation invented these tests in order to seek and re-instate humanity in its purest form and those of us which choose to harm/loot/pillage/steal and kill one another in order for some sort of personal gain have failed at the test and will be terminated upon completion of the aging procedures, those of us seeking to help and support one another and try to make a positive contribution to society and the environment as a whole no matter the circumstances are set to succeed at the test and be rewarded with true life upon completion of the aging procedures, if you are unlucky enough to die before enough data has been collected on your personal level of quantifiable humanity then you are re-introduced into the virtual reality until enough data has been collected.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would make sense why so many clues have been left for us to discover of this greater power, or the idea of "heaven" and being one with the creator. It's a nice theory. :)

       Nice post. If I can jump right in with some clarifications here and there:
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all - do not fall for sensationalist titles like "WOW! Things have changed - We Live in a Holographic Univerce" as if anything is in any way different that it was before. Also - be careful not to mix up the terms "holographic universe" and "simulated universe".
      </p>
      <p>
       A "Holographic universe" means that one of the dimensions of space-time is possibly just an emergent phenomenon as a result of our brains interpreting the available information in such a way as to appear to us that there are three spacial dimensions. Just like when you look at a hologram which is essentially a flat peice of paper, but you see depth in it. That depth is only in your mind, as this is how your brain chooses to interpret the light reflected or emitted from the holorgram. For this we have some evidence and a strong theory -
       <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0203101">
        https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0203101
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       A "Simulated universe" is something Elon Musk has been talking a lot about lately and essentially the idea is the universe we see and live in is not "base reality". If we are now capable of creating VR that is nearly photo-realistic, the odds of we being the first and only beings in an endless universe to come up with that technology are inconceivably small. And then, according the Musk, the odds of us living in "base reality" (or the original universe, that has no VR) are minuscule. For this we have no strong evidence, but we do a hard to argue with chain of thought from Elon Musk:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Light is NOT quantized - it is merly matter's limitation in interacting with light that makes it seem as though there are individual clumps that hit our detectors - the photons. If you shine white light through a prism you can very clearly see that the beam spreads continuously into different colors with no gaps between them and never splits into individual beams as would be expected if it was photons flying through the prism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed of light is NOT fixed - Yes it is a constant, but that does not mean that if you now get in your imaginary car and hit the accelerator pedal, and keep accelerating until you reach 300 000 km/s, something special will hapen. In fact what Einstein says is that if at that speed you turn on your headlights, they will still blast away at the constant speed of 300 000 km/s as if nothing has changed at all. But where did all of the energy go? I burned alot of gas getting to light speed you know? Well - YOU SLOWED DOWN TIME - this is the best part of General Relativity - one lifetime IS enough to go to other end of the galaxy and back - 100 000 light years in 80 years - you just have to keep accelerating. - This sounds amazing but is proven fact.

       As for quantum non-locality when you say "change the spin on one, and the other one instantly changes spin", it would be better to say "we measure the other particle as having opposite spin". Despite the fact that no information has even theoretically had time to pass between the particles. This is a very subtle manifestation of non-locality. So subtle in fact it took me years to understand what is meant by it, and I highly recommend getting started with the bell test experiments:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In short - it is stranger that what you say even - the way I like to visualise it is as so:
Imagine we have two envelopes and we put a piece of paper in each one. One piece has a plus sign on it "+", the other one has a minus sign on it "-" and we mix 'em up good and send one off on an interstellar journey with some people on a space ship. On a pre-agreed date 10 000 years later we open the envelopes and we see the god damn "-" sign here on Earth, so ok - the other one has a plus "+" sign in it, nothing magical so far. The quantum effect comes when we decide, absolutely out of the blue and without telling anyone, to check the small bar-code on the envelope, just for fun, and we read "000". Unbeknown to us, and far away in space and time the guys on the space ship also open their envelope and see the "+", of-course, but one of the guys has the same idea to check the bar-code and WTF - it is "111" the exact opposite, even though no one was planning to test this at all 10 000 year ago, and in no way could the information have even theoretically travelled to them in that time, so something is up indeed, but this is just subtle evidence for non-locality. Not evidence for a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will grant you that a Simulated universe would be a reasonable candidate explanation for the Fermi paradox, but statements like :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is just the beginning…
Fear not
It will forever change the way we look at the world.

       I often think about the simulation hypothesis and it's implications. Is our past real? Are the unexplainable megalithic sites around the globe really the work of a once conscious, advanced civilization? Or were they merely rendered into existence by computers as part of the landscape of our reality? I can't help but find the theory a little depressing.

       Correct! The delayed choice quantum eraser experiment shows it's possible that when we decide to view an object as a particle or as a wave--it's entire history has to adjust to match our observation. Sometimes this could be millions or billions of years.

       I'm surprised that more of this is not discussed here. I think there is a very legit possibility that we are in a Matrix of some sort. Think of you playing The Sims or something. Our whole world could be just made up straight from artificial intelligence. I don't really believe in God but I definitely think there is someone out there controlling us, probably laughing at how fickle and stupid we all are. This is a good article:

       Y'all did not read the damn article. This isn't about living in a simulation, this is about how the universe as we experience it can be expressed in terms of a projection from a two dimensional field. This is extremely huge for quantum and astro physicists because it covers a gap in our understanding of physical laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       By no means does this indicate there is anything before, after, or outside our universe. This is just another example of quantum weirdness.

       I think it is the Gaia hypothesis, on a universal scale.  Humans directly influence the universe by thought and action, and the universe responds with new discoveries that in return directly influence the Earth.  It's a giant biofeedback system that is created for the sake of CREATION, as in humans get to control reality, in more ways than they realize...and synthesize their own ideas and make their own universe.  I do think the observer effect plays a large role.  And like you, I don't think this is the "dark" timeline, even with all the foreboding and shenanigans.  :)

       Super interesting post! I'm really down with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My one criticism is this part here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        VR also explains the Fermi paradox. Because the universe is so massive, statistically, it should be teeming with life. Intelligent species over time that evolved long before us should be travelling around and colonizing the universe. We see none of this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's nothing in statistics that says the universe should be teeming with life. There are a ton of obstacles to the development of life in the first place, and then even more potential hazards that could end it immediately. You're right in saying that the universe is massive and I'm sure that there are planets that sustain life out of the many billions that exist, but there is nothing statistically that says that we should have found life by now because of how limited our sample size is.

       Bruh, do you even conspiracy? There definitely is life out there beyond this planet, and extraterrestrial visitors have been here as well.

       I don't think this is true at all. I mean, all scientists are pretty much on board with quantum mechanics, which essentially says we live in a probabilistic nonmaterial universe full of quantum fluctuations and virtual particles. I think the issue with VR is that it's extremely difficult to prove, one way or another. If the simulation is seemingly eternal, how do you prove there's something beyond it? Also, such a reality would lead to a lot more questions than answers, such as how many VR simulations deep are we in? Can you have a simulation inside a simulation Inception style?

       Fascinating. This has actually been a theory of mine for about... well about 12 months now. I saw The Matrix years ago of course, I've been atheist for years, and have been interested in strange supernatural phenomena and miracles and such for years, done loads of research, made sure I'm not a narrow minded "oh there's no such thing as this and that because it's a ridiculous concept and I'm actually sane" person. That's an arrogant mentality and I really don't believe we as a race actually KNOW all that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       About this time last year I came to the decision that if I believe in anything even remotely similar to religion, it is that we are plugged in and when we die we wake up in an actual reality. I embraced this belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fascinating concept, just to think that we are characters, digital.. or avatars in a virtual world, and of course thinking that.. well if we are right then we are doing that thing that we sometimes see in movies (movies that we made), where those who are in a virtual world or a matrix of some sort, become aware of it.. essentially becoming aware that they are not real. What a strange, fascinating concept, to be aware that you are not real.. if I am not real then does that mean I do exist? ..but of course I exist, I am here having these thoughts, seeing my hands, and these thoughts are real.. to me. But maybe a long way from here there is someone being told by one of their species that they spend too much time immersed in our existence something like "why do you spend so much time gawking at that Earth, it's not real!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an amazing thought I had though. Well, with the advancement of technology we have made photography, films, video games, VR.. right, what if.. as the process of technological advancement goes on and on, we are getting closer to inventing the technology that.. I don't even know how to explain it. So in the future of our race, maybe they make this VR technology and rightly so we here in 2017 ARE VR.. we are the VR of our own future race. So.. our future race has made us.. but they used to be us OH MAN WHAT A FUCKING PARADOX MINDFUCK! LOVE IT!

       I love this explanation.  Each of us as an independent AI, or OI (organic intelligence) if you will (originating from a single base kernel), interacting entirely with each other and pre-programmed code "objects" on a server.  Every significant scientific or cultural "breakthrough" = new "expansion pack," or custom mods. First question then is...assuming this model...who or what set up the server?  Second question, again assuming this model...would the entity that set up the server, hold the same reservation about code based intelligence achieving self-awareness that we do?  Would it also follow that the server creator has mechanisms in place to prevent us from "evolving" beyond the constraints of our server?  I'm sure there's other relevant questions but these 2 came to mind first.

       Science was just a move to make the fundamentalist-minded people harmless. Just notice how always its the "big bang
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       " and "evolution
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       ", they are winking, hey its just a theory and undiscerning people that needs an owner-of-the-truth authority fail to notice it.
