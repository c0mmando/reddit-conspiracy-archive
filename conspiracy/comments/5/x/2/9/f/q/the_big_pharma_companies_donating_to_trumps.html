       Yes, we should be watchful of the future and not always looking back, but it is by studying the past that we can remain informed of efforts to mislead our attentions.

       AFAIK:  The Trump administration's focus on opposing drugs is more about opposing deep state mechanisms which use drug trafficking to subvert or avoid democratically-controlled appropriations procedures.  It isn't about suppressing pot.  Statements by the AG have indicated that state and local laws will determine enforcement priorities.

       By the way, I get so many replies attacking Clinton just because I will post something attacking Trump. Let me repeat what I've said before: FUCK Clinton. I don't like her, I didn't support her ever, and I wish she'd rot in prison. Happy now?

       Nope.  Study the past to predict the future.  You keep getting directed to Hillary because frame-inversion is among the most classic propaganda tricks of all.  By labeling Trump as being bad at something that Democrats are actually terrible at, the expectations are lowered and Democrats no longer have to prove qualified in order to capture votes on that issue.  Political goldfishing is a recipe for malignant stagnation.

       That's not the point...  You're not really up against "the other side supports the drug war".  You're up against "the other side opposes CIA trafficking, and anti-CIA rhetoric is currently being confused with pro-drugwar rhetoric by forces trying to prevent a crackdown on the CIA".  You're going to get a lot of responses that are meant to puncture propaganda points because there's an active propaganda effort distorting this issue that people on this sub care about.

       It's a fair response. Pharma has been fucking people long before Trump. It's been two months. Attributing pharma pofits to this administration is beyond retarded, sorry.

        If pharma profits boom after a year, and they actually crack down on weed, you'll have a point.

       Why do profits have to boom? It's already fucked up what they're doing
       <strong>
        now
       </strong>
       (regardless of who has been in power), so it seems like you're ok with the status quo so long as your guy is the one doing it? When I read that statement all I see is: "Trump can keep things exactly as they are and I'm ok with that."

       I just have realistic expectations. It will take longer than a year to loosen pharma's grip on everyone. Many are already addicted.

       All he has to do is leave legal weed alone and the problem will begin to resolve itself. I don't know enough about the pharma scam to see any easy, legal, ways out of there price gouging. I feel that any price controls by the government would be hard to enact.

       There have been several posts on r/conspiracy as of late, regarding President Trump's administration and the financial contributions of "Big Pharma" to either his current administration or to his campaign, due in part to Sean Spicer's statement about pot... If there is a connection between the two, then such a claim requires proof/sources. Information to support these claims are very important, and if true then they need to be shown. u/russian321 , may I see your sources please?

       I'm only asking for these specific sources, because the burden of proof falls on you. I'm asking because I would like to inform myself further. You're redirecting my question into claiming that I'm ignorant of these things, when I'm asking you to simply provide some proof or links. You're not, which leads me to believe you don't have any valid or reasonable sources to share.

       Down votes are fine, they're nothing and only effect those who care about their opinions or statement's popularity. The lurkers, readers, and posters of r/conspiracy can tell the difference between the amount of votes and the truth...and the difference is there is no correlation. The truth can have 1000 upvotes or a thousand down votes. The truth is still the truth

       <p>
        This event with PhRMA lobbyists explains why. On most of the big public policy issues of the day, Trump is a very conventional Republican. And on those issues where he hasn’t been conventional, Republican Congress members and business executives feel confident they can turn him around. On some issues, they probably won’t. But on this issue, it seems like they did.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should acknowledge that some reporters who cover this beat don’t agree with my read of these remarks. But Trump
        <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-price-medicare-drug-price-negotiations">
         picked an HHS Secretary who’s opposed price negotiations
        </a>
        , and other ideologically orthodox Republicans to run Medicare and Medicaid and his Office of Management and Budget. When congressional Democrats tried to get an amendment supporting price negotiation into the senate’s budget resolution, Trump didn’t lift a finger to stop them. It seems to me that Trump is now aligning his statements with the actual policy he is pursuing, namely to speed drug approvals at the FDA and not change anything about Medicare pricing.

       That's a stupid thing to hope for.  Big pharma spends hundreds of millions on R&amp;D, clinal stuidies, and marketing.  By slashing prices all your going to do is stop them from developing new drugs, because it won't be worth it to them to do the investment.  Instead encourage legislation to help generic drug makers and stop authorized generics (big drug makers screw with generic drug companies by partnering with another company, then they come out with an authorized generic, so the original company loses less money from generics).

       Do you know why big pharma charges astronomical amounts for their drugs?  Because the FDA requires them to do years and years and years of testing and red tape regulations.  A company has to get a return on their investment.  Cut regulations to make them more common sense, and drug prices will fall dramatically.

       Both the POTUS and USAG have publicly stated that they believe States should have the right to decide what to do about marijuana, even though they both personally believe recreational use is a bad decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is hilarious. People really haven't figured out the strategy yet? One simple evasive comment dropped by Spicer and no action to back it up, and now the media is practically demanding that Congress legalizes it just so they can appear to be in opposition to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been using the same strategy to manipulate MSM since the primary election. I can't believe there are still so many people that haven't figured this out and just believe Trump is a big dumb dumb.

       pharma doesn't want cannabis legal, they want "medical" because you have "medical" marijuana in places but the "medical" programs essentially don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance PA only allows concentrates/edibles for their medical market. They also created a limited number of licenses as far as I know. You know what that means? Powdery Mildew for everyone!

       Everyone write your congressmen and tell them you support the new bill for states rights for marijuana. It's not Trumps call. He has said multiple times that he wants to uphold the law. He can't pick and choose. Let's get this fucking bill passed.

       Both the POTUS and USAG have publicly stated that they believe States should have the right to decide what to do about marijuana, even though they both personally believe recreational use is a bad decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is hilarious. People really haven't figured out the strategy yet? One simple evasive comment dropped by Spicer and no action to back it up, and now the media is practically demanding that Congress legalizes it just so they can appear to be in opposition to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been using the same strategy to manipulate MSM since the primary election. I can't believe there are still so many people that haven't figured this out and just believe Trump is a big dumb dumb.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This event with PhRMA lobbyists explains why. On most of the big public policy issues of the day, Trump is a very conventional Republican. And on those issues where he hasn’t been conventional, Republican Congress members and business executives feel confident they can turn him around. On some issues, they probably won’t. But on this issue, it seems like they did.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should acknowledge that some reporters who cover this beat don’t agree with my read of these remarks. But Trump
        <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-price-medicare-drug-price-negotiations">
         picked an HHS Secretary who’s opposed price negotiations
        </a>
        , and other ideologically orthodox Republicans to run Medicare and Medicaid and his Office of Management and Budget. When congressional Democrats tried to get an amendment supporting price negotiation into the senate’s budget resolution, Trump didn’t lift a finger to stop them. It seems to me that Trump is now aligning his statements with the actual policy he is pursuing, namely to speed drug approvals at the FDA and not change anything about Medicare pricing.
