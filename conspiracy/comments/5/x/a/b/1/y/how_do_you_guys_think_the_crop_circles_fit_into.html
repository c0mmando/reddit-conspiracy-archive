       Crop circles are a prank meant to inspire fear in those who believe themselves to be above retaliation by reminding them of the essential frailty of their semiholy order.  People can and do gather without leaving traces.  People can and do gather leaving exactly the traces they chose.

       Kia and I were discussing this yesterday. Here's what I came up with:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like smashing open a pi≈Ñata, allowing children to clammor, slash and scrape their way to the candy, only to then chastise the children for their misbehavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, throw out a conversation starter, but word it in such a way that it invites all manner of response. Then you can point and say "Look, r/conspiracy is ridiculous because they're talking about XYZ."
      </p>
      <p>
       He put out a similar post regarding Scientology on another sub. Not saying the above scenario is the current predicament, but they smell very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be used as a weapon to invalidate other arguments. "r/conspiracy can't be right about Sessions, they believe the government puts out subliminal messages on tv."
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not you can lend any credence to the efficacy of subliminal messages, the public largely finds the concept to be the work of science fiction, or once thought of as potentially effective but has been disproven (as is taught by mostby university psychology programs).

       I like your idea, but in addition to that I think it is to dilute our focus, and possibly disarm us while we talk anout things we enjoy talking about so that they can inject more subtle forms of manipulation. Like, see we both agree on A isn't that nice, what do you think about B? Where B is a carfully constructed question that forces you to accept one wrong thing to discuss another thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        since we know Sessions lied to congress, do you think we will get someone in there that will finally disclose UFOs?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is a clumsy example I though up real quick, but I think you get the idea. I call these boat turners.

       Half-truths are rampant here now. 9/11 was a inside job....perpetrated with alien technology! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       The nonsense buries the valid arguments as well as detracts from the credibility of the sub. It's a win win. Someone comes to the sub to read about Sessions because it was on the front page. They start thinking "wow there just might be something to this sub!" Then they back out, go to read more on the sub, see a post about aliens helping with 9/11, immediately disregard the information in the original Sessions article that brought them there, and fall in line with the narrative being pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no coincidence that the population of the sub goes from 2000 to 3500 every time a major story hits/ news or/ politics. The sub is brigaded by a force  over 50% the size of the typical logged-on population.

       The skills of anti-conspiracy are the skills of conspiracy.  They are one and the same.  To teach people how to root out conspiracies, teach them to advance themselves with conspiracy.  Embrace the worst case, and be reborn in chaos.

       While going down a rabbit hole with the excellent series, Ancient Knowledge (6 parts)
      </p>
      <p>
       Part one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/4p4YSle5MoM">

       I believe I have a pretty good idea of how crop circles are formed. The series isn't about crop circles but it covers Sacred Harmonic Geometry, Cymantics, advanced ancient civilizations and their understanding of advanced mathematics and harmonic resonance/vibrations, Pi, the fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio among other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla believed that the Earth and other planets gave off a frequency that he was able to tap into to send electricity wirelessly over several miles. Different frequencies (energy /sound) can produce different effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few experiments from the Ancient Knowledge series used sand spread out on a flat surface with a speaker underneath the board or glass. Different frequencies would cause the sand to form increasingly complex geometric patterns. The higher the frequency, the more complex the patterns. These patterns are sacred Geometric formations and they can be found all over the world on Ancient Structures, statues and paintings. The flower of life, the seed of life, metatron's cube, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also did an experiment where they played different sound frequencies as ice crystals were formed and the crystals would freeze with very complex geometric patterns frozen inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other planets in our galaxy also give off a frequency. Saturn has a really eery sounding frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Sh2-P8hG5-E">
        https://youtu.be/Sh2-P8hG5-E
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen the Hexagon on Jupiter? It's a naturally forming hexagon pattern at the North Pole of the planet. Scientists don't know yet what causes this pattern to form. I would argue that Jupiter produces a frequency that creates the pattern. I think crop circles are created the same way. The earth itself generated the frequency necessary to create the complex geometric patterns found in Crop circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory explains a lot of the features of a genuine crop circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Complex geometric designs. Mathematical and geometric perfection. Designs incorporate Pi, the Golden Ratio, the fibonacci Sequence and many more complex mathematical symbology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presence of electro- magnetic energy inside the crop circle that is detectable with instruments and causes batteries to drain and equipment to malfunction. It also affects people and animals. Electro magnetic energy can alter brainwaves creating happy feelings. It can also cause you to feel afraid or uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changes to the plants and soil at a molecular level. Presence of high energy microwave energy. The stems from the plants that have been exposed to the energy heat and expand, causing them to bend and not break. They are more fertile and reproduce faster than plants from outside the circle. The stem nodes are blown out instead of bent or broken. There are iron micro spheres in the soil along with other metals not found outside the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of balls of light/energy in the vicinity of the crop circles. Some have witnessed the crop circles forming while others have stated that the Julia Sequence Crop circle right next to  Stonehenge formed in broad daylight within 30-45 minutes. Balls of light, possibly intelligent, could be a by-product of the energy and frequency generated when the circles are formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most crop circles form over night and their formation is rarely witnessed. They can form quickly and they vary from a few feet in diameter to hundreds of yards. As demonstrated in the two examples above, the patterns formed instantly as soon as the frequencies are played.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly possible for humans to create very complex geometric patterns but they can not replicate all of the features of a real crop circle outlined above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe in a God but the more I learn about Sacred Geometry, unified theory (as above, so below), Mathematics and numerology (repeating numbers in space, time, distance, and the fabric of our universe.), the absolutely perfect harmony between the earth and the moon and the sun and the rest of the planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mathematics is the universal language and it sure seems like there is some "intelligent Design" behind everything we see, touch, feel and experience.

       Damn, interesting theory on the formation. Seems very plausible to me. This was a great read, thanks.

       I was always fascinated by the use of sacred geometry by former civilizations. I am a big believer in forbidden knowledge and the potential of a far more advanced previous race.

       Sacred Geometry in Crop Circles are a message from the Coders that designed the Universe we live in. They are not from "good guy ETs".

       I dunno but there has to be something. Sacred Geometry has been around since before us. It's found everywhere as are certain numbers and mathematical formula. It's encoded into nature and its encoded into ancient structures such as the Great Pyramid and many more all around the world.

       I recommend watching this series because I'm not smart enough to properly explain it but I promise it will be worth it.

       Why couldn't it just be humans making the circles using that known geometry.  Why does it have to be "the Coders that designed the Universe "?

       Humans are definitely making a majority of them but you can scientifically verify the ones that they did not and can not make.

       The soil and the plants have been altered in real crop circles consistent with electro magnetic energy. The stems on the plants are folded over, not smashed and the nodules in the stems have been blown out.

       I tried to find a video to explain better. This was the best I could find so far. Ignore all of the ufo stuff and psychically communicating with "space brothers". It does have a good explanation of Sacred Geometry and a possible way that these circles are being generated. Sound frequency/high energy fields. This mah also explain the balls of light often seen around crop circles. I don't believe these balls of light are alien ships but a by product of the energy used to create the circles.

       Humans have been using electro magnetic energy for close to two centuries.  Why couldn't those have been made by humans as well?

       And how would they get these electro magnetic devices out into the fields to make the circles? Please show me one of these devices. Keep in mind that these circles have been forming for decades.

       Scientists have already tried conducting experiments to explain the presence of this energy and so far haven't come up with a practical method.

       Also, there's no way you watched the video that quickly before responding so I'm guessing your mind is already made up.

       The devices aren't out in the fields, they are probably up in the sky.  I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying there is another possibility.  I haven't made up my mind, I'm open to either being true.  Pranksters with sticks and ropes is the only one that seems impossible to me.

       I recently watched this series on Ancient Knowledge and it had nothing to do with crop circles.

       Have you seen the hexagon on Jupiter's polar region? I think crop circles are something like that. Like the sand on the board with a speaker below and when they played certain frequencies, the sand on the board would form increasingly complex geometric patterns. Tesla believed that Earth produces frequencies and it would account for the electro magnetic readings, changes in the plants and soil.

       Just my working theory until new information comes along.
