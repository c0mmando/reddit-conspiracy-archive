       Nothing in those messages is an attack, whereas OP is calling the other dude a cocksucking retard, fucking dipshit, and a bitch - among other things.  I don't know why you're trying to defend OP here but he was being an asshole and that type of childish behavior isn't tolerated on this sub.  It isn't really too complicated.

       wait that's not right -- the quoted lines in that comment are from OP's original post. the attacker was quoting OP's post and then writing the lines abuse after each thing OP had said

       i totally agree OP was needling people and shit stirring. if the attacking message hadn't come from a banned user i might've just let it go. but if a user is banned from here it's probably for good reason, so it bothered me that banned users can still abuse members from 'beyond the grave', so to speak.

       You clearly don't care about personal attacks if you disagree with the person being attacked. The fact that the user is already banned is just convenient. Not a strawman, youre just a crap mod

       Yes, but your reaction when you thought OP was saying those things was very different from your reaction when you found out you were mistaken.

      <p>
       First you threatened him, then you said he "gets no sympathy".
      </p>

       Why have you not removed your comments in which you threaten OP for something he didn't do?

       His getting no sympathy doesn't mean I have a problem banning the other user for breaking the rules.  My personal opinions are separate from my modding duties.  What is your point?

       I'm not concerned with what your interpretation of my words is to be frank.  I know what I meant, I just explained to you what I meant, and beyond that you're free to think whatever you'd like.  The fact that the other user was banned a year ago should tell you that personal opinions have no bearing on the way the sub is modded.  If the bias you're implying existed then that user would have been free to say whatever he wanted to say to the OP and nothing would have been done.  But that isn't what happened, so again not sure what your overall point is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To repeat myself: just because I think someone is a troll or don't personally like what they bring to the sub, that doesn't mean I'll allow them to be attacked by other users even if I agree with those other users.

       am not implying bias. I simply pointed out the very different way you reacted when you thought OP was being abusive, to when you found out the abuse was being aimed at OP.

       I agree that your bias (if there is one) did not actually result in you banning OP or deleting this thread, but I felt that the way you had left it gave the perception of bias.

       I simply pointed out that a correction of your initial erroneous reaction was called for - and you seem to have agreed.

       Because I think,
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       , the OP is a shit-stirring troll.  I've explained this now like four times.  I'm a human being, I have opinions and biases, it would be stupid to deny that and I admit to it readily.  Sometimes I ban users even though I totally agree with them.  Sometimes I protect users who I totally dislike.  Again I ask: what is your point?  I feel like I'm just repeating myself and you're arguing for the sake of arguing.  You don't like that I "changed my tone" once I realized OP wasn't the one attacking.  Okay, I did.  And?

       Is this really the best use of both our time today?  Me fucking up when reading through a comment?  If you scroll down in the thread it's readily apparent that I fucked up, I admit I fucked up, and now I've even edited my initial comment saying I fucked up.  If you have another question or concern by all means ask away but as of now this is quickly becoming a waste of both our time.

       i don't think the problem is that there are political posts, the problem is that there are political posts that have zero to do with any conspiracy. for example: earlier this week people (or maybe 1 person) were posting political articles that were so irrelevant to any conspiracies that i would've sworn they were posted here by pure accident if it wasn't such a habitual thing

       Nope, I just see that it was removed and which mod removed it.  If that mod doesn't give a reason on the post itself then there's no way for me to know.

       I'm not concerned with what your interpretation of my words is to be frank.  I know what I meant, I just explained to you what I meant, and beyond that you're free to think whatever you'd like.  The fact that the other user was banned a year ago should tell you that personal opinions have no bearing on the way the sub is modded.  If the bias you're implying existed then that user would have been free to say whatever he wanted to say to the OP and nothing would have been done.  But that isn't what happened, so again not sure what your overall point is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To repeat myself: just because I think someone is a troll or don't personally like what they bring to the sub, that doesn't mean I'll allow them to be attacked by other users even if I agree with those other users.

       Yep, I was leaving the comment for posterity.  I made the edit because you asked me to.  Like I said.
