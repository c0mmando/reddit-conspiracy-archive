       As much as I think this whole "Russian ties" story is a bullshit buzzword to distract people, what implications does it actually even carry if it were to be true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they saying Trump collaborated with Russia on any certain thing, or just that Trump generally collaborated with Russia?

       I'm still not following. The way msm talks about it makes it sounds like grounds for impeachment. I just don't understand why communicating with Russia would be bad, unless they can prove that he was communicating about a particular thing that actually is grounds for impeachment

       Communicating with Russia isn't bad. The MSM wants you to believe it's bad because the MSM hates Trump, along with a majority of the political establishment.  They also know Hillary's sycophants are still in shock that their chosen one lost and will believe anything that goes along with the narrative that the election was "stolen" from her due to outside interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point they're doing everything possible to delegitimize Trump because there's a lot at stake, most notably the political order which people like Clinton have benefited from. The Democratic Party is also in shambles so this is also a way to save face for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad because there are good people who are just reacting to the surface noise of all of this and actually believe what they're being told.  Some are just outright dishonest and are playing hardball team politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       A question no one seems to ask is, how does Russia benefit from a Trump Presidency? No one seems to have a coherent answer to this. Another key question to ask is what do certain people have to lose with a Trump presidency/friendly relations with Russia.

       This is what I've been thinking. It just doesn't add up to smear someone this much without any solid thesis. Their entire argument at this point is essentially that he talked with Russia. I guess if they want to push the hacked election thing, they can form an argument based off of that, but I'm almost positive that would lead to a war if any action against Trump implicating Russia were taken.

       Hacked election is a very broad way of looking at it and the mechanics of that really haven't been analyzed to provide substantial proof it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that Clinton was (is) a noticeably corrupt politician. Even if it was the Russians behind the leaks (which is certainly possible, but at this point not proven), she was exposed to a degree not seen in modern American politics. And that's really the heart of the outrage. Those screaming about Russia don't actually care that an election was potentially influenced; they care more that their candidate was exposed to the masses and an "evil billionaire" who was willing to fight back and rattle the cages wound up winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a lot of outrage and nonsense from the right when Obama won, but the key difference is the left has the MSM on their side. It's going to be much more difficult for Trump to fend them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I generally don't trust either side of the aisle, but I agree that the left is engaging in some dirty and potentially dangerous games right now.

       It's not. Lying to congress would be (

       Exactly. They have no true legal remedy, so the only solution at this point is a full court press on Trump to create public outrage and strong opposition.

       The problem is the media isn't just reporting news, they're creating narratives. It makes it increasingly difficult to know if the outrage is legitimate, or if the people who hate him do so because of what they're being fed.  I'm not suggesting some haven't done their research and simply just disagree with his positions, but taking into account how much the media carried the bag for Clinton and ignored certain things, it makes one question whether it's actual news being reported or a concerted effort to legitimize one while delegitimizing the other. The outlets being criticized can report what they want and how they want, but people can reject that, too.

       That is what I think. That relationships between our leaders and a power like Russia, who has many enemies in common with us, is just ridiculous. I was really looking forward to better relations with Iran as a side effect of this as well. I think Russia and Iran are really interesting countries, and they would be great friends to have with conflict against Saudi Arabia and Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what this whole thing is about imho. Saudi and Israel own our shadow government. Russian and Iran are antithetic to Israel's agenda.

       Trump wasn't supposed to win... so all this Russia talk was supposed to be to swing public opinion against them... Putin already said he knows he is trying to be provoked when they killed that Russian ambassador to Turkey... but I don't think that is the goal... they had to switch gears on the fly and instead used that propaganda to delegitimize Trump... just like they had to switch gear with the bought and paid for "antifa" guys... those were supposed to be playing the role of angry Trump supporters rioting after the elections... thats why it makes no sense to have happy tolerant liberals in masks smashing windows.

       All a scheme to turn public opinion against Russia, damage relations, and delegitimize the GOP... maybe with a touch of martial law.

       That's what I thought too, except less of damaging relations with Russia and more of delegitimizing Trump and the GOP. I just see all these stories of "Trump under investigation for Russia!" and I just think "What's your point?"

       Exactly, they already had the momentum from the planned russian narrative they had executed to prepare us for a war with russia. They just improvised capturing that momentum to direct it towards Trump. That is why it comes across so unbelievable to people that don't have a dog in the fight, it wasn't built to the purpose and the pieces don't fit together very well.

       I got the first inkling something was up when before the election they were pushing the Russian hacking narrative and announced they were gonna have US "white-hat" hackers shut down the internet and electricity in Russia for a week surrounding the election to make sure they didn't meddle... that's how you start a war.

       These sort of sloppy tactics really remind me of the Clinton campaign. I can't remember specifically what made me think it, but it seemed like they were letting someone plan strategy in the media that was just inept. Maybe it is that AI that they are said to have been using? Maybe they are still listening to its obviously flawed decision making ability? All I know is it has felt like there was a new or amateur hand on the wheel since October at least.

       It would only be a big deal if there were some law being broken. Having ties to foreign countries is unfortunately the norm. If Trump had paid or coordinated with Russia (assuming they actually hacked the DNC/Podesta), then it would be an impeachable offense. Or if there were some sort of quid pro quo going on, such as Russia forgiving some of Trump's personal debts in exchange for lighter policies, then it would be impeachable too. But realistically, you'd think that people on Trump's team would've been smart enough to avoid these kinds of legal issues out of fear of eventually getting impeached or ending up in jail.

       Anyone who wants a multi-polar world is an ally in some aspects. Federalist blocs/ad-hoc agreements between nationalist countries are the future, not globalism and giving national rights away to un-elected global powers.

       The Red Scare is far worse than it was before because previously the scare was manufactured by the NWO, now it is literal panic and ACTUAL Red Scare as Putin brings their dirty laundry into the open. They will hang it Putin wins. And it's not looking good for them.
