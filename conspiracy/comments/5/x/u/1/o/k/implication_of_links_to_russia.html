    <div class="md"><p>Communicating with Russia isn&#39;t bad. The MSM wants you to believe it&#39;s bad because the MSM hates Trump, along with a majority of the political establishment.  They also know Hillary&#39;s sycophants are still in shock that their chosen one lost and will believe anything that goes along with the narrative that the election was &quot;stolen&quot; from her due to outside interference. </p>

<p>At this point they&#39;re doing everything possible to delegitimize Trump because there&#39;s a lot at stake, most notably the political order which people like Clinton have benefited from. The Democratic Party is also in shambles so this is also a way to save face for the time being. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad because there are good people who are just reacting to the surface noise of all of this and actually believe what they&#39;re being told.  Some are just outright dishonest and are playing hardball team politics. </p>

<p>A question no one seems to ask is, how does Russia benefit from a Trump Presidency? No one seems to have a coherent answer to this. Another key question to ask is what do certain people have to lose with a Trump presidency/friendly relations with Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;ve been thinking. It just doesn&#39;t add up to smear someone this much without any solid thesis. Their entire argument at this point is essentially that he talked with Russia. I guess if they want to push the hacked election thing, they can form an argument based off of that, but I&#39;m almost positive that would lead to a war if any action against Trump implicating Russia were taken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hacked election is a very broad way of looking at it and the mechanics of that really haven&#39;t been analyzed to provide substantial proof it happened. </p>

<p>The truth is that Clinton was (is) a noticeably corrupt politician. Even if it was the Russians behind the leaks (which is certainly possible, but at this point not proven), she was exposed to a degree not seen in modern American politics. And that&#39;s really the heart of the outrage. Those screaming about Russia don&#39;t actually care that an election was potentially influenced; they care more that their candidate was exposed to the masses and an &quot;evil billionaire&quot; who was willing to fight back and rattle the cages wound up winning.</p>

<p>There was a lot of outrage and nonsense from the right when Obama won, but the key difference is the left has the MSM on their side. It&#39;s going to be much more difficult for Trump to fend them off.</p>

<p>I generally don&#39;t trust either side of the aisle, but I agree that the left is engaging in some dirty and potentially dangerous games right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the media isn&#39;t just reporting news, they&#39;re creating narratives. It makes it increasingly difficult to know if the outrage is legitimate, or if the people who hate him do so because of what they&#39;re being fed.  I&#39;m not suggesting some haven&#39;t done their research and simply just disagree with his positions, but taking into account how much the media carried the bag for Clinton and ignored certain things, it makes one question whether it&#39;s actual news being reported or a concerted effort to legitimize one while delegitimizing the other. The outlets being criticized can report what they want and how they want, but people can reject that, too.</p>

Putin already said he knows he is trying to be provoked when they killed that Russian ambassador to Turkey... but I don&#39;t think that is the goal... they had to switch gears on the fly and instead used that propaganda to delegitimize Trump... just like they had to switch gear with the bought and paid for &quot;antifa&quot; guys... those were supposed to be playing the role of angry Trump supporters rioting after the elections... thats why it makes no sense to have happy tolerant liberals in masks smashing windows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These sort of sloppy tactics really remind me of the Clinton campaign. I can&#39;t remember specifically what made me think it, but it seemed like they were letting someone plan strategy in the media that was just inept. Maybe it is that AI that they are said to have been using? Maybe they are still listening to its obviously flawed decision making ability? All I know is it has felt like there was a new or amateur hand on the wheel since October at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would only be a big deal if there were some law being broken. Having ties to foreign countries is unfortunately the norm. If Trump had paid or coordinated with Russia (assuming they actually hacked the DNC/Podesta), then it would be an impeachable offense. Or if there were some sort of quid pro quo going on, such as Russia forgiving some of Trump&#39;s personal debts in exchange for lighter policies, then it would be impeachable too. But realistically, you&#39;d think that people on Trump&#39;s team would&#39;ve been smart enough to avoid these kinds of legal issues out of fear of eventually getting impeached or ending up in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah they&#39;re playing the &quot;where there&#39;s smoke there&#39;s fire angle&quot; and the more time spent on Russia the less time the Trump administration has to enact it&#39;s domestic agenda.</p>

<p>Not that they&#39;re completely unfounded. Sessions lied to congress because he&#39;s a dumb hick and Flynn was also retarded. These are unforced errors </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin says stuff like &quot;<a href="http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.508/putin-the-builders-of-the-new-world-order-have-failed.html">The New World Order has failed</a>&quot; so everyone in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> realm considers him the enemy of our enemy. However politically, it is kryptonite because Putin is the ultimate enemy of the globalists right now. They are still trying to keep the illusion that he was in the wrong for Crimea alive. </p>

<p>Anyone who wants a multi-polar world is an ally in some aspects. Federalist blocs/ad-hoc agreements between nationalist countries are the future, not globalism and giving national rights away to un-elected global powers. </p>

<p>The Red Scare is far worse than it was before because previously the scare was manufactured by the NWO, now it is literal panic and ACTUAL Red Scare as Putin brings their dirty laundry into the open. They will hang it Putin wins. And it&#39;s not looking good for them. </p>
