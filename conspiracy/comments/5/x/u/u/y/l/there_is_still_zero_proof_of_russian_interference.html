       Clapper and intelligence reports actually place blame on RT for propoganda. Hahahahaha. Really?  Here's a nice little exercise: go to RT website or watch RT America.  It will be foreign to most readers to read REAL, unbiased journalism. Now compare those news reports in RT to MSM in America.  The difference in unbiased truth based reporting is staggering.   All the Russians have to do is report the actual truth and sit back and watch as America tear itself apart.    It's brilliant really

       I wonder if they just shake their heads at the establishment that horribly runs this country and feel bad for its citizens. I'm embarrassed by the people that run this country. It's always the most unfit people that want to run the US into the ground.

       Is a government funded news agency really considered unbiased? RT is funded by the Russian government, and I imagine it is hard to distinguish the actual direction of news the government does or doesn't push on RT. But I do believe one of the cornerstones of democracy is to have government free media agencies. And that being said I have seen more than one rt article that can be claimed as "propaganda". That isn't to say RT doesn't have truth to plenty of their articles, it is always good to get foreign input on how they see developments inside one country.

       My point is not to advocate, but to compare the coverage. It's night and day. All the Russians have to do is report non-biased media coverage to point out the hypocrisy of American media coverage.  It's totally backwards.

       <em>
        Exactly.
       </em>
       The accusations are so vague and nebulous...what the fuck is there even to debunk? I mean, how could you possibly claim that there was
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       Russian involvement in the US election? For example, pro-Putin media outlets tended to lean towards Trump in the 2016 election - does that constitution interference to these people? I don't even know what we're arguing about...
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly I have seen absolutely ZERO evidence that Russia in any way interfered
       <em>
        improperly
       </em>
       with the Presidential election. But I'm sure there were many in the Russian government who reached out to Trump during his Presidential campaign, just like there were probably many who reached out to Hillary, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole Russia shit is just so asinine. The very idea that people would seriously be discussing whether "Russia hacked the election" in fucking 2017 is just so god damn stupid. I can't believe it.
       <em>
        Leftists really are useful idiots.
       </em>
       There, I said it. These people are fucking bottomfeeder tier retarded. Fucking idiots. They will literally believe anything they see on the TEEVEE regardless of how ridiculous it is or how scant the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are past the tipping point in our nation; the government is safe from retaliation by those of us who know because our voices are drowned out by the fucking idiot masses. I can only speak for myself, but personally, Trump is the siren song of a lost America.

       That's a good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, I take it for granted that the governments of the world attempt and occasionally succeed in tampering with each other's governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, to make such a big deal about something that is common place makes me call into question the people making all the fuss.  While I think Trump as president is an awful shame I have yet to see any evidence that our government is any worse off.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a corrupt mess and continues to be so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, evidence to me would consist of not only actually see or hearing the collaboration between trump campaign and Russia but, perhaps more importantly, the consequences of that action.  "Trump as president" in and of itself sucks balls but if that is all Russia can do then it's really not worth getting worked up over.

       Seems to me that Russia took advantage of our own ineptitude.  The DNC had a amazing candidate and sand bagged him to their own detriment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we are playing the blame game then I think we need to lay out the entire trail of events.

       They
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       found evidence that supports the idea of Russian involvement in the election. For example, computer forensics showed that the software the DNC hackers used on the hacked servers phoned-home back to the same command-and-control server that known Russian malware used.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is certainly room to discuss whether the evidence is strong, relevant, etc. but saying there is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence is really pushing a false narrative.

       LoL, I'm a professional security researcher bro, this is how it works. Attackers set up public data sink in a friendly network, typically registered to some domain. It's a publicly reachable server but the identity of the owner is kept secret legally. The address for this server is hardcoded in the malware. Look it up, stuxnet used something like malaysianfootballbets.com. Once the data is inside the  public server, it can be VPN'd to home base securely and without anyone finding out where the data went.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public server that the DNC malware uploaded data to is known to be controlled to by GRU.

       Hi bro, you're clearly a terrible fucking "researcher." A domain name is not an IP address, domain names are thus not necessarily static. So you cannot prove an identity of an address based on a domain name.

       Just because the hacker used a Russian keyboard and that malware was used that was developed by a Russian military official is not PROOF that the Russian government hacked the DNC. Also, a hacker wouldn't be that dumb to leave those kinds of traces behind. If anything, they would leave traces behind that are meant to intentionally mislead the party that was hacked. As far as the Podesta emails, we know that was simply a phishing scam. Could've been done by anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the end of the day, none of this is proof of anything. It's just a political tactic being used to turn the American public against the Trump administration and part of a larger plan to get him impeached and get Pence in. Because we know that Pence will protect the deep state.

       When CrowdStrike investigated the DNC hacks they identified
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_Bear">
        Cozy Bear (A.K.A. APT-29)
       </a>
       as one of the actors in the hack. Cozy Bear is a group of Russian hackers who are largely suspected to be hackers associated with the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       CrowdStrike found that Cozy Bear were inside the DNC computer systems for over a year before the election. This actually provides even more possibility that the hacking group was involved in a nation-state outfit (like the Russian government) as they were sitting inside the DNC's computers with full access to internal communications for months without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can read more about their findings in the blog they made public,
       <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And since you brought up John McAfee it's worth pointing out that the person responsible for identifying the Cozy Bear hackers at CrowdStrike is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Alperovitch">
        Dimitri Alperovitch, the Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee
       </a>

       Cozy Bear being inside the DNC is not proof that the
       <strong>
        Russian government
       </strong>
       stole all the files and gave them to Wikileaks. And far from proof that the Trump campaign coordinated directly with Putin. It's proof that Russian malware was used to hack the DNC. Now lets be clear, this only includes the DNC emails, and not the Podesta emails. The problem is the media running wild with the narrative, conflating everything, and boiling it down to "Russia hacked election, Trump not legitimate president."

       If that is what happened you will never in your lifetime have proof of it. It would mean the Russian government would have to admit to it (highly unlikely) or someone inside the Russian government leaks it (also highly unlikely and would basically be a death sentence to whoever the whistle blower was)

       You are asking reddit users to give you proof to something that is imppossible to do. While at the same time using the lack of proof in your argument that Russia wasn't involved.

      <p>
       Not only does that ignore all of the circumstantial evidence but it's really disingenuous on your part.
      </p>

       Where is your proof that this is all made up by the media? How do you explain CrowdStrike's findings of hackers being in the system if this is nothing but media hype?

       You're right we don't have 100% proof of anything. But I don't agree that we couldn't have more proof than we already have. We have to look at what we do have and come to our own conclusions. Me and you have come to different conclusions. But ultimately what our conclusions are based on is how much we trust our government, the FBI, the CIA, NSA, and the media. You obviously trust their words and intentions more than I do. But that's fine, it's your opinion and it's valid. Discourse is a good thing. You didn't say that the Trump campaign did not coordinate with Russia, but can you really deny that this is the narrative the American media is pushing? I will not trust these organizations, especially when I see a motive/plan behind it.

       You're right in a sense, this basically boils down to speculation on both our parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do reject your assertations that the Russia connections are just inventions of the media. That, to me, is ignoring basic truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple people within Trump's inner circle have been forced to resign over their connections to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are not things created by the media. They're not lies or narratives or half-truths or things that are being blown out of proportion. They're just facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for CrowdStrike and the other companies who investigated the DNC hacks. That blog I posted earlier is filled with code and malware they found. Can you explain how, if this is all just the media hype, those people found some of the hacker's tools in their computers?

       The media operates to influence public opinion, not inform it. Sessions met with a Russian ambassador in his capacity as a US Senator as did other senators like Sen. Mary Landrieu (La.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.). Suddenly, the day after Trump's speech to congress (after he gains some momentum) headlines appear everywhere: Jeff Sessions met with Russian Ambassdor and lied about it under oath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then suddenly there are calls for him to resign. Headlines calling for him to resign. It's a witch hunt. It's not as simple as "multiple people from trumps campaign resigned, facts are facts." If you can't see that then you aren't looking deep enough into the situation. Suddenly the story isn't about who he met with (which is completely normal), but it's about how he lied under oath. It's all semantics. Where was that outrage when James Clapper lied under oath about the NSA spying on American citizens? Liberal media ignored it. It was clearly a coordinated and carefully timed attack. With Flynn it was the same thing. The liberal/conservative elites are working with the media with the goal of influencing public opinion and ultimately impeaching Trump. So you are right, there are many facts. But the headlines and the way in which the media presents the information is key to controlling public perception. It happens from multiple directions. CNN, Washington Post, NYT, MSNBC, CBS, TYT, and more are on the side of the liberals. Fox News, Breitbart, Infowars, RT and more are on the side of conservatives/Trump. But each source varies from one another in certain ways. You can't get caught up in one side or the other and you must watch all of them with an open mind. I'm not a Trump supporter, and I didn't vote for him. But I am willing to defend him and call bullshit where I see it. I am seeing a lot of bullshit from these so called journalists. I am a member of the working class, not a member of the Washington elite. If you don't think that liberal/conservative media directly coordinates with Washington to influence public opinion, and they are all apart of the same club, then you are in for a rude awakening.

       So do we trust Julian Assange or no? He said it wasn't a state party. Some say that he can't know who it was based on the setup of Wikileaks. I'm not sure about that.

       I don't know what to make of Assange and WikiLeaks anymore.

       He alluded to it all coming from insider leaks but I think that's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at some of the findings from cybersecurity companies and reading the ODNI reports there's no doubt in my eyes that there were hackers. Who the hackers were? I have no way of knowing
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it were coming from inside leaks that would mean the insiders hacked themselves and purposely left behind code and an entire trail of bread crumbs? And they somehow posessed enough knowledge to throw off some of the best cybersecurity experts in the world and fool them into thinking the insider leaks were actually being committed by nation-state hackers on the other side of the world? I mean I like a good conspiracy and all but that just seems ridiculous

       Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear are actually malware familys--not "hacker groups"--despite what the media and wikipedia has asserted. From
       <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/07/clinton-campaign-email-accounts-were-targeted-by-russians-too/">
        Arstechnica
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fancy Bear is the malware family tied to "Operation Pawn Storm" and other recent breaches targeting members of the media, US and NATO allied military organizations, government agencies, embassies, and defense contractors, as well as Russian political dissidents and opposition political parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also typically installed by a phishing attack, the Cozy Bear implant is a combination of remote access backdoor, keylogger, screenshot capturer, and password stealer. It can also be used to remote-install other malware on the victim's Windows computer. If Cozy Bear captures the right credentials, it can connect to other systems and spread laterally through a network.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It fits the MO of a Russian operation, but as other security experts have noted, any significant, state-sponsored, hacking event would be almost impossible to attribute. It also doesn't make sense Russia would use keyboards and timezones within Russia (or Russian-made malware with the eponymous Bear in the name for that matter) for the attacks if they were truly responsible.

       There is zero proof. The intel release provided no details. I do intrusion detection analysis for the government. They can give more details than they did. They didn't, because they have nothing.

       The supposed evidence you speak of was provided by a single firm, Crowdstrike. Financed $100 million by Google Captial, owned by Alphabet Inc. who's chairman is Eric Schmidt, who is a vocal Clinton supporter.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the malware revealed by the FBI assessment was freeware Ukrainian malware, that you can download off a site
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the IP range used by the malware corresponds to a block notoriously used by common malware

       PAS isn't what was used for attribution, the unique malware was. Crowdstrike mentioned PAS in their indicators of compromise just because they need to list every piece of malware used there. In their report they don't mention PAS as evidence for attribution.

       No pal, this disruption tactic won't work. You made an objective mistake: thinking this analysis was about the Crowdstrike report. The honest thing to do is admit to it and move on, not try to pivot to a different topic and pretend nothing happened. This discussion won't go anywhere until you show this elementary bit of honesty. Until then, cheerio.

       It's okay that you don't understand how attribution works, let me try to make it easy. These groups have specific malware only used by them, so when it's time to attribute attacks we are able to do so by seeing this unique malware. In all of the reports the unique malware is used for attribution, PAS is never mentioned because it is widely available so it can't be used for attribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acting like the malware was old or widely available just because PAS was is misleading because PAS is never mentioned as evidence it was the Russians.

       <pre><code>The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app’s icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately. When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.



Installing the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically. This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.

        The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app’s icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately. When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        Installing the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically. This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.

       What group? There is no evidence that connects Apt 28 and 29 to Russian Intelligence.  The claim that the use of xagent is a unique identifier has no evidence for it.  On top of this we have Crowd...Sony was Hacked by North Korea...Strike claiming it compromised Ukrainian Military, which they themselves deny. We have allegations of attribution, no actual evidence. So please provide some.

       Read your own report by welivesecurity which does not attribute apt 28 and 29 to Russian intelligence.

       From the Fireeye report we really see that the emperor has no clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 3 points the report tries to make. One is that primary language setting of 103 pieces of malware was ' consistently'  Russian:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IYbZkUg.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/IYbZkUg.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We can see the breakdown 59 Russian, 27 US English, 16 Neutral and 1 one from Great Britain.   No implication of Russian Intelligence here!
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 2 is that supposedly 89 percent of the malware was compiled during Moscow Business hours:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cCjM1Au.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/cCjM1Au.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the distribution of  time. UTC +4 or Moscow time starts at 3 UTC, but no Malware is compiled then.  If we wonder how many have been compiled at UTC +3, where the business day starts at 7 we get the exact same amount.  Look at the frequency of compilation:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TjG2R49.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/TjG2R49.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know this could be compiled in Ukraine in the summer time giving us safe margin for UTC +3.  The time zone argument is so vast it offers very weak support that it was compiled in Russia, and no support that it was compiled by Russian Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third point that this report makes is that the phishing attacks are consistent with targets that Russia would be interest in.  So US arm dealers, NATO websites, etc.  This is the strongest evidence of Russian government involvement, and it is no evidence at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to repeat, do you have evidence that APT 28 or 29 are Russian Intelligence?

       No, I want evidence of which you are yet to provide any other than insertions like Apt 28 is Russian Intelligence.    I want to make my bias clear.  I don't think Russians hacked the DNC and I don't think you provided any evidence for it.  But there is a lot of BS like trying to pass of Ukranian Malware as Russian, or claiming Guciffer 2.0 is Russian, etc.  So far there is plenty of evidence that evidence provided for the Russia hacked narrative is fraudulent, and zero evidence that APT is connected to Russian Intelligence.

       Where did I endorse slaughtering anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did I say a war was good?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you always put words in people's mouths?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can look at all the coincidences, all the connections in Trump's organization with Russia, the fact they've been caught several times lying about those connections, the fact they've taken a very soft tone on Ukraine, and think these connections are real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it's stupid to think Trump and the Russians aren't connected. Really stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much you care about that obvious fact is up to you, but, at this point, denying it is retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say all this and not want war and still passionately hating Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can think Trump is a corrupt buffoon, and be staunchly antiwar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want war at all, and if that's gonna be the result of this, I'd rather Trump stay in power. But you have no real evidence that this will lead to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       You literally made a post in r/conspiracy arguing that the biggest conspiracy right now fake, despite overwhelming coincidences pointing to it being real.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a political opinion, not a skeptical one.

       Trump, himself, says Russia hacked the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's evidence Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. He stepped down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort worked for a known Russian puppet. This info got out, and he stepped down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign. He lied about it under oath. Why would he lie about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       He then recused himself from the investigation. Why would he recuse himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP changed their policy on Ukraine right after Sessions met the embassador. That's an odd coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that enough evidence to convict? No, but any reasonable person can see something's up. And the investigation is ongoing. Stuff is gonna keep coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence do you want? It'll probably be released soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question here is not whether or not Russia helped Trump, it's whether or not it you are Okay with the CIA going after a democratically elected president, even if he's clearly on Russia's cock.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence do you have this scandal will lead to a war?

       That's a very inflammatory thing to say with no evidence.

       Yes. This is important and we should focus on this as well, but it should not be used to deflect from Trump's issues, and it's not the subject of this post.

       What do you think pursuing all this Russia nonsense leads to?  Patty cake?  War, numskull!  By skipping over due process right to the part where we accuse and act against a foreign state, IS advocating escalation (war).  We played that game with Iraq, already.  Let's learn from our hasty decisions and use caution this next time, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, have you not noticed the idea that US wants to make Russia the bad guy because Russia isn't playing with US's monopoly money, and teaming up with other countries to follow suite?  And what a surprise, US is in conflict with all those other countries (Lybia, Syria, Iraq...)

       You mean twice, not several?  One lied to his boss, not Congress or the public.  The other accidentally answered a two part question in a way that was spun into "blatent lies".  Neither were found of wrongdoing.

        Trump, himself, says Russia hacked the DNC.
There's evidence Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. He stepped down.
Manafort worked for a known Russian puppet. This info got out, and he stepped down.
Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign. He lied about it under oath. Why would he lie about it?
He then recused himself from the investigation. Why would he recuse himself?
The GOP changed their policy on Ukraine right after Sessions met the embassador. That's an odd coincidence.
Is that enough evidence to convict? No, but any reasonable person can see something's up. And the investigation is ongoing. Stuff is gonna keep coming out.

       I'd also add, if all these anonymous sources are fake, why is Trump complaining about leaks?

      <p>
       Leaks mean people in the know are releasing information, not the media just inventing things. In complaining about these leaks, Trump indicates there is accurate information getting out.

       I'm not saying any of this. I don't know how deep it is, but I doubt Trump is a Manchurian Candidate.

      <p>
       What I am saying is that there are way too many coincidences for Trump and Russia not to be in bed in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC gets hacked by Russia, as Trump acknowledges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's inner circle seems to have all these weird connections with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has taken a really soft tone on Russia, and, specifically, Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is basic logic. This has legs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Say Trump's cabinet members had contact with Russian diplomats. So fucking what? Again - Obama in 2012 before he was reelected told a Russian diplomat to tell Putin he'd be "more flexible" after the election. So were you out there in 2012 screaming from the rooftops like a retarded child about how "OBAMA IS IN BED WITH DAH RUSSKIES!!!"?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a ridiculous comparison. We aren't just talking about Trump being nice to Russia, we're talking about Trump making a deal with Russia to hack his political opponent in exchange for lifting sanctions and taking a soft tone on Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not at all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I don't like Obama. I'm sure there's lots of dirt on Obama, but we aren't talking about Obama or Clinton, we're talking about Trump.

       Even if Russia was involved with the American elections, "what difference does it make?"
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The American public still voted on it.  The emails weren't falsified.  The Democrats cheated Sanders and the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Foreign news is still news, and you can't stop Canada from talking about American elections.  Just because Canada talks about US elections, doesn't invalidate them.

       So I'm not really certain where this bellongs but I wanted to float it here and see what people think:
      </p>
      <p>
       We know with fair certainty that Hillary and camp were for sale. Throughout the election, Hillary made repeated
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       mistakes that are uncharicteristic of a career politician with an experienced campaign staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how likely might it be that Trump paid Hillary to take the nomination then throw the election?

       It does sound like the dems are completely lost trying to do anything to delegitimize the trump presidency, however I don't think it's a complete smoke screen.  trump is a billionaire who has most definitely been intertwined with russian business deals. He's a billionaire, putin is a billionaire, the real scandal, and I guess it's not really that big of a surprise is that the world has already become a globalist government. The world is a playground for billionaires and only looks like a world of nations to us little people.

       There is a lot of DUMB shit in this subreddit. What's the big deal if I think that white supremacists use r/conspiracy to  push things like holocaust denial and stuff like that? Conspiracy is actually a really good way to spread propaganda.

       honestly, noticing the push back is the thing thats kept me most interested even as the stories ebb and flow. "Users" come in loud and in numbers saying its NOT a conspiracy, which is literally the least likely thing for conspiracy fans to say (IF they didnt have an agenda). Also, whenever there is breaking news on the topic (Flynn, Sessions, Dossier etc) this place goes NUTS. Weird things start happening. Front page flooded with human trafficking busts (if you go in the thread its prostitution stings) and self posts reminding people that pizzagate is still a thing that deserves attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so fishy I love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus reading "The Agency" and other stuff about these state sponsored trolls who seek to change public opinions is fascinating.

       Ooo this is why I like r/conspiracy too. It's such a strange microcosm with a super overt political/social bent, but it's constrained by what it holds itself out to be - which actually makes it a sort of honest battleground for both sides of the political spectrum. Something that's rather rare on every other subreddit

       I checked your post history and found no posts or comments to any of the extremely anti-Trump subs or the anti-conspiracy subs either. You're also correct that they broke the subs rules.

       Sorry, but even if that user had posted in purportedly "anti-Trump" subs, how would that necessarily make him a shillot?

       I think what the mod was looking for was reasonable suspicion regarding calling me a shill.  Calling someone a shill is different than showing evidence of it, so if I did have a bunch of posts in the extreme anti-Trump subs it would've fit into the idea of reasonable suspicion and therefore calling me a shill wouldn't have been an attack.

       you are a shill. There's no reasoning with anti-conspiracy subs though, we are the bad guys, deal with it. Thanks for trying but they won't actually see your comment in the link.

       OP is dismissing it because there is no evidence, but that doesn't change anything about the obvious outsider comments suggesting that we
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       believe the MSM narrative about Trump and being surprised that we won't buy whatever they're selling.

       And yet multiple front-page posts about how Obama totally wiretapped Trump, despite the only evidence being "Trump said so."
      </p>
      <p>
       So from your definition, it sounds like outsiders have taken over

       OP also states that there's absolute proof Clinton "rigged the election process" and yet, there isn't. So I guess OP's an outsider too.

       Where is CNN reporting on that? And yes, there is a ridiculous amount of proof that the primary was rigged. And your are changing why I said he was an outsider. His

       He didn't say "you people". And he's absolutely right. The standard for proof 'required' seems to change for some people depending entirely on the context (usually depending on whether it is positive of negative towards Trump).

       And while there is no definite proof there are a lot of strange coincidences surrounding the Trump administration regarding Russia. Dismissing them all is extremely strange for a sub labeled r/conspiracy.

       Your post is so irrefutably stupid it makes my head hurt.

       Aside from your unnecessary need to put an apostrophe in the word "gets" you made the following statement:

       "Basing a conspiracy on what the media does is only valid if what they push directly hurts the medias viewership numbers."
      </p>

       Besides that statement literally being a non-fact (especially given media outlets CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER), you parlay your opinion into claiming that the USA is somehow more moral than Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love for you to elaborate on your idea the nation that is currently attacking half the world toppling governments including it's own and feeding its citizens nothing but leftist propaganda is somehow good or more moral than Russia.

       Because they have different audiences. Fox tried to be anti Trump but it hurt their ratings so they became pro Trump. CNN covers Trump negatively because that's what their audience wants. Fox and CNN have widely different audiences so they run with different stories.

       Where did I say the US is good. I think the US is way shittier than it could be but Russia is just on another level. How is the US feeding you nothing but leftist propaganda but Fox news  and Breitbart are somehow allowed to exist? Look at what Fox news did to Obama or what John Oliver does to Trump, the US and Russia are not comparable when it comes to freedom of the press.

       Freedom of press has nothing to do with Facebook, Facebook is a private company that can do whatever they want. Try post an anti Trump comment on Infowars and you'll get banned as well and I wouldn't even criticize them for it, it's their website(and the same is true for Facebook).
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is, if you try to pull infowars level shit against the Russian government in Russia you'll go to prison or get poisoned.

       Like holy shit mate, you could have picked your battle and talked about something were the US might get close to Russia but you picked freedom of press of all things.

       Flynn's conversation was about non sanctioned topics or what I find likelier that he was ordered to talk about the sanctions but didn't disclose it officially. Trump was warned by the intelligence community that Flynn did that but Trump didn't take action until the media got wind of it.
       <br/>
       Sessions tried to lie about the meeting. The extremely likely case that Russia tried to influence the elections. And then the circumstance that Trump goes on ridiculous Twitter tirades every time the media unveils something about Russia so that the media covers that instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying there are no indications that he has ties to Russia is ridiculous, more investigations have to be done though before we know for sure either way.

       Flynn was cleared of all wrongdoing and criminal activity by the FBI after the fact - meaning whatever he said about sanctions was perfectly legal and allowed. His only crime was in not reporting everything back to Pence, which may have been inadvertent.
      </p>

       You cannot prove Sessions lied about anything. He attended his meeting with the Russian ambassador as a Senator on the Senate Armed Services Committee and was not involved with the Trump campaign at the time. He is being attacked on semantics and context - he took the question as whether he had met as a Trump campaign member, which the answer was 'no', but he didn't include his time as a Senator before then. That's fairly understandable, but ultimately he should have clarified or remembered. Either way - its a pretty weak reason to call for someone to resign. Their meeting was scheduled by the Obama administration - it wasn't even set up by his own people.

      <blockquote>

        And then the circumstance that Trump goes on ridiculous Twitter tirades every time the media unveils something about Russia so that the media covers that instead.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the Russia/Trump stuff is completely fabricated by the media working along with the deep state, why wouldn't he respond with outrage? Trump using twitter is no longer a valid point - we all know he uses Twitter. It doesn't mean anything, and half the time his tweets are true but the media keeps parroting lies anyways.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Saying there are no indications that he has ties to Russia is ridiculous, more investigations have to be done though before we know for sure either way.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The investigations have been done. Do you think Obama and Hillary weren't looking high and low before the election? Do you think people are sitting on evidence? It's a joke. They are making all this shit up, and they have NOTHING to substantiate it. According to Wikileaks and Julian Assange, they got the DNC hacked emails from an insider (some think Seth Rich (RIP), Guccifer has singled out Warren Flood) and not from the Russians, but hey - they're just the people who released the hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you wondered why the international community hasn't even commented on this? Because there is no proof. You cannot go to the  international community without some evidence of wrong-doing, and the deep state can't come up with a single thing. That should say enough.

       Like you are literally just dismissing the coincidences, Pence knew Flynn lied to him, yet they only fired him once it got leaked. And it might not be reason enough for Sessions to resign but it is a coincidence that you are just dismissing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama wasn't looking, official investigations would have been leaked and helped Trump. Hillary was looking  just like every other candidate before her(who often found nothing when there was something to be found). You seem way too sure that there is nothing, seems dishonest.

       The Director of the National Intelligence lied before congress about their ability to spy on pretty much any (and every) person in America. Why would they suddenly not have that ability now? And who are they running searches on and why? All of that is valid.

       I am only arguing for the standard by which our legal system works - innocent until proven guilty. I'm not sure how a sanctioned talk between an incoming national security adviser and a Russian diplomat, and then a meeting with Sessions that was organized as a Democratic administration event is 'a bunch of coincidences piling up'? Please substantiate your words. What are these 'coincidences'?

       Either nobody knows or nobody has released the information. Some people talk about the golden shower stuff but I find it much more likely that it is a simple tit for tat. Russia releases anti hillary information and in turn Trump gives Putin some material to use as propaganda. Trump saying Russia isn't any worse than the US for example is an absolute gold mine for Putin.

       I can't make any sense of what you're saying. I also can't make out a single viable threat or motive. It's not like Trump and Putin can do whatever they want because he's president - if they are linked into making shady business deals, the ethics people will be on top of them like flies on shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only motive I can make out for Russia to get Trump in power is purely to try to dodge a third world war that Hillary was talking up the entire campaign trail as tensions grew in Syria. I don't blame them for not wanting to start an armed conflict in their backyard over long-held assets in the middle east.

       The sanctions were in place over the disagreement in Syria. As soon as Trump and Putin agreed to fight ISIS together, they fell off as they should have.

       Because that is what Putin does. Whenever a critic of him is being shot he just points at the US and says "They are bad too". It's an old soviet tactic called whataboutism. Now the President of the United states literally made the same argument. The opposition uses the US as the example of how better and democratic Russia could look, Trump saying it's just as bad is a huge blow to the opposition.

       Indeed he is. Though that is mainly due to the annexation of Crimea and the current economical situation is eroding that jump(though more of the government as a whole). It's only so long that the patriotic fervor he inspired can make up for the ongoing recession.

       Just like there's yet to be any proof that Hillary and a secret cabal of pedophiles are running a child slavery ring outside of a pizza shop. You can't have it both ways you know. A lack of concrete evidence means you can't claim something is 100% true, which sadly seems to fly over a lot of people's heads.

      </p>
      <p>
       "No evidence or proof" would depend on what you would accept.  I think having multiple people be clearly deceptive about their contacts and dealing with Russians and then step down once they were uncovered is something I would call evidence.  At least enough to take the topic seriously and want an actual investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be acceptable evidence to you of Russian involvement to at least start an investigation?

       You are literally the person who brought it up. Just because you won't accept the evidence doesn't mean there is none.

       Kind of like how Hillary Clinton should be locked up and everyone knows her husband is a rapist, but nobody does anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the topic at hand. The Kremlin uses typewriters and the democrats are desperate to continue war in Syria, Ukraine, Yemen etc. something Russia does not want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I choose to side with the people helping remove ISIS From Syria (a DNC funded terrorist group) and giving the land back to their legally and democratically elected leader.

       Trump's opposition Clinton, was integral in the destruction of the country of Libya, one of the most prosperous African nations of all time. It amazes me that BLM supports her, when she clearly does not support them. They also recently took the Clinton Foundation out of Haiti, but everyone paying attention know that's because they didn't want to get busted for human trafficking ;)

       Speaking of human trafficking! Did you know thats what arguing about refugees and immigrants is? Mainstream corporate human trafficking!

       There actually is proof.  I would classify it as slightly more than circumstantial but significantly less than a smoking gun.  Granted, the information I have looked at is all public domain so I have no idea what classified material the three letter agencies have.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Podesta clicked a link in his email that contained a Bitly link.  That Bitly link can be traced to a Bitly account used by a hacking group named Fancy Bear.  It was one of almost 9,000 links that Fancy Bear created in a massive phishing scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are facts.  They are objective and you cannot argue them.  However, the subjective part is the link between Fancy Bear and the Russian Government.  A lot of people believe that there are strong ties to the Russian Government.  I really don't have an opinion on this link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I haven't done a lot of research into the DNC hack; this is just for the Podesta "hack".

       While I am not trying to defend Trump (we should be skeptical of ALL government and the private interests corrupting them), this MSM Russia narrative is not the thing that concerns me with this administration. Makes you wonder why they are hesitant to report on the ACTUAL worrying issues....

       Absolutely the only people I've seen bringing up the concept of "WAR WITH RUSSIA!!!!" are pro-Trump talking-point repeaters and critics of those trying to figure out if the Trump campaign colluded with Russian ops and/or Assange in order to win the election. Glenn Greenwald warns of Dem hypocrisy and the potential dangers of red scare 2.0, but even he won't claim that anyone is pushing for real WMD-type war initiation. Ditto anyone from the intelligence community or any gov official. Well, besides that Putin-surrogate Russian official and Trump himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, whenever WAR WITH RUSSIA!!!! is suggested (by Trump devotees and critics of those considering/investigating conspiracy) no attempt is made to debunk the ties between Trump and co and Russian oligarchs, banks, former mobsters, etc, we just get the general refrain of NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Putin tried to influence the election, that's fair game as far as I'm concerned. If Team Trump played a role in it, that's collusion and/or treason, and that's what this conspiracy theory is all about.

       There is a lot of DUMB shit in this subreddit. What's the big deal if I think that white supremacists use r/conspiracy to  push things like holocaust denial and stuff like that? Conspiracy is actually a really good way to spread propaganda.

       Really? That is the only motive you can come up with? Like nothing about sanctions, oil prices etc. (not that I claim this to be the true motives but surely an option)?

       Clinton talked about a no fly zone, that's hardly a WW(in fact the opposite). Nobody wants an actual war with Russia, Russia is already beaten in almost every way.

       Maybe you should look into their campaigns a little more, there is a reason every security firm attributes apt 28 &amp; 29 to Russian Intel and have for years, this isn't a new thing.

       I knew what he/she meant, but it appeared you did not, which is an odd position to be in when debating someone.  Especially if you are claiming he/she admitted something.  If you knew, too, why say they "admitted posting" when they clearly said they did not post?
