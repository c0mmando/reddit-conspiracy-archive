    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant.</p>

<p>But a tactic I&#39;m seeing right now is that the supporters of one specific side are saying &quot;you can&#39;t talk about policy because you don&#39;t KNOW.  because our guy hasn&#39;t done anything yet.&quot;  It&#39;s like they are lining up ducks before making any huge policy implementations.  </p>

<p>The thing that you really have to watch for is the Fabian method, which intentionally pushes the envelope too far with the expectation of being pushed back on (two steps forward, one step back approach).  And they use this as a distraction while quietly pushing another policy forward that won&#39;t be properly vetted by the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that phrases like &quot;smart government&quot; and &quot;talk policy not politics&quot; are brilliant persuasive tactics to get people thinking past the sale.  They both take the focus off of whether government activity in a particular area is appropriate in the first place and move the discussion to how that enforcement or funding framework should be implemented.</p>

<p>Whoever came up with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/barackobama/status/301519174574931971">this talking point</a> in particular especially deserves a raise.  Who doesn&#39;t want smarter government?  Who ever advocated increasing the size and scope of government activity while believing that it would be a dumb use of public resources?  Nevermind past government failures.  The unintended perverse incentives created by those policies are no longer an issue.  We have the complex puzzle of how people respond to new policies figured out now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who strongly disagrees with attempts to attach <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x00kq/this_literally_just_got_posted_on_4chan_and_call/deebjpc/?context=3">&quot;big government&quot; label</a> to progressive economic policies, I agree that &quot;policy, not politics&quot; could be a misdirection.</p>

<p>In this election season some of the most important issues were the corruption of out political process, so why would we want to stop talking about it?</p>

<p>DNC&#39;s collusion with Clinton&#39;s campaign? Let&#39;s forget about it and talk about who leaked what /s</p>

<p>I love to talk about policies when there are really meaningful options on the table, like what was in Bernie Sanders program.</p>

<p>But now that those options were taken away from us, you bet I want to talk about how that happened and who did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Focusing on what policies you want to support and forgetting about parties is a much healthier way to participate in politics. If the &quot;other side&quot; starts to supports what you support, don&#39;t stop supporting it and play into the partisan divide! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree.  The idea of left vs right wing, is completely fabricated to divide us.  A lot of people forget that politics is about finding the best solutions to problems its citizens have.</p>

<p>In reality both political parties are full of good and bad, it&#39;s not about which is the better, or the worse, but rather which politicians (aka representatives) will make the best decisions for us.  For this to be effective, one must value trustworthiness, capability and action; it&#39;s that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good idea.  </p>

<p>I also think that a good 1/3 of the conspiracy theories that are of real interest right now are WFT the parties, their ops and the games they are playing.  It could be a whole new genre of conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could discuss individual policies like healthcare, proper tax brackets for the elites, the failed war on drugs, the failed war on Iraq or any of the other anti middle and lower class and anti environmental policies the Republicans push if you&#39;d like??
