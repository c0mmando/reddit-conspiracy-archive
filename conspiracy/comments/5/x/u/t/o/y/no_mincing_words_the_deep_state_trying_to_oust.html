<p>I think most of us agree there is no such thing as &quot;independent investigations&quot; anymore. Who knows how many ways an investigation could be botched, hindered, altered, tampered, or misled. Either for or against him. Nobody on either side believes there is a &quot;neutral&quot; third party to look into this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump is outed, the Trump crowd will be sparked into civil war and it will end in an indeterminate amount of bloodshed and civil insurgency. </p>

<p>If Trump prosecutes Obama and Clinton and the public doesn&#39;t trust the investigation was independent, they will also cause bloodshed and civil insurgency as they will feel it is a coup. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m just saying that whatever way it goes, both camps are basically entrenched in their ideology and feel like the stakes are similar to life-and-death. For anti-Trumpers, this is mostly the media priming any aggressive move by Trump as fascism, while for Trump supporters it is the undercurrent of roiling anti-establishment hate that will make it feel like JFK all over again. </p>

<p>Both options, not good. Once trust is lost, violence is guaranteed as the result. This was set up just by letting the corruption go on this long. From time to time, the blood of patriots must water the tree of liberty, not independent investigations and their bureaucratic ink. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Never going to happen. If you want a civil war you need people to be really uncomfortable, like actually starving and dying or failing that, some kind of religious calling. No large number of people are stupid enough to throw their lives away because a President they like is no longer President. They might make some angry posts on social media about it.</p>

<p>People really are uncomfortable, and right-wing militias exist all over the country that have been waiting/preparing for a powderkeg moment like this. A lot of people in rural USA are preppers, they would consider this an all-out attack. </p>

<p>I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen over all of this government infighting but at the end of it Americans are still going to be well fed, sheltered and entertained. They&#39;ll be protests and angry social media posts and then everyone will go to bed like they always do.</p>

<p>How about on the off chance Trump gets impeached and is removed from office, if civil war starts then I&#39;ll give you reddit gold, and if the country remains at peace then you&#39;ll give me reddit gold. If Trump is never impeached then we both keep our gold. How&#39;s that sound?</p>

<p>The ones out in the woods have no reason to come to a protest. They don&#39;t give you any warning. They have no need to spread their views to other people that react violently and are members of the &quot;broken&quot; society they see. They are the /pol/ sort of guys, not just old timer suburban-ites. The republican has a big voter base and part of it is the &quot;new Tea Party&quot; which will not take no for an answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying 50% of the population will revolt, I&#39;m saying 1% might, and even that 1% is about 3 million people, let&#39;s say only a quarter of that is armed or prepared, they could still do an inordinate amount of damage to high-level political targets, the power grid, or other vital infrastructure. It REALLY doesn&#39;t need much to kick this sort of thing off once you throw democracy out the window by ousting an elected president for something his voter base was OK with and voted on based on his platform (cooperation with Putin). </p>

<p>No way I&#39;d ever pay a single cent for gold to the cretin that is Spez, but let&#39;s just hope nobody is impeached for the sake of stability!</p>

<p>That&#39;s 37% of the 24 million millennial voters. Or <strong>8,880,000</strong> people. Still more than enough to bring America to the brink of ruin and more than enough people to overthrow almost any individual government elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>Now take out the women. Because let&#39;s be honest, men are usually the ones revolting. If there&#39;s going to be a paramilitary group anywhere it will be almost exclusively men. </p>

<p>A rough estimate of Trump&#39;s female votes %: </p>

<p>Total election votes: 138,884,643
Of which about half are women: 69,442,322
Of which Trump got 41% (number is all women who voted for Trump): 28,471,352</p>

<p>28 million is 45% of 62 million(all Trump votes). So 45% of Trump&#39;s votes were from women.</p>

<p>Take 45% from 8,880,000 and you have <strong>4,884,000.</strong></p>

<p>Now lets take out those who are Obese (and bear in mind obesity is higher in places where Trump did well, like the South and Midwest)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/158351/obesity-nearly-age-groups-2008.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/158351/obesity-nearly-age-groups-2008.aspx</a></p>

<p>Roughly 20% for mid/early thirties and under. Take them out and you have <strong>3,907,200</strong> people. Now there&#39;s the number you proposed. The premise you presented assumes that every young, non-obese man who voted for Donald Trump rises up. I didn&#39;t account for the disabled, those in prison or jail, those abroad and those who changed their mind since the election but ignoring all that there is the scenario that has to happen to get your 3 million rebels number: Every young man who voted for Trump is so passionate that he goes and joins a militia.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. Zero Day is here. I didn&#39;t vote for the guy but I&#39;d put my life on the line to end the US deep state, it&#39;s the most negative influence on anyone&#39;s life in the world. Lots of other people could have changed their mind since the election. </p>

<p>Older voters are not the /pol/ crowd but they will still mobilize the same. Most militias are made up of older people, not super young ones. It&#39;s a variety, some of the older vets would certainly participate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not proposing that only young, able bodied, non-obese men will be fighting this war. It&#39;ll be women, older veterans, non-Republican voters who are tired of corruption, a variety that is too hard to pin down. It isn&#39;t as black-and-white as you are proposing. </p>

If the coup is successful, then this will continue, with opposing factions wrestling power from each other, totally circumventing the democratic election process.

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like a bumper sticker. Shaking things up! How about expecting rational well thought out policy and working for change. Also I have no idea why you assume he&#39;s shaking things up as he&#39;s surrounding himself with hardcore establishment partisans. I guess appointing the head of Exxon to be SOS Is a shakeup but rational people would see the truth behind such appointments. You are easily swayed by slogans and bumper sticker politics, unfortunately sound policy is nuanced and complicated and doesn&#39;t lend itself to slogans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly at a loss... I&#39;m having an internal mental struggle where on the one hand, I want to fight.  But on the other hand, I feel that those who haven&#39;t yet been able to see through the crap will never do so.  I&#39;m by no means a nihilist, but without mass public outrage against the crimes against humanity committed by those in whom humanity has unwittingly placed most power and trust, Trump is not going to make it.</p>

<p>This has been ongoing since before Trump was sworn in.  The paid protests, wiretapping / surveillance, leaks, and the repetitive media coverage of derogatory information and <em>outright lies</em> -- these are all connected.  As are the people behind it.  It takes so little critical thought to see this that it I simply can&#39;t understand how the majority of people aren&#39;t demanding Obama, the Clintons, the Podestas, Soros, Brock, and all the other kiddie-diddling, murderous, totalitarian cretins be dragged into court to answer for their crimes.</p>

<p>Every single government employee or contractor with any involvement in any action against Trump is, by definition, guilty of insubordination.  I was threatened with insubordination for insisting I would take leave to attend a free technical seminar -- how much more so should these criminals be brought to task?  If the general public just knew 1/10th of the true story... This hurts my heart for the country I&#39;ve served, and -- if there&#39;s no change -- concerns me greatly for the world my children will inherit.</p>

<p>Except he is the President of the United States and he lacks the ability to diplomatic. Like, you can see his Twitter that he is basically a child. But I guess its okay if he allegedly doesn&#39;t act like that in public. Okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on now, the election cycle should have told you that the buffoonery is a <em>show</em>.  He does this to let the media and his detractors step into traps that are plainly laid for them intentionally, or to get a topic he wants discussed into the public arena.  Just look at what is now being called Obamagate - turns out there&#39;s quite a bit of truth to his accusations.  The dude is incredibly smart.  Idiots don&#39;t become billionaires.</p>

<p>Again, that assumption simply doesn&#39;t match <em>reality</em>.  Trump has an <em>extremely</em> good rep as a boss to his employees and insiders that know him.  The idea that it&#39;s just another psyop or Deep State ploy to trick people into supporting a bastard should&#39;ve been dismissed the second he won the Presidency by accident.  Yes, he was not supposed to win.  The only reason he did was because white hats in the alphabet agencies revealed HRC&#39;s attempted electronic voting fraud (the same fraud she used on Bernie to steal 13 primaries from him, which was confirmed by a Stanford study) and stopped it cold.  Look into the works of ex-CIA Robert David Steele, he lays the whole thing out quite convincingly.</p>

<p>I have no political horse in this race whatsoever, I&#39;m center-left leaning and didn&#39;t even vote, whereas you have quite clearly showing that you seem to think Obama literally has done <em>nothing</em> wrong, a baffling concept.  I just think Trump is a potentially useful tool for the people to get what they want that we would never have had through Clinton or any of the other globalist mouthpieces.  He&#39;s clearly not a part of the DC establishment or the Deep State, and his independent wealth means that <em>he cannot be bought</em> which is incredibly important.  Trump bringing up these revelations about Obama and wiretapping/spying is serving to create a larger discourse on the nature of spying on the public in general, which is certainly a good thing.  People have seemingly forgot since the Snowden revelations that no matter what the government says, what they are doing is incredibly illegal and disregards constitutional law at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How is that not establishment? What about him is seen as &quot;good&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Point well-taken, and one I&#39;ve had plenty of time to mull over since my father first posed the same challenge to me when I voiced my support for Trump.  And the answer lies in what we define as &quot;the establishment.&quot;  Personally, and I am comfortable saying I speak for a majority of Trump supporters on this point, I don&#39;t define &quot;the establishment&quot; as those with a ton of money, but rather those with the desire and ability to abuse their authority to maintain some form of status-quo to the benefit of a select few -- including themselves -- and to the detriment of the vast majority.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve never claimed Trump to be the champion of the common man, or someone who&#39;s life is any worse (or better, honestly) than the powerful elite.  Trump is a man with serious faults.  Looking at his life through the limited scope of my perspective, there aren&#39;t very many redeeming qualities about the man.  His past is riddled with scandal, misogyny, racial discrimination, bullying behavior, and questionable ties to incredibly questionable people and circumstances.  I&#39;m not blind to his past relationship with Jeffry Upstein, allegations of rape, and endless list of sexual harassment lawsuits.</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump is not a saint, and he is not an example of rags-to-riches.  But serious introspection on this led me to the following justifications for giving him my vote, and for continuing to support him:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For all the bad stuff in his past, Trump doesn&#39;t seem to have a history of intentional deception.  Sure, he&#39;s made uninformed/ignorant comments, and he sometimes speaks when silence would serve him better, but when he <em>does</em> speak, what he says comes from what he believes to be true.</p></li>
<li><p>His enemies are my enemies.  I understand how all the democrats hate the man, but seeing all the neocons who <em>should</em> be supporting him instead <em>continuing</em> to attack him speaks volumes to me.  One way to see what a man is all about is to see who his enemies are, and his enemies share the common characteristic of being globalist, shady, power-hungry, narrative-controlling enemies of the American public.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is wealthy enough of his own accord to remain free of outside influence.  This is <em>absolutely critical</em>. </p></li>
<li><p>Everyone with a pulse has the ability to change.  And there is indeed good evidence that Trump accepted Christ in 2015.  I believe that you must keep theocracy and democracy separate for a democracy to function properly; however, a mind being renewed by faith in Christ is the kind of leader this country needs to keep it from completely devouring itself.</p></li>
<li><p>His stated political goals and values align very well with my own.  I want to see us less obligated to foreign powers.  I want to see our military reinvigorated.  I want less federal control.  I want a smaller federal government.  I&#39;m anti-baby-murdering / anti-abortion.  I support literal interpretation of the constitution.  I want corruption in the government to be rooted out and destroyed.  Etc, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is not Hillary.  Need I say more on that?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, no one can claim his sainthood.  We&#39;re not deceived into believing he&#39;s perfect, or that he wasn&#39;t more liberal in the past, or that he&#39;s free of scandal of any kind.  But with a country about to go down the crapper, we need a complete and total 180 from where the previous administrations were slowly guiding us.  And Trump was the best option presented.</p>

<p>He surely is not rags-to-riches, and I think one of my largest issues with him is that people seem to infer that because he has money he is somehow automatically qualified and they leave it at that. </p>

<p>His foreign policy experience also gives me cause for concern. However these are differences that I can deal with like I dealt with them in the past (Drone strikes, blech thanks Obama-- making people afraid of clear skies isnt a good idea imo)</p>

<p>Basically, I wanted to give him a little more slack early on, but I do wish that he would relax on the press. Although I must admit having a background in journalism makes me biased there. I can admit that. </p>

<p>He does take steps to do what he said was going to do for the most part. Obviously politics makes it difficult for him to push stuff through, but that&#39;s politics. </p>

<p>I do see that bias a lot. I don&#39;t really find it fair either because it is just used as a means to disrupt someone from sharing their opinion (duhhh you like Christ, you&#39;re clearly a moron!). That is total bullshit as long as the person isn&#39;t attempting to force their beliefs on someone else. I truly believe that we can make compromises and the majority of us can live together easily. I have known many religious folks that there was no problem getting along with, because there was mutual respect for each other as what we are deep down: people. </p>

<p>But both sides are guilty of being dicks. Humans are flawed.</p>

<p>Yeah man you can say that again. No one has a complete fix for anything and no politician is a savior. Much like I don&#39;t particularly enjoy Trump, I can totally understand how he would resonate with other people-- Some of the stuff he does concerns me, but I realized that there is an entire group of people who were probably just as equally concerned with Obama as I am with Trump. </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s my turn to watch with a bit of anxiety, but in the end I (want to) believe the majority of people don&#39;t want their fellow countrymen to suffer horrible things. People get called racist for supporting the travel ban or the deportation, but.. while I don&#39;t agree with those sentiments personally. They aren&#39;t &quot;wrong&quot; they are just different views, they&#39;re not saying &quot;deport people because I hate them&quot; as much as it is &quot;deport them because they aren&#39;t here illegally, idgaf if they are legal immigrants &quot;is reasonable.  Again, I don&#39;t feel that way, but if I am unable to accept that reasoning and just call people racist or whatever, am I really any better than the people I am calling racist?</p>

<p>Probably not. </p>

<p>It is easy to make broad assumptions and paint people with a wide brush, it&#39;s harder to see other people are people and their upbringing/life experiences/whatever could have had a profound effect on how they see the world. </p>

<p>I concur with that. I also believe we shouldn&#39;t dehumanize the &quot;other side&quot;. Which I can admit I am guilty of doing, but I realize it is not really a way to make any headway with anyone. If people don&#39;t want to have a conversation, that is their problem. Move on to someone who will and gain knowledge about all views from every side. </p>

<p>Apathy and not caring will probably be the downfall of the US in the end. It is better to attempt to reach common ground.</p>

<p>So very true, regardless of race, creed, religion, philosophy, affiliation, nationality, gender, etc, etc.  With all the division in the world today, all the polarity and &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality, we all share the core blessings and curses of what it means to be human.</p>

<p>I should really get out and talk to more actual people about their politics.  I keep that topic at bay, so the only time I ever hear it discussed is in the context of news and/or radio, where its easy to get the impression that all liberals are hell-bent on destroying the country through civil war to prevent Trump from cleaning house, or that all conservatives are nationalist bigots who will stop at nothing to make America white again.  I know neither case is true, but as a conservative, I have anxiety about the former.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right -- I perceived Obama&#39;s administration to be very damaging to this country in so many ways, and the only thing I could do was look forward to the time when someone else would be in office.  I relied on the American system, which allows for a bloodless revolution every 4-8 years.</p>

<p>That said, I do know that there <em>are</em> those who are actively promoting a civil war against Trump, and I wish they would just hold tight for a term or two like we did with Obama.  Why do they feel the need to threaten democracy for the sake of what they believe to be a violation of democracy?  I know you don&#39;t have those answers, nor do you feel as misguided as to think that would be productive.  But that reaction to Trump is also part of informs my support of him.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Alas, my friend, I&#39;m afraid apathy has already brought us close to the end.  We&#39;ve been apathetic for the past 20 years as the federal government hoarded more and more power, as we spent ourselves further and further into debt, as massive corporations cheated and scammed us into oblivion, as we lost our homes and our jobs for the sake of banks &quot;too big to fail,&quot; and as biased media and political correctness shamed and silenced anyone who actually tried to voice an opinion contrary to any of it.</p>

<p>Apathy has been the vehicle by which we&#39;ve been driven to the point where labels like &quot;homophobe,&quot; &quot;bigot,&quot; and &quot;islamaphobe&quot; are effective weapons.  Where ideas like securing the borders, applying Constitutional law, and putting America first is considered un-American.  Where play-dough therapy and cry-ins are reasonable treatments for anxiety people get when a man they don&#39;t like is democratically elected as President under the original guidelines of the founding fathers.  Where people are more interested in investigating why Richard Simmons hasn&#39;t left his house in a while than investigating mass child graves, untimely deaths and disappearances of everyone investigating child-trafficking circles among the elite, or why their own government feels the need to remotely enable their webcams and microphones.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guilty of apathy, too.  It&#39;s so much easier to assume everyone operates in good faith, and to assume my comforts and way of life will continue indefinitely.  But this simply isn&#39;t true -- at least not so long as things continue as they have been.</p>

<p>Thanks for being a voice of reason for the opposing view.  It&#39;s refreshing, and gives me encouragement that perhaps we&#39;ll get out of this glut eventually.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen Trump is genuinely at odds with globalism/multinational trade deals, open boarders, over reaching federal power, and government corruption is at least given lip service. Why are you shouting him down like he&#39;s a Bush/Clinton/Obama? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is true that trump is not our friend. but he will be able to do less real damage than any president since carter, since he is opposed by all of the the alphabet agencies, the entire establishment on both sides of the aisle, and at least 1/2 of the population.</p>

<p>he&#39;s much less dangerous than were cheney and rumsfeld. they almost ended the world in 1983, and then got to come back in 2000 and try again. cheney, while veep, shot his friend in the face and didn&#39;t give 2 fucks about it. could you imagine what would happen if trump shot someone in the face with birdshot?</p>

<p>not to mention that trump would  have to work like a dog night and day to rival kissenger for war crimes.</p>

<p>plus obama used up pretty much all of the countries that are not protected by reciprocal aid treaties for bombing. even most of the one&#39;s left in africa are protected by china, strangely enough. iran, china, russia, and north korea all have reciprocal aid treaties with each other. if he is putin&#39;s stooge, ain&#39;t no way we&#39;re attacking iran or china</p>

<p>the CIA and its evil brethren are on the verge of revealing to the world that they are now completely ungovernable while they at the same time govern all. how do we fight the CIA? </p>

<p>we&#39;ll survive the asshat, we won&#39;t survive the CIA. trump is a vanila flavored softserve cone evil, the CIA is an exploding nuclear banana split evil where all the fruit toppings are chopped up childrens&#39; pineal glands and fermented semen.</p>

<p>trumpophobia is so powerful it even killed godwin&#39;s law.</p>

<p>Well, the Deep State has been subverting the constitution for at least 100 years. But I read the Wikipedia article on sedition, particularly the part about the United States, and there&#39;s nothing in there about the Deep State&#39;s ongoing seditious acts against the constitutionally-defined government. Not one word.</p>
