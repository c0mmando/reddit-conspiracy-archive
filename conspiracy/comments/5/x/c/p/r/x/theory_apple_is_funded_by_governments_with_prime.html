       Apple is an excellent brand, but they are the only phones (and some of the only laptops) whose battery cannot be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All cell phones are tracking devices that provide metadata such as location, even when turned off.  Battery must be removed when not in use, or you are broadcasting.

       I agree with OP's theory.

       First they got everyone to give them about 5 thumbprint scans per each thumb for convenience sake.

       Now they're removing that button so you can unlock your phone with iris and retina scanning.

       And they're adding "three modules" to the cameras so they can take 3d images of your face.

       The article mentions many forms of authentication as possibilities not because Apple is doing them or thought to be doing them, but because they exist.

       I think that's possible.  Another way of looking at it is that they were manufacturing consent in the mass consciousness for unlimited surveillance.  tptb think that if they communicate what they are doing, even if through what most of would regard as "hidden" symbols, signs, etc then they relieve themselves of the bad karma for their misdeeds.   Just a thought....

       Jobs was woke af. He did LSD and was a proponent of it, spoke to sherpas, and was all around in favor of expansion of consciousness.

       Pretty sure he was seen as an obstacle, and given the pancreatic cancer black bag treatment.

       I don't understand the whole spying thing.  Why doesn't Trump and McCain and every other Freedom Loving Government Worker simply SPY on the Terrorists of Al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS, also known as Islamic State)?  Do they use Android phones only?  Cusotimezed home screens?

       I don't have the link but here's a fun conspiracy for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple was started as a partnership between the CIA and the British MI5. Apple was originally ... Apple Records, the Beatle's record company and a company that invested in high tech electronics (for the time.) The Beatles were just a cover for the real intel work being done.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there was a big fight between CIA and MI6, and the partnership broke up. Steve Jobs kept the Apple name - and no matter how many times the Beatles sued Jobs to get the name back, the US judges just said "fuck you limeys."
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is history.

       Android has a larger market share than iOS and supports more platforms. Wouldn't it make sense to include Android as well? I know Android is open source, but OEMs can add closed source applications and additions to their devices.

       I guess so, but let's assume it's USA and UK who want to spy on us. If they are using Apple to do it then it is already a vast number of citizens they can get info on. Do they need to involve an Asian company like Samsung for example? Seems like it's a USA/UK thing hence it's limited to Apple products for now. Maybe if Korea decide to spy on their citizens they will do the same with Samsung phones.

       Interesting. The theory I built up about this was that the government could already hack the phones. The issue that they ran into was that they would have to brute force it. You can brute force the phone by creating multiple copies of the hard drive and having people try various combinations. Even with the 4 pin code it really isn't completely brute force safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the intended to do was set a precedent in court to make it so that Apple would unlock anything for them.

       I don't think they need to hack anything. I in visage a huge Apple database the government can access that stores everything you do on your phone, photos, texts, where you've been that day. If the government ever want info on you they type your name in and the city/town you live in, match a photo they have of you to the ones you have stored on your phone so they know it's the right person and that's it. They can then figure out your whole life.
The refusing to unlock phone thing was just another lie to make you think your stuff is safe on your iphone.

       It's completely possible, but I have yet to see evidence to support this. Snowden definitely showed that some of our wilder theories can definitely prove to be true. Doesn't XKeyscore do something similar.

       Maybe Jobs refused to use his technology to spy on citizens and was taken out of the picture by the powers that be. Apple have had pretty much no innovation since he died, apart from a front facing camera and thumbprint scanner.

       I got in an argument about this with two IT guys last year. I swear Snowden said they could already do this with system called SMURFS or something like that. His revelation came out before the San Bernadino iPhone thing and I believe that the whole drama between Apple and the FBI was completely staged. No electronic communication is 100% secure. 60 Minutes had a segment about TPTB eavesdropping on everything in the late 90s. They probably created the whole fucking internet for this very purpose.

       100% agree. I don't think any American company would refuse to help the government if they did genuinely ask them to.
