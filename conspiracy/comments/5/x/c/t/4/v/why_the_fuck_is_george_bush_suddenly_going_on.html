       This has nothing to do with the Mandella effect. The Mandella effect is when people have different conceptions about factual history. This is revisionism. "Bush isn't that bad anymore because what we have is worse" is the narrative the media is trying to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mandella effect would be people believing Bush invaded Iraq because they had nuclear weapons.

       It sounds like you've gone deeper than I have. Right now I'm focused on the order, but it has become apparent that they either compete with other secret entities or they are all compartments of a larger organization. Can you through me some direction on linking them to other orgs? The strongest I know is the Wundt influence and his connection to the Bavarian illuminati. Again, i'm not an expert and have only begun on one tentacle.

       All of them have a same theme and that Time waits for no one.... It's a way of saying there is no heven or hell your happiness is here on earth in the now. Live in the now experience evrithng don't let others take what is yours. The means justify the ends.. There is more to the rites that elaborate on this keep digging you will find the connectios .

        the order of skull and bones goes back to the Templars

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Skull and Bones is also referred to as 322.
      </p>
      <p>
       322 represents the 322nd lodge of an unknown Germanic organization. That unknown Germanic organization is most likely the Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       like the Templars because they plagiarized. Adam Weishaupt, who created the Illuminati, stole most of his Illuminati references from Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Mormonism also looks like Freemasonry. Joseph Smith stole parts of Freemasonry for his own religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why Ordo Templi Orientis looks like Freemasonry, as Aleister Crowley was a Freemason before starting his own organization.

       It's been well-documented that people joined Freemasonry, left, and then started their own group. They took plenty of Freemason concept with them, but ultimately their groups aren't Freemasonry.

       The Freemasonry members who left to create their own separate orders were low-level Masons. They didn't have all the knowledge (a majority of which is oral), so their orders will always never be the same.

       OSB was a conception made to absorb American establishment. In terms of origins it is definitely an offshoot from the Nazi's. In fact the Nazi's seeded a great many industries in the US and are likely for the unseen corporation states which have consolidated most enterprises, including the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       It terms of Nazi seeding its pretty much throughout American establishment. The most blatant I think is Von Braun, an actual SS Nazi party member who was the first man to head the American space program, NASA. No surprises there given the World establishment is quite fickle about technological control.

       Skull and Bones goes back to the 1800s. Its members were responsible for bankrolling in the Nazis before WWII. Both groups followed a philosophical view that the people belong to the state. That an individuals goal should not be for himself but for the state. That is why members of skull and bones funded the rise of the Bolsheviks and the Nazi. Both ideas follow a Hegelian world view that the state is gods march across the earth.

       Skull and Bones seeded german industry before WWII an example is standard oil providing hitler with the means to make aviation fuel independently. There are a lot of different examples.

       I'm kind of torn on this one. My gut tells me he is controlled opposition. But if you look at how hard they are trying to bring him down it make you think he is the enemy of the system. They are throwing every trick they have at him and it hasn't worked. Had he been a career politician he would have crumbled under the "scandals" but it seems to be doing the opposite for him.

       He's a Russian puppet who probably brought some loyal GOP politicians into the Russian oligarchy fold. I gotta say, as a conspiracy sub, it's pretty disappointing. It's like going to a science sub and finding out they're discussing alchemy.

       You're talking about news coverage. Different left/right of center corporations competing for profit. That doesn't change the fact that our culture has become more socially liberal. Sanders was ultimately seen as an ally of the Democrats even though he was an independent and continues to be. Sanders wasn't blinded by the Republican smear job, even though I'm sure Hillary wasn't his ideal type of politician.

       Lol a shill. Everyone who doesn't buy into the populist anti-establishment bullshit is a shill. Here's some more shilling: the only thing trump is good at is flamboyant marketing and he fleeced a bunch of suckers into thinking he's some kind outsider who's gonna drain the swamp. And Bernie shot himself in the foot with his populist rhetoric, and ruined his chance of pushing his agenda by unknowingly sabotaging Hilary.

       I thought the Wikileaks exposed the fact that the Clintons coerced their friend Trump into running, and basically called in media favors to have them prop him as well as Carson and Cruz up in the primaries so she would have an easy opponent. They were pleased as punch that somehow Trump won, and then it kind of got away from them. I feel Trump was probably so amazed that he won, that he is now carried away with it, and basically going off their script...that's why they are actively trying to destroy him...I mean, he is doing a good enough job at that himself, but removing him in favor of Pence seems like it will eventually be top priority for both parties.

       That's my fear is that he is actual controlled opposition. My hope is that he is not. However, I do believe what ever the case is he is being used as managed opposition. I think many of his plans are antithetical to the plans for a NWO. That being said, with the way they are demonizing him, if he fails they (The PTHB, through MSM) will associate every anti NWO plan or policy with Trump. By destroying him and demonizing him they will also demonize and destroy any future anti NWO agendas.

      </p>
      <p>
       If, as you believe, he is in fact controlled opposition, then why do they permit him to carry out some of the policies he has. I believe the answer to that is because they want all of those policies to be discredited by him and never taken seriously in the eyes of the public again.

       This. Bush crime family. It's long suspected that bush senior was involved in killing JFK and Nancy Reagan believed that the bush family tried to have rondald assassinated. They almost succeeded. Then you have George bush senior going in front of the UN spouting off "new world order" policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I need to even go into how evil bush jr and Cheney are? They literally lit the Middle East on fire starting wars so the globalists can fuck up every country over there and rape their resources. Now they're flooding Europe with "refugees" or rapeugees. The bush family is one of three shadow government factions that rule this planet. They all report to the aristocratic families like rothchilds and do the bidding of people like Kissinger. The bush' family is a crime family .

       You're absolutely right. I would just say that one of the issues is, is that so many people view the Bush's as acting on behalf of their family or their own interests. I believe that their motivations come from their ties to secret societies, such as, the Skull and Bones. Many people forget that John Kerry was also a member of that group. In the Bush V Kerry election we would have been fucked no matter what. John Kerry was a bonesmen who went on to be Sec of State for Obama and shouldn't be overlooked as an individual who towed the line for war and destruction in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steven Munchin (I think that's how you spell it) Trumps sec of treasury is also a member.

       You are absolutely right too. The bush family implements the wishes of the globalists more specially members of secret societies like skull and bones which is why people like John Kerry are selected and placed in positions of power. They profit by implementing the globalist agenda. Look at the past few elections...either way we lose. With the exception of trump all the past presidential candidates have been controlled. Obama McCain. Obama Romney. Bush jr gore. Clinton dole. And look who they just tried to install Hillary Clinton...the ultimate puppet. You nailed it. The people at the top are all in a club and as George Carlin once said...you aint in it!

       Exactly, I think the PTHB have remained insulated from the people for so long they completely underestimated peoples tolerance for BS. The internet was a Pandora's box. They thought the could control narratives and build social profiles for everyone but then things like WikiLeaks happened as well as places like this. People using the internet to think, you know, could be bad for business.

       Right. Which is why they are always trying to control the internet. They've setup systems of controls which monitor everything we do online, monitor our every thoughts and desires because of what we type into google and post on Facebook. They believe they can dominate us forever but there is one thing they can't control. Free will. They can't stop us from thinking for ourselves. To the ruling class, a well informed population doesn't help them in any way. In fact it hurts their efforts to try to control and manipulate things like public opinion, stock markets, social  behaviors and just about every other aspect of our daily lives that they want to dominate. Just like the Magna Carta set forth freedom, and the US Revolution gave us independence from tyranny, we will reject their attempts of control and that is what scares them the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing is, the more they try to tighten the noose, the more they are exposed and the more we will reject it. There are some of us who won't go willingly into the box cars. It's time we stood up and fought back with the power of the internet. I been in this fight for a long long time. My username checks out.

       So you legitimately believe that trump isn't manipulated lol. You had a lot of fair points until that very moment. He's not your knight in shining armor, he is the exact same thing but instead of pretty wrapping paper it is glitter duct tape. He has neo cons on his cabinet, he has Munchin, he is probably indebted to Russia in god knows what way -- he is controlled just as much as the rest of them.

       Trump isn't controlled like the rest of them at least not yet. That is why they are fighting him so hard on every front. If he was owned they'd have him doing what he wants. Can't say much for the neo cons in his cabinet but I do know that his weasel Preibus has been stacking the cabinet with his people and not necessarily people good for Trump. Munchin?

       He's been pushing a classic neo con agenda but masking it as a nationalist agenda. Increase military spending, border control, tax breaks for corporations -- all focal points of neo cons. Mnuchin** is part of skull and bones society and is part of his cabinet. Carter Page, Manafort, Flynn and now Sessions have all had repeated contact with Russia. He is 100% bought and controlled, maybe not by your typical puppeteers but at this point who gives a fuck? They may not be Americans pulling the strings but every day it seems like Russia just may be.

       I still don't know why this wasn't made more of an issue during Bush/Kerry election...it was literally voting for the same fucking guy. Both were "made" politicians...went to the same school, and were in the same secret society at basically the same fucking time...at least Obama had the illusion of not being part of this machine...

       I think it goes to show how deep the tentacles go. People are outraged about media collusion now but that shit's been going on forever. They buried the story, there was only one guy who ever asked about it and their response were disturbing. They laughed it off.

       Same reason we're not going to hear much directly from Obama for a while.  They keep the guy going out quiet while the guy coming in dismantles his system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure it works like this so that the old president can't mount a counter-campaign against the new president.  The old presidently shouldn't be out talking shit, because it would cause his loyal followers to suck at his teat and could cause issues and further divide the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure, now Trump's in, so Bush can run his mouth about stuff in a chill capacity.  He's gone away for a while, and now when he comes back, people are more relaxed.

       But Obama is clearly doing exacly that. Staying in DC to distrupt the current administration. He's not even being subtle about it... Eric Holder confirmed it proudly for fuck's sake! I agree though, from what I've seen of the refent Dubleyuh interviews, he's actually been moderately fair to Trump.

       Exactly.  And I haven't seen anybody worshipping what he did as president, but more they understand what made him so electable in the first place.  The whole, "someone you could have a beer with".

       I've been asking you to source your argument...because you stated it very matter-of-factly and I'm interested to know more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of just citing where you're getting your knowledge (like a normal person who is confident in their opinion) you've chosen to tell me to Google it. Twice. And then you decided to be smug and link to Let Me Google That For You.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the one throwing around some pretty serious accusations, and that means that the burden of proof is on you. Based on your citations thus far, you appear to be basing your ideas on 5.1 million search results...which effectively implies the same thing as when Sarah Palin claimed to read all of the newspapers.

       It's not an accusation I read about it in his autobiography. It's not a conspiracy theory it's his actual life as admitted by him. That's why I'm not entertaining you, it's public knowledge. The answer is in the link I sent you if you actually looked. Jesus what a moron.

       From the get go, all I've been asking from you is for you to cite your sources. What's so difficult about that? If he straight up admitted this in his autobiography, you would have immediately pointed out where in that book it could be found. That would have easily precluded any kind of dispute from anyone. But
       <strong>
        you can't even provide the book you claim to have this "public knowledge".
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So far you've directed me to a search engine and then (after I pointed out how ludicrous it is that you're trying to cite over five million sources) you devolved to just calling me names and trying to be demeaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had a single iota of proof, you would have provided it by now.

       It's public knowledge as in it's not hard to find. If it was some obscure fact I could understand but it's not, it's information that is readily available. You're either too lazy or too dumb so either way I couldn't care less.

       Considering how, by now, you could have easily told me the title of the autobiography with that admission so that I could educate myself with this easily accessible public knowledge, but haven't...the odds are that you're making shit up.

       It's in the link, it's actually right there in front of your face when you click it. George W Bush worked as executioner and chief, how is this so difficult for you? I've provided you with the means. Educate yourself, ask yourself this, I you want to find out information do you look it up yourself or ask a stranger to do it for you? You could have read his life story by now. I do not facilitate this kind of lazy mentality.

       My favourite tarot card. But not applicable here. The point of the fool is he takes in the beauty and wonder of his surroundings whilst ignoring the dog biting at his ankles which is trying to warn him if his peril. I don't see how it goes with this topic at all other then dubya was a pretend fool.

       So is it an enemy of my enemy is my friend situation?  Serious question.  Because Trump is attacked by both sides of the isle, and has been ever since he decided to run.  Perhaps that's all for show, but as someone in the middle I'm trying to understand what's going on in the quote-unquote liberal heads.

       The reality is that the elites will allow people to play the 'liberal vs. conservative' game as long as it keeps them docile, divided, and manipulated.

       Once the deep state begins to reveal itself (as we're seeing now), the labels are no longer useful (if they ever really were to begin with).

       been a tool to maintain docility and division in the past.  I'm starting to see something much worse lately.  I think there is a cold-civil war brewing.  They will escalate the division in a last ditch effort to maintain their concealment.

       Nah, they are stronger than ever. Don't kid yourself. I used to think the same thing a long time ago and realized that only looking at conspiracy shit you get the confirmation bias echo chamber. Middle America is still blindly duped as ever before.

       For the most part, Joe and Jane do not follow what's going on around the world beyond what pops up on Facebook or on the notification bar on their smart phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might not even tolerate political discussion on FB because it adds more stress to their already stressful day at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll passively glance over headlines or switch the TV on to Network news when they want to feel "informed".
      </p>
      <p>
       It was decided long ago which side of the political spectrum Joe and Jane fell on. Perhaps their father or mother watched Fox News and expressed their disdain for Democrat agendas? Maybe they come from immigrant families who's families were uninformed when it came to American politics; consequently, they gravitated towards liberal views because those around them claimed Republicans were racist and didn't embrace minorities?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's just a perpetual cycle that goes uncontested. An information bubble that people willfully create around themselves. They'll accept the narrative their side pushes as long as it doesn't create cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, Joe and Jane will go out into the world with unhealthy political views that for the most part serve to drive division between the populace.

       I agree with a lot of the Trump folks on none "liberal" issues. For instance I believe in universal healthcare but we'll never have it with a massive illegal immigration problem which we currently have. Putting America ahead of the world should be job of the President. Not globalism and corporate fascism we've been experiencing. The right to bare arms etc.

       We do have a what appears to be a demographics problem for some.  What those on the left don't realize, or don't respect, is that it's not necessarily a fear of immigrants (legal or otherwise) that the right wingers have, the fear is a loss of sovereignty, a loss of freedom-of-association, a loss of standard of living, loss of culture, traditions, and probably most importantly: a loss of social trust.   We've already observed these effects first hand and how they've transformed the US from the 60s til now, and there is absolutely an argument to be made that much of it's due to demographic transformation.   Elites and communistically minded people who see the masses as nothing more than mindless consumers, marketing indicators, in their strip-mall worldview, don't care about any of those things - they seek to deconstruct culture unless it's consumerist, along with destroying religion, tradition, and the social cohesion those things have brought, because it threatens their control and power.  The only gods you need to worship are the almighty dollar and the myth of equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, if the US became (in the long term), a 90% Mexican country, how different would it be from what Mexican people built in Mexico? How different would it be from the cultures and governments of much of South and Central America, especially if the government is changed through democracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, it's the people that make a country, not its laws, not its land.  Why not respect that?

       The US has always had people that feel that way.  80 years ago it was the damn Germans, then the Italians, then god help us the Irish and Asians.  Mexicans have been with us longer than most groups.  Nobody can take us over and turn us into a different country.  By the time they've been here for a few generations they are native Americans and will be bitching about whatever new group is moving in.

       I'm not going to debate about the percentage of illegal immigrates uses public services. The biggest problem with talking about this issue is racists and bigots have distorted and misused the facts leading to the mistrust of creditable sources.

       No, you are allowed to hate them both, you are allowed to hate one individual without your feelings about someone else effected, Trump and Bush Jr. do not
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to have reputations depending on each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take me, for instance. I can't stand Trump and I absolutely despise Bush Jr. I want him in prison. Now that Bush Jr. is making appearances and appealing to my negative feelings for Trump, you know what this has done to my feelings for Bush Jr.?
      </p>
      <p>
       This publicity has reminded me of his existence and keeps this criminal in the front of my mind. Im reminded how much of a piece of shit he is, as opposed to him laying low and drifting into obscurity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I forgive Bush Jr. for the wrongs he has done. I have to forgive him. He's merely human, and as a human myself I feel we all should forgive each other for the bad decisions, mistakes, and wrongs we choose to do. Forgiveness is the key to moving on, the key to approaching happiness within. But...
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean I don't want to see Bush Jr. locked up. I forgive him for what he did regarding 9/11 and many other ill deeds, however he still needs to face his retribution. Everyone is allowed to make mistakes, you just have to face the consequences. Every action has a reaction. If your action is killing hundreds (thousands?) of your own American citizens while also hamstringing the future generations.... well, then your consequences, your retribution will not be pretty.

       No it's not dude, it's an attempt to polish his image, so people think highly of him. They do this to all presidents. They give them a library, "paint" them in a positive image (pun intended, W is supposedly a sensitive painter in his spare time), and just generally try to make you look at them in a positive light, to forget about the horrible war crimes they've committed.

       The GOP hates Trump because he is not one of them and he's ruining the "Jeb Strategy" of turning America from an Anglo nation to a Latino nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure Bush "fears" Trump so much. No, Trump isn't going to do anything about 9/11 for instance. But Trump likely has the goods on Bush Jr. the way Clinton had the goods on Bush Sr.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they are most certainly rivals. The Bush family basically is the GOP establishment - Romney for instance is a Bush family loyalist. Trump is not the GOP establishment, he has his own network.

       So they have this rivalry. But at the same time, a lot of Critical Thinkers / Citizen Investigators are backing Trump's presidency, for whatever reason. The Bushes see who is surrounding Trump and giving him support, and may worry that they will be influential enough to kick off an American Spring.

       There are some reasons to support Trump. Best chance to stop the mass immigration. I doubt he'll start a war with Russia (Clinton almost certainly would have.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump's not going to be prosecuting any corruption or taking down any pedo rings or investigating 9/11 or anything like that.

       The Bushes Clintons and Obama all have more common goals and a vested interest in the current party structure than trump and far more than the average American.  They are in an elite club together.  They don't like the new member.  It may be just personal dislike though.

       That is a good question.  The Bush family are trillionaires.  Perhaps they are trying to regain control of the narrative before everything they have stolen is stolen back.

       What I am alluding to is the Anderson Trust.  It was set up with $1.2 T in 1946 with precious metals captured from the Japanese.  The money should have ended up in the US Treasury, but it ended up with private banking instead.  I am willing they did not pay taxes on it, either.  The CIA was started in 1947 with money from this trust.

       He's making a derogatory statement based on nothing other than their looks alone. So it's actually on par with racist remarks. There are no universal racist terms for whites people, but keep thinking these types of insults aren't a substitute for that.

       Americans are generally very, very stupid people.  They don't care about history, won't take the time to read important things about our world, and are easily persuaded to care about pop culture, sports and celebrities instead.  I gave up all hope a few years ago.  It would take the younger generation realizing how screwed they are to change things, and they are too manipulated to care.

       Why? Because it's the moment to whitewash everyone via comparing him/her to Trump. To aggrandize His Orange Highness' stupid acts and decisions and minimize and plain blot out from collective memory others' past and current crimes. Oh that shitty Trump, closing the border and treating humans as cattle... while those that manufactured the crises and stoked the popular revolts and backed the coups that brought down Libya and attacked Syria, causing a wave of refugees to wash all over the world, ah, those are sanctified, considered heroes,

       All of the people suddenly acting like W. wasn't so bad just to try and make Trump look worse by comparison are pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly Bush was just so statesman-like, has a real big heart, and really meant well but just had bad advisors leading him astray.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the fucking President, not some 17 year old getting wrapped up in a street gang. The wars and all the cronyism and tax cuts for the rich and just general incompetence were on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dislike Trump as much as anyone and wouldn't be surprised if he managed to fuck things up even worse than W. given 8 years, but he hasn't done nearly as much harm yet. Bush has a long record of being a sack of shit at this point, but suddenly a bunch of "liberals" on reddit want to act like it's 2000 and he's just the goofy guy you want to have a beer with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relatedly, about the only thing I like about Trump was during the primaries when he just shit all over the Bush family legacy.

       Trump is entirely serious about the solutions to the problems he made up. He's going to do them if they are a big problem or not.

       He's got a lot of good ideas. He just has so many more bad ones.

       People are defending Trump because "oh look a president that's doing what he said he'd do" when his first orders came out.

       THIS.  Obama was everything against what he said he was for.  He was a big upraised middle finger to the honest activists against peace and surveillance.  Obama was the globalists saying to the left's activist base, "You dance on our string!  You attack our opponents, and we don't even have to pursue your agenda!  We just have to pretend for a few months in the election!"

       This, right here, is why I rage at liberals these days (17 years ago, I thought of myself on the so-called political left largely
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of this scumbag). And I already know the GOP is 100% captured by Neocon lunatics, but liberals try to tell me that the DNC isn't...the evidence says otherwise. They're mostly just too ignorant, naive, or flat out dishonest to say what kind of ideology they're endorsing.

       I don't like it either, but one thing to consider is that audiences in talk shows are only cheering because of a person that gets the crowd in high spirits. Anyways, even that tactic is shitty, but showbiz.

       Holy fuck you're a moron. She was in that car crash in 1963 when she was 17. She didn't meet George Bush until 1977.

       In no situation is a car accident murder. In order for it to be murder it would have to not be an accident. Car accident =/= murder. It was in the 60s, when she was 17 years old, and well before she ever met G. W. Bush. Your fundamental lack of understanding about the situation is alarming since you seem to have taken a strong stance based off of misinformation.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
       </p>
       <p>
        And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

       Since trump started to run you can literally track how much more positively people were posting about Bush, remember the trump inauguration? Bush was so cute and nice with his raincoat that Reddit has a nice circle jerk about the good old bush. This is the guy who literally killed thousands of Muslims but hes a cute old grandpa now apparently. This is not about his book, Bush has been working on his image lately because people are starting to forget what he is and what he did.

       He is doing this for his book. It's like...a totally normal thing for people to do when they have a new book out.

       I don't like him either, but his portraits are of veterans are very striking. There isn't much he can do anymore to make up for his actions but I do recognize he does seem to understand his responsibility.

       No I totally understand you and your complex thoughts. You see things in greyscale, and because George Bush is someone you'd like to get a beer with you can forget that he played a part in the tragedy that was and is the Iraq war. I get your point about 'inbetween' but did you ever stop to consider whats the halfway point on a scale that goes from -100000 and 100?

       What confusion. Hitler was a flaming genocidal scumbag.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Bush was responsible for the deaths of at least a million people, the aiming and displacement of millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler was an unapologetic fascist. GW Bush may have thought he was doing the fight thing, but was a small man faced with a great problem.

       I don't see confusion there. All I see are people saying "wow. Isn't that cool?" when they should be saying "That's nice. Fuck off."

       You seem confused that "complex people" can say good about Hitler. What? You thought that everyone in Germany thought he was a maniac that was off his rocker, and that no one thought he was doing some good for his country? I've got some bad news for you, buddy... It turns out that people are complex!

       The conspiracy is George Bush didn't paint those paintings. Seriously? I never once heard of him even picking up a paintbrush, and now all of a sudden he's the Martha-fucking Stewart of bullshit apocalypse paintings, making books on it and shit because obviously the president's horseshit perception of art is somehow worth the shit canvas he's shitting on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch them "donate" the painting valued at 30 million to some bullshit corrupt foundation for children peddling and pocket the tax deduction. God damn scam artists

       UK bloke here so maybe my experience isn't worth much. I've been seeming him everywhere recently and had no idea about his book of paintings.

       I thought that all of a sudden everyone on the left began to think he's super cool for being friends with a black woman.

       News have picked up what he's said about being president  (and used it as a negative against trump), without mentioning his books. If you actually saw the primary source of him talking youd know why he was saying it, but reddit/people who care about politics are not the target audience for those shows. And of course no one bothers to actually check sources either.

       A much better time would have been to do it during the election process if his goal was to undermine trump. In fact, he probably waited until the election was over to publish.

       I'm not saying he isn't. I'm just saying that is suspicious. And he's a Bush. And political dynasties are Machiavellian as fuck. It would be right up Bush's alley to do something like that. It's subtle and provides a convenient excuse. The thing you have to remember about government is that nothing is "just" anything. There's always a power play or a setting up of dominos happening.

       You can certainly make the argument he was not a great president, but if a politician is a two term president (and however many term governor) he hasn't really "failed" at politics.

       Lets just look at this objectively. Bush gets ample air time for his portrait book. So he comes in and does a bunch of interviews. The interviews consist of 10% talking about his paintings, and then 90% unrelated subjects like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How the media isn't the enemy
       </li>
       <li>
        Putin has always been a bad guy
       </li>
       <li>
        Concerned about Trump. Needs to be investigated
       </li>
       <li>
        He's somehow atoned because he paints now
       </li>
       <li>
        He's super duper friends with Michelle Obama now
       </li>
       <li>
        Loves black people
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Lets stop pretending the amount of exposure he's getting is about his paintings and not about other motives. Whether good or bad.

       That's the trick.....Bush being interviewed for his "legitimate" painting skill. (LOL as I type that)

       Yes. Bush has been planning this for years. The plan: learn to paint and publish a book. Get on talk shows. Use that to talk shit about Trump and undermine civic society. /s

       Honestly, I believe Trump to be mostly irrelevant in these 'hitpieces', I also believe him to be playing ball for the other side. Trump is a perfect scapegoat to push the Putin is bad media is good narrative.

       Yeah, pretty much every time I see a celebrity go onto a talk show, they spend about 10% of the time plugging their newest thing and 90% of the time talking and joking about other things. He's clearly trying to endear himself to a wider audience with all the newly centrist ideas. Even if he doesn't really hold the positions he's touting, I still see it as a way to boost his book sales.

       You're absolutely right about not needing to increase book sales for personal gain. Because the proceeds are going to help veterans, not into his pockets. The fact that he's out there plugging the book so hard is even more respectable knowing that fact. Not saying that makes him more respectable as a person, but this particular action is a respectable one.

       How is he rewriting history? He's not a historian. He is literally making history. His past doesn't go away. But that doesn't take away his future. I probably sound like a bush apologist but for the record I did not like his presidency at all. That being said I don't think what he's doing right now is out of the norm.

       This is how interviews work. The interviewer gives the interviewee a free plug. Except it's not. Because the interviewer gets to use a significant amount of time to ask other questions about the person. As I'm typing this I can't believe I have to explain this. This is literally the format for interviews.

       Lol the original argument was that a war criminal was profiting from his victims. You really need to think a bit. I can't believe people like you and whoever originally replied to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The topic is about George w bush selling a book of his paintings of soldiers; that a great number of them wouldn't exist, if not for him. Weather or not he's directly getting paid is not the point. He and his father, and many other American presidents are war criminals. The fact that he chose to do art of lives he was directly involved in destroying is beyond fucked up. And you people "defending" him need to reevaluate your morals.

       Even so. Don't you think that's like John Wayne gacy selling paintings of his victims for "charity"? It's fucked up. I can't believe people are defending this. This is why we can't have nice things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also. Show me some proof of him not profiting from it? Even if he's not directly profiting from "paintings of veterans"; that he helped create, it is promoting him as some sort of "awe what a nice guy".

       Agree, 100%. As a UK person, I remember the debates, protests etc before the war. As a 19yr old, I had a very black and white view of the world in that Saddam = Bad etc and was vocal in support. What has transpired is that Blair, at best, was conned and thought they were playing God, and at the worst, tied the UK into this through greed and power.

       Somewhat unrelated but I had the privilege to meet him last week at a book signing at MacDill AFB in Tampa. He's definitely not a reptilian like you all claim and he seemed perfectly nice in the conversation I had with him. I do believe that George Bush was simply a pawn under Cheney as he always seemed a bit... Clueless. Just my two cents, take it the way you like from a person who has actually met the man and doesn't claim to know him after reading a couple news articles.

       Yet he didn't help them with benefits or not sending them to a war we didn't want. Do you know how many if them have committed suicide because of his actions? But he will give them the proceeds of a book. He could give them 10x and feel nothing. This is propaganda to normalize the horrible politicians we get.

       I know everyone loves to joke about that, hell, even Bush was making fun of it on Kimmel the other day. But it was part of the agreement he made with allied nations for the invasion of Iraq. About a dozen countries wouldn't donate men, money, or material until they knew that the Iraqi army was no longer an effective fighting force. So the commander of CENTCOM, General Franks, recommended Bush to go on TV with the Mission Accomplished Banner and all that, so they could start Phase 3 of the operation, using more international money and local resources.

       Was kind of surprised they dusted that idiot off and now he's making the rounds. His presidency was a 8-year nightmare, and his credibility has been gone for some time. The whole thing is comical, but if he could fuck right off to whatever hole he slithered out of, that'd be great.

       I'm in no way advocating that Bush is by any means a "good or decent guy". 
He probably did more harm than we could ever know, and I fully agree that he has a special place in hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just commenting on the rhetoric that he delivers - put that next to Trump, he
       <strong>
        seems
       </strong>
       a likable guy.
      </p>

       I also think that Trump is a moron that has no spine and has his wheels turned by someone else. 
Bush definitely knew the evils he was perpetuating, Trump is just a moron with no knowledge or acknowledgement of the bad things that he is doing and will do.

       I think this will be their biggest blunder yet.  I was in esist and started to say how incredibe it was I was getting downvoted in a liberal sub for calling Bush essentially a monster.  Some people actually respond Ed saying the downvotes opened their eyes to this tactic.

       <p>
        Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother.

       You missed the title of the post, didn't you? Bush was the "enemy," he started the Iraq War, he began the process of tearing apart the Middle East, now he's a media darling and being applauded by the masses as he promotes a book of soldiers wounded in his folly.

       Think you missed the title if you're going to quote "enemy" and have it be nowhere in the title. Also the question is "why" is bush on television suddenly. The answer is he is promoting a book. He's a "media darling" in the sense that he is a former President so anything he does will be able to gain a sizable amount of press if they so desire. This isn't Orwellian simply because he is hitting the talk show circuit to promote a book where the profits are supposed to go to a non profit that helps veterans. There are things to get worked up about, this isn't one of them.

I'm saying that a sitting President parading a widow in front of the nation as political shield while saying crap like "[The Generals] lost Ryan" is such a fucking sign of cowardice. He claims to be for the troops, but can't acknowledge failures. It was his call, and it went badly.

       2) That wasn't within Obama's first month in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) This is the same public that we're claiming are mindless zombies who accept everything that is presented in media as Truth, right? If the "fake news" reports that the public likes a speech, did they really like it?

       We're at an extremely dangerous moment in our country's history. There are no more brakes on 24/7 propaganda and these Hillit/anti-Trumpers are willfully oblivious to what they're playing with. And through social media this ignorant mass has become weaponized by a handful of global oligarchs, banks, and multinationals to foment a coup (which is happening now thanks to Obama) or nuclear war. My advice is, do whatever you've always wanted to now, because it's going to get a whole lot worse

       Little do they know trump's supporters would hang both Bush and Obama. I prefer spilling the beans on 9/11 , and chucking the two &amp; their Administrations  into the NYC general prison population. The Prisoners would be so  angry over the truth they would produce a throne of bones .

       Bush is a Republican, but he's also a globalist. Obama spent 8 years publicly shitting all over him and his presidency (while also continuing many of his policies...), but Dubya said nothing. In fact, in interviews he slobbers all over Michelle Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet a month in to Trump's presidency, he's all over the media attacking him (despite being in the "same party" as the new president).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real dichotomy isn't Republican vs. Democrat. It's globalist/totalitarian vs. nationalist/libertarian. The masks have slipped off.

       You pairing two completely unrelated topics seems to suggest that you believe globalism and totalitarianism are synonymous and nationalism and libertarianism are equatable. If you acknowledge that they are unrelated, then you are being grossly misrepresentative of what each of these individual topics are simply for the sake of blowing Trump. Not surprising, but still worth mentioning.

       You're not very smart if you don't understand what a slash means in writing. Here is a definition to refresh your memory, or perhaps to inform you because clearly you have no idea how it is even used:

/slaSH/

      <p>
       <em>

       There's also a great deal of middle room between Nationalist and Nibertarian as well as globalist and totalitarians. A slash is used between things that are synonymous, e.g. you are an idoiot/moron.

       because the people are sedated by their admiration of mighty wizard of OZ, or any old dickface looming above the crowd with smoke and pyrotechnics, look at professonal wrestling and rock concerts.  also the same reason the majority of this kind of criminal are running around freely having a rapefest with world and we're standing knee-deep blood guts and waste applauding and crying like bitches aka idol worship

       The Democratic Party overwhelmingly voted in favor of the worst things that came out of the Bush years. PATRIOT, two wars, "enhanced interrogation" techniques, etc. Of course they brought Bush out of retirement to help them. They are trying to erode moderate Republican support as they gear up for the next election.

       Why the fuck is the previous Republican president no longer ashamed to show his face in public?  This Orwellian propoganda needs to start because former figureheads should never be allowed opinions.  A few triggering pictures and interviews and suddenly the alt-right forgef about Trump's promised on the campaign trail crimes against humanity.

       Why is it that you think he is to blame? Haven't we already arrived at the conclusion that a group of rich guys are running things? I can understand if you want to attack the things that happened during his tenure but the man himself cannot is more than likely not to blame. Same with Obama...Same with Trump.  Figureheads do have secondary psychological functions of course.

       I'm sorry if this makes me sound dumb but what makes me wonder is if maybe he's being coerced....well okay, blackmailed. I liked him back when he was president (granted, I was 8 when he started and 16 when he left) but is there something solid here that I never saw? I knew he wasn't a perfect president but this? I can't....I dunno....😔

       His administration fabricated evidence to illegally invade Iraq. That is not a question any more. That isn't even a conspiracy theory. It is fact at th9is point. People are just as hard on him as they should be. Maybe even too soft on him.

       I think what OP is saying is that there's a concerted effort to paint Bush in a positive light right now, even beyond the talk shows he's on. I've seen a bunch of memes humanizing him, with comments saying how Bush really wasn't that bad of a guy and how people would grab a beer with him and how he seems really genuine.

       Trump being even more of an idiot than him doesn't make Dubya cute. His blatant ignorance might have been endearing when he wasn't responsible for thousands and thousands of deaths. Even ISIS is mostly his fault.

       Donald Trump is just making it so easy to slam dunk on him. He's on the wrong side of virtually every issue so he's giving evil goons like George Bush an opportunity to improve their image just by taking a slightly less fascist stance on virtually anything.

       He seems to be speaking from the heart, not like a puppet. And he is trying to slow Trump so I am all for it. Maybe he's promoting his book but it doesn't seem like his primary role. I think he screwed us in the past but maybe he is with us now.

       Bush has PR people. They see that Agent Orange is more hated than pretty much anybody thought he would be, as an elected President. Perfect time to resurface and resist...to sell some shit and clean up his image.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of millennials were too young to really get what was going on during his presidency. It's history to them. A lot of older people never really learned about any of it, and they only view his failed presidency through the eyes of the economic downturn. One of the defining objectives of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars was that most people didn't have to think about it day to day, even when it was going badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are here on r/conspiracy because you believe that the government planned 9/11, Iraq was a trillions dollar handout to private companies, Afghanistan was about oil, Gitmo was just about being evil, the Bush admin had a direct propaganda line to Fox News, Dick Cheney was the actual president, etc....

       You got to understand the internet demographic. There are more commentors and social media consumers who have no idea or bleak remembrance what Bush did during his time. All they remember was Obama and his sweet pictures. This demographic does not go into details, just say it like they see it. Obama was a mess yet they call "the best Presidents" lol

       I dunno Obama and Bush are neck and neck in that race.  If the press had treated Obama like they treated Bush, not to mention Trump,  his administration would have been a joke.  Many legacy media outlets ran with the story that Obamas whitehouse was scandal free.

       They forget because they are stupid, even mindless.  It's that clear.  GWB is an insane idiot, and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are evil geniuses, and a few years aren't going to change that. But 95% of them are too stupid to realize that because they are flat-out idiots.

       This guy perputrated and covered up 9/11/01, shredded the constitution with the gestopo like patriot act and started wars that killed a million innocents. A war criminal and regular criminal who became president when his father and brother fixed the florida count and the supreme court. Really belongs on the gallows, worst person and one of the dumbest ever to be president. Arrest him!

       So you legitimately believe that trump isn't manipulated lol. You had a lot of fair points until that very moment. He's not your knight in shining armor, he is the exact same thing but instead of pretty wrapping paper it is glitter duct tape. He has neo cons on his cabinet, he has Munchin, he is probably indebted to Russia in god knows what way -- he is controlled just as much as the rest of them.

       I wouldn't agree with what Trump did, normally. But the fake news (that didn't make a peep when 33 servicemen, including 15 Navy seals,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Chinook_shootdown_in_Afghanistan">
        died under a single Obama approved operation
       </a>
       ) was going absolutely batshit over a molehill mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump fires back. And in this case, public response says he slam dunked it.

       He was executioner and chief. Literally the most simple Google search. And also if you know what you are talking about you already know this. Sorry I assume people's intelligence on a topic being discussed.

       My favourite tarot card. But not applicable here. The point of the fool is he takes in the beauty and wonder of his surroundings whilst ignoring the dog biting at his ankles which is trying to warn him if his peril. I don't see how it goes with this topic at all other then dubya was a pretend fool.
