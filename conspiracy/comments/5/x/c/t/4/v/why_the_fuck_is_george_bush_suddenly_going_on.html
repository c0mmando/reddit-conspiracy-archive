    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the order of skull and bones goes back to the Templars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. </p>

<p>The Skull and Bones is also referred to as 322. </p>

<p>322 represents the 322nd lodge of an unknown Germanic organization. That unknown Germanic organization is most likely the Illuminati. </p>

<p>They <em>seem</em> like the Templars because they plagiarized. Adam Weishaupt, who created the Illuminati, stole most of his Illuminati references from Freemasonry. </p>

<p>This is why Mormonism also looks like Freemasonry. Joseph Smith stole parts of Freemasonry for his own religion. </p>

<p>And why Ordo Templi Orientis looks like Freemasonry, as Aleister Crowley was a Freemason before starting his own organization. </p>

<p>Spiritually, not physically. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been well-documented that people joined Freemasonry, left, and then started their own group. They took plenty of Freemason concept with them, but ultimately their groups aren&#39;t Freemasonry. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire point of the bone and skulls metafor is that time does not wait for anybody your time is limited and you have take what you can. If you want proof of this just look at the piret flag.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re outing yourself as a bonesman (at which point I&#39;ll need proof so I can verify you), it&#39;s purely conjecture. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Study the Templars </p>

<p>I have, that&#39;s how I know Bonesmen aren&#39;t a part of the Freemasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OSB was a conception made to absorb American establishment. In terms of origins it is definitely an offshoot from the Nazi&#39;s. In fact the Nazi&#39;s seeded a great many industries in the US and are likely for the unseen corporation states which have consolidated most enterprises, including the US. </p>

<p>It terms of Nazi seeding its pretty much throughout American establishment. The most blatant I think is Von Braun, an actual SS Nazi party member who was the first man to head the American space program, NASA. No surprises there given the World establishment is quite fickle about technological control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skull and Bones goes back to the 1800s. Its members were responsible for bankrolling in the Nazis before WWII. Both groups followed a philosophical view that the people belong to the state. That an individuals goal should not be for himself but for the state. That is why members of skull and bones funded the rise of the Bolsheviks and the Nazi. Both ideas follow a Hegelian world view that the state is gods march across the earth. </p>

<p>Skull and Bones seeded german industry before WWII an example is standard oil providing hitler with the means to make aviation fuel independently. There are a lot of different examples.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol a shill. Everyone who doesn&#39;t buy into the populist anti-establishment bullshit is a shill. Here&#39;s some more shilling: the only thing trump is good at is flamboyant marketing and he fleeced a bunch of suckers into thinking he&#39;s some kind outsider who&#39;s gonna drain the swamp. And Bernie shot himself in the foot with his populist rhetoric, and ruined his chance of pushing his agenda by unknowingly sabotaging Hilary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the Wikileaks exposed the fact that the Clintons coerced their friend Trump into running, and basically called in media favors to have them prop him as well as Carson and Cruz up in the primaries so she would have an easy opponent. They were pleased as punch that somehow Trump won, and then it kind of got away from them. I feel Trump was probably so amazed that he won, that he is now carried away with it, and basically going off their script...that&#39;s why they are actively trying to destroy him...I mean, he is doing a good enough job at that himself, but removing him in favor of Pence seems like it will eventually be top priority for both parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my fear is that he is actual controlled opposition. My hope is that he is not. However, I do believe what ever the case is he is being used as managed opposition. I think many of his plans are antithetical to the plans for a NWO. That being said, with the way they are demonizing him, if he fails they (The PTHB, through MSM) will associate every anti NWO plan or policy with Trump. By destroying him and demonizing him they will also demonize and destroy any future anti NWO agendas. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh come man you&#39;re sounding like that freak show who ran back in the early 2000s, yeah those ideas didn&#39;t work then and they don&#39;t work now.&quot;</p>

<p>If, as you believe, he is in fact controlled opposition, then why do they permit him to carry out some of the policies he has. I believe the answer to that is because they want all of those policies to be discredited by him and never taken seriously in the eyes of the public again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Bush crime family. It&#39;s long suspected that bush senior was involved in killing JFK and Nancy Reagan believed that the bush family tried to have rondald assassinated. They almost succeeded. Then you have George bush senior going in front of the UN spouting off &quot;new world order&quot; policies. </p>

<p>Do I need to even go into how evil bush jr and Cheney are? They literally lit the Middle East on fire starting wars so the globalists can fuck up every country over there and rape their resources. Now they&#39;re flooding Europe with &quot;refugees&quot; or rapeugees. The bush family is one of three shadow government factions that rule this planet. They all report to the aristocratic families like rothchilds and do the bidding of people like Kissinger. The bush&#39; family is a crime family .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. I would just say that one of the issues is, is that so many people view the Bush&#39;s as acting on behalf of their family or their own interests. I believe that their motivations come from their ties to secret societies, such as, the Skull and Bones. Many people forget that John Kerry was also a member of that group. In the Bush V Kerry election we would have been fucked no matter what. John Kerry was a bonesmen who went on to be Sec of State for Obama and shouldn&#39;t be overlooked as an individual who towed the line for war and destruction in the middle east.</p>

<p>Steven Munchin (I think that&#39;s how you spell it) Trumps sec of treasury is also a member.</p>

The bush family implements the wishes of the globalists more specially members of secret societies like skull and bones which is why people like John Kerry are selected and placed in positions of power.

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Which is why they are always trying to control the internet. They&#39;ve setup systems of controls which monitor everything we do online, monitor our every thoughts and desires because of what we type into google and post on Facebook. They believe they can dominate us forever but there is one thing they can&#39;t control. Free will. They can&#39;t stop us from thinking for ourselves. To the ruling class, a well informed population doesn&#39;t help them in any way. In fact it hurts their efforts to try to control and manipulate things like public opinion, stock markets, social  behaviors and just about every other aspect of our daily lives that they want to dominate. Just like the Magna Carta set forth freedom, and the US Revolution gave us independence from tyranny, we will reject their attempts of control and that is what scares them the most. </p>

<p>The good thing is, the more they try to tighten the noose, the more they are exposed and the more we will reject it. There are some of us who won&#39;t go willingly into the box cars. It&#39;s time we stood up and fought back with the power of the internet. I been in this fight for a long long time. My username checks out. </p>

<p>From the get go, all I&#39;ve been asking from you is for you to cite your sources. What&#39;s so difficult about that? If he straight up admitted this in his autobiography, you would have immediately pointed out where in that book it could be found. That would have easily precluded any kind of dispute from anyone. But <strong>you can&#39;t even provide the book you claim to have this &quot;public knowledge&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>So far you&#39;ve directed me to a search engine and then (after I pointed out how ludicrous it is that you&#39;re trying to cite over five million sources) you devolved to just calling me names and trying to be demeaning. </p>

<p>If you had a single iota of proof, you would have provided it by now. </p>

<p>They might not even tolerate political discussion on FB because it adds more stress to their already stressful day at work.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll passively glance over headlines or switch the TV on to Network news when they want to feel &quot;informed&quot;. </p>

<p>It was decided long ago which side of the political spectrum Joe and Jane fell on. Perhaps their father or mother watched Fox News and expressed their disdain for Democrat agendas? Maybe they come from immigrant families who&#39;s families were uninformed when it came to American politics; consequently, they gravitated towards liberal views because those around them claimed Republicans were racist and didn&#39;t embrace minorities?</p>

<p>And it&#39;s just a perpetual cycle that goes uncontested. An information bubble that people willfully create around themselves. They&#39;ll accept the narrative their side pushes as long as it doesn&#39;t create cognitive dissonance. </p>

<p>As a result, Joe and Jane will go out into the world with unhealthy political views that for the most part serve to drive division between the populace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do have a what appears to be a demographics problem for some.  What those on the left don&#39;t realize, or don&#39;t respect, is that it&#39;s not necessarily a fear of immigrants (legal or otherwise) that the right wingers have, the fear is a loss of sovereignty, a loss of freedom-of-association, a loss of standard of living, loss of culture, traditions, and probably most importantly: a loss of social trust.   We&#39;ve already observed these effects first hand and how they&#39;ve transformed the US from the 60s til now, and there is absolutely an argument to be made that much of it&#39;s due to demographic transformation.   Elites and communistically minded people who see the masses as nothing more than mindless consumers, marketing indicators, in their strip-mall worldview, don&#39;t care about any of those things - they seek to deconstruct culture unless it&#39;s consumerist, along with destroying religion, tradition, and the social cohesion those things have brought, because it threatens their control and power.  The only gods you need to worship are the almighty dollar and the myth of equality.</p>

<p>The reality is, if the US became (in the long term), a 90% Mexican country, how different would it be from what Mexican people built in Mexico? How different would it be from the cultures and governments of much of South and Central America, especially if the government is changed through democracy?   </p>

<p>In short, it&#39;s the people that make a country, not its laws, not its land.  Why not respect that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are allowed to hate them both, you are allowed to hate one individual without your feelings about someone else effected, Trump and Bush Jr. do not <em>have</em> to have reputations depending on each other.  </p>

<p>Take me, for instance. I can&#39;t stand Trump and I absolutely despise Bush Jr. I want him in prison. Now that Bush Jr. is making appearances and appealing to my negative feelings for Trump, you know what this has done to my feelings for Bush Jr.?  </p>

<p>This publicity has reminded me of his existence and keeps this criminal in the front of my mind. Im reminded how much of a piece of shit he is, as opposed to him laying low and drifting into obscurity.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I forgive Bush Jr. for the wrongs he has done. I have to forgive him. He&#39;s merely human, and as a human myself I feel we all should forgive each other for the bad decisions, mistakes, and wrongs we choose to do. Forgiveness is the key to moving on, the key to approaching happiness within. But...   </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to see Bush Jr. locked up. I forgive him for what he did regarding 9/11 and many other ill deeds, however he still needs to face his retribution. Everyone is allowed to make mistakes, you just have to face the consequences. Every action has a reaction. If your action is killing hundreds (thousands?) of your own American citizens while also hamstringing the future generations.... well, then your consequences, your retribution will not be pretty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The GOP hates Trump because he is not one of them and he&#39;s ruining the &quot;Jeb Strategy&quot; of turning America from an Anglo nation to a Latino nation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure Bush &quot;fears&quot; Trump so much. No, Trump isn&#39;t going to do anything about 9/11 for instance. But Trump likely has the goods on Bush Jr. the way Clinton had the goods on Bush Sr.</p>

<p>But they are most certainly rivals. The Bush family basically is the GOP establishment - Romney for instance is a Bush family loyalist. Trump is not the GOP establishment, he has his own network.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bush was just so statesman-like, has a real big heart, and really meant well but just had bad advisors leading him astray.</p>

<p>He was the fucking President, not some 17 year old getting wrapped up in a street gang. The wars and all the cronyism and tax cuts for the rich and just general incompetence were on him.</p>

<p>I dislike Trump as much as anyone and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he managed to fuck things up even worse than W. given 8 years, but he hasn&#39;t done nearly as much harm yet. Bush has a long record of being a sack of shit at this point, but suddenly a bunch of &quot;liberals&quot; on reddit want to act like it&#39;s 2000 and he&#39;s just the goofy guy you want to have a beer with.</p>

<p>He&#39;s got a lot of good ideas. He just has so many more bad ones.</p>

<p>People are defending Trump because &quot;oh look a president that&#39;s doing what he said he&#39;d do&quot; when his first orders came out.</p>

<p>Same people say Trump is a liar and think he just said some things to get votes and not follow through.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have it both ways and be correct.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the voting. It&#39;s that anyone born here can be president.</p>

It was in the 60s, when she was 17 years old, and well before she ever met G. W. Bush. Your fundamental lack of understanding about the situation is alarming since you seem to have taken a strong stance based off of misinformation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</p>

<p>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p>

<p>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</p>

<p>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</p>

<p>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>

<p>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p>

<p>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</p>

<p>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is George Bush didn&#39;t paint those paintings. Seriously? I never once heard of him even picking up a paintbrush, and now all of a sudden he&#39;s the Martha-fucking Stewart of bullshit apocalypse paintings, making books on it and shit because obviously the president&#39;s horseshit perception of art is somehow worth the shit canvas he&#39;s shitting on? </p>

<p>Watch them &quot;donate&quot; the painting valued at 30 million to some bullshit corrupt foundation for children peddling and pocket the tax deduction. God damn scam artists</p>

<li>Putin has always been a bad guy</li>
<li>Concerned about Trump. Needs to be investigated</li>
<li>He&#39;s somehow atoned because he paints now</li>
<li>He&#39;s super duper friends with Michelle Obama now</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the original argument was that a war criminal was profiting from his victims. You really need to think a bit. I can&#39;t believe people like you and whoever originally replied to me. </p>

<p>The topic is about George w bush selling a book of his paintings of soldiers; that a great number of them wouldn&#39;t exist, if not for him. Weather or not he&#39;s directly getting paid is not the point. He and his father, and many other American presidents are war criminals. The fact that he chose to do art of lives he was directly involved in destroying is beyond fucked up. And you people &quot;defending&quot; him need to reevaluate your morals. </p>

But it was part of the agreement he made with allied nations for the invasion of Iraq. About a dozen countries wouldn&#39;t donate men, money, or material until they knew that the Iraqi army was no longer an effective fighting force. So the commander of CENTCOM, General Franks, recommended Bush to go on TV with the Mission Accomplished Banner and all that, so they could start Phase 3 of the operation, using more international money and local resources.</p>

He probably did more harm than we could ever know, and I fully agree that he has a special place in hell. </p>

<p>I was just commenting on the rhetoric that he delivers - put that next to Trump, he <strong>seems</strong> a likable guy. </p>

<p>I also think that Trump is a moron that has no spine and has his wheels turned by someone else. 
Bush definitely knew the evils he was perpetuating, Trump is just a moron with no knowledge or acknowledgement of the bad things that he is doing and will do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the rest of our lives. Get used to it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother.</p>

<p>If human equality is to be forever averted—if the High, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently—then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think you missed the title if you&#39;re going to quote &quot;enemy&quot; and have it be nowhere in the title. Also the question is &quot;why&quot; is bush on television suddenly. The answer is he is promoting a book. He&#39;s a &quot;media darling&quot; in the sense that he is a former President so anything he does will be able to gain a sizable amount of press if they so desire. This isn&#39;t Orwellian simply because he is hitting the talk show circuit to promote a book where the profits are supposed to go to a non profit that helps veterans.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t agree with what Trump did, normally. But the fake news (that didn&#39;t make a peep when 33 servicemen, including 15 Navy seals, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Chinook_shootdown_in_Afghanistan">died under a single Obama approved operation</a>) was going absolutely batshit over a molehill mountain.</p>

<p>Trump fires back. And in this case, public response says he slam dunked it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)I&#39;m not saying that the democrats using the Gold Star family is right. I&#39;m saying that a sitting President parading a widow in front of the nation as political shield while saying crap like &quot;[The Generals] lost Ryan&quot; is such a fucking sign of cowardice. He claims to be for the troops, but can&#39;t acknowledge failures. It was his call, and it went badly.</p>

<p>2) That wasn&#39;t within Obama&#39;s first month in office.</p>

<p>3) This is the same public that we&#39;re claiming are mindless zombies who accept everything that is presented in media as Truth, right? If the &quot;fake news&quot; reports that the public likes a speech, did they really like it?</p>

There are no more brakes on 24/7 propaganda and these Hillit/anti-Trumpers are willfully oblivious to what they&#39;re playing with.

    <div class="md"><p>Bush has PR people. They see that Agent Orange is more hated than pretty much anybody thought he would be, as an elected President. Perfect time to resurface and resist...to sell some shit and clean up his image.</p>

<p>A lot of millennials were too young to really get what was going on during his presidency. It&#39;s history to them. A lot of older people never really learned about any of it, and they only view his failed presidency through the eyes of the economic downturn. One of the defining objectives of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars was that most people didn&#39;t have to think about it day to day, even when it was going badly. </p>

<p>If you are here on r/conspiracy because you believe that the government planned 9/11, Iraq was a trillions dollar handout to private companies, Afghanistan was about oil, Gitmo was just about being evil, the Bush admin had a direct propaganda line to Fox News, Dick Cheney was the actual president, etc....</p>

<p>You are in a distinct minority of the population.</p>

He&#39;s not your knight in shining armor, he is the exact same thing but instead of pretty wrapping paper it is glitter duct tape. He has neo cons on his cabinet, he has Munchin, he is probably indebted to Russia in god knows what way -- he is controlled just as much as the rest of them. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t agree with what Trump did, normally. But the fake news (that didn&#39;t make a peep when 33 servicemen, including 15 Navy seals, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Chinook_shootdown_in_Afghanistan">died under a single Obama approved operation</a>) was going absolutely batshit over a molehill mountain.</p>

<p>Trump fires back. And in this case, public response says he slam dunked it.</p>
