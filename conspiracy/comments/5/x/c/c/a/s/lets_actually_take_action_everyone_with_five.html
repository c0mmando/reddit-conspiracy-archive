<p>If we flood the oversight committee with this, they&#39;ll know it is the will of the people to have this investigated.

    <div class="md"><p>What point? That you dont have any legitimate source linking Trump to Russia? Keep in mind im not American and think all American politics are corrupt.</p>

<p>From my perspective....Would it be so bad for U.S. and Russia to get along? Even if there was extensive proof of contact with Russia, to me the question is about context. Otherwise it is nothing more than a senseless smear campaign piggy backing on the &quot;RUSSIA IS EVIL&quot; mass propaganda campaign which is, in all honesty, blatantly obvious at this point.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not even what this was.  It was even less nefarious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called a Cy Pres settlement.  Because big class actions usually don&#39;t get settlement claims from every class member, there&#39;s usually plenty of money from the settlement left over.  It used to be that this money just reverted back to the defendant, which seemed to be a failure of justice.  So in the 80s judges started approving settlement terms where any leftover money would go to a charity or group related to whatever the case was about.  This isn&#39;t just government settlements, private plaintiffs put these terms in too.</p>

<p>The Justice Department pursues equal rights, consumer rights and civil rights claims.  The type of groups that support civil rights, equality and consumer rights tend be left leaning, because that&#39;s the ideology that usually cares about helping victims of powerful people.</p>

<p>Lol, r/conspiracy. Six Russian diplomats have been killed since November, four of whom were named in a dossier claiming our president is being blackmailed by the Russian government.  But your time is <em>definitely</em> better spent pulling the threads on that whole &quot;commonplace legal practice&quot; caper </p>
