    <div class="md"><p>Actually I decided to call his bluff and research. Here is when he started posting - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rockran?count=1175&amp;amp;after=t3_nzbqs">https://www.reddit.com/user/Rockran?count=1175&amp;amp;after=t3_nzbqs</a></p>

<p>Work back from there. He posted a bunch of shit posts and karma grabbing posts. All topics, no actual commenting. He only started commenting on reddit 3 months ago. The same time he started posting to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Has spammed the fuck out of the board with nothing but nonsense, insults and terrible debunking. So the claim that he is a long time poster is clear bullshit. A bluff. He created the &quot;prove I am a shill&quot; posts before ever posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Knowing full well what he was coming here to do. Not sure what else there is to say, the shill is a shill.</p>

<p>My conclusion is it is a bought account. Someone farmed for karma and sat on it to increase the value. Poor guy will need to buy a new one now.</p>

A corrupt political party used government surveillance power unethically to spy on political opponents, obviously to gain a advantage OR the FBI independently investigated trumps dealing with Russia because (insert whatever bullshit argument you want here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part about this. is those dumb cunts in our source are citing Louise Mensch at heatst. </p>

<p>Louise Mensch is a former british MP and is one of the more vocal journalists pushing the Trumps collusion with Russia. One of the best reasons to believe her is BECAUSE of that heatst article.</p>

<p>Your own sources give weight to what you are arguing against you dimwit. fucking hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that this is too crazily farfetched and pizzagate is not baaffles me. They&#39;re both interesting to talk about, but apparently on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> everyone thinks Trumps twitter is gospel which is fucking weird.</p>

<p>My point was the poster above used a source that cites Louise Mensch as evidence against it, indicating they believe she is credible. Even though she pushes what they are trying to debunk. whihc is fucking stupid.</p>

<p>Here ya go, I posted this somewhere else:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sutori.com/story/trumputin">This</a> is well documented. </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DnQWKe9koRkG31bO3vGJdLjqlI5fPi4I7MRjWFTz3Y0/edit#">Here</a> is some more compiled things that corroborate the dossier as well as Trumps connections to russia, including his buddies and all that.</p>

<p><a href="https://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/kompromat/">Here</a> is another source that goes into even more detail of the manafort being compromised, and remember, he had to step down because of this, and that people are not pleased with Trump, judging by what they said when they released the hacked data from her phone.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/manaforts-ukrainian-blood-money-caused-qualms-hack-suggests-235473">Politico</a> contacted Manafort and the guy even fucking admitted his shit was hacked, so it is likely the dump of his daughters&#39; phone&#39;s data is legit. </p>

<p>You also put up Louise Menschs&#39; blog. Reminder that Louise Mensch <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">broke the news about the FISA warrant</a> a couple months before anyone else, which lends some more credibility to her theories. She also is not classical &quot;MSM&quot; and generally leans to the right. She also used to be a British MP or whatever. So.</p>

<p>Honestly there is a whole fuck ton of stuff that points to Russian collusion. More than most people would have you believe here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original FISA request which specifically named and broadly targeted Donald Trump was denied, a second request was redrafted months later which narrowed down on equipment in Trump Tower. The second request is said to have been granted, despite the fact that FBI sources did not believe these servers to be of actual national security or possess any illegal ties to Russia. The notion that this second FISA warrant was granted is highly significant as they exist to investigate cases when Foreign Intelligence is suspected of operations in the US.</p>

Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s trying to get the media away from the Russians? Maybe the media and the Democrats are focusing on Russians to hide their corruption and DC pedophile rings?

<p>I promise you they will not go to prison. There is no reason to believe that Trump is going to investigate Hillary&#39;s campaign. He could have done it, he has not done it. It&#39;s not gonna happen.</p>

<p>As for what Obama ordering it, eh. They still got the FISA warrant, and Obama was huge on spying which explains his EO with the sharing of information between the ICs.</p>

<p>Yeah that&#39;s fine the problem the &quot;DC Pedophiles&quot; are used as a boogeyman to attempt to shut down arguments a lot now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump doesn&#39;t have to investigate Hillary&#39;s campaign. I never said that. A special prosecutor will look into it or some select committee will probably form to look into the Russians, Trump&#39;s campaign, Hillary&#39;s campaign, and Obama&#39;s Administration during the election. It was a hypothetical by the way and you don&#39;t know that Obama didn&#39;t do it. But we don&#39;t know that Obama did do it. </p>

<p>The only reason I mentioned the DC pedophile ring was in my hypothetical if the Democrats and the media were trying to draw away from it. From what I see you&#39;re shutting down arguments. Remember this statement you made?</p>

<p>&quot;Uh wow, still with this huh?&quot; </p>

<p>Right...I&#39;m the one shutting down an argument. Nice projection you got going on.  Also I never said you had to agree with it and I never called you a pedo defender. You brought that up. I merely pointed out to your confrontational statement that we look into all conspiracies. </p>

<p>I explained why I said what I said and it&#39;s perfectly valid. </p>

<p>My point is just that he isn&#39;t going to investigate them. Ever. It was all talk and bullshit. He said he would, he can make it happen, and if he wanted to he would have done it because it would be another promise he could say he kept. So why hasn&#39;t he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you don&#39;t just lock up the most powerful and high profile politicians in the world, specifically HRC, who has connections to THE most powerful family in the world and think that&#39;s just going to fly without a proportionate, directed retaliation from the citizenship, press, the Deep State, you name it.  This isn&#39;t TV where you just go lock up the bad guy, perp walk them into the station and go &quot;Book &#39;em&quot; and ride off like the Lone Ranger.  The case has to be airtight, all possible variables need to be examined, all connections exposed, a total slam dunk with no chance of acquittal.  Sessions, Trump and anyone serious about bringing them down would be putting targets on their heads along with their families too - it&#39;s rumored Barron Trump is not living in DC for <em>precisely</em> that reason.  Even <em>IF</em> Hilldawg or big names like Obama, Schumer, McCain got clipped for the pedophilia/occultism, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was done in secret with a ready-made media excuse to cover it all up, even to the point of faking their deaths rather than expose the whole fucked up underbelly of what REALLY goes down at the highest levels.  Just think of what those kind of revelations would do to the average person, the national/world psyche and people&#39;s sense of security to find out that people you trusted and voted for are <em>raping, torturing and eating children</em>.  TPTB rely on our sustained faith in the inherent &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot; of their illusory government and its puppets, or the whole thing comes apart and fast.  We know and they know we can&#39;t handle a redpill like that in one shot, so we&#39;re getting little snippets that progressively get bigger and bigger.  All about maintaining control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s lost in a way. What has happened is a clear illustration in what happened to reality before the internet. Controlled by elites defining the news. Altering people&#39;s beliefs by using the media as a weapon. A pro is that thanks to Wikileaks and documented evidence we can observe this phenomenon of evolution. Knowledge and awareness is step 1. Now we have the technology that has provided all the data to give us a more transparent society. Just one simple example; how the top 1% have been gaining 90% of wealth. Before we would be told this is normal. Now more people have access to clear statistics and numbers that show there is enough money to give everyone basic needs like food, water, and shelter. Everything else past that must be worked for. </p>

<p>I digress. Now we comes the best step. Replacing these old methods and technologies with better ones. Ones that use the blockchain in an effort to benefit all humanity. Like the blockchain. </p>

<p>Notice whenever there&#39;s a post that hurts Obama, Hillary, the left, and even people that don&#39;t like Trump such as McCain, the post, this sub and OP are openly attacked and they say this sub is T_D now to shut down discussion.</p>

<p>Yet any posts that hurt Trump, Pence, or anyone affiliated is upvoted and the comments are all organic discussion of the topic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very obvious the shills are spilling over from the various left wing Hate Spaces around reddit, as they are spilling into default subs as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s being manipulated to not count down votes. It&#39;s possible. Shariablue and the elite media moguls own Reddit enough to plant some of their people to post that. Then they disallow down voting on it. Then they get a couple people like you to create false conversations that are also programmed to not receive downvotes. Now other people start thinking it&#39;s okay to judge all of TD by one comment. Now other people think more and more TD people are posting this ideology when they&#39;re all plants too. Checkmate Shariablue wins. Not really. Because people catch on and we&#39;re too smart. TD starts being more careful and starts banning those comments. Sike. Checkmate again. It&#39;s too late shariablue already controls all of Reddit. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and TD completely compromised. They&#39;re all in on it trying to secretly impeach trump. Wrong. Moderator civil war. 1776 Reddit style commences again. Freedom reigns and truth exposed. Corruption averted and civilization can continue to thrive and evolve. TD not judged by one nasty comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you really think conservatives don&#39;t use PR firms? I know you probably won&#39;t look into them, but here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/DCI_Group">DCI</a> that works for the Republican Party:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DCI Group offers services that include national, state and local lobbying; coalition building; and generating “grasstops” and constituent support for issues. The firm has been linked to several industry-funded coalitions that pose as grassroots organizations. Perhaps it comes as no surprise as DCI advertises its ability to provide “third party support” to clients. </p>

There are posts exposing and attacking leakers from the Trump administration. John McCain, who has begun opposing Trump is suddenly subject to massively upvoted nonsense posts.

    <div class="md"><p>Lets start with why though. This sub is not recognizable because of the people OP listed. This is ALL of reddit because these shills and bots are abusing Reddits crap algo thats why you see 1000 of the same worded subs with the same subscribers with the same posts and the same comments just worded a little little differently. I explained why she would not have won at all according to your if every liberal was a shill. I mean if you really do lurk here a lot like you say you would have seen the Reddit is really bought sticky that was up for days and you would understand its just VPNs proxies and up/down vote bots being used and only a small team of people because Magic Internet Reddit Points are worth nothing. Dont slide topic with &quot;This isnt conspiracy anymore&quot; it just does NOT help at all. Instead why dont you post actual sources to this russian conspiracy and back it up on your own thread in conspiracy than posting in OPs clearly drunk rage of reddit because lets face it reddit is abused by the Admins and lets face it anyone with a wallet. I could be gilded and on front page tommorow saying I should be president in 2020 because I can type all because I could pay for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself centrist and personally I would describe r/politics as really bad. From its name and community info, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous to have an expectation of open discussion with view points from both sides being represented. I understand it&#39;s not going to be equal, because of Reddit&#39;s demographic, it&#39;s gonna skew to one side, but it&#39;s been getting out of hand. Literally every attempt at voicing a right leaning view point is downvoted to hell and/or dismissed as idiotic/malicious, even if it&#39;s a perfectly rational stance. Lots of what-about-isms come up during that. On top of that, I&#39;ve been seeing irrational left leaning ideologies being supported a disturbing amount through upvotes. During the whole &quot;punch a Nazi&quot; and violence at UC Berkeley media cycle, multiple different threads had triple digit upvoted comments non-ironically supporting the violence. Also what people are expecting from Trump gets very melodramatic often, but I&#39;ve been trying to be forgiving of that for now. I remember how the right was having a meltdown when Obama first took office. It&#39;s just frustrating when I&#39;m looking for people&#39;s opinion on Trump&#39;s cabinet pick for DOE, and there&#39;s people seriously concerned with the possibility of nuclear war. </p>

<p>It is what it is. I still subscribe to it even though I can&#39;t do much about it, it&#39;s just disappointing when I have to be careful about commenting anything other than the anti-Trump echo chamber type stuff. There is sometimes a tiny portion of decent information on there, I&#39;ve just come accustomed to dismissing most of the content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what other people&#39;s motives are on here. What matters is the validity and rationality of their comments. If a shill actually raises a good point, then good for them, I actually appreciate it. But when you have comments like &quot;lol you still believe in pizzagate&quot; or something, it&#39;s just valueless even if the guy isn&#39;t a shill.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve said it before, the shills are just fucking terrible at their jobs, it is so damn easy picking them out. Seriously, shills, we know you&#39;re here, so how about you actually put some effort into shilling? Here, I&#39;ll start you off with a free piece of advice: you need to build your conspiracy street cred before you start shilling in threads that have like 43 upvotes and 0% <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> exposure. You just look out of place when you go to your shill troll script and we check your account and see that you have zero interactions with any conspiracy threads yet you somehow found a tiny thread in a niche subreddit. <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> redditors make shill-like comments but they only come to threads that actually reach the front page, those people don&#39;t hang out in subreddits that they make fun of and they sure don&#39;t find tiny threads with 3 comments and leave their own shill comments.</p>

<p>So get with it shills, start posting pro-conspiracy stuff on the less threatening conspiracy theories. And after you build up some credibility, maybe your shilling will work better. </p>

<p>How about being the change you want to see in the world?  Be the one who listens to the other side&#39;s tiredness.  Take the concerns of the other guy seriously.  Investigate Soros and stand against him wherever he seems to be wrong.  He&#39;ll either survive that process or he won&#39;t.  While you&#39;re at it, you&#39;ll gain a lot of insight into the people who think Koch is the lesser evil, and by your example you can likely persuade them to listen to your side&#39;s tiredness next.</p>

It&#39;s simply one of the more prominent heavily invested in false dialectics many adhere to without knowing how deep the gloom goes at each &quot;end&quot; of the political spectrum which is what r/consp. has always been in the business of revealing until it got a shot in the arm from wikileaks and the recent cascade of anons, leakers and decent folk who are no longer putting up with the façade. </p>

<p>Hence the recently amplified influx of dis-info agents, agent provocateurs, shills, bots, career political advisors/think tank experts/strategists, JTRIG goons, CIA/mil. intell spook f-tards etc....hi guys. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that astroturfing does&#39;t exist, or that it&#39;s not a serious problem, but there&#39;s a greater irony here...</p>

<p>The essence of a conspiracy theory lies in the willingness to have an open mind. To think critically about widely accepted beliefs. To entertain notions without necessarily buying in to them. </p>

<p>This subreddit has gone so deep down the confirmation bias rabbit-hole that dissenting opinions are not just disregarded, they&#39;re automatically branded as <strong>part of an active conspiracy against the pro-Trump stance that this subreddit has assumed.</strong></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve never seen a subreddit change so dramatically in both content and attitude than I have with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> over the past few years.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re so good at reading in between the lines then you should be able discern between a normal liberal on the internet and a corporate shill. And quite frankly you should try harder at doing so.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to automatically reject any opinion that doesn&#39;t line up with your own, then you&#39;re a bigger part of the fucking problem than the shills.</p>

Even 4chan is bringing forth evidence to support this pro donald thing. At this point, after all the evidence I have seen, I am basically &quot;Pro Trump 100%&quot; now. Does that mean I am not looking at the evidence? no, I read from all the other front page news subreddits to get an opinion on both sides of the story. I have come to the conclusion that I am most likely going to agree with the Trump supporters. Some of them can be stupid, but I DO support and believe in Trump 100%. I have no doubts about him. I have also found no evidence to deny his authenticity as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand friend, I truly do. I used to be really concerned about climate change, until I saw the evidence. Climate change is a giant hoax promoted by the globalist, now I know that sounds wacky but you must believe me. I can DM the proof if you so wish desire. I like muslims too :D, two friends of mine are muslim. both moved to America this school year. You must understand that there is a difference between being an AMERICAN muslim (legally) and an immigrant. There is dozens of videos showing the violence and brutality that the immigrants induce amongst the European population. These videos include Muslims raping swedish girls, destroying building, robbing trucks etc, one video includes a woman being raped and one immigrant laughing as if she were nothing but an animal. Her screams were horrifying. Yes Trump is illiterate that is annoying, but I truly believe that Trump cares about America and that he is doing his best to support our country. He IS a president for the people. Why do I say that? Because he listens to us. I have proof of all of this, just DM me if you want it. I would rather have a rich billionaire who became rich through his immense success in business more so than a corrupt globalist politician who had his whole life pre planned for him (including the money). Trump is authentic which is why I like him. The rabbit hole goes deeper than you think and I have only begun to scratch the surface of the truth of what is really going on. I advise you to do the research for yourself because it is out there. you MUST search hard but I believe you will find it. Best of wishes to you friend.</p>

<p>btw, look into George Soros, read about his upbringing and his influence on global society. This is a good starting point.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the point.  When you make comments like &quot;what if you like people who can emit a coherent meaningful English sentence?&quot;, you are not only insulting Trump, but you are insulting everyone who doesn&#39;t have the same expensive education as you.</p>

Putting the blame on the left for calling folks on the right stupid is ignoring the GOP&#39;s steady cultivation of a culture that distrusts intellectuals. Science and reason are viewed as subversive of Conservatism, simply because that is the message that the GOP has been pushing to their base for decades. The left didn&#39;t push that message.</p>

<p>You realize trumps a globalist right? Businesses in 24 countries you probably can&#39;t even name but no totally America first. Or are the (((globalist))) just everyone who disagrees with Trump? It seems to match up with your liar hit list. But anyways no shit they&#39;ve all lied or mislead on something but not to the maginitude Trump has in only 2 months of his presidency.  Here&#39;s some that you can&#39;t even dispute because we can pull video of him saying he&#39;d do them: 1. His promise to release his tax returns. 2. Promised to move away from his business in a meaningful way. Neither have happened... anyways with your devotion you should look into this [<a href="http://www.esama.ca/warning-signs-that-you-are-in-a-cult">http://www.esama.ca/warning-signs-that-you-are-in-a-cult</a>].

    <div class="md"><p>I shared your statement with a friend of mine, her thoughts below.</p>

<ol>
<li>He says Trump is a globalist. What is a globalist? That is someone who is part of the government elite who are working towards a one world government. How do you do this? You coordinate an agenda with others around the globe, you consolidate power int specific areas, and you do things that will catalyze globalism like have open borders, take away the sovereignty of nations, and make nations join things like the European Union and the TPP. Trump has not bee involved in the construction of any of these things, and we know this because he has not gone to their meetings such as the Bilderberg group and other yearly meetings. He also has been talking about globalists and what the &quot;robber barons&quot; (look that phrase up) do to destroy the US economically for decades, as can be seen in interviews like literally all of the ones in this video from before he announced his presidency <a href="https://youtu.be/MP3pMvc9MOY">https://youtu.be/MP3pMvc9MOY</a>              2. Of course Trump would take advantage of the world market to expand his business, and it is natural as a businessman to do business is whatever country would get him the most money. He did what was best for his business in the past, but that absolutely does NOT take away from the fact that he literally destroyed the TPP ( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership</a> ) as his first executive order. The TPP is a globalist partnership because it forces the United States to make trade deals that are pre set up, rather than the US making trade deals one at a time and changing them within context of the trade situation at hand. The TPP is comparable to having to write an essay with only the suggestions that your phone gives you above the keyboard.                     3. Not everyone who disagrees with Trump is a globalist, and you never said that. The obvious anti trump shills and those in high positions of the social order such as famous people and politicians who are vehemently anti trump aren&#39;t globalists because they are anti trump, they are globalists because they are trying to have open borders.
They are trying to have open borders, keep trade deals like the TPP, allow other cultures to take over other cultures, etc. When we say less than %20 of muslims in the world should be temporarily banned from specific countries because of terrorist infiltration, that isn&#39;t racist and the left is only lying to make it seem like he is in the wrong whereas all he is doing is going against a globalist scheme to put random people from other countries that want to harm us over the lives and cultures of those who are citizens. The fact is that these people in high positions and their followers are so obviously controlled. Trump once said &quot;in the news tomorrow I bet they will say I made a big deal out of this. Heres the headline: Donald Trump rants and raves...&quot; and WHAT DID WE SEE THE NEXT DAY... more than 3 major news outlets both on articles and live on air used the phrase &quot;Donald Trump rants and raves&quot;. Another example of this extremely obvious planned opposition is when Trump said &quot;Fake media is the enemy of the American people.&quot; And guess what all mainstream media outlets posted the next day? &quot;Trump says media is the enemy of the America people.&quot; They take the word fake out. THEY THINK THEIR FOLLOWERS ARE STUPID. He specifically said fake, and they TOOK OUT THE WORD FAKE. These are the globalists who also happen to be opposed to Trump. If Trump is a puppet, why would they make it so fucking complicated by doing all these things hhat hurt themselves and funneling millions and millions of dollars to stop Trump? Why did Goldman Sachs give 100% of its campaign donations to Clinton? Why did Saudi Arabia fund 20% of Hilary&#39;s campaign? 4. &quot;They&#39;ve all lied or mislead on something but not to the magnitude that Trump has in only 2 months of presidency&quot; Okay, this is just bullshit. Nearly every single thing that the anti trump movement does, both within the elite and within the anti trump followers, is hypocritical. What has Trump lied about? The MSM is owned by the globalists. Literally. They are bought. Here is proof that goes beyond even the fact that they lie over and over <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jH8dejYGa5A">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jH8dejYGa5A</a>   there is absolutely no excuse as to why all of these news outlets would say the exact. same. thing. word for word. All of the news channels are not collaborating, that is ridiculous. The logical answer is that they are all owned and given loose scripts, with specific terms and phrases they must say. Given how much the media lies, and I don&#39;t need to give sources for that because we already know, that means Trump has to lie a LOT to lie even more than the MSM AND the people following the globalist agenda. What has Trump lied about within these two months? I can only think of one thing, and that is when he said &quot;last night in Sweden&quot; but even that wasn&#39;t a lie. He may or may nit have been referencing the terrorist attack by a non migrant, but even so there of course were crimes committed by migrants that night. Rape, murder, and all crime have gone up in extreme amounts. There are so many crimes being committed by them that Sweden has stopped recording the statistics for crime by race or citizenship status. 5. Yes, he hasn&#39;t released his tax returns. His lawyer told him not to and even his supporters know that he has probably out maneuvered paying them some years. Given the fact that he has done more to bring jobs, factories, business, and natural resource management back to the US, that makes up for it in my eyes. There shouldn&#39;t even be an income tax, and when you&#39;re in a cut throat job like business you can&#39;t always afford to pay a large percentage of your wealth. He went bankrupt once and came back from it. Paying taxes hurts, and releasing them would only give people a platform to diss him. It would make people ignore the good he is going and bring attention away from the real issues at hand. 6. He DID move away from his business in a meaningful way. He literally gave ownership of his business to his sons in favor of taking one of the most stressful, time consuming, demanding jobs in America that pays very little compared to his net worth. He has no reason to do this extremely mentally and physically taxing job at the age of 70 when he had billions in his bank account besides the fact that he genuinely wants to help the American people. This person..... And then he sent a link about how to tell if you&#39;re in a cult. &gt;implying that the liberty movement stops with Trump. Trump simply catalyzed this movement. We have the momentum and strength in terms of willpower at this point to restore America and the world into a place where countries have fair relationships without all kinds of bullshit wars and globalist groups like the European Union (This is why Britain left). If Trump does somehow turn out to be a puppet, the people of America and the world WILL fight back physically. We may not win but there is absolutely no way that those who understand the importance of stopping the globalists would be complacent if something were to happen like he is killed or if he doesn&#39;t protect us or does something else that proves he isn&#39;t truly on our side. WE voted him into office because we like the IDEAS he has, but if he turns out to be bunk no one who is truly awake is going to still support him. So his cult claim is also bullshit. They really don&#39;t get it. This isn&#39;t about Trump. Trump is a part of our movement as far as we know and he stepped up to the plate to help it explode into what it is today. </li>

<p>As soon as some credible whistleblowers provide leaks on the trump administration we will be all over it.</p>

<p>As a Berniecrat, I had a vested interest in believing that the Russian narrative was bullshit, partly because it seemed designed to divert attention away from the contents of the emails.</p>

<p>But I am curious about Russia&#39;s interest in US politics, and it remains a bipartisan question.  I guess folks forgot the revelation from the Panama Papers about Clinton and Podesta&#39;s ties to Russia as well.<a href="http://observer.com/2016/04/panama-papers-reveal-clintons-kremlin-connection/">http://observer.com/2016/04/panama-papers-reveal-clintons-kremlin-connection/</a></p>

<p>There are two countries who seem to have an outsize influence on our political lives - Russia and Israel.  I&#39;d love to look at both these relationships.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but that&#39;s bullshit. This sub will ravenously upvote blatant false info and fearmongering, as long as it&#39;s pro trump. Just look at the top post right now on this sub about McCain&#39;s net worth. No sources, no real information, not even a biased pundit website attached to it. Just a photo of McCain and some nonsense about secret funds from deep state terrorists that&#39;s immediately disproven in the comments. Remember when the pissgate dossier was released and this sub&#39;s moderators buried the fuck out of it? Active censorship. Not suggesting that pissgate is even remotely true, but the reaction to it by this sub is telling of its pro trump bias.</p>

Everything printed, read from teleprompters or typed on social media is so uniformly anti-Trump that one must take a step back and see the big picture. In reality Trump is a tiny piece of the big picture contrary to everything that we are being force fed. Just because people recognize this more frequently here and don&#39;t get frenzied the same way they do elsewhere doesn&#39;t make this a pro-Trump sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of this is manipulation.  But a lot of people intrinsically hate Trump.  He has gone out of his way to cause people who aren&#39;t Conservatives to hate him... and in America alone that&#39;s 150 million people.  If you care about the environment, if you have friends who are Muslim, if you want a hard line on big business, if you want to spend less money on the military-industrial complex, then you naturally hate Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, the way people feel is effected by media these days.  When we hate Trump, or Hillary, or Bernie, and there are groups that truly hate each of these people for different reasons, the hate was fed and nurtured through the use of shills.  </p>

<p>You can say that the hate for Donald comes naturally, but constant drumbeat of negative messaging from the media was quite intense.</p>

<p>This is a tricky argument to make, but I was always one of those people who believed in the integrity of our democracy and valued the role of the free press.  Whatever &quot;side&quot; you are on, I would hope we would all agree that propaganda is toxic to a democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a simplistic view. You cannot be suggesting that if I want the Clean Water Act to stand and oppose a plan by Trump to weaken it I&#39;m caused to do so by the media.</p>

<p>That&#39;s dangerous and wrong. You are trying to paint any thoughtful opposition as being under mind control and your next step is to violently oppose me because I&#39;m already gone.</p>

<p>At the least you won&#39;t listen to my opinion and conclusions because you have already decided they aren&#39;t worth hearing and not my own. How is this fair to the real people? I&#39;d say Trump&#39;s rhetoric that the media is the enemy of the people is just as dangerous as this idea of MSM mind control. Because that&#39;s allowed you to write off any evidence of fact you&#39;d like and my own opinions, no matter the source, all the same.</p>

<p>&quot;I think there should be limits on public works spending for...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You got that from CNN/FOX, that&#39;s what they want you to believe&quot;</p>

<p>Look, a lot of us just don&#39;t trust the media anymore.  Trust really matters.  That trust was undermined by the corporate control of messaging for both parties.  My issue is non-partisan.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you prefer to have news organizations that weren&#39;t driven by advertising revenue and weren&#39;t acting as mouthpieces for each side?  </p>

<p>I personally value journalism which dispassionately reports on all the news, and where a comprehensive review of diverse views and opinions is represented with sources and critical analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look back to the beginning of our exchange, the question was &quot;do people hate Trump because they really just truly hate him?&quot; or is that hate somehow influenced by media?</p>

<p>HRC ran a fear-based campaign.  We were besieged day after day with &quot;OMG!!!&quot; and some new story about how awful he is.  Some of those really were stories that needed to be told, and some were hype.</p>

<p>By the end of the campaign, people were so hysterical, really hysterical, that they thought the world was literally ending because he won.  That&#39;s how powerful that campaign was.</p>

<p>So, if you are a scientist, and you ask &quot;was my opinion influenced by the constant tweets, memes, news broadcasts and social media badgering?&quot; vs &quot;Was I able to make up my own mind about my political views without being influenced at all by the media?</p>

<p>I dunno, but I can&#39;t see how any human in this type of climate wouldn&#39;t be effected by the media.  And those donors spend a lot of dollars on the media, so they seem to agree that it does help to shape opinion.</p>

<p>But, even still, I didn&#39;t vote for her, so I guess I am an example of a person where that strategy didn&#39;t work - who was turned off by the campaign, and who now doesn&#39;t follow the MSM.  I don&#39;t listen to that crap anymore.</p>

It&#39;s clear most of these guys aren&#39;t old enough to remember anything before Obama, so they are still naive enough to believe Republicans are any better. This sub had a good run but any forum like this is always doomed. ATS, GLP, etc. all started out legit and look at them now. Same thing as here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how many older users are in this sub, but having seen quite a few election cycles, with this one it&#39;s GLARINGLY obvious that this one is highly abnormal in too many ways to list. There&#39;s something seriously intense going on behind the scenes, and I think that&#39;s worth exploring, and I wish partisan politics could be set aside to do so. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen such incessant attacks by the media, politicians, the internet etc. on a president before like there is with Trump. I&#39;ve always thought a president was just a puppet that&#39;s strings are pulled by the real owners of this country behind the scenes, but there&#39;s something going on here with Trump. I honestly think there&#39;s a deep state war going on right now, and that&#39;s why so much craziness is happening, because I&#39;ve never seen anything like what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nowhere you can go that isn&#39;t being manipulated and overrun with shills and bots for information. There&#39;s probably a bit and shill war going on as well. Interesting times we&#39;re living in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s lost in a way. What has happened is a clear illustration in what happened to reality before the internet. Controlled by elites defining the news. Altering people&#39;s beliefs by using the media as a weapon. A pro is that thanks to Wikileaks and documented evidence we can observe this phenomenon of evolution. Knowledge and awareness is step 1. Now we have the technology that has provided all the data to give us a more transparent society. Just one simple example; how the top 1% have been gaining 90% of wealth. Before we would be told this is normal. Now more people have access to clear statistics and numbers that show there is enough money to give everyone basic needs like food, water, and shelter. Everything else past that must be worked for. </p>

<p>I digress. Now we comes the best step. Replacing these old methods and technologies with better ones. Ones that use the blockchain in an effort to benefit all humanity. Like the blockchain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s being manipulated to not count down votes. It&#39;s possible. Shariablue and the elite media moguls own Reddit enough to plant some of their people to post that. Then they disallow down voting on it. Then they get a couple people like you to create false conversations that are also programmed to not receive downvotes. Now other people start thinking it&#39;s okay to judge all of TD by one comment. Now other people think more and more TD people are posting this ideology when they&#39;re all plants too. Checkmate Shariablue wins. Not really. Because people catch on and we&#39;re too smart. TD starts being more careful and starts banning those comments. Sike. Checkmate again. It&#39;s too late shariablue already controls all of Reddit. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and TD completely compromised. They&#39;re all in on it trying to secretly impeach trump. Wrong. Moderator civil war. 1776 Reddit style commences again. Freedom reigns and truth exposed. Corruption averted and civilization can continue to thrive and evolve. TD not judged by one nasty comment. </p>
