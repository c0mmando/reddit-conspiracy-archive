       EVERY god-damn top comment in a Trump-related submission in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a variation of:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I just came here to see how much this would be downvoted.
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        has become a shitty pro-Trump circlejerk. Shame on the_donald.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is ALWAYS the top comment. Meanwhile the thread is usually around 70%-80% upvoted, which is completely normal. The comments are filled with debate, with people on both sides of the issue hashing it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       STOP with this bullshit that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a Trump circlejerk. Every thread on Trump has people complaining about how pro-Trump everyone else is, and these comments are highly upvoted, which means that at least a large portion of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is not pro-Trump at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, reddit is a place where each community espouses only one view and everything else is downvoted to oblivion, so  people seeing opinions they disagree with not being immediately downvoted assume that the subreddit must be a circlejerk of those opinions. But it's time to stop and look at the evidence: every Trump-related submission in here has debate, not agreement, which means the opinion here is split. Stop with this "waaah it's a circlejerk because not everyone agrees with meeee" bullshit and stick to discussing the facts.

       This so easy to answer.  WaPo is a government backed publication.  We reject our government.  Our government is telling us to be scared of Russia.  So is it really a surprise that the government's message is being ignored in this community?  Because it shouldn't be.  Welcome, stick around and you'll get a better feel for our community I'm sure.  This is the best sub on reddit.  Remember fuck our government and fuck our politicians, and certainly fuck any publication they support

       How is he the embodiment of the government? I will allow that he is an elite, but he never had anything to do with government.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a on again off again real estate success, a beauty pageant personality, and a reality show star. I would characterize him as a fantastically successful brand manager, and a pop culture icon.

       He is the president.... that makes him government! What more would he have to do to be government in your eyes?!

      <p>
       He's also had multiple bankruptcies, id say that's anything but successful. That makes him a terrible brand manager. That, along with the fact that anyone knows a good brand manager would stay away from potentially negative political press.

The dem establishment waged everything on Clinton and they fucked us all. You want to get pissed at TRUMP? Nah brah, LETS BURN THE WHOLE MOTHER FUCKER DOWN.

       Except Trump is the government. Your government is saying "Nope nothing to see here, please keep walking" when ever Russia comes up. The government is actively suppressing the Russia story by calling it fake news. So if you are so anti-government why do you trust and believe them now?

       I'm on board with investigating the connection between Trump and Russia, but let's be sure to investigate the connections between other Democrats and Republicans and Russia, China, Israel, and Saudi Arabia while we're at it.

       That's fine, investigate everyone. My problem is that many on this sub are so quick to dismiss anything involving Trump as fake or false flags. They ignore his Russian ties and even his connections to the pizza gate stuff. It shows a clear bias towards Trump and I can't for the life of me figure out why. There are people here that will bend over backwards to defend a billionaire elite who is now the embodiment of government.

       To be fair there is an old story about crying wolf and it applies to the media here.   They have fed us so much shit why would we all the sudden trust them on the Russia crap?  They have lost my trust and will not suddenly regain it when the official narrative is now also a conspiracy.

       You post in multiple liberal and anti-Trump subs, should I bring that up? no, because it's not fucking relevant: an argument is good or bad based on its merits, not who makes it. That should be obvious to you, assuming you're interested in discussion and not propaganda.

       You are anti-free speech that doesn't agree with your views and use the title of "uncensored".

       You can rant on and on but everything you spout will keep being propaganda until you start backing it up with evidence. We have an open modlog, go forth and show us which news articles we've supposed censored for not agreeing with our views.

       But it was perfectly fine when America engaged in a massive global conspiracy to disrupt the USSR and try to make peace with Russia in the Perestroika and Glasnost days? Ending the cold war might be the only hope for the future of globalism (much as I despise it as a corporatocracy-led enterprise) and I suspect if the Democrats had tried to do it reddit would applaud them.

       It's become a back and forth because people (at least for me) don't want to see pizzagate all day, every day. Then, the other people in this sub, think it's the most important conspiracy in history so they totally ignore everything else!

       I think there is merit to pizzagate, and I think I see more posts criticizing it than promoting it.

       I think that private meetings with foreign ambassadors should be punished, but iirc, the punishment is treason, so I'm not sure why Trump or Flynn are still alive. I'm sure the Clintons should have been executed for their private meetings as well. As should every US leader attending the Bilderberg meetings.

       They aren't ignoring everything else, they just aren't instantly respecting your conspiracy theory that lines up with the MSM. If you want them to believe you, you're gonna have to do more than whine or they will just think you are a shill.

       Forget about Trump at the moment, and lets analyze several instances of a media blitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia hacked our Electric Grid - False claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump met with a Russian Oligarch in Charlotte - false claim
      </p>
      <p>
       Micheal Cohen met with Russians in Prague - false claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia  hacked our election - false claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia leaked emails to Assange- false claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia hacked the DNC - false claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't care about the fact that every week or so there is a media blitz anti-Russia story that turns out to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is a nuclear power. It is dynamic capitalist country now.  Tensions between our two countries are increasing with a proxy war in Syria already playing out. The Baltic states are having increased military presence on the border. Ukraine is unstable.
       <br/>
       War is a real possibility, and I mean a real war. One where the opposing state can damage our country in a real way.  Maybe you don't know these things, and just see this as  politically strategic trajectory to get rid of Trump, or setting up 2020 election strategy. I don't know. What I do know is you are not serious about influence of foreign nations on our government. If that is the case you would be railing against Israel and Saudi Arabia.  At this point the anti-Russia campaign is Propaganda only.

       I will give you my assessment of the situation.  If they did discuss Russian sanctions, which we don't know if they did all we have is anonymous sources, then I think Pence knew, and he lied about it.  Flynn had to take the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       But suppose Flynn did talk to the Russians. Obama administration just threw out Russian diplomats. Obviously attempting to increase tensions.  If Flynn got on the phone as said, " Listen guys, don't react. Don't kick out our diplomats out of a country. We need to decrease tensions. Once we are in power that is going to be our policy'.  I say give this man a Nobel peace prize. It is probably the only good policy decision he has taken.

       First, proof belongs in math and logic. I can provide some evidence and arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second certainty is a matter of degree that one can't induce in another.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can do, is provide evidence for these claims, and then you can use your faculty of judgment to evaluate them.  Let us start with the Micheal Cohen story.

       Look at the vote counts in here.  You currently have 16 points and OP has 9 points yet you are trying to claim that this sub leans towards OP.  Just looking at comment points alone shows the contradiction OP is talking about.

       That's because every time there's bad press about Trump and Russia the sub fills up with emails and Clinton and pizza to deter you from the story. Hard evidence of pizza porn, no hard evidence of Russia ties. Shill. Globalist.

       The front page is basically a constant battle between team A (pro Trump shills and organic Trump voters) and team B (David Brock shills).  At this point, those of us who don't play the partisanship game are just mild noise in this system.

       Ask any atheist what it's like to debate a Creationist and they will say exactly the same thing: you cannot force someone to change their beliefs. Conspiracy Nuts are absolutely no different to the fundamentally religious because they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       fundamentally religious. They have a worldview that has been shaped by preachers, reinforced by echo-chambers, and they so obstinately refuse to listen to anything that goes against their narrative that detractors become enemies.

       Franken: CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week, that included information that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” These documents also allegedly say “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” Again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so you know. But if it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions: Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.

       Flynn was doing his job. Didn't tell Pence he mentioned sanctions.

       Bring up the fact Clinton is a country destroying murderer and people say "why do you care about Clinton so much."

       Or the fact she said she'd attack Iran as President.

      <p>
       Or the fact the DNC rigged the primary against a man named Bernie Sanders, who contradicts himself on Twitter all day just to be contrarian to Trump.

       Or the fact Seth Rich's murder hasn't been solved yet.

       Administration with murky business dealings, record levels of opacity for the president regarding his assets and conflicts of interest... his family business now linked to the executive and does business in all sorts of less than open places.
      </p>
      <p>
       His campaign advisor was tied to Russian intervention in Ukraine, his  security advisor was talking to the Russians about sanctions and lied about consulting fees he was paid before in violation of the emoioemenrs clause, his attorney general who prosecute any malfeasance lied about speaking to the Russians, possibly Russian intelligence leaked his oppositions internal emails...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you don't buy the msm narrative... but why is it somehow assumed trump and his people aren't involved in something nefarious...
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub is truly about transparency, freedom, civil liberties, the truth then one would expect people to demand a special prosecutor, trump to open up his business dealings, and further investigation....
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it's going to be a more pertinent question of who in trumps cabinet is not speaking to the Russians or met with their ambassador and who hasn't been paid by them.

       Do you understand the irony of this post in context to OP?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's a total false equivalency to equate pizzagate and Clinton corruption posts with Trump support.  I think the wikileaks on Clinton and DNC corruption is the best thing to happen for the conspiracy community in years, and my political ideologies lean pretty far left.  I support exposing corruption nomatter what political realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how long have you actually been here? For years this sub has been accepting of Russia for a lot of reasons.  They banned a lot of GMO produce.  Putin simply took businesses away from corrupt oil oligarchs, a completely badass move you'd never see in the West.  He halted the CIA and MIC's move to use ISIS to overthrow Syria by bombing the shit out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your short post history that reads like the talking points of MSM's anti-Trump narrative is just as shady to me as the people here claiming Trump is great.

       I'm anti Trump for pure policy reasons. He's cucked like anyone else, he's economically clueless, he doesn't know what he's doing, and he's gonna set up the next big recession just like W. That said the liberal media can't make rational arguments like that. It's always racism or he's subverting democracy. And these are the people who hate free speech the principle, who are so worried about Trump "behaving" un-democratically and bucking norms

       They were gonna increase nukes regardless of Trunp or Clinton won. And Putin is always increasing it. The thing with nukes is that you don't want to
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       them , which we would had in a potential  a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like the oil drills either but it's idiotic to say that having a good relationship and preventing war is not a good thing. Everyone should be in favor of that, including you.

       there's a difference between a submission that mentions Trump/administration and a submission that praises Trump. Those comments appear on submissions that praise Trump or openly bash an opinion that goes against him, which, on a conspiracy sub, is a baffling thing to do

       The same comments would appear on submissions that praise Obama but those you can just downvote away, the pro-trump posts don't get downvoted because people want them to stay

       Notice how many anti-Trump pro-Democrat handles have shown up in the last few weeks - these are people who never participated in

       Pizzagate was a new subreddit and had mods that weren't sold out yet.  It was a lot easier to ban them than to change the entire mod team.  Conspiracy has been censored and controlled for years, it's not even close to the same thing.  The only cognitive dissonance here is what you face when you punch in on the clock.

       Speaking of, when am I supposed to get my paycheck. I was never told about being compensated for posting on reddit, but that'd be awesome. You seem to know a lot about it, so could you help me out with that? Where do you get your check?

       There is a loyal brigade of pro-Trump people  in this sub from T_D and a small  pro-Trump element organic to this subreddit that blindly upvote and downvote all the Trump related posts. This appears to be a very diligent group of voters that seems to make sure to always vote on Trump posts, upvoting if the submission appears to be positive towards Trump and downvoting any and all submissions that are even tangentially questioning and less than positive in their critique of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, this brigade outnumbers the longtime regulars of the sub who are more or less apolitical and completely understand that our country's elected government is an illusion designed to fool the majority of the population into believing they actually have a say in what our government is going to actually do. These longtime regulars of this subreddit are the people who understand that, in their lifetime, it has always been the unelected  shadow government of the oligarchy and deep military-corporate complex that make all the important decisions in our country. Unfortunately those of us who clearly understand this and are not  true believers in the political illusion or fooled by the theater are in the minority here right now.

       I'm a long-time user here and I completely disagree.

      <p>
       I see 10X as many posts claiming "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is just T_D 2.0, this place sucks now." than I see posts actually espousing Trump uncritically.  And, like OP said, all the posts bashing this sub for being like T_D are highly upvoted where blind Trump support almost always goes into the negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing these detractors conflate is anti-DNC or Clinton corruption posts automatically being pro-Trump.  It's ridiculous, I can't even count the amount of times I've been called a T_Der even though I've never gone to that sub and my political views more often align to the left.  I'm not a fucking Trump supporter just because I'm skeptical of the media narrative of "evil Russia" being forced down our throats.

       This sub has had a problem with a couple right-wing moderators enforcing their agenda long before Trump came around, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's still happening.  Doesn't mean the community is T_D 2.0.

       It was taken down cause I immediately starting spamming the clear shill tactics in real time. My comments were steady negatives when they were shilling and when I woke up, I my comments returned to normal rating when the normal conspiracy users showed up. It was taken off r/conspiracy bc it was a clear ShareBlue brigade. Most top commitments had nothing to with the story but was all about shitting on trump and trying to connect r/conspiracy to T_2.0 in another sad attempt to flip this sub.

       There is a disconnect between the voting patterns of posts and comments. But I'm pretty sure if we were being attacked by bots and shills, that they would mostly focus on posting and voting on posts. It just can't be efficient to delve into the comments in a place like this.

       Sorry, but it's less about posters saying pro-Trump things and really more about how the majority won't even engage with anti-Trump posts. The fact that OP said "We are just skeptical" is the funniest, least self-aware thing I have ever read on this sub. That skepticism is almost never applied in a major way when it comes to anything non-Trump. Yeah, in every thread you have debunkers and what not, but to have Trump-Russia threads disappear and no one talking about Rosneft on a FUCKING CONSPIRACY SUB is all the evidence you need to know that this place has no interest in furthering knowledge and discussion, only more partisan hackery.

       Why do you want us to talk about Trump_Russia.  Why don't you tell me why it's sinister to get along with another country.  Even if Trump was friends with Russia.  Convince me why that is a horrible thing and why I should be focused on that.

       i think the issue has always been did Trump use relationship with Russian to get elected, if so is he beholden to them. There's always the blackmail issue if it's true.

       If there is a blackmail issue there is definitely a problem.  If there isn't though I'm not worried about it.  Lord knows who was trying to help get Clinton elected.  Foreign entities have stakes in our elections, who would have thought?

       Is this a joke? Replace "Russia" with "Israel" and you wouldn't even come close to pretending that what allegedly happened is okay. Nice attempt to slide though.

       Sorry. I usually assume everyone is working with the exact same prior knowledge in here, which is obviously faulty. But yeah. I completely understand the perspective of a lot of people who dismiss the Russia stories as just this propaganda opportunity, but I was at the very least more intrigued and convinced something more sinister is afoot after reading about the Rosneft deals.

       It's ok.  It actually sounds like something with some actual substance and I will look into it.  This is actually the kind of thing I want to see.  People always get mad when I ask for evidence but I am asking for it because if there is some, I want to see it!  Everyone gets so defensive though so it's hard to get actual information without being attacked sometimes.

       We already did the Russia Trump connections. They were baseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy is why so many seemingly disconnected users want us to continue to discuss these Russian connections over and over when there's nothing left to talk about. In this thread they're really asking us to hate Trump or at least hate pro-trump.

       Yeah, just because lots of people disagree with you and call you out on what you say doesn't mean we're all one person. Feel free to check my extensive post/comment history. I must have a lot of free time to run such an active alt account. You should've just called me a shill instead.

       No. what I said was you have nothing of substance to reply with, so you try to ad hominem attack me with falsities. You're lying. I'm saying you should've just called me a shill, because then you could actually maybe believe it. If you think this is an alt account, simply because I called you out, then you need a reality check.

       Yupp. Every day. And I distinctly recall when the Sessions thread was actually up, people peddling the exact same t_d logic of "HE DIDN'T PERJURE HIMSELF, HE SAID HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN! HE DIDN'T LIE!"
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah. I'm not a child. "Not talking to the Russians about the Trump campaign" is a laughable excuse for a man who admitted to being a surrogate of the Trump campaign at that time and just so happened to meet with them at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       "OH HE WAS MEETING IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY FOR THE ASC-"
"ASC: Our members don't meet with Russian ambassadors."
"OH WELL LOOK AT MCCASKILL'S TWEET SHE MET WIT-"
You can be on multiple committees. Homeland Security meeting with the Russians is perfectly normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the excuse now? He met with them, sure, but in a different capacity. Oh, what's that? That capacity also doesn't have a reason to be talking to the Russian ambassador? Interesting.

       There isn't a huge amount of explicit pro Trump sentiment. But all anti Trump posts get downvoted, no matter how credible, and most just stay at 0 because of it. Whenever someone starts prominently speaking out against Trump, this subreddit goes against them viciously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then whenever anything anti Trump makes it to the front page, this sub loses its damn mind.

       are the pro trump people behind the constant flood of pedophile related posts? It feels organized in that is a constant flood that consistently keeps anything trump/russia related off the front age of this sub. Where is the sessions stuff? there are signs of an actual conspiracy with national security implications going on and we are hearing about local prostitution busts.
      </p>
      <p>
       AGAIN, watch what happens. Today sessions is in the news. Just like the flynn scandal before, we will see an uptick in pizzagate, podesta, and hillary stuff even though there is NO movement on those subjects. We will see self posts thrown in, denying pro trump movements on here, asking why the shills are trying to disprove pizzagate. we will see more posts with some variation of 'still dont believe pizzagate, watch/read this'. Maybe even a sticky.

       If you want to go on about the Russia connection there are 100s of subs for that.  I don't know why you would expect to upvote the same articles here as in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .  If there was anything of substance to the "Russia Connection" I would hope our fucking government could pick up and that and thwart it well before these people got into office if it was a real concern.  I mean we spend billions and billions of dollars on the spy machine but somehow Russian puppets are infiltrating our government?  If this was true we should be irate at how incompetent our government is instead of screaming for Trumps head.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually read the articles nobody even has proof of shit and it is all misconstrued allegations.  I apologize if I am going to go with my gut before I start taking marching orders from the Washington Post but this Russia shit just seems insignificant to me.

       the evidence is being downvoted and obscured by employees of 55 savushkina street and the useful idiots protecting the donald. and we arent going to war. we are trying to clear our govt of undue foreign influence bought with money and oil. Why do the pro russia people always assume war mongering? the last thing I want is war, but the first thing i want is to make sure that our nations leaders have our nations best interest in mind, not a foreign power that can make them all oligarchs

       It's sometimes strange to see things from the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most here in /conspiracy have identified that pattern long since, with one notable exception. Any child-fucking news get plastered over with this ridiculous Red Scare 2.0 nonsense...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to troll you or anything, just pointing out that both sides are playing a very irritating game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plus side, in my view, is despite the schism between the Trump haters and the child-fuckers haters, people on both sides are looking at the rich and elites as the enemy, rather than the people who love people we don't approve of, or the people who look different from us, or the people who believe differently from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is that the people running the country, publicly and privately are the problem, and we all need to go us on them, not each other.

       A preliminary report that even Obama claimed failed to draw any conclusive links between Trump and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dossier. A foreign intelligence agency having a dossier on a potential leader of a rival nation proves nothing more than Russia was interested in knowing about whoever is going to run the place.
Or do you honestly think those filthy commies don't have a file on hildawg or Obama?

       The Russia thing isn't a Trump issue in here, it's a media issue. They lie. They feed the public lies, half truths and distractions on behalf of the government and the rich who hold its chain. And if only the media is saying that Trump is in league with those inhuman Reds... it is a pretty good bet that almost anything else is the truth.

       What would be the reaction from the pro-Trump camp be if this turns out to be a plan by him to honeypot Kremlin spies and subversive influence, removing their influence from our politics, law enforcement, and institutions?

       I'm a liberal that likes hanging out here because so many other subs are just boring 24/7 anti-Trump circlejerks. What you're saying matches with what I've seen. The acceptable range of discussion here seems to extend from "both parties are equally bad" to "the Dems are uniquely evil and Trump might be the hero come to save us".

       As I said in the other thread, the most insulting realization for left leaning person in the last election season was that people who bankrolled Democratic party and shoved Clinton down our throats preferred Trump to Sanders (as Sanders was beating Trump in most polls).

       That the same people are now paying their PR monkeys to demonize Trump and pretend that there is some sort of unity on the left is just the icing on that shit-cake.

       Obama was never questioned by the media. Never attacked in this way. Without context, I understand your point. But with the context of the loads of baseless attacks against Trump, this subs response makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is clearly a conspiracy, whether you like him or not, by the media to discredit and destroy trumps credibility. You see this with the purposeful misunderstanding of quotes. The baseless allegations of racism. It's real.

       Did you read that article? It's just about how many times Trump was on Fox. He was on Oprah too, but I don't think she pushed the birthed movement. But even so, Fox is one outlet vs the many who are against Trump. They were without a doubt softer on Obama.

       As I've already stated, the 52 segment are just the times Trump was on. And again, you're only talking about Trump and only talking about Fox quoting political figures. Where are the journalists from multiple sources calling for his head? Where are the papers saying, "Will Obama's term end in impeachment or assassination? Put down Trump and show me ONE MSM journalist making these claims.

       Fox News was one outlet (in a much much different media environment) that was out to capture the far-right vote. They were the equivalent of the National Equirerer at this point, so you're not making a very strong point. This era of Fox News led to ridicule and shame for the network. They reeled it back in after because of how poorly this attitude came off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the current media - they are united except for half of Fox News and Breitbart Media. Nobody else is even trying to be nice to Trump. I love how you have created this huge conspiracy that Trump is getting the media to attack him on purpose as if we weren't watching the last year of election coverage play out. Trump was a 'pied piper candidate' and he punched them in the mouth and stole their lunch money. The media is still trying to do anything they can to remove him. Again, your take on reality is a joke.

       Money, my friend. Going 50/50 makes sense because the market is split similarly. That's what makes it so strange that they are unifying - Trump is a true threat to them. 'The establishment' hasn't been challenged since JFK, and what we're seeing now if the new-age version of it all. I promise you there is more going on than you or I understand right now.

       I never said 100% of media was nice to Obama. There is always the exception to the rule. Larger than that, the media environment was totally different back them. Also, there is money to be made in opposing the mainstream. Lots of reasons FOX NEWS exists, and Obama had some push back too, but not like Trump has dealt with.

       Oh keep repeating yourself until you feel it is true. His speech 2 nights ago was fine. He is learning to shut up and not get in so much hot water. He's not a 'trained politican' like Obama is. Obama was too good - he made us feel good while nothing changed a damn bit.

       I don't think his trademark had much to do with that, to be honest... I think he just didn't realize the pecking order as it is right now. He was picking a fight with the biggest kid on the playground, and I think his counsel let him know to shut the hell up very quickly. Trump is pro-Taiwan because of his business dealings there, but he did not understand the serious nature of the 'one china' policy in terms of international geopolitics. He had to play nice with China. He didn't really have any choice unless he wanted to provoke China unlike any president has before.

       I've never heard of him hiding behind the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Middle East WMDs, or the chemical attacks in Syria or Libya, or even the complete lack of coverage of the attempted coup by the DNC in late 2016 (all examples of actual, factual, "fake news").

       All I hear from Trump is how the MSM lies to the public constantly. Even his stupid fucking travel ban is commentary on the the media's consistent deluge of fake news.  The idiot has bought into the MSM lie that Muslims = terrorists.

       fox news had a great 8 years of that, number 1 news channel. when your party is in office, you might take some criticism. ask obama, bush, clinton, bush, etc. This isnt new.

       Opposition to the Establishment is the reason they hate not the party.  It doesn't matter if you are black, muslim, female, gay or Democrat.  NBC, ABC, MSNBC, CNN and the army of fake news sites like Salon, Vox, Huffpost, etc all hate against those who oppose the views of the Establishment.

       when the president called CNN fake news the next question he took was an absolute fellation by breitbart asking about what reforms to the media he would recommend.

       To be fair, Obama supporters, Bush supporters, Clinton supporters, hell, any and all presidents had fervent supporters who refused to see the truth, and it does nothing but a disservice to the American people as a hole. that still does not excuse their behavior, or his.

       You're right. They fear that if they voted for Trump, and if what the media says about him is true, then that makes them just like Trump. So they refuse to believe the stories about him, or even at the very least listen to the stories about him. Sadly, the ones that refuse to see the truth are the ones that vote the most often. So that keeps Trump and the GOP in power that much longer.

       We did see it with Obama but it was skewing towards the other side of the spectrum. With Obama the media would say something amazing about him and this community would try to figure out what dark secrets he was hiding, same with Clinton during the election. With Trump, the media is constantly on offense which makes many of us wonder why they are trying so hard to make us dislike him.

       Honestly if you look at what he says its not that hard to understand why the media is "portraying" him like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean he spends every weekend at a resort or playing golf, he sticks his foot in his mouth every 5 minutes, has reneged on multiple campaign promises, received a stone cold stunner from a pro wrestler, hosted a reality TV show, first military engagement was a huge failure, then blamed the military, made it legal to dump coal refuse into public rivers, accused the previous president of being foreign born (Never showing his proof), repeated interactions with Russia, backpedaling on one China, removing the EPA, backpedaling on federal legalization, increasing support for private prisons, the first lady did softcore porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on and on.

       Obama definitely didnt get enough shit for silencing whistle blowers or his illegal drone strike campaigns, not closing gitmo but overall he never tweeted out celebrities saying they were overrated.

       What am I making excuses for?  I am saying people, such as yourself, want me to view him as the bad guy for going through with campaign promises while simultaneously also wanting me to be mad at him for not.   Speaking of which I don't know which campaign promises he has backed out of  that you want me to be mad about in particular?  Am I supposed to be upset that Obamacare didn't get completely irradiated?  I just want affordable health care and not to be forced by the government to insure my body.  I don't care how that happens.  Am I supposed to be mad he backtracked on marijuana?  He really hasn't yet.  Nothing has happened and we don't know what is going to happen.  So please, let me know what I am supposed to be mad about so I can quit making excuses.

       No... What Im saying is judge him by his actions. Dont hide behind the idea "The media is unfair, quit being so mean to him"

       I know you guys hate this site but its a fairly comprehensive list of the things Trump has said and his efforts to make those things happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im glad he implemented his plan to get rid of ISIS within the first 30 days... Glad he hired wall street execs for his cabinet when he said he was going to drain the swamp... Suspend immigration from countries that engage in terror attacks against the US... Sure Iran has never once attacked us but SA sure as shit has, but they have Trump property so we cant ban them. The guy is a mess.

       And that private healthcare costs 2x the amount as the next industrialized country. If the ACA wasnt hamstrung during its conception it would have worked much better.

      <p>
       All Im saying is hold him accountable, thats it. The calls for fake media are bullshit and its used to discredit people that criticize him.

       Hold him in his own chamber, dont compare him to other presidents... yet.

       Only thing so far he has done that I think is pretty dumb is the travel ban or whatever you want to call it so I agree with you there.  I also don't care about the wall but think border security is important.  The best way to go about that is debatable.

       I agree that the media was generally positive towards Obama, but Hillary was definitely not treated the same way. The MSM has been loving Clinton scandals for decades. I didn't see much positive coverage for her (or Trump) which is why she decided to hang back and let him soak up the coverage. Which was probably a bad move based on underestimating how much his message was resonating.

       You might be. Along with your establishment Democrat and Republican buddies grasping at Russian straws.
Russia!!! They're destroying democracies across the globe and working w/ Trump!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen leaks on this magnitude.. but I'm sure you have insight into comparable circumstances. Of intelligence anonymously leaking to US media because.... they seemingly don't like the the outcome of the latest election results and scary rhetoric.

       Chelsea Manning has a name.. got any other comparative intelligence links that were leaked to US media corporations? Specifically anonymous.. because that's all we're getting in the first 5 weeks of a new presidency?
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaked Australian and Mexico transcripts.. anonymous
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaked transcripts of phone call between an American citizen (General Flynn) and Russian ambassador.. anonymous

      <p>
       Leaked Yemen mission details.. anonymous
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaked pissgate dossier.. anonymous
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's more anonymous leaks, with no name attached like Charles Manning, that I'm missing.. But-but.. one leak a week is totally fcking normal

       They just downvote you because they don't have any evidence to respond with.  The fact that you are sitting at a negative basically asking for evidence of the Russia bullshit says a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people want us to blindly accept the Russia narrative so bad?  Lets see some damn evidence of something nefarious.  Being friends with Russians even if true doesn't really bother me.  They have more in common with me than the damn Orwellian UK.  Realize that there are Russian citizens too and if we got into conflict with Russia it would be the citizens that suffer.

       The US Attorney General may have lied (or at best, was very misleading) to Congress about contact with Russian representatives at a time when campaign officials have been booted from positions for similar questionable contacts and the top post today are a picture of LBJ "smirk" during swearing in as evidence he assassinated JFK and a post about Hillary emails.

       I'd agree with you if this sub didn't become a Pro Trump sub during the election. Now, you have people defending Trump and making his administration try to look perfect. No, this is not what the sub is for. We questioned all things Obama did, we will question Trump. Take your fanboy shit back to the fanboy subreddits

       There is so much to hate hillary for, and so many conspiracies in her closet, i honestly don't think a skeptic has any business supporting her. That means that in the last cycle, if someone was going to pick a team, and be active, they were either going to be for Trump, Johnson, or Stein. It is no surprise that many were pro-Trump, and it does not show that anything is wrong with the sub.

       You can pick to not support either candidate. Which many I this sub did. Picking one because "they're less bad" is still supporting someone bad. And now that they're in the office you won't hold them accountable or critique them?

       That was indirectly my point; the sub should be filled with either "trump supporters" or "neither supporters", which means that the sub will be more pro-trump than anti-trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, i haven't seen many anti-trump arguments that hold water, and i consider myself a skeptic. He was very clear about what he was going to do, and so far i'd say that, like it or not, he is doing that. He is supporting israel, he is expanding the military, he is reducing regulations on coal, etc. These were all known ahead of time, and many here don't like those actions, but they weren't a bait and switch or a conspiracy.

       A small disclaimer: 'I won't(can't) go too deep into it, and by all means don't take my word for it. I still haven't researched deep enough and my focus isn't the U.S.A. or contemporary times'

       He's remarkably clean, but focusing in on him is one of the ways to be mislead. The Unites States are a huge machine led by think tanks filled with very well educated people.  Not only that but this machine has been refined over a very long period of time. Some people say that the perfection started in the 1950s but personally I would say that it was already at a full blast well before the unites states were founded. Then again I haven't researched enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       But disregarding that completely there are some fairly clear signs (to me) that he is in on the same action they all are. f.e. the democrats and the globalists cheat a 70 year old woman who is being investigated for major war crimes and who knows how much shady work into the front of their list like they want to lose. Then she and her cronies overstate their odds so no one really gets worried and the cheat machine doesn't run at full power. And during all of this, they're supposed to have full access to the NSA and yet are felled(partly) by some run of the mill email accounts.
If I was the establishment I would put some real smart people into figuring out how much dissent there was among the people at all times using metadata acquired from my insanely huge spy machine, and then play up a hero supposedly from the other side when it was time. This is an old strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So over to trump himself, he is insanely easy to misunderstand until you've made up your mind and either way you swing- after you're set he reinforces your belief with everything he says, not only because of the staggering amounts of propaganda against him but because he relies so much on power words and little on content. He gets away with saying things that most politicians couldn't dream of and yet never really cuts to the core. If he had come out in the start with a list of known pedophiles in the government, and other clear lists of crimes that could be verified that would have been one thing. But politician or not, he comes in playing their game and the banks are still doing their thing. Corporatism is a financial duality to fascism after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just from the top of my mind but as I've seen during the campaigns it came clear to people once they started focusing on the things he and Clinton don't say over what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll agree with the sentiment of him being the best chance of ridding the globalists away, but that
       <em>
        strongly
       </em>
       feels like level 2 brainwashing. Being a Hillary fan would in that sense be a level 1 programming but there isn't so much difference. Then there's always the point that globalists care for the globe, not lines drawn on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a good answer but hope it makes some sense.

       Thank you. so why all the hate for trump from people in this thread? Are they just level1 brainwashed? It seems like their hate and efforts would be better used against other targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what would you say to the whole "Trump is hated by the GOPe, the DEMe, the media, and in general
       <code>
        the establishment

       I wholeheartedly agree that the hate is misplaced and should go into real investigation, it's one thing being against trump for being president and another thing to be against him as a part of the establishment- the former being as brainwashed as any clinton supporter. Personally I haven't seen much trump hate here but more intolerance for any pro-trump rhetoric which I suppose is seen as state propaganda. I'd gander that few people dedicated to this sub actually believe the U.S.A. to be a democracy so believing in an elected hero of any kind would be equivalent to burying your head in the sand. Heck even a straight up violent revolution wouldn't be believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I would go as far as saying that that kind of push back from the establishment would almost be a prerequisite for trusting someone. But the real power behind the U.S.A. understands this as well, better than any citizen. You can say that trump "hacked" his way into the presidency by manipulating the press, laying new ground rules, and feeding on the hate so to speak. You could also say that he was made president using the tools of the establishment. Trump was as much elected in, as Clinton was elected out after the primaries and Clinton got a free pass past the primaries.

       I can understand being anti Hillary but the pro Trump thing is crazy to me. This is the perfect time to take them all down but instead people are just moving from "Government and media are against us" to "So we're gonna let this other government and media control us!" is ridiculous. Both sides play for the same time why denounce one side and let yourselves be played by the other?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus Trump is highly suspect, supported by Russia, wanting to move the Israeli embassy to Jeruslam, talking about bringing more christians to the country. I don't understand how a place about conspiracies became pro government.

       Trump is fucking awful, Sessions too (and I sincerely hope he goes to jail for perjury), but at the same time all this Russia sabre-rattling is circuitously tied in on itself. Trump Admin people talking with Russians only matters because of the "Russian Hack!" accusations and saber-rattling, but there is, was, and has never been a shred of evidence beyond "anonymous sources say!" tying Wikileaks's release to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       From someone who has been keeping up with pretty much everything getting posted on the subject, it seems like the media told a lie to deflect from the DNCLeaks/Podesta Emails and their role in Hillary's loss, doubled down on that lie, created elaborate theater to enforce the perception of the truthiness of that lie, and now are demanding resignations and criminal prosecution for lies that only matter if the Russian Hack shit is true in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has shifted from (not, lol) proving allegations that "Russia hacked the election!" into merely having to prove that Trump officials were in contact with Russia, and equating the two as though they are proof of the same conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. it is interesting to note that if Trump is "friends with Putin" I'm pretty sure that that would make him the only President since fucking FDR advocating any kind of friendly relations with Russia.

       It's amazing how people can't see this. This sub is a nonstop smear campaign against Democrats. That's literally the front page every single day. For months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats lost the election 4 months ago and there are Trump conspiracies developing on a seemingly daily basis that are completely down voted and buried. It's so blatantly compromised

       I have NEVER seen a post on this sub claiming, "B-b-but Hillary is a great gal, she was gonna do great things!" Some of us are sick of the beating of a dead horse and consider the matter closed because she LOST. On the other hand, pro-Trump comments are many, with people waxing poetic about how he's going to, "Drain the swamp!, prosecute pedogate!, Make America Great Again! Save the country from the elites!" That is not appropriate content for this sub and that is why you are downvoted. In addition, Trump criticism is always downvoted by this same group, just as I am about to be downvoted. Luckily, I'm not worried about imaginary internet scores.

       I'm not talking about the theory, I'm talking about the comments. No one made a post saying "This subreddit not taking every piece of anti-Hillary news as absolute gospel" etc. No one thought they should be skeptic in a post about Hillary being a cannibal. The reason for that is partisanship and lack of skepticism.

       You are so full of shit. You're only "skeptical" when it comes to the piles and piles and piles of information on Trump's Russia connection.

       Nothing on the page today about the multiple scandals brewing in the White House, but plenty about #PizzaGate--which is somehow absolved from the normal "skepticism" that you claim to value.

       Thank you for this. This should be pinned at the top. There is a reason why people don't believe these Russian stories. We have had tremendous evidence showing how corrupt the Democratic party is:
1.)No coverage about Putin's warnings toward the media over the summer of a potential war that the U.S. is stirring up.
2.)No coverage of the Guccifer hacked emails that showed pay to play, and rigged elections. Same with the leaked Podesta and leaked Soros emails.
3.)The Project Veritas videos with VIDEO PROOF of people being paid to protest and plot attacks against Trump and his supports as well as frame them. Scott Foval and Robert Creamer lost their jobs because of this but the MSM still discredited and ignored everything.
4.)Nobody cared that the debate questions were leaked to Hillary and the woman who leaked them, and admitted to it, still has her job

       It's not just the pro-Trump comments or the shill accusations. It's a distinct lack of quality, supportive or knowledgeable content lately.  Post-election, there's a bunch of people completely uneducated on the level of deceit, the age and depth of "the big picture" and much of the discourse feels like I'm hanging out in a townie bar, overhearing  skull-numbing conversation...

       He is the president.... that makes him government! What more would he have to do to be government in your eyes?!

       He's also had multiple bankruptcies, id say that's anything but successful. That makes him a terrible brand manager. That, along with the fact that anyone knows a good brand manager would stay away from potentially negative political press.

       the evidence is being downvoted and obscured by employees of 55 savushkina street and the useful idiots protecting the donald. and we arent going to war. we are trying to clear our govt of undue foreign influence bought with money and oil. Why do the pro russia people always assume war mongering? the last thing I want is war, but the first thing i want is to make sure that our nations leaders have our nations best interest in mind, not a foreign power that can make them all oligarchs
