    <div class="md"><p>And this is exactly my point. The FBI released this on their investigation</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, <strong>the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision</strong>. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First you have to remember who Justice Dept. they were reporting to. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/politics/meeting-between-bill-clinton-and-loretta-lynch-provokes-political-furor.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/politics/meeting-between-bill-clinton-and-loretta-lynch-provokes-political-furor.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>That meeting happened just a week or so before the statement from the FBI. That AG is who the FBI is reporting to. </p>

<p>This happened just a few days after that meeting and a few days before Comey&#39;s letter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html</a></p>

<p>Back to the letter</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I truly believe that Comey meant what he said here. But I think he knew or at least should have known that there were moles within his people that had leaked their conclusions to the Clintons, which then Bill took to Lynch and told her she can wash her hands of this in the eyes of the American people while still appearing to uphold justice by saying they will leave it to the FBI decisions already knowing that the FBI was going to say they didn&#39;t have a strong enough case. Now this is where the FBIs conclusions are important. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding <strong>now</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I just pointed out, all the prosecutors who this case would be brought to would have conflicts of interest as the broad scope of these investigations and accusations will encompass that era of the DOJ. No reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against their own based off of the current evidence available. Other people accused of the same crimes, with no connections to the DOJ and with no greater implications against the DOJ, would have been charged is what they are saying in my opinion. WHat if other evidence came to light?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. <strong>Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government account—or even a commercial account like Gmail—there was no archiving at all of her e-mails</strong>, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s important to take away here is that the FBI is implying that there&#39;s potentially an unknown number of deleted communications out there that were &quot;periodically deleted&quot; or wiped when devices were changed. Those are the 650,000 emails. Those are the Wiener emails and this letter is from before those emails came to light. Every time Huma and Hillary and crew deleted emails or destroyed/switched devices they thought they were wiping the slate clean but the info was all still being saved on their shared laptop that Wiener took to the NYPD. </p>

<p>My point in asking what you would charge them with, and asking for evidence to back up the charges was to highlight the intensity and the reality of what were dealing with here. This is something bigger than a lot of us really know or understand and its been operating very quietly and very quickly since the new DOJ has taken over. There wasn&#39;t sufficient evidence to support the more serious charges in the eyes of the FBI <em>at the time</em> of their last investigation. A lot has changed since then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  The disinformants keep pretending that investigations only happen based upon having already achieved damning evidence.  Unfortunately for them, that isn&#39;t true.  Justice starts the investigation when there&#39;s reason to suspect criminal activity, not when there&#39;s reason to have already proved it in hindsight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just blows my mind that you have the ability to understand all the specific charges but don&#39;t understand that if they were going to be charged with all of that, the investigation leading up to those charges would be huge, very quiet and take a long long long time. My point is that we as civilians don&#39;t have access to the evidence that is required to bring these charges into the realm of reality. But the evidence does exist. Just be patient.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, yeah... I was a fed for four years, so I know a &quot;BIT&quot; about federal investigations.  The ones that are massive, and extensive, and &quot;quite&quot; are the smokescreen used to kill investigations.  Make sure that several divisions are working round the clock with full cloak and dagger (seriously the office pogs just LOVE this crap), and wait for the news cycle to spin down, then you quietly present a 1500 page report that says nothing and you declare victory.</p>

<p>Real investigations happen quickly.  The longer a case stays open, the less evidence there will be.  Time is the enemy of prosecution, from witnesses memories fading, to physical evidence fading, to bad guys working to cover up evidence and leads.  Lots of guys in the field, lots of interviews, and forensics on EVERYTHING.  </p>

<p>If you think that anyone is TRULY ACTIVELY investigating pizzagate at this time you are fooling yourself.  The arrest that have been made across the country, regarding child porn, is all a bunch of low level nobodies.  Not anyone who could be flipped to testify about bigger fish, not any mid level players, nothing big.  Just a few headlines that keep teasing the reddit an voat crews that &quot;arrests are coming&quot;.  They aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Yeah, he could have been clearer. I think it is pretty fucking obvious however that he was not testifying that he had never had contact with the Russian Government. I mean, he obviously doesn&#39;t have Downe&#39;s Syndrome, so neither would it be believable that he would have forgotten or that he would believe such a lie would be overlooked. His contact with Russian officials under his capacity as a Senator is public record. If you apply Occam&#39;s Razor it seems like the only conclusion one could come to was that he was referencing having no contact as a representative or surrogate of the campaign. I can&#39;t imagine a scenario where anyone could honestly come to a different conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are written questions and written responses for the congressional record, not transcripts from the hearing.</p>

<p>The potential perjury occurs in this exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franken: &quot;CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that quote, ‘Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.’ These documents also allegedly say quote, ‘There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump&#39;s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.’</p>

<p>&quot;Now, again, I&#39;m telling you this as it&#39;s coming out, so you know. But if it&#39;s true, it&#39;s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?&quot;</p>

<p>Sessions: &quot;Senator Franken, I&#39;m not aware of any of those activities. <strong>I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn&#39;t have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I&#39;m unable to comment on it.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t strike me as the most natural reading--at best, the testimony is pretty misleading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Franken&#39;s actual question is how Sessions will respond if it turns out Trump affiliates were cooperating with the russian government during the election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Senator Franken, I&#39;m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than answer the question directly, Sessions volunteers that many consider him to be a Trump affiliate...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...and I didn&#39;t have — did not have communications with the Russians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then flatly denies any contact. He&#39;s volunteering himself up as a representative surrogate and unequivocally denying any contact.</p>

<p>Now, if he had said &quot;I worked as a campaign affiliate and in the course of that work never communicated with the Russian government, or heard of anyone else doing so&quot;; or said &quot;...I did not have communications with the Russians <strong>other than as part of my work as a Senator</strong>&quot; he&#39;d be on much firmer ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he could have been clearer.  I think it is pretty fucking obvious however that he was not testifying that he had never had contact with the Russian Government.  I mean, he obviously doesn&#39;t have Downe&#39;s Syndrome, so neither would it be believable that he would have forgotten or that he would believe such a lie would be overlooked.  His contact with Russian officials under his capacity as a Senator is public record.  If you apply Occam&#39;s Razor it seems like the only conclusion one could come to was that he was referencing having no contact as a representative or surrogate of the campaign.  I can&#39;t imagine a scenario where anyone could honestly come to a different conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point, which apparently went wayyyy over your head, is that the order is specifically directed at transnational crime groups. </p>

<p>Which means that if the activity doesn&#39;t cross international boundaries, it is not covered under the order. </p>

<p>So, if the DC ring can&#39;t be, or simply isn&#39;t &quot;found&quot; to be, connected to international human trafficking, it will not be investigated.</p>

<p>This appears to explicitly exclude the California ring that is part of the Hollywood elite.</p>

<p>The only way that I see that it could affect the Clintons and Podestas and Alefantis is if the authorities investigate the Clinton Foundation people that have operated in Haiti and other countries. If the authorities chose to ignore the international connections, they get off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI Anon here, ignore Bill Clinton&#39;s dozen trips to convicted pedophile Epstein&#39;s pedo sex slave island via the &quot;lolita express&quot;. Ignore Bill Clinton waiving secret service protection for several of those trips. Bill just wanted to hang out with his favorite pedophile on an island where kids are enslaved and raped.</p>

<p>Ignore the Podesta brothers&#39; obsession with pedophilic art. A personal collection of art certainly is in no way a reflection of a person&#39;s views or beliefs in any way shape or form. It is perfectly normal for any guy to have paintings of tied up near-naked children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump himself has said that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with,” adding that he admired the sex offender&#39;s affinity for beautiful women “on the younger side.”<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;<br/>
2. Trump was named in Epstein’s “little black book.”<br/>
Epstein’s “little black book” was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed “14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump&#39;s security guard and houseman.”<br/>
3. Trump has allegedly flown on Epstein’s private plane — a hot spot for under-age sex orgies.<br/>
“Mark Epstein, Jeffrey&#39;s brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey&#39;s private jet at least once,” reports VICE News. “Meanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein&#39;s Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.”<br/>
Epstein’s private Boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, was nicknamed the “Lolita Express.” Roberts recalled “unsavoury” sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with Epstein and his friends. </p>

<p>Donald &quot;grab em by the pussy&quot; Trump would never do anything sexually inappropriate to anyone. He would never intentionally walk into pageant contestants&#39; dressing rooms to catch them naked, talk about fucking his own daughter on national TV... twice, be accused of rape by his wife, or associate with known pedophiles like Epstein. You&#39;re off your rockers if you think this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s just a hankerchief, I don&#39;t know exactly what the person meant by that awkward phrasing, and I agree it is awkward, but it&#39;s certainly not indicative of anything sinister. Also Podesta didn&#39;t write that message he just received it, so even he might not know exactly what the person meant. </p>

<p>As for 65k on hotdogs, literally that&#39;s what it is. When you fly in food for the president it&#39;s expensive. 65k is a ton of money to you and me but elites spend that money on parties routinely, it&#39;s not odd that flying in food for the president was that expensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, fascists gonna fash. </p>

<p>Lets investigate everyone! Like maybe, a government agency should intercept all our communications and decide on whether or not we are breaking any laws. They can have a secret court where we are not allowed to hear the evidence against us decide on whether we are guilty. We should give this group no oversight. We should allow them to arrest you and send you to a secret prison. Maybe name the site after a color or something, like red or maybe black. </p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence would be there is a murder. Even though there is no physical evidence connecting the suspect to the murder. 
-He has no alibi

<p>-He had motive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think you understand how investigations work. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Murder investigation - Person X&#39;s body is found, Person Y leaves physical evidence on the crime scene. Person Y gets investigated. OR - Person X goes missing, Person X is last seen with Person Y. Person Y gets investigated, body may or may not be found. NOT Person X/Y/Z jokes about killing and you find a way to code statements from him to make it look like he&#39;s talking about hiding bodies. </p>

<p>You need evidence of (at least a connection with) a specific crime BEFORE you launch an investigation into somebody. That&#39;s why investigators have to get warrants. Even when you get pulled over, an officer can&#39;t just be like &quot;you look like a stoner, get out of the car I bet you have drugs&quot;. He has to smell something, observe inebriating effects, or see drugs/paraphernalia to establish probable cause for a search. There are both legal and ethical reasons for this. </p>

<p>The fact remains that you can build a pizzagate-like case against virtually anyone for virtually anything. The precedent it sets is a little scary. Unless there are actual allegations, witnesses, incriminating statements (beyond normal statements twisted to seem like something else), or physical evidence, there is no reason for a police investigation whether you believe in it or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, if Hillary has, for a fact, mishandled classified data (a felony) and not been charged how in the hell do think that she would be charged with nothing more than paper thin circumstantial evidence.  Are there any pictures or video of her with &quot;missing&quot; or subsequently deceased children?  Any pictures or video of her mistreating any children?  Any CREDIBLE first hand accounts of her harming a child?  Ok, there is your answer.  If she can get away with the pay for play crimes and mishandling classified data (where there is a paper trail a MILE long) while she was the Secretary of State, she is UNTOUCHABLE when it comes to the bullshit connect the dots logic being applied to &quot;pizzagate&quot;.  </p>

<p>I DO believe that there is PLENTY of fire to go along with the pizzagate smoke, but as a former fed, let me tell you NOTHING that has been put online, so far, comes withing a SOLAR SYSTEM of a prima facie case to present to a court.  There are a lot of unseemly association between the unseemly players, but not ONE SCRAP of ACTUAL EVIDENCE that would lead to a warrant.  If the NYPD has the documents from Anthony Weiner&#39;s computer that has been RUMORED to exist, then they should have filed for a warrant on State charges and screw the FBI.  If the FBI has the files that it&#39;s been RUMORED that they have, then why haven&#39;t THOSE been leaked, it not like the FBI has been leaking like a sieve lately?  </p>

<p>I know that all of the armchair quarterbacks on reddit and voat want to believe that they &quot;KNOW&quot; what&#39;s what, but we used to use the Know (Have facts that would stand up in court), believe (good PC or RS usually circumstantial evidence that would stand up in court), an think (everything from Wild Ass Guesses (WAGS) to pizzagate (pretty sure something is there, but no hard evidence.  Primarily supposition.) to test how close we were to going for a warrant.  If you want to see arrests made, you are going to have to get a hell of a lot closer to the KNOW than the far cold end of THINK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally in a crime it&#39;s about love, money, or power.  So you find the common thread and follow it (You always hear about &quot;follow the money&quot;, well it usually not wrong).  So what do all of these people have in common 1. Powerful people (to varying degrees) 2. Links to missing children (The Podesta brothers uncanny resemblance to the police sketch of Madaline McCain&#39;s suspects, Laura Silsby&#39;s arrest for child trafficking in Hati, Jeffrey Epstein and his island of underage sex slaves, and these people DIRECTLY tie to the Clintons.  While there are PLENTY of things that orbit this nucleus, this looks VERY MUCH like the core of a human trafficking network.  If I were working this case, I&#39;d start interviewing the girls from lolita island, and the original case workers from Laura Silsby&#39;s arrest.  I&#39;d work with the Portugal authorities to rework the McCain Cain (Google the Podesta brother&#39;s whereabouts when Maddie went missing, your blood will go cold).  The REAL meat is not going to be going after THESE big fish, but you have to find a piece of human debris that is orbiting them that you can flip.  Someone close enough to have hard evidence, but not big enough to have someone call the head of the FBI or Department of Justice.  You flip that person (or get a CREDIBLE victim with EVIDENCE to go public), then you start working your way up.  Little fish give you bigger fish, and bigger fish can give you  whales).</p>

<p>When you are investigating a criminal conspiracy, you look for what ties the players together.  You find a weak link in the outer edges of the chain, break it, and climb higher until you get to the top.  Look at EVERY SINGLE instance of these LONG investigations.  You find that someone (not a big fish) was arrested, maybe several.  You get a headline that lasts for an hour, then life goes on.  The real criminals are still doing whatever it is they WERE doing, and no one cares anymore.  The concerning thing about the recent child porn arrests is that people THINK that it is an effort to move forward with the people in pizzagate, when it is nothing more than a dog and pony show.  Hey look we caught all the bad guys, everyone is safe, go back to watching reality TV please.   This isn&#39;t a case of follow the money this is follow the children, and so far I haven&#39;t seen a SINGLE kid from Hati or Lolita island interviewed (publicly or officially).  If they were trying to arrest someone this is where they&#39;d start</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think you understand how investigations work. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Murder investigation - Person X&#39;s body is found, Person Y leaves physical evidence on the crime scene. Person Y gets investigated. OR - Person X goes missing, Person X is last seen with Person Y. Person Y gets investigated, body may or may not be found. NOT Person X/Y/Z jokes about killing and you find a way to code statements from him to make it look like he&#39;s talking about hiding bodies. </p>

<p>You need evidence of (at least a connection with) a specific crime BEFORE you launch an investigation into somebody. That&#39;s why investigators have to get warrants. Even when you get pulled over, an officer can&#39;t just be like &quot;you look like a stoner, get out of the car I bet you have drugs&quot;. He has to smell something, observe inebriating effects, or see drugs/paraphernalia to establish probable cause for a search. There are both legal and ethical reasons for this. </p>

<p>The fact remains that you can build a pizzagate-like case against virtually anyone for virtually anything. The precedent it sets is a little scary. Unless there are actual allegations, witnesses, incriminating statements (beyond normal statements twisted to seem like something else), or physical evidence, there is no reason for a police investigation whether you believe in it or not. </p>
