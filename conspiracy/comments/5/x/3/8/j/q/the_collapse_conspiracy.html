<p>&quot;We now live in a nation where doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the press destroys information, religion destroys morals, and our banks destroy the economy.&quot; </p>

<ul>
<li>Chris Hedges</li>
</ul>

<h2>COLLAPSE = GREED</h2>

<p>We use debt to enslave us with our own greed.</p>

<p>We use school to enslave us to debt.</p>

<p>We use illness to enslave us to debt.</p>

<p>After school, we slave to pay school debt.</p>

<p>We slave to buy a mortgage* to build up enough equity to pay for end-of-life health care debt, leaving nothing for the kids. Our lives are a vicious cycle of debt. By the time the lawyers and bankers are done with us, there&#39;s nothing left for our kids. The chains of our past debt is killing their future. Break free. Take back the currency and credit of your country.</p>

<p>We are slaves to collapse and extinction caused by our slavery to false ideals. Lies.</p>

<p>In the U.K. a police chief said they can&#39;t afford to jail all the people who look at child porn.</p>

<p>The catholic church is a pedo factory. Orphanages, adoption and child protection agencies are used to abuse and enslave our children. </p>

<p>We think war is a welfare program for our youth to get jobs.</p>

<p>We would rather believe lies and die than see the truth.</p>

<p>If we use taxes to pay for education and healthcare instead of war, we could solve most of this.</p>

<p>But we prefer the fugue of denial. We mistake debt slavery for wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anarchy does not equal chaos. It is the &quot;absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.&quot; It&#39;s up to the people whether it descends into chaos.</p>

<p>If enough of The People are stupid, and divided, and filled with hate for each other, they&#39;ll always need leaders to tell them how to live and be. And anarchy wouldn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>If enough of The People are intelligent, well-informed, united, peaceful, and have a common goal of social harmony, they won&#39;t need to elect leaders to tell them how to live their lives. And democracy wouldn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Anarchy cannot survive if its participants are morons. Democracy is easy to steer if it&#39;s participants are morons. The key here is that The People are morons.</p>

<p>This effect can be quickly traced to our education system among other things.</p>

<p>Since there&#39;s no easy money in <strong>not</strong> being a leader, you need to dumb the people down to keep your position of power. And you can do that by federally regulating curriculums to destroy creativity and free thinking, driving the price of college and textbooks through the roof, focusing on sports instead of learning, making people emulate Kim Kardashian instead of scientists, and keeping everyone constantly fighting over who&#39;s better : red or blue.</p>

<p>I like to think Ben Franklin was smart enough to hope for a future of peace, growth, and intelligence instead of stealing from the poor to feed the rich.</p>

<p>But he also though it was a good idea to own people.
Plus he&#39;s dead. So fuck him</p>

<p>Why do we need government? Government creates ALL the problems. If you give people people then they will, one way or another, find ways to abuse it. &quot;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p>All governments are corrupt because the fact is that there is no man that exists that is resistant to temptation. I mean our constitution promoted small government and look at it now - it&#39;s grown massively. </p>

<p>Greed is a natural human trait. So if you give people the power to accelerate their wealth, they will take it. No man is never not greedy. We always want more. It&#39;s natural. Government allows people to steal off others.</p>

<p>Anarchy is the only solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) First and foremost, are you willing to put a gun to someone&#39;s head and tell them what they can and cannot use for money? Even if you find none of the arguments you&#39;re presented with convincing, and think the economy couldn&#39;t possibly function without government controlled money, if you&#39;re advocating government control, you&#39;re advocating the gun to the head.</p>

<p>2) I see little evidence that government or quasi-government controlled money does much to keep currency stable in the real world. Inflation happens all the time (compare today&#39;s US dollar prices to those of 10 years ago), and massive inflation happens fairly often (Weimar Republic and Zimbabwe for example).</p>

<p>3) It is possible to m1ention the government backing currency via the gold standard. There is no reason a private entity couldn&#39;t do the same. If you feel that a currency backed by gold (or silver, or tulips) is the one for you, you would almost certainly be able to find one.</p>

<p>4) There is no particular reason a useable unbacked currency needs to be controlled by govt, either (Useable being the operative word. Government could theoretically force a currency nobody trusted via the gun to the head, but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d qualify that as &quot;usable&quot;). The only backing that the US dollar has that bitcoin does not is government force, which does not come into play all that often.</p>

<p>5) There&#39;s no reason an entity like the Fed couldn&#39;t exist in Ancapistan without government backing. A privately &quot;managed&quot; currency would almost certainly be more stable than central bank currencies, too, since the goal would be to actually keep the currency stable, not fund the government.</p>

<p>I saved this answer from someone a long time ago. It&#39;s not mine but it does a good job explaining it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a true free market and taxation is theft. The reason the rich get away with it is because government allows them too. When you realise that the rich can just hide money in tax havens then you realise that taxation for funding social programs is worthless. So you have 2 options:</p>

<p>A) Tax everyone properly. Doesn&#39;t happen because of corruption.</p>

<p>B) Cut all taxes and all social programs. Never been tried before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you dense, or what?  </p>

<p>This is a chicken and egg situation.  The government is supposed to enact Anti-Trust laws and split these corporations up, they don&#39;t because the politicians are <strong>BOUGHT BY THE CORPORATIONS</strong>.  The problem is that the government is susceptible to bribery and corporate influence, the solution is to strengthen the government by disallowing PACs, lobbying, and campaign contributions.  </p>

<p>Like, take a fucking look at history.  The destruction of the middle class in America starting in the 70s was a direct result of deregulation, union killing, massively reducing corporate taxes, and opening the government to PAC and lobbying influence.  The solution is to reverse this dismantling, not complete it.</p>

<p>Nope, I would love to live in Switzerland or Lichenstein. Both have smaller governments. Switzerland government spending is the least in Western Europe and they have the 3rd highest GDP per capita in Europe. Lichenstein even allows secession to be legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans have no clue that FDR gave the Federal Reserve System in 1933 the power(by executive order) to impose &quot;forced labor&quot; on American Gentiles when the federal government can no longer pay on the national debt.</p>

<p>Everybody should read this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve System is a sovereign power structure separate and distinct from the federal United States government. The Federal Reserve is a maritime lender, and/or maritime insurance underwriter to the federal United States operating exclusively under Admiralty/Maritime law. The lender or underwriter bears the risks, and the Maritime law compelling specific performance in paying the interest, or premiums are the same.</p>

<p>Assets of the debtor can also be <strong>hypothecated (to pledge something as a security without taking possession of it.)</strong> as security by the lender or underwriter. The Federal Reserve Act stipulated that the interest on the debt was to be paid in gold. There was no stipulation in the Federal Reserve Act for ever paying the principle.&quot;Prior to 1913, most Americans owned clear, allodial title to property, free and clear of any liens or mortgages until the Federal Reserve Act (1913) &quot;Hypothecated&quot; all property within the federal United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, -in which the Trustees (stockholders) held legal title. The U.S. citizen (tenant, franchisee) was registered as a &quot;beneficiary&quot; of the trust via his/her birth certificate. <strong>In 1933, the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets and labor of their &quot;subjects,&quot; the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System.</strong></p>

<p>In return, the Federal Reserve System agreed to extend the federal United States corporation all the credit &quot;money substitute&quot; it needed. Like any other debtor, the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan. Since the federal United States didn’t have any assets, they assigned the private property of their &quot;economic slaves&quot;, the U.S. citizens as collateral against the unpayable federal debt. <strong>They also pledged the unincorporated federal territories, national parks forests, birth certificates</strong>, and nonprofit organizations, as collateral against the federal debt. All has already been transferred as payment to the international bankers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people voluntarily pay directly for such things to private companies and contractors. You already do that, it&#39;s just you&#39;re forced to now and the gov takes their cut and then pays the private sector to do it (government doesn&#39;t do shit). Why do we need the government as a shady middle man who waste, steal, and cause needless wars?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You live in a country where a select few oligopolies own nearly all the marketshare in major industries: oil, banking, media, mining, telecom, pharmaceutical. It&#39;s actually even more centralized than that, because all of the controlling shares of those giants are owned by a select few financial corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the goverment empowering them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They use lobbying to give themselves massive subsidies, they ghostwrite bills that create a high barrier to entry for new startups. So much for the &quot;free market.&quot; You probably pay more tax than multibillion dollar outfits like Exxon or GE, or people like Warren Buffet who can exploit tax loopholes. So, now the entirety of the tax burden falls on the lower rungs of society who don&#39;t have the money to avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t have a true free market and taxation is theft. The reason the rich get away with it is because government allows them too. When you realise that the rich can just hide money in tax havens then you realise that taxation for funding social programs is worthless. So you have 2 options:</p>

<p>A) Tax everyone properly. Doesn&#39;t happen because of corruption.</p>

<p>B) Cut all taxes and all social programs. Never been tried before.</p>
