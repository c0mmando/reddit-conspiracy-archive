<p>Why would there be a conspiracy to take all guns away?</p>

<p>Well I don&#39;t know anything about Sandy Hook, but the Democratic party wants to disarm the population because an armed population has the ability to resist totalitarianism, and the Democratic party progressive agenda can only be forced onto a disarmed population.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not some big secret that Democrats are against the second amendment, they are pretty open about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really don&#39;t understand how the world works. For sake of argument I will assume you are not a vegetarian. If that assumption is correct then you are part of the problem (in fact you are a massive part of the problem). I&#39;m not preaching people should be vegetarians, I don&#39;t care, but since you brought up destroying the environment... </p>

<p>Cows (meat consumption) are the leading cause of environmental damage... Since you seem dense, I will break it down for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It takes over <strong>2,400 gallons</strong> of water to produce 1 pound of beef. Whereas it only takes 25 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of wheat. </p></li>
<li><p>Cows release more toxic emissions than all cars combined at any given moment. They are causing way more damage. </p></li>
<li><p>A massive reason we clear cut forests is to make room for pasture land. </p></li>
<li><p>All of the waste produced from cows, plus all of the manure and chemicals we add to sustain the cows, are literally poisoning your local creeks and rivers (hence fish decline), which leads into the ocean... </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but either you are a troll or severely uneducated. If YOU feel so strongly about the environment then stop eating meat. You are part of the problem. </p>

<p>PS: GMO reduces the amount of land you need... More crops surviving means you don&#39;t need to plant as many.</p>

<p>I figured you&#39;d either take the simple route and say: pasture land, I saw Cowspiracy </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>You&#39;d think about it a bit and realize how complex the question is. For starters, you&#39;d probably want to consider transevaporation differences, termites (which alone accounts for 4% of the world&#39;s methane vs 5% for all animals combined) and all other sources of emissions you will find in a forest, age of forest, style of pasturing, natural vs artificial pastures.</p>

<p>You may have considered that without pastures, humans may not exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did you ask a question? You said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are insane.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what I responded to. However, I will admit I&#39;m no expert on the environment. Yes, I watched Cowspiracy, and I feel like many others should as well. Of course there are many other issues in the world, nothing is ever so simple and one sided. </p>

<p>I do feel like you are downplaying the massive impact farming meat has on the planet though. It&#39;s not all about methane // CO2 emissions, you have to consider the amount of fresh water we use... It&#39;s absurd... 2,400 gallons of fresh water for a steak... That&#39;s roughly 60 bathtubs full! We really need to wake up... And the water we don&#39;t waste gets polluted anyway from all of the waste. </p>

<p>Again, there are obviously a lot of environmental issues, there is no one problem or one solution, but we must admit... The amount of meat we eat is not sustainable. </p>

<p>Also... I think we would be fine without pastures. Meat served us well throughout evolution, but nowadays we would all be much better off without all of the beef... We could nearly &quot;cure&quot; starvation, we would be healthier, the environment would be healthier... </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I come off sounding like some vegan preacher, I&#39;m not even a vegetarian I&#39;m just stating facts... I do rarely eat meat, and when I do it&#39;s almost always chicken, but that&#39;s personal preference... I don&#39;t blame anyone for eating meat, it&#39;s practically our culture, but we do need to step back a little.</p>

<p>Your answer:</p>

<p>You immediately took it to the negative extreme. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what you&#39;ve done with most of the topics in this thread. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t downplayed anything. I asked a question; I received an extreme answer. I added context. </p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Livestock production impacts air and water quality, ocean health, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on regional to global scales and it is the largest use of land globally. Quantifying the environmental impacts of the various livestock categories, mostly arising from feed production, is thus a grand challenge of sustainability science. Here, we quantify land, irrigation water, and reactive nitrogen (Nr) impacts due to feed production, and recast published full life cycle GHG emission estimates, for each of the major animal-based categories in the US diet. Our calculations reveal that the environmental costs per consumed calorie of dairy, poultry, pork, and eggs are mutually comparable (to within a factor of 2), but strikingly lower than the impacts of beef. Beef production requires 28, 11, 5, and 6 times more land, irrigation water, GHG, and Nr, respectively, than the average of the other livestock categories. Preliminary analysis of three staple plant foods shows two- to sixfold lower land, GHG, and Nr requirements than those of the nonbeef animal-derived calories, whereas irrigation requirements are comparable. Our analysis is based on the best data currently available, but follow-up studies are necessary to improve parameter estimates and fill remaining knowledge gaps. Data imperfections notwithstanding, the key conclusion—that beef production demands about 1 order of magnitude more resources than alternative livestock categories—is robust under existing uncertainties. The study thus elucidates the multiple environmental benefits of potential, easy-to-implement dietary changes, and highlights the uniquely high resource demands of beef.</p>

<p>They are comparing types of human use; not natural use. </p>

<p>No one has said raising cattle is the best use of all land. But acting like no land is suited to cattle is ridiculous. I&#39;m not arguing I&#39;m in favour of all methods of raising cattle either. It appears that more sustainable permaculture based methods are gaining popularity despite certain mega-industries. </p>

<p>What is being argued is that OP is dismissive without depth and they should develop their positions with more research and understanding. </p>

<p>So then I showed you a study about the harmfulness of livestock production as an example of their claim (which didn&#39;t include anything about &quot;no land is suited to cattle&quot;), so I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Can you tell me what I&#39;m dismissive about? I literally said there are many environmental issues, I said nothing is one sided. I&#39;m simply stating that pasture land is currently one of the most devastating environmental issues, but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t other issues. I&#39;ve said all of this.  </p>

<p>Beliefs, not facts.</p>

<p>These beliefs are founded on very flimsy support, and hence why they are beliefs rather than theories. </p>

<p>The info had no impact on your beliefs at all.</p>

<p>As such, you as an OP will have no impact on this sub at all.</p>

<p>Because you are not providing or supporting theories which change with new info, but merely promulgating beliefs.</p>

<p>Had you taken a step back and considered the new info, then it would inform the reader that you are not operating on beliefs but on the best available info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost feel like it&#39;s not even being a conspiracy theorist, it&#39;s simply being a rational thinker. Hah, maybe the term conspiracy is a conspiracy itself... If we started identifying ourselves as &quot;forward thinkers&quot; the outsiders might start taking us seriously! </p>

<p>I definitely respect the right to own a gun, however I never thought of it as some Democrat conspiracy to remove all guns. For a couple reasons... a) Why would the Rebuplicans want you to have guns? Why do they have your best interest in favour? I feel like they know gun ownership means nothing, therefore they don&#39;t care. I think it&#39;s all a matter of getting votes... On the left people want to hear no guns, on the right people want to hear more guns, in the end both parties know guns don&#39;t matter, so the politicians say what their specific voters want to hear... Because votes matter. </p>

<p>And, to quote what I said earlier in this thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe guns provide a false sense of hope. I don&#39;t deny there is a totalitarian movement, however I don&#39;t believe a violent resistance is realistic. The amount of man power, technology, and surveillance the US military already controls is unbeatable. IMHO, the only solution is to fight through politics, or hope other (less corrupt) countries step in if it ever comes to that.</p>

<p>The days of 1812 are over. The battlefield was a little more even back then. There&#39;s no way (mostly) untrained civilians can combat drones and other high-tech military. </p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely interested in hearing any counter argument. This is just my own made up opinion, and I like counter arguments so I can maybe learn something!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t believe in violent revolutions either, but I would make the case that any and all &quot;powers that be&quot; would consider twice before trying to throw an obvious coup at an armed populace.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Joe Rogan said though, America doesn&#39;t have a guns problem, but a mental-health problem disguised as a guns problem. </p>

<p>That said, a conspiracy I would suggest looking into is actually the environmental lead levels in poorer districts/neighborhoods and its link to violent crime.</p>

<p>I agree with GMO&#39;s and the companies. I like GMO&#39;s, I don&#39;t like Monsanto.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;ve been to the moon. I believe 9/11 was a false flag. And I believe that Sandy Hook, the Charleston shooting, and many others were just the result of sick individuals who wanted to kill people. I think some others <em>may</em> have been false flags/planned, but not all of them.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on leakers/whistleblowers like Snowden and Manning? </p>

<p>I agree with your overall premise. It&#39;s mostly just people being people who want money and power, and will do whatever it takes to get them. I think most politicians are corrupt, but I think most people in ultra-powerful positions like that are. They don&#39;t care about their neighbors or constituents or employees, they just care about making themselves more powerful and rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, yes on 911 and all else, not so much. </p>

<p>Your views on vaccines seem very &quot;virtuous.&quot;  (Must fear what really kills, epidemics: paraphrase). Yet, there have been credible ppl (md&#39;s) from the  health field that have <em>questions</em> regarding vaccine processes (FDA approval,  CDC guidelines, CDC/ industry conflicts of interests, immunity to law suits).  Recent reports of whistleblowers are not reassuring.  </p>

<p>I am certainly <em>for</em> vaccines, they are an amazing breakthrough for humanity. I have relied with utmost faith in the CDC&#39;s reporting of studies that underly the risk:benefit basis for approval, with its list of guidelines. And yet, we <em>see</em>, the predatory and inhumane Pharma industry making unethical decisions and marketing to profit at <em>any</em> cost, example-- Epi pens.  Is it so unthinkable they would not similarly abuse their position as researcher AND profiteer from recommendations? This process is tainted by industry insiders that conveniently get appointed to regulate the industry they just served.  Really?  Foxes in the henhouse? FDA, CDC, Dr&#39;s Organizations... just tooo easy. </p>

<p>Then, the instant tinfoil treatment and ridicule of anyone who questions any of it is quite reliable.  Jill Stein, Ben Carson, to name a couple. Both say they are NOT anti vaxxers, one is GOP, the other Green Party. Both medical doctors who served in their field in high positions. Maybe we should just make sure. Maybe those recommendations are a little too cavalier. Maybe they are taking more chances than necessary to &quot;first, do no harm&quot; NOT, to make a buck. I mean, they <em>do</em> want the masses dumbed down, &quot;compliant and unaware&quot;.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what I responded to. However, I will admit I&#39;m no expert on the environment. Yes, I watched Cowspiracy, and I feel like many others should as well. Of course there are many other issues in the world, nothing is ever so simple and one sided. </p>

<p>I do feel like you are downplaying the massive impact farming meat has on the planet though. It&#39;s not all about methane // CO2 emissions, you have to consider the amount of fresh water we use... It&#39;s absurd... 2,400 gallons of fresh water for a steak... That&#39;s roughly 60 bathtubs full! We really need to wake up... And the water we don&#39;t waste gets polluted anyway from all of the waste. </p>

<p>Again, there are obviously a lot of environmental issues, there is no one problem or one solution, but we must admit... The amount of meat we eat is not sustainable. </p>

<p>Also... I think we would be fine without pastures. Meat served us well throughout evolution, but nowadays we would all be much better off without all of the beef... We could nearly &quot;cure&quot; starvation, we would be healthier, the environment would be healthier... </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I come off sounding like some vegan preacher, I&#39;m not even a vegetarian I&#39;m just stating facts... I do rarely eat meat, and when I do it&#39;s almost always chicken, but that&#39;s personal preference... I don&#39;t blame anyone for eating meat, it&#39;s practically our culture, but we do need to step back a little.</p>
