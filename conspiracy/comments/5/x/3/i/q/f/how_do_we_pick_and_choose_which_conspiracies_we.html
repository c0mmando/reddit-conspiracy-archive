       Well I don't know anything about Sandy Hook, but the Democratic party wants to disarm the population because an armed population has the ability to resist totalitarianism, and the Democratic party progressive agenda can only be forced onto a disarmed population.

       It's not some big secret that Democrats are against the second amendment, they are pretty open about it.

       I believe guns provide a false sense of hope. I don't deny there is a totalitarian movement, however I don't believe a violent resistance is realistic. The amount of man power, technology, and surveillance the US military already controls is unbeatable. IMHO, the only solution is to fight through politics, or hope other (less corrupt) countries step in if it ever comes to that.

       The days of 1812 are over. The battlefield was a little more even back then. There's no way (mostly) untrained civilians can combat drones and other high-tech military.

       He's certainly biased. I feel like a lot of people who are into conspiracies are a little too right leaning, which is ironic because they're the same ones who want guns to protect themselves from the government. At the end of the day, left or right, it's all the same government. The labels are only there to divide us. Especially now.

       I'm missing the irony. Of course the people that firmly believe in a government conspiracy are the ones that feel strongly about their need to protect themselves.

       It's about control though, not all out war. An unarmed population is much easier to control, no? You imagine if there's a revolution there just gonna drone every american citizen?? There's a reason why its the 2nd Amendment, and it has nothing to do with hunting. It's not outdated at all. Not a personal fan at all but I'd much rather prefer a lot of Americans having them.

       There's a curvature to population growth. We're in a period (or, at the end of a period) of explosive growth. We're about to level out.

      <p>
       I'm all for birth control and pro choice. However it's a cultural and economical situation. Good luck getting people in India and other developing nations with different world views to adopt birth control right away. All in all, kids are being born, and I think feeding those kids is more important than fear of technology.

       you sound like a healthy skeptic. Vaccines from a trusted source are good. Also it's not GMOs that are bad, just the patents that monopolize the food source. There's a political solution there that is wholly unacceptable to American corporate masters.

       You really don't understand how the world works. For sake of argument I will assume you are not a vegetarian. If that assumption is correct then you are part of the problem (in fact you are a massive part of the problem). I'm not preaching people should be vegetarians, I don't care, but since you brought up destroying the environment...
      </p>
      <p>
       Cows (meat consumption) are the leading cause of environmental damage... Since you seem dense, I will break it down for you.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It takes over
         <strong>
          2,400 gallons
         </strong>
         of water to produce 1 pound of beef. Whereas it only takes 25 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of wheat.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cows release more toxic emissions than all cars combined at any given moment. They are causing way more damage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A massive reason we clear cut forests is to make room for pasture land.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All of the waste produced from cows, plus all of the manure and chemicals we add to sustain the cows, are literally poisoning your local creeks and rivers (hence fish decline), which leads into the ocean...
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could go on, but either you are a troll or severely uneducated. If YOU feel so strongly about the environment then stop eating meat. You are part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: GMO reduces the amount of land you need... More crops surviving means you don't need to plant as many.

       I asked a question that I'd hoped you'd try to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured you'd either take the simple route and say: pasture land, I saw Cowspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think about it a bit and realize how complex the question is. For starters, you'd probably want to consider transevaporation differences, termites (which alone accounts for 4% of the world's methane vs 5% for all animals combined) and all other sources of emissions you will find in a forest, age of forest, style of pasturing, natural vs artificial pastures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have considered that without pastures, humans may not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead, you've seen Conspiracy so...
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes with many of the examples you have provided here.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You are insane.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And that's what I responded to. However, I will admit I'm no expert on the environment. Yes, I watched Cowspiracy, and I feel like many others should as well. Of course there are many other issues in the world, nothing is ever so simple and one sided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel like you are downplaying the massive impact farming meat has on the planet though. It's not all about methane // CO2 emissions, you have to consider the amount of fresh water we use... It's absurd... 2,400 gallons of fresh water for a steak... That's roughly 60 bathtubs full! We really need to wake up... And the water we don't waste gets polluted anyway from all of the waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there are obviously a lot of environmental issues, there is no one problem or one solution, but we must admit... The amount of meat we eat is not sustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... I think we would be fine without pastures. Meat served us well throughout evolution, but nowadays we would all be much better off without all of the beef... We could nearly "cure" starvation, we would be healthier, the environment would be healthier...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       I come off sounding like some vegan preacher, I'm not even a vegetarian I'm just stating facts... I do rarely eat meat, and when I do it's almost always chicken, but that's personal preference... I don't blame anyone for eating meat, it's practically our culture, but we do need to step back a little.

       If you're asking me if we should have more jungles or more pastures... Obviously more jungles? Who would debate this? I don't think I am jumping to any conclusions, our entire conversation has been about pastures and that is what I've been talking about.

         Abstract
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Livestock production impacts air and water quality, ocean health, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on regional to global scales and it is the largest use of land globally. Quantifying the environmental impacts of the various livestock categories, mostly arising from feed production, is thus a grand challenge of sustainability science. Here, we quantify land, irrigation water, and reactive nitrogen (Nr) impacts due to feed production, and recast published full life cycle GHG emission estimates, for each of the major animal-based categories in the US diet. Our calculations reveal that the environmental costs per consumed calorie of dairy, poultry, pork, and eggs are mutually comparable (to within a factor of 2), but strikingly lower than the impacts of beef. Beef production requires 28, 11, 5, and 6 times more land, irrigation water, GHG, and Nr, respectively, than the average of the other livestock categories. Preliminary analysis of three staple plant foods shows two- to sixfold lower land, GHG, and Nr requirements than those of the nonbeef animal-derived calories, whereas irrigation requirements are comparable. Our analysis is based on the best data currently available, but follow-up studies are necessary to improve parameter estimates and fill remaining knowledge gaps. Data imperfections notwithstanding, the key conclusion—that beef production demands about 1 order of magnitude more resources than alternative livestock categories—is robust under existing uncertainties. The study thus elucidates the multiple environmental benefits of potential, easy-to-implement dietary changes, and highlights the uniquely high resource demands of beef.

       No one has said raising cattle is the best use of all land. But acting like no land is suited to cattle is ridiculous. I'm not arguing I'm in favour of all methods of raising cattle either. It appears that more sustainable permaculture based methods are gaining popularity despite certain mega-industries.

       Can you tell me what I'm dismissive about? I literally said there are many environmental issues, I said nothing is one sided. I'm simply stating that pasture land is currently one of the most devastating environmental issues, but that doesn't mean there aren't other issues. I've said all of this.

       Look, you presented some beliefs as a thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beliefs, not facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beliefs are founded on very flimsy support, and hence why they are beliefs rather than theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       New info was provided, and you ignored the info and proceeded with espousing your beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The info had no impact on your beliefs at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, you as an OP will have no impact on this sub at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you are not providing or supporting theories which change with new info, but merely promulgating beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had you taken a step back and considered the new info, then it would inform the reader that you are not operating on beliefs but on the best available info.

       Except everything I've said (regarding our specific topic at hand) is actually factual. You keep trying to bring my other topics into this, we are talking about farming. That's it. What I'm saying is fact. The amount of water used, the amount of waste, all facts.

       I don't tell people I believe anything to be true unless I think I can make a rational argument for it supported by evidence. Do the people involved have the means and motive to accomplish what the conspiracy says? If the means and motive are there and I can show that it is reasonable to come to a certain conclusion I will stand behind it. Otherwise its just theories and ideas that I file away until something corroborating comes along.

       I may not agree with all your bullet points (I think the war on guns is as real as the war on cash, and both serve the same purpose), but the important thing is to keep using your instincts and objective research, an open mind and a critical eye.

       I almost feel like it's not even being a conspiracy theorist, it's simply being a rational thinker. Hah, maybe the term conspiracy is a conspiracy itself... If we started identifying ourselves as "forward thinkers" the outsiders might start taking us seriously!
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely respect the right to own a gun, however I never thought of it as some Democrat conspiracy to remove all guns. For a couple reasons... a) Why would the Rebuplicans want you to have guns? Why do they have your best interest in favour? I feel like they know gun ownership means nothing, therefore they don't care. I think it's all a matter of getting votes... On the left people want to hear no guns, on the right people want to hear more guns, in the end both parties know guns don't matter, so the politicians say what their specific voters want to hear... Because votes matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, to quote what I said earlier in this thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I believe guns provide a false sense of hope. I don't deny there is a totalitarian movement, however I don't believe a violent resistance is realistic. The amount of man power, technology, and surveillance the US military already controls is unbeatable. IMHO, the only solution is to fight through politics, or hope other (less corrupt) countries step in if it ever comes to that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The days of 1812 are over. The battlefield was a little more even back then. There's no way (mostly) untrained civilians can combat drones and other high-tech military.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm genuinely interested in hearing any counter argument. This is just my own made up opinion, and I like counter arguments so I can maybe learn something!

       Well, I don't believe in violent revolutions either, but I would make the case that any and all "powers that be" would consider twice before trying to throw an obvious coup at an armed populace.

      <p>
       It's like Joe Rogan said though, America doesn't have a guns problem, but a mental-health problem disguised as a guns problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, a conspiracy I would suggest looking into is actually the environmental lead levels in poorer districts/neighborhoods and its link to violent crime.

       I think we've been to the moon. I believe 9/11 was a false flag. And I believe that Sandy Hook, the Charleston shooting, and many others were just the result of sick individuals who wanted to kill people. I think some others
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have been false flags/planned, but not all of them.

       What are your thoughts on leakers/whistleblowers like Snowden and Manning?
      </p>

       I agree with your overall premise. It's mostly just people being people who want money and power, and will do whatever it takes to get them. I think most politicians are corrupt, but I think most people in ultra-powerful positions like that are. They don't care about their neighbors or constituents or employees, they just care about making themselves more powerful and rich.

       Your views on vaccines seem very "virtuous."  (Must fear what really kills, epidemics: paraphrase). Yet, there have been credible ppl (md's) from the  health field that have
       <em>
        questions
       </em>
       regarding vaccine processes (FDA approval,  CDC guidelines, CDC/ industry conflicts of interests, immunity to law suits).  Recent reports of whistleblowers are not reassuring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am certainly
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       vaccines, they are an amazing breakthrough for humanity. I have relied with utmost faith in the CDC's reporting of studies that underly the risk:benefit basis for approval, with its list of guidelines. And yet, we
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       , the predatory and inhumane Pharma industry making unethical decisions and marketing to profit at
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       cost, example-- Epi pens.  Is it so unthinkable they would not similarly abuse their position as researcher AND profiteer from recommendations? This process is tainted by industry insiders that conveniently get appointed to regulate the industry they just served.  Really?  Foxes in the henhouse? FDA, CDC, Dr's Organizations... just tooo easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the instant tinfoil treatment and ridicule of anyone who questions any of it is quite reliable.  Jill Stein, Ben Carson, to name a couple. Both say they are NOT anti vaxxers, one is GOP, the other Green Party. Both medical doctors who served in their field in high positions. Maybe we should just make sure. Maybe those recommendations are a little too cavalier. Maybe they are taking more chances than necessary to "first, do no harm" NOT, to make a buck. I mean, they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want the masses dumbed down, "compliant and unaware".

       </p>
      </blockquote>

       And that's what I responded to. However, I will admit I'm no expert on the environment. Yes, I watched Cowspiracy, and I feel like many others should as well. Of course there are many other issues in the world, nothing is ever so simple and one sided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel like you are downplaying the massive impact farming meat has on the planet though. It's not all about methane // CO2 emissions, you have to consider the amount of fresh water we use... It's absurd... 2,400 gallons of fresh water for a steak... That's roughly 60 bathtubs full! We really need to wake up... And the water we don't waste gets polluted anyway from all of the waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there are obviously a lot of environmental issues, there is no one problem or one solution, but we must admit... The amount of meat we eat is not sustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... I think we would be fine without pastures. Meat served us well throughout evolution, but nowadays we would all be much better off without all of the beef... We could nearly "cure" starvation, we would be healthier, the environment would be healthier...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       I come off sounding like some vegan preacher, I'm not even a vegetarian I'm just stating facts... I do rarely eat meat, and when I do it's almost always chicken, but that's personal preference... I don't blame anyone for eating meat, it's practically our culture, but we do need to step back a little.
