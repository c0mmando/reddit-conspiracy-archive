       It's funnier that they coined "fake news" and instantly got it turned on themselves. Now, when people mention fake news, it's associated with their network.

       Jake Tapper is correct, that "Fake News" term was originally coined in response to the PizzaGate discussions that took place on Facebook after the release of the Podesta emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, these discussions, and the votes of these people, are not scary.  These people made a judgement on Podesta's character, and they decided that he should not be anywhere near a government office building.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also calling BS on CNN for covering it up.  The people saw the pictures, made a judgement call on Podesta.  But, then they made a second judgment call on CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you speak of these people, you are not addressing 500 people on a conspiracy board.  You are condemning the views of well over  a hundred million American's and a duly elected government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unhinged.  You are going against the plurality of the informed. I'm willing to bet you are also going against the morality of the uninformed; perhaps even your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       These views... calling out CNN... passing judgement on John Podesta and that crew... this is not radicalized views or unhinged.  It's as straight and as based as you can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Podesta is a fucking creep.  No one will defend him.  No one that is informed will want him in government.  That's not scary.  That's uplifting.

       Yeah these folks are pretty much deflecting on all the psychotic shit they spout. It's hilarious to sit back and read. I do miss the old conspiracy when it was more benign lizard people talk and such. Now it's a place for t_d spillover,white supremacists to recruit empty headed youths, and desktop detectives trying to bring down worn out politicians with stretchy associations.

That being said, out of all the fake news he couldve mentioned, it was "some pizza place". A little on the nose there...

       Yeah. Part of their dictated talking points are never to actually use the term "Pizzagate." This makes it tough for them, in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liked the post somewhere earlier today that showed people writing "#Pizzagate is not fake news" on dollar bills and other currency. In combo with people scrawling it on bathroom stalls, this seems like a great idea to me---true guerrilla marketing/information warfare.

       I think that's a pretty good indication that even including the word 'Pizzagate' in their straw-man argument backfired; it encouraged even more people to look into the mountain of truly creepy evidence they were intending to divert our eyes from. So now it shall forever be the straw-man who shall not be named, or Google-able. "Something-something Hillary Clinton pizza place."

       I saw this coming from a mile away.  After a whole year of CNN shilling and propagandizing bs you'd think they'd go back to the globalist world domination drawingboard.  It just shows how removed they are of common logic and sense.

       Right? I mean for fuck sake CTR, if you wanted hillary to absolutely lose then just try whacking every internet commentator with a blunt stick telling them they're wrong and need to support the next DNC candidate starting in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       That'll get people to change their minds with abit of hyperbolic name calling with everyone who disagrees with you being a sexist, jewish, racist, christian nazi who supports rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ, most folks think they're good people and dont want any of that much less be accused of one of those(even if they arent actually good).
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching CTR literally decimating their ownsupporters with bullshit like friends dont let friends vote trump. DNC relied on the loudmouth equivalent of a evangelical TV priest - the 'SJW' crowd to mould people into the new party line rather then adopt sanders.

       Honest question: My understanding was that Fake News referred to phony news websites that manufactured stories. Sort of a new version of tabloids like Weekly World News, but more designed to deceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there ever an article published by one of those websites related to Pizzagate? Seems like the origin is usually traced back to Wikileaks and forums where theories developed.

       For him to equate fake news to pizza gate is a lie. They just think we are all so stupid, and yeah 40-50% are dumb as a box of rocks with no idea about politics or the issues, but they will gladly stroll up to that ballot box and gleefully vote for the democrat propaganda machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example of fake news is what the media did last week with the "Media is the Enemy" hysteria. Every fake news media outlet ran with that story and heads were blown, but he never even said that. Trump said, "Fake media is the enemy" but that doesn't play as well as "The Media is the Enemy!"

       They are so disingenuous. That is what really bothers me. Agenda driven media outlets.

       Loving it so far! Hopefully this descheduling cannabis bill passes and all that sweet juicy revenue can help him further rebuild our country.

       Right that seems likely! It would seem Donald Trump might be the most pro cannabis President ever! Is something I can't believe anyone has ever uttered...

       It would have been no better under the alternative candidate, and at least a chance for states rights to exist under Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions is enforcing federal laws. Now there is a bill to deschedule it so that it will no longer be illegal under that law, at which point states rights come into play, which we know Trump supports.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that won't be the play and things will continue to be illegal against all logic. In that case, it's not like there was any viable alternative so I'm not sure what your panties are in a bunch about. I'm no fan of Sessions. You're just another voice in the crowd shouting at the top of their lungs, dying to say I told you so to someone.

       No, I'm another in the crowd telling you Trump is not your friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was no fan of Hillary and actively campaigned against her in 2016, but what would have happened under her was a continuation of the Obama administrations loosening of restrictions on marijuana in jurisdictions where it is legal on a local level.

       Not perfect, but something.

       What you are about to see unfold now is a coalition of Trump (narcissist with lefty city leaning, large organization tendencies) meets Christian right (moralistic, self righteous, belief in self/faith) ... the administration has a fight within it self and none of us might make it out alive. Weed rights were the first to go. They are long gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't believe in states rights, trump doesn't believe in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark my words, align yourself with someone with conviction (Paul or Lee) ... because when Trump explodes you don't want to be anywhere near...
