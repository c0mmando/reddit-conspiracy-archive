       Is this logic faulty?
      </p>
      <p>
       So Sessions interacted with the Russians during the election. Apparently, that's a big no-no that I still don't quite understand why it is forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he did this big no-no. The intelligence community had this information. Yet they didn't release it during the hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They release it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that the step between not releasing it and then releasing it would be a logical time for attempted blackmail on Sessions to control him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why else would they not release it during the hearing? They were hoping to have an attorney general they controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is more terrifying than a person meeting with the Russians. It's what Glenn Greenwald has been reporting on. We cannot appreciate the corruption of the intelligence agencies even if they are working against Trump.

       The big no no isn't communicating with the Russians. The big No No is that he lied about communicating to the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Flynn's Russian no no was for completely different reasons.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If, during the confirmation, he had said "I spoke with the Russians about things unrelated to the Trump campaign, but I had contact." there would have been faux outrage from the left, but no grounds for anything more.
      </p>

      <p>
       Why would they? If Session's had been honest during the hearing there wouldn't have been anything to release.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is definitely part of the deep state long game, but it wasn't about blackmail. It was about having Sessions confirmed and in the AG seat before they run him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Sessions Senate seat is in the hands of a congressional newb and his position as head of the judiciary committee is up for grabs AND the optics of forcing the AG to recuse himself or step down plays well for the deep state and poorly for Trump.

       I disagree. The optics are terrible for the democrats and the mainstream media. This is a desperate play, and it's terribly obvious. The only people they are winning over are the shrinking group of corporate democrats who shill for global corporations.
       <br/>
       Sessions was acting as Senator and member of the committee on foreign relations or whatever. WaPo can take shit out of context, but that won't make people trust them. It just further divides the public. The deep state is divided, and this Russian scam is a failing strategy.

        At his Jan. 10 Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign.

       I think it was an honest case of "misspeak" but it can very much be used to accuse him of perjury since he didn't clarify it, and they are now running with the un-clarified declaration that he "did not have communications with the Russians."

       Of course the logic is faulty.  The globalists are obsessed with drumming up a new Cold War and they are doing everything they can to delegitimize our democratic process by throwing out vague allegations of Russian "hacks" and some "influence" over our elections. They need to reassure their mindless followers that the majority of Americans would never, ever reject such a sparkling candidate like Clinton and Trump only won a pocket of backwoods hicks. That's what this is all about.

       It doesn't have legal recourse which has just exposed a broken system. The reaction in here here would have been much different in here a few years ago. This sub used to stand for basic principles but now it appears it's all subject to how it works regarding your personal agenda.

       Well I'm open to discussion and even modification of my views as far as these basic principles go. I'm far from a dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporter btw. Curious as to why you think our electoral system is broken and what you'd propose to fix it.

       Yes. That's why you don't hear people calling for Trump to resign because he lost the popular vote. The results are still illegitimate when literally millions of more people voted for someone else. This sub used to have principles. I'm sure you remember.

       The fact is the electoral college still matters. Would you prefer the CIA become our defacto government? Because at this point, that is the alternative. It's not worth throwing away the voting power we do have simply because a corporate democrat lost a general election she should never have been a part of.
       <br/>
       Democrats should take some fucking responsibility for the loss, and stop risking nuclear war over some bullshit.

       It's not about democrats or republicans. I think Hillary should have been disqualified and probably prosecuted for her bathroom server and the Clinton Foundation. You'll notice I didn't say the electoral college doesn't matter.

       The biggest issue here is the perjury. Why would he lie about it if was on the up and up? Why wouldn't he just come clean now? If it was being used as blackmail, which I don't believe, why would he have lied and given them that token?

       I agree. It's why we need an independent investigation and his taxes. This is serious shit. If they're all on the up-and-up, clear it up because right now they look guilty as hell. Yet they keep doubling down. They're actively creating the case for appearance. The next time something else drops it's going to be exponentially more damaging, just like this was exponentially more damaging than Flynn. And you know more is coming...

       But the problem I have is that someone is holding on to this intelligence for nefarious purposes, it seems. Or why not just release it to the press now. But if they keep trickling out corruption to take down one after another, it seems that they are actually trying to control politicians. Because to the intelligence community, it seems that a corrupt politician can be a controlled politician. And you only release their dirt when the politician doesn't want to play along.
