        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is this logic faulty?</p>

<p>So Sessions interacted with the Russians during the election. Apparently, that&#39;s a big no-no that I still don&#39;t quite understand why it is forbidden.</p>

<p>But he did this big no-no. The intelligence community had this information. Yet they didn&#39;t release it during the hearing. </p>

<p>They release it now.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the step between not releasing it and then releasing it would be a logical time for attempted blackmail on Sessions to control him. </p>

<p>Why else would they not release it during the hearing? They were hoping to have an attorney general they controlled.</p>

<p>And that is more terrifying than a person meeting with the Russians. It&#39;s what Glenn Greenwald has been reporting on. We cannot appreciate the corruption of the intelligence agencies even if they are working against Trump. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The big no no isn&#39;t communicating with the Russians. The big No No is that he lied about communicating to the Russians.</p>

<p>(Flynn&#39;s Russian no no was for completely different reasons.)</p>

<p>If, during the confirmation, he had said &quot;I spoke with the Russians about things unrelated to the Trump campaign, but I had contact.&quot; there would have been faux outrage from the left, but no grounds for anything more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet they didn&#39;t release it during the hearing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would they? If Session&#39;s had been honest during the hearing there wouldn&#39;t have been anything to release.</p>

<p>This is definitely part of the deep state long game, but it wasn&#39;t about blackmail. It was about having Sessions confirmed and in the AG seat before they run him out.</p>

<p>Now Sessions Senate seat is in the hands of a congressional newb and his position as head of the judiciary committee is up for grabs AND the optics of forcing the AG to recuse himself or step down plays well for the deep state and poorly for Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The optics are terrible for the democrats and the mainstream media. This is a desperate play, and it&#39;s terribly obvious. The only people they are winning over are the shrinking group of corporate democrats who shill for global corporations.<br/>
Sessions was acting as Senator and member of the committee on foreign relations or whatever. WaPo can take shit out of context, but that won&#39;t make people trust them. It just further divides the public. The deep state is divided, and this Russian scam is a failing strategy. </p>
