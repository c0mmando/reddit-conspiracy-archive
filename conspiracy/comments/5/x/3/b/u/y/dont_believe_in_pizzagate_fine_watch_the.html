        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit:  I love the amount of conversation that this post has generated. IMO, it&#39;s obvious that ShareBlue has infiltrated the odds and ends of Reddit. Anyone, who is against an honest and fair, (keyword being &#39;fair&#39;) investigation of these wild allegations deserves to rot in hell. The sad part is, the non-evil side of the FBI already has the evidence sitting somewhere. The go-ahead just needs to be initiated. When that switch flips, shit is going to hit the fan. It will be spun to fit an agenda, but there are big names on the list of offenders. Biggest scandal of all time if true. </p>

<p>My other point being.... we are all conspiracy theorists on this subreddit. It&#39;s the nature of r/conspiracy, which is a beautiful thing because anyone who threatens us of thought provoking conversation sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>Keep it up r/conspiracy. I love you. I love you because you are non-partisan. I love you because the world is too big and complex to be lumped into two political categories.  Keep working together to uncover things. Truth is what we seek. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s being charged with a federal offense. </p>

<p>You have absolutely no evidence whatsoever he is anything but what prosecutors say he is. A gunman who entered Comet Ping Pong with the intent of fact finding at gunpoint. Whereupon he learned what had been told to him as facts about pizzagate were - in fact - wrong. </p>

<p>The &#39;false flag&#39; narrative was made up after the fact by pizzagate promoters to shift their own blame at inciting violence by spreading false and misleading information. </p>

<p>I also find it curious that on the one hand, this prosecution is claimed to be a &#39;false flag&#39; while simultaneously pizzagate promoters argue the lack of evidence they present is worthy of an investigation. If prosecutors can&#39;t be trusted to fairly charge a gunman, why should they be relied upon to investigate Aleantis, the Podestas, or the Clintons?</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence in court relies on physical evidence.</p>

<p>For example, forensics evidence from a gun. And a body with a bullet in it. The forensics specialist ties the bullet to the gun. And determines the suspect has gunpowder residue on his body. </p>

<p>Nobody witnessed the crime. So this forensics evidence is circumstantial evidence. But in pizzagate there is no physical evidence. No bodies. No victims making official witness statements. No forensics tests. </p>

<p>There is no way the coincidences and interpretations of intent in Podesta&#39;s emails add up to a viable court case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most conspiracies have at least some evidence to support them, even the ones with great implications or ones that never had an official investigation. When asked for evidence, this is all you can provide? Forgive us if we&#39;re a little doubtful of this one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certain there&#39;s plenty of evidence for child trade rings around the world, but is there any for this specific store and these people? It&#39;s easy to draw connections when it&#39;s happening elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most pedophiles, from what I&#39;ve gathered, try their best to keep any and all evidence of their crimes against children hidden.  They do communicate through emails but in order not to get caught with an email in their inbox that asks &quot;Do you have any children for sale that I could have sex with?&quot; they use code words.  Now if some of these coded emails got published, they would be a little embarrassing but would not be evidence of a crime because it&#39;s not against the law to email someone to let them know children will be in the pool for their enjoyment. It&#39;s also not against the law to ask about playing dominoes on pizza or hot dogs. Clever folks.   Some people don&#39;t think a ton of this is enough to investigate. Others think, why not? If it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck....     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;m thinking about it. I&#39;m thinking about how every modern court system follows that concept. It&#39;s remarkably similar to the scientific method: an investigation starts with observations and unconfirmed hypothesis, and conclusions/facts aren&#39;t drawn until it is precisely proven so. Through your logic, we should declare scientific laws as fact, then find the evidence to support them later on. You&#39;re setting yourself up for several cognitive biases. </p>

<p>Have you seen Alefantis&#39;s Instagram  (before he scrubbed it), the performances at Comet Ping-Pong Pong by bands obsessed with paedophilia, the comments from the crowd and vocalist during said performances referring to the manager liking little boys, the artwork that Podesta and Alefantis collect which is almost exclusively depicting adults abusing children? </p>

<p>These people are either pedophiles themselves, or they are obsessed with other  pedophiles.   </p>

<p>If you have looked at all the circumstantial evidence and don&#39;t see anything wrong with it, you are a grade-A idiot, or you&#39;re in denial because the accused are allied with your preffered political party.  </p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s not just weirdly worded emails that appear to be using some kind of code. There are emails referring to children being in the pool for entertainment at late night parties, and others where the author says they were excited and couldn&#39;t sleep because a child was rubbing their nose at 4am.   </p>

<p>As a follow-up, I&#39;d also recommend the Corbett Report&#39;s take on this story as it covers it from a comoletely different angle:</p>

<p>You can find both on popular podcast players (I use Overcast for instance). </p>

<p>I watched a few YouTube vids and some website dedicated to it but it seems like a bunch of hand wavy shit. Arguments I hear claim they are Luciferin because some artist said sacrifice chicken to moloch to podesta who happens to go to a pizza place nearby in washington that is known for its thriving gay community with an owner who is gay and posted pics of people using his pizza in a provocative way for art as well as a pic of his child loosely taped to a table smiling. They go on to say he must be a Luciferin too and be using his pizza place as a cover to do pedophilic rituals. Black and white handkerchief email, they claim oh that&#39;s the hanky sign for pedo meanwhile look up hanky code for yourself black means s&amp;m white means safe sex/masturbation black+white safe sex.</p>

<p>Honestly I think anyone who can look past the whole satanic lens can see it&#39;s nothing but a right wing smear campaign against Hillary. Notice how Alex Jones is the one pushing this shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elites and cults have been raping, torturing and killing children (and everyone else) for thousands of years. </p>

<p>In fairness, whole tribes would happily sacrifice an innocent child to whatever god they thought could give them a good harvest or save them from being slaughtered from another tribe. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe in God, or karma, if you don&#39;t believe your actions have any real meaning, if you don&#39;t believe life has any meaning, that it&#39;s just a video game, you can talk yourself into horrible things if you want to. </p>

<p>At that point, all rules are out, they are make believe. Fucking kids, killing kids, killing as many people as you want for enjoyment and money and power isn&#39;t something you lose sleep over, it&#39;s a dopamine release for you. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what people don&#39;t understand about the occult that these people subscribe to. There is no punishment coming for them, you don&#39;t matter, THEY don&#39;t matter, nothing matters, it&#39;s all just make believe. </p>

<p>What scares me the most, is that the monster lives in all of us, we choose to bury it, we choose to cage it with out beliefs of God, or goodness, or that life matters. </p>

<p>Think of all the horrific things you do in video games. Look at the animal you&#39;ll play in a fantasy world, getting a rush, feeling euphoric as you blow innocent people apart, fuck and then kill hookers. In those same games, you&#39;ll also do good things, you&#39;ll help people you choose to and you&#39;ll feel good about it. You&#39;ll choose to help some, save some, and choose to slaughter others when the urge arises. </p>

<p>This to me, is exactly what the elite occult believe. I believe they do charitable things, act sincerely at times, not just to cover their tracks, but because they feel like it, they enjoy the love and admiration they get out of paying for a child&#39;s cancer treatment one day, and another they might just want to see them blown apart by drone strikes. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t often see this thinking here, it&#39;s really my own thoughts after years of looking at both the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; these people do. </p>

<p>To them there is no good and bad, no right and wrong...just making the game as exciting for themselves as they can while they are here.</p>

<p>Wealth gets old fast, power is all these people can strive for. The power of God, to choose who lives, who dies, what the world looks like.</p>

<p>They work together for self preservation, in the past, those who played the game and rose to the top were targets for other players to come kill them brutally. </p>

<p>Now the rule of the empire is democratized and the emperors do not need to fear each other any longer. When new people rise to power, they are invited in to join the party and use their wealth and influence to further the cause. If they refuse, they are dealt with. </p>

<p>It actually all seems pretty simple to me, human nature.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should go to a mental health provider and ask them, they&#39;ll tell you the very same.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t come up with that idea, it&#39;s one of the earliest teachings in mental health study, Freud&#39;s view of the inherently evil nature of man. </p>

<p>The belief in a God, or the fear of imprisonment is a massive deterrent to releasing that evil for most people. What separates those at the top, in their not so secret societies of power, is that they do not believe in God, and they do not fear punishment because they own the punishers, they also don&#39;t believe life has any meaning or value.</p>

<p>You probably think quite a bit of yourself, your so called morals, your advanced enlightened brain, but you have no idea who you really are without the crutch of your cushy life and your fairly safe society. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a CERT team member, I could say I like to help, but really I just like the idea of potential excitement at some point. Either way, the first thing we are taught by law enforcement and first responders is how fucking crazy people get in a disaster and how to stay safe. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just during the panic of a disaster, and within a few days if shit gets worse, no power, no water, no food deliveries to the grocery stores, it&#39;s a fucking warzone. </p>

<p>&quot;Good people&quot; fathers, mothers, teachers, will turn into complete fucking animals when hungry and thirsty, worse if if their children are hungry and thirsty. </p>

<p>Some people will choose to be good, most will not. Do you know why some people choose to be good in those horrific disasters? belief in God, belief in something greater. They face fear and the demons inside them and choose goodness because they believe something better awaits if they don&#39;t make it, that something better wants them to help as much as they can. </p>

<p>The elite don&#39;t believe in heaven or karma, either because they know who wrote all that shit, or it was them that wrote it, or they just choose not to believe any of it. </p>

<p>If they kill you, it doesn&#39;t matter, your life doesn&#39;t matter, you would die eventually anyway, and you weren&#39;t going to accomplish a fucking thing worth living for. Your family and friends that mourn you, they&#39;ll die to, billions of people die, whether it&#39;s today at their hands or 40 years from now in a hospital. </p>

<p>All of this has been pretty well documented by the confessions of elites throughout history, their texts, the work of psychologists, etc. </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many games that let you kill &quot;innocent people&quot;. In fact, GTA is one of the few truly popular series that allows it and none of the story-based-missions has encouraged that since 2002.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s by far my favorite genre of podcasts! I&#39;ve got a few more for you as well haha. Check out Astonishing Legends and you may like Lore.</p>

<p>Mysterious Universe and LPOTL are a bit more comedic than the others, but I really enjoy all of them in their own way. Do yourself a favor and give the Astonishing Legends Mothman and/or Dyatlov Pass episodes. They put in a HUGE amount of research into their show.</p>

Dyatlov Pass is my all-time favorite, and I love when others suggest it here :) Also, the mothman series was a crazy deep-dive, so if you&#39;re listening to that as your first taste of AL....well, buckle in ;)</p>

<p>PizzaGate is about the allegations against a pizza shop, its owner, and John Podesta.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is but a fraction of the theory. Although the name may be misleading, PizzaGate is about implicating those connected to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation in the human trafficking of children, among other crimes. It is speculated that one of a number of ways to traffic said children is through business fronts like Comet Ping Pong Pizza is implicated to be.</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation is guilty of various fraudulent schemes such as pay to play, gun running and human trafficking. This is a well documented fact. The corruption was first uncovered by Charles Ortel and later published in books by Peter Schweizer and Jerome Corsi. See books, &quot;Clinton Cash&quot; and &quot;Partners In Crime&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a question of whether or not the foundation is guilty of these crimes, rather who within the Clinton&#39;s social circle is participating in this illegal activity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pizza part of the &quot;crowd sourced investigation&quot; is more so aligned to the code in the podesta emails.  Investigating the overall activity of those associated the emails or persons and groups relating to the rmails has genereally been the goal.  This is why pizzagate and spirit cooking are used together because it addresses the larger actions of the group.</p>

<p>That possible pizzza related code led to some links which also happen to involve pizza shops.  The act of associating pizzagate with only comet pizza is the most common method to dismiss it.  </p>

<p>If you hate the name feel free to hate the name.  I&#39;ve been watching it all since October and it was never focused only on pizza places.</p>

<p>Granted, as a third party observer, some of the weak associations that lead to large jumps in logic or bias interpretation are some what frustrsting.  Those tend to fall by the side and is a source of why so many people got fed up with Seaman.  He kept mentioning many of the looser and less concrete &quot;facts&quot; that others then use to descredit the whole intent of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; or investigation regarding probable ongoing corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Podesta held a senior position at the Clinton Foundation. Alefantis is associated with Podesta, Clinton, and Obama. Comet Ping Pong is one of the numerous questionable establishments that Alefantis owns. Most of the establishments implicated in this particular trafficking ring are not pizza parlors. </p>

<p>The reason the theory is called PizzaGate is because Alefantis was rather brazen about how he conducted himself on social media while publicly representing CPP. Further investigation confirmed his close relationship with John &amp; Tony Podesta and solidified his ties to the Clinton Foundation. This shed light on a plethora of horrifying details about the alleged human trafficking ring that the Clinton Foundation is implicated in funding/running.  </p>

<p>By the evening of Nov. 6, Alefantis&#39;s Instagram had been scoured by the weaponized autists and Alefantis made it private.</p>

<p>The first post I saw about pizza and pedophilia on reddit was on Nov. 7: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161107234422/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bpa7c/breaking_from_the_anon_who_brought_you_the_laura/">http://web.archive.org/web/20161107234422/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bpa7c/breaking_from_the_anon_who_brought_you_the_laura/</a></p>

Genuinely, unless they are shills, I do not understand why folks would come to a conspiracy sub to say pizzagate is fake, when the circumstantial evidence would be enough to begin an investigation, and if the people accused weren&#39;t so powerful, could be enough for a conviction.  </p>

<p>Like, it&#39;s confounding. If you don&#39;t agree, don&#39;t comment or visit the sub right? There&#39;s so obviously a planned response to anything pizzagate related and it&#39;s sinister feeling. Creepy stuff. </p>

<p>The &#39;Podesta e-mails&#39; revealed the existence of a secret society of pedophiles operating through a pizza place loosely connected to Clinton associate David Brock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this is rated false. Nothing was revealed, only hinted at. This is where the formal investigation by people with no vested interests would come in. However, there has been no formal investigation and there will be no fair investigation. There&#39;s a total media black out of even the thought of pedophilia in our government at this point.</p>

<p>Also, tangentially related thought: wasn&#39;t Snopes implicated as colluding with the DNC in the emails? I can&#39;t recall off the top of my head if anyone else can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more to the tale than we are lead to believe, like the Russian naval interest there, the high number of Russians that live there and the dubiousness of the coup being entirely domesticly fomented. Perhaps over time those parts won&#39;t be forgotten, but it depends on whose version of reality to which you listen. Russia does not have to be the perfect country to acknowledge these things that affect opinion of its actions. If we judged the USA entirely upon its CIA, which largely protects the economic self-interests of Wall Street, we&#39;d be unnecessarily demonizing the USA and its people. Russians are humans too and their government is not run by Satan. </p>

<p>No ,you are wrong. Only the western part of Ukraine wants this and they are not in the majority. That&#39;s what you&#39;re all missing. The pro-russia government had the support of ~55% of the people - those in Eastern Ukraine. </p>

<p>But the seat of Government is in Kiev, where most people are anti-russian/pro-EU. So ofc they&#39;re going to protest. </p>

<p>Also Crimea was part of Russian since they took it from the Ottomans (well technically from the Crimean Khanate, but that was under the  protection of the High Gate). </p>

<p>It was only &quot;gifted&quot; to Ukraine by the Ukrainian N. Khrushchev when he was the leader of the USSR. </p>

<p>So how what claim does Ukraine have to Crimea, a region populated by russians for the past 250 years, where  ethnic Ukrainians are under 10% ? </p>

<p>Or is everything the Politiburo of the USSR said and done so great that it must never be challenged ever again ? WTF</p>

<p>The wishes of the Russians living in Ukraine is to be either part of an Ukraine that is pro-russian or part of Russia. Those people would rather start a civil war then take orders from Brussels. And ofc Russia would support them in every way it can. Those are Russian people who want to live their lives in a country that does not go against everything they want.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate originally involved a pizza shop and Podesta, including those who surround him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. &quot;Pizzagate&quot; started when it was discovered in the Wikileaks dumps of DNC related emails that Podesta and Co. were using what some call &quot;codewords,&quot; such as Obama ordering thousands of dollars worth of &quot;succulent hot dogs,&quot; and Podesta having children over to play in a hot tub. This led people to look at the Podestas a little bit more, discovering their propensity for collecting what many would deem strange artwork by artists who seem to do a lot of work involving bound children being tortured. Gradually people dug deeper into the emails and they discovered connections with the DNC establishment via David Brock to James Alefantis&#39; pizza parlor &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; which was frequented heavily by DNC insiders and media folk. People began to look more closely at Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis, the strange art around Comet Ping Pong, and the connections with the Democratic establishment. As people began to scrutinize this information, there was a backlash unlike anything we&#39;ve ever seen against a &quot;looney conspiracy theory&quot; that &quot;no-one in their right mind could believe.&quot; For those familiar with spin and disinformation, all of this seemed very familiar to the Westminster pedophile dossier and the scandal surrounding Jimmy Savile, both of which were shut down by similar language by a media deeply in bed with establishment insiders who said only crazy people could believe such a thing. The story evolved to include Hillary Clinton running a sex dungeon in the heart of DC with an elaborate system of tunnels connecting all of these places. </p>

<p>In short, &quot;Pizzagate&quot; began as a real story that got drowned out by disinformation meant to discredit and marginalize anyone who even mentions it. No matter how well developed a reasoned argument is, on Reddit anyone can go back through your history, see you made a comment &quot;in support&quot; of &quot;Pizzagate&quot; and anything you said, regardless of the facts cited, is meaningless. &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is, or became, a limited hangout that serves multiple purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think the word &quot;waitresses&quot; means? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think, and my interpretation is equally as valid as yours because neither of us were party to the email.</p>

<p>This group clearly had a similar &quot;Chicago hot dog day &quot;in the past. They hired people to serve the food. Perhaps these people did not traditionally work as waiters. Maybe the Obamas &quot;turned the tables&quot; by serving the food themselves. Thus, Michelle Obama was their &quot;waitress,&quot; but she&#39;s really the First Lady. Or instead of the Obamas, maybe they had attractive adult models serving the food. So the writer is saying that he wants the person who served him food, who is not traditionally a waitress, to serve him again because it is a humorous twist or something. </p>

<p>There are soooooo many possible interpretations of this. You are reading into it to find a possible meaning that supports your narrative. I have conversations with friends often that a third party would not understand and that could be misinterpreted. That&#39;s why I am a strong advocate of digital privacy. You are doing EXACTLY what privacy advocates fear the US government would do with a digital record of all private communications - you are looking at past conversations to find anything that is incriminating or can be interpreted as incriminating to impugn political enemies. You are taking thousands of communications and picking out small snippets to create a narrative to discredit a person or group of people. This is what we fear, and yet this community has no problem doing it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>looked into the &quot;hot dog party&quot; a bit awhile back and it looks like the original Stratfor emails, which were dated May 14, 2009, are specifically referring to Obama flying in the chefs of Pi Pizzeria in St. Louis to cook pizza for them in the White House. This occurred the first week of April in 2009.</p>

<p>If you read the emails Fred Burton writes: &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?&quot; He heard about the money spent on flying in chefs and then makes a quip about how they should use public money (taxpayer money/client money) for their Chicago Hot Dog Fridays, (which I&#39;m guessing involved a guy&#39;s night out with strippers/prostitutes/drugs). I think that the use of &quot;waitress&quot; was meant to reflect the same thinking--as long as it&#39;s paid for using other people&#39;s money then it&#39;s cool. Remember, these emails were referring to events happening in Austin, Texas, not DC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I&#39;m going to break this down line by line</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. &quot;Pizzagate&quot; started when it was discovered in the Wikileaks dumps of DNC related emails that Podesta and Co. were using what some call &quot;codewords,&quot; such as Obama ordering thousands of dollars worth of &quot;succulent hot dogs,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code words that came from 4chan, and as pointed out &quot;succulent hot dogs&quot; appears nowhere in the emails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and Podesta having children over to play in a hot tub. This led people to look at the Podestas a little bit more,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely untrue, the emails i&#39;m sure you&#39;re referring to talk about a political fundraiser where someone said three children would be using the heated pool. So starting off with a complete misrepresentation of the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>discovering their propensity for collecting what many would deem strange artwork by artists who seem to do a lot of work involving bound children being tortured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of art you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t even owned by him, not to mention liking weird art isn&#39;t a crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gradually people dug deeper into the emails and they discovered connections with the DNC establishment via David Brock to James Alefantis&#39; pizza parlor &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; which was frequented heavily by DNC insiders and media folk. People began to look more closely at Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis, the strange art around Comet Ping Pong, and the connections with the Democratic establishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes he donated to the Democratic Party and had a fundraiser. The rest of this is just trying to paint that as something nefarious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As people began to scrutinize this information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which as pointed out, was all bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there was a backlash unlike anything we&#39;ve ever seen against a &quot;looney conspiracy theory&quot; that &quot;no-one in their right mind could believe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah after somebody WENT INTO THE PIZZA PLACE WITH A GUN thinking he was going to save children because he bought into the bullshit. And spare me your false flag trash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those familiar with spin and disinformation, all of this seemed very familiar to the Westminster pedophile dossier and the scandal surrounding Jimmy Savile, both of which were shut down by similar language by a media deeply in bed with establishment insiders who said only crazy people could believe such a thing. The story evolved to include Hillary Clinton running a sex dungeon in the heart of DC with an elaborate system of tunnels connecting all of these places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first attempt at connecting pizzagate to a real incident of child abuse to give it legitimacy. The rest is what this sub was actually talking about, a post about the tunnels made the front page like 2 days ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, &quot;Pizzagate&quot; began as a real story that got drowned out by disinformation meant to discredit and marginalize anyone who even mentions it. No matter how well developed a reasoned argument is, on Reddit anyone can go back through your history, see you made a comment &quot;in support&quot; of &quot;Pizzagate&quot; and anything you said, regardless of the facts cited, is meaningless. &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is, or became, a limited hangout that serves multiple purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate was always bullshit from the get-go and i&#39;ve never went through anybody&#39;s history to make an argument, but it&#39;s happened to me on this thread alone multiple times so</p>

<p>In short you are an absolute disgrace to your username and might as well change it to Fred or the Beast.</p>

<p>Nah. Read the email, dear. It says,</p>

<p>&quot;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzato (11, 9, and almost 7) so you&#39;ll have some further <em>entertainment</em>, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that, I&#39;m done breaking down the rest of your nonsense point by point. Rich elites fuck children, and from the Westminster pedophile dossier, to Jimmy Savile, to Dennis Hastert, to Jeffrey Epstein, there is proof of it all.</p>

<p>Incidentally, John Podesta was traveling buddies with Hastert. Do you travel with friends you don&#39;t have anything in common with? And who appointed the judge that gave Dennis Hastert his light sentence for fucking children? Obama appointed that judge.</p>

<p>Or what about Epstein and Bill Clinton&#39;s multiple flights to &quot;Sin Island&quot; on the &quot;Lolita Express&quot; without his Secret Service detail? Why would Clinton, a known pervert and serial assaulter of women, travel to a private island where Epstein fucks underage prostitutes without his security detail?</p>

<p>The dissonance reduction is strong with you, my friend. The Democratic establishment, and the Republican establishment, all associate with notorious child fuckers. </p>

<p>You have trouble reading, don&#39;t you? I covered all of this in my initial post about the evolution of &quot;Pizzagate.&quot;</p>

<h2>Fail.</h2>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious regardless of what I say, you will continue to flail around as you are. You&#39;re apparently incapable of wrapping your head around any of this.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t see the problem with wealthy politicians associating with wealthy pedophiles. So what if they are friends with kiddie fuckers and child diddlers? That doesn&#39;t mean they like to fuck kids too. I&#39;m sure when Bill Clinton flew with Epstein out to &#39;Sin Island&#39; on &#39;The Lolita Express&#39; he went into the other room when Epstein started fucking the underage sex slaves.&quot;</p>

Here&#39;s the problem with having this conversation with this sub -  A skeptic makes a thorough post then a PG &quot;investigator&quot;  will ignore 70% of the post, address one point with a blatant misrepresentation (FBI link, for example) and then attack the poster through post history or just calling them a shill (or a pedophile).</p>

<p>I see so many logically inconsistent replies, outright fallacious reasoning, and personal attacks that I just point and laugh now.  This is the main reason that I&#39;m such a skeptic now.  It&#39;s not just the idiotic assertions (Clinton and Kuru), it&#39;s the inability to have a conversation with someone who espouses the ideas posited by &quot;PG&quot; people.</p>

<p>The cryptic language in the Podesta Wikileaks from back in late October / Early November was the final straw. My Heart is just absolutely broken over this.

<p>Turns out, it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>The true number is about 20 US kids per day are kidnapped for prolonged periods. Less than 1/20th of 1% of the 800,000 are criminal stranger abductions. </p>

<p>Of the 800,000, 99% are found within hours or days by usual law enforcement response.</p>

<p>The 800,000 includes children who run away. If a kid runs away multiple times in a year, each time is counted separately.</p>

<p>The 800,000 includes those kicked out of their homes by their families.</p>

<p>A very large subset of these (&gt;200k) are related to custody disputes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to argue against a pizzagate investigation. I&#39;m simply pointing out that your numbers are sensationalist and misleading in context.</p>

<p>According to FBI stats, the number is closer to 330 per year who are abducted by strangers. 2200 are abducted by non-custodial parents. </p>

<p>Something else to keep in mind that these stats are only accounting for <em>reported</em> missing children. This doesn&#39;t include numbers for those unreported (how could you ever figure that number out anyhow?). Many children used in sex trafficking are subjected to this by their own or adopted parents.

    <div class="md"><p>I think maybe you need to take a break from conspiracy stuff, man. Based on some of the stuff you say here, like good vs evil, us vs them, calling for executions. It seems like this stuff is turning your worldview very dark. Especially if you find that you&#39;re losing interest in activities you used to enjoy. That&#39;s a red flag for depression and other bad things.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll probably just tell me to fuck off and wonder what my motive is. I don&#39;t really have one. Just hope you&#39;re doing OK, fellow internet person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I genuinely appreciate your concern.</p>

<p>My worldview is dark because the reality of my situation is that I currently live in a very dark world. It&#39;s just soul-crushing... I see Human Beings as capable of so much and with our current technology; World Peace is easily attainable. It&#39;s just a matter of loving each other, but these sociopaths are incapable of that. The knowledge that the wealthiest of us are vampires capable of harming Children on the scale that they are has truly shattered me. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re right; I do need to take a step back from all of this and focus on my own life, a day at a time, while simply praying that this gets resolved at some point soon. It has taken a severe toll on my mental state. I am not doing well, but at least I&#39;m okay physically.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that things have been tough. I definitely respect your passion for justice, but in pursuing justice you also need to be fair to yourself, know what I mean?</p>

<p>Not sure if you&#39;re interested in my take on things, but for me what helps is knowing that the world is largely populated with good people who want to do good, but have a lot of human flaws. When I look at the world, I see lots of broken shit. But that&#39;s mostly what it is, things which are supposed to work, but don&#39;t. Because of chaos, randomness, and human error.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, embracing the idea that the world is kind of derelict with no one having full control has given me some peace. Most of the bad things that happen are because of there never being enough to go around rather than true malice. </p>

<p>I do think that one day (long after I&#39;m dead) we may live in a truly post scarcity society, and a lot of these problems will go away as if by magic. This is a weird time in human history, since we know a lot but haven&#39;t yet managed to apply that knowledge to solving the big problems like war, disease, famine, ect. Kind of like an awkward pre adolescence, I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, take good care of yourself. If you don&#39;t, then who will?</p>

<p>This is truly what I used to believe, but it is absolutely not the reality of our situation. We have an extraordinarily wealthy elite ruling class that has more than anyone should ever have. The disparity between the rich and the poor makes the economic realities which sparked the French Revolution look like absolutely nothing. Trillions in assets &amp; wealth is what these people have. Trillions. They are living as Gods among men; not even just mere Kings. </p>

<p>They have control of the Federal Reserve &amp; the money creation system and have essentially completely won the game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like playing a game of Monopoly against someone who is acting as the banker and finding out that they have been cheating the entire time. Do you just keep playing the game?</p>

<p>Alright now what if you find out that the person you are playing Monopoly against is also a sick bastard who likes to harm innocent children in the most horrific ways imaginable? Do you just keep playing the fucking game?</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I am at this point. They won the money game ages ago and there is no way to fix it short of seeing these people executed and collecting the loot. They create the chaos. They feed on fear and terror; it drives them. That is not a normal human condition but it is their modus operandi; order out of chaos. They are truly sociopaths and they look at the average Human Being as being an inferior slave. And they have indiscriminately enslaved ALL of us. Now that doesn&#39;t mean that it is impossible to find happiness on this Earth, because it isn&#39;t. But they have DEFINITELY effectively won the game and control the wealth of nations. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to go back to thinking it was just misplaced intentions, ignorance, stupidity, and apathy that create our problems but it is so much more malicious than that. We truly are being duped at every corner. </p>

<p>I believe we are fully capable of seeing the post scarcity society as early as tomorrow if we were to eliminate the prime players of this horrific game. Hell, we need to simply start playing a new game instead of their bullshit manufactured money game. It has us successfully divided &amp; conquered. </p>

<p>We as Humans require so little to live fulfilling lives... Love, food, water, warmth &amp; shelter. That&#39;s it. Meanwhile these monsters need much more than that and they are insatiable; it&#39;s never enough. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling and I do greatly appreciate your concern. Day at a time is what I need to focus on and aye, should lay off even thinking about these glaring issues for at least awhile. I am certainly incapable of solving any of them, so it doesn&#39;t really do me any good to stress about it. </p>

<p>I sorta dove head first into the shallow end of a pool and need some time to recover. But I&#39;ll be okay.</p>

<p>Regardless, God bless you &amp; yours &amp; thanks again.</p>

<p>Be well.</p>

<p>Spotlight is a good movie about that. It&#39;s a Hollywood movie based on the coverup of pedophiles in the Catholic Church in Boston.

    <div class="md"><p>The best explanation of I&#39;ve heard of it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the stupid conspiracy stuff that this subreddit spews. </p>

<p>In Catholicism, it is not a sin to be gay, rather it is a sin to act upon those urges. This motivated a LOT of people who could not act out their sexual preferences to seek a life of celibate priest. Obviously, nearly no one can contain their sexual urges their whole life, so there are many stories of priests being found at gay bars and whatever. This is embarrassing for the church because part of it&#39;s whole tenants is to deny your urges and live your life based on their teachings. So, in order to prevent these breaks in celibacy from being spread and causing the church more embarrassment (and more importantly, cause more doubt in the faith of their congregation), they shifted priests around, moved them to places where their actions weren&#39;t known. </p>

<p>This is the same logic of why pedophiles became priests and the same logic of why the church tried to cover up their actions.</p>

<p>The &quot;Hypothesis -&gt; Prediction -&gt; Test -&gt; Repeat&quot; loop is still present.</p>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis: &quot;X murdered Y&quot;</li>
<li>Prediction: &quot;X was on location of the murder of Y&quot;</li>
<li>Test/Observation: &quot;X was on location Z during the time of the murder&quot;</li>

<p>I&#39;m afraid not. There&#39;s a lot of dumbasses calling pizzagate proven fact,  and wanting the accused people to be jailed without investigation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not against more investigation. I&#39;m against people calling the conspiracy proven again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When &quot;tens of thousands&quot; (if that is even an accurate number) of people try to <em>investigate</em> something, but they don&#39;t know anything about how legal investigation works, they&#39;re guaranteed to <em>completely fuck it up</em>. And that&#39;s what Pizzagate did.</p>

<p>Rule 1: Don&#39;t make your investigation public, and don&#39;t post your updates in a public forum.</p>

<p>All other rules: Refer to Rule 1.</p>

<p>The &quot;investigation&quot; has resulted in a social media brigade on the people they&#39;re investigating. Not only did they tip-off anyone they <em>might</em> have gotten actual dirt on, they&#39;ve brazenly and openly trolled and threatened people who are innocent of any provable crime.</p>

<p>I keep saying the argument that if they don&#39;t want the harassment, then they should clear their names. That&#39;s terrorism. That&#39;s holding peace hostage. It&#39;s not justice, and it&#39;s not how justice works in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. It&#39;s a red herring. It is not whether you believe the conspiracy is true or false
Why should you believe without sufficient evidence to believe? Question those that have false certainty, they are prone to self-deception, but don&#39;t be falsely certain that they represent the entire group of people who have suspicion based on the available evidence. False certainty is an insidious problem in belief systems and discussions. </p>

<p>I was being up facts like</p>

<p>THey are not investigating it!!! The media spun the term pizza gate to make the whole thing seems stupid so people like you spew their narrative of there being no evidence when that&#39;s because they have not investigated it!!! Of course shady shit is all over those emails but just because it doesn&#39;t say &#39;we&#39;re molesting kids&#39; you don&#39;t find it as proof because there hasn&#39;t been an investigation.. what!? You expect the govt to investigate into itself for this stuff? No thy are going to call it something g stupid say it&#39;s fake news and cover everything up like Ben swann..  when in reality pedophilia runs rampant in D.C. And there is proof of that </p>

<p><a href="http://wjla.com/news/local/carl-carey-arrested-on-child-porn-charges-74734">proof of D.C. pedophiles being a common problem</a> 
And
<a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/27/daniel-rosen-former-state-dept-official-convicted-/">more proof</a> 
Here
<a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/tampa/press-releases/2012/former-state-department-agent-sentenced-for-transportation-of-child-pornography">lots more proof</a> for ya that state dept officials had a hard time keeping their hands of child porn. </p>

<p>these aren&#39;t even all the D.C. State dept officials who have been arrested, but seeing these people get arrested and thrown under the bus, I must ask you, shouldn&#39;t they investigate into what was on wieners laptop and podestas computers?</p>

<p>No,, the media will just make fun of us because of the. Wry term pizzagate and fake news they brandished into everybody&#39;s minds </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you look at that. After 3 callouts that you&#39;ve been caught in the act you realize you can&#39;t bluff your way through hard evidence.

<p>But congratulations, you were the only person posting &quot;evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>By pulling that stupid little stunt you did more to discredit pizzagate than any shill ever could.</p>

<p>Luckily I&#39;m such a good person I won&#39;t let your failure reflect badly on everyone who supports pizzaga- oh I&#39;m sorry. That was a lie. I&#39;m quite the petty person.</p>

<p>And you set the bar <em>VERY</em> low. (Downvoting my callout on your lie while you&#39;re writing a &quot;i lied&quot; comment? Now that&#39;s levels of petty I believed to be in the realm of myth.)</p>

<p>By the way, I&#39;ll be deleting my comments in this discussion. You&#39;ve ruined it by lying, and others have made my point in a better way. I won&#39;t be responding to whatever you may reply to this. We&#39;re done here.</p>

<p>This comment will get nuked too, after 20-30 minutes. Feel free to downvote it, I&#39;ll be losing more karma from deleting my comments than from your downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I glossed over everything on purpose. I can enumerate three reasons for that. The first is humor. The second is that there are already enough internet resources that painstakingly analyze every detail in people&#39;s social media accounts, looking for &quot;hints&quot; of pedophilia, unable to reach <em>any</em> conclusion beside &quot;this man is a pedophile&quot;. There is a huge difference between &quot;let&#39;s look at this thing and see what&#39;s in it&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s look at this thing and see how it relates to pedophila&quot;.

And
<a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/27/daniel-rosen-former-state-dept-official-convicted-/">here</a> 
Are examples of people in the state dept having been arrested involving child pornography. So now I ask you, knowing the rampant problems of pedophilia in the govt, make your statement again knowing this.</p>

<p>&quot;You have weird photographs on the wall, these emails  obviously are code talk for something weird either drug or pedophile related and this pizza place is weird. &quot;
But your response is we should ignore it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You showed two cases of possession (and transportation) of child porn and one of attempting to contact minors online, from the last five years. According to Wikipedia, the State Department has about 69000 employees.</p>

<p>Does State Dept pedophile employees being <em>arrested by the government</em> make me think the State Dept is not, in fact, a pedophilia ring? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Does it even look like an investigation? Absolutely not. It looks like someone is using Google (which by the way is obviously controlled and run by the CIA, am I right?) to connect everything they can to pedophilia, and then shout that they found new evidence. No, a game of use Google to make up more dots and then connect them by force of speculation does not count as finding information and calling it an &quot;investigation&quot; is ridiculous.</p>

<p>&quot;Govt affiliates&quot;! As if there aren&#39;t literally millions of government employees. If your Google searches for government employee + pedophilia didn&#39;t show any results, then <em>that</em> would be clear evidence for shady play, because statistically there are going to be pedophiles working for the government. You&#39;re taking the expected result and treating it as evidence of something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much exactly what I believe. I know 100%, no doubt at all that there are nefarious groups of people across the globe commiting appauling crimes against children and vulnerable people. Running child sex rings for the elites and politicians. To deny this would frankly be absurd.</p>

<p>I think it would also be absurd to deny that the whole Podesta/Alefantis clique are weird. The whole dynamic is &quot;Off&quot;.</p>

<p>With that being said, I just don&#39;t see credible evidence YET. I think its important for good researches and/or the authorities to be looking into these people and when its done in an honest, unbiased way it should be commended. It would not shock me in the least if they were actually doing the stuff they have been accused of.</p>

<p>Some of the people researching this don&#39;t understand what proof actually means. I&#39;ve been called a shill for expressing these opinions before, it might happen again now.</p>

<p>I also think the name pizzagate has been tainted. Some people are just going to automatically reject anything with the name pizzagate in it, and I can kind of see why (although I don&#39;t agree that any info should ever be automatically rejected). Some of the claims are plucked out of thin air and are quite possibly dis-info to distract away from the genuinely concerning info. There is almost certainly people within the voat communities keeping tabs on what is being shared and it would no suprise me if they are throwing in the odd outlandish claim to discredit the rest of the community.</p>

Every other sentence you try to dispute, she comes back with some bogus explanation. You dispute that explanation, she offers another contradictory response. It&#39;s sad really, but she&#39;s free to believe what she wants. Just about everyone believed in a Santa Claus once upon a time, but that changed and so will these people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im just getting into the youtube video you recommended, it makes me sick in 2 minutes talking about 300 boys killed a year just in houston, even if that number is greatly inflated its still horrid, and excludes girls, and &quot;ordering&quot; a child as if he is ordering takeout. It sounds like something out of a screwed up dystopian novel. </p>

<p>I feel the rabbit hole goes much further than I could ever care to investigate. Its bothersome that you send an article of chicago, I grew up in chicago, about 5 miles from John Wayne Gacy&#39;s home, and my grandfather was a shriner so clowns were a thing in life, even with that happening prior to me being born it still something I heard quite a bit about, Jeffrey Dahmer is another &quot;local&quot; and it makes me wonder how much of this could have spawned from either the pedo porn, and/or trafficking in the area. </p>

<p>Knowing that things like this are the reason parents didnt allow nearly a whole generation to go outside. </p>

<p>I dont know, this is some of the craziest shit... Im out of words to express my anger, and my distaste, and the fact that their is even a possibility that Pizzagate is real shows a reason to investigate it significantly, but to see all the  &quot;alphabet&quot; agencies ignoring this shit is insane!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I wish I could.</p>

<p>I did read the indepth article in Texas Monthly. I don&#39;t think it quite did him justice, but it was a lot of good info.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to wonder if he himself was a victim. His background has all the markers he mentioned in the documentary that pedophiles look for.</p>

<p>And there is just so much pain in his voice, even from the beginning. Watching him from the first few seconds that he begins talking is one of the most arresting experiences I have ever had. It sort of freaked me out a little, I had to stop watching it for a bit and come back to it later.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t 100% agree with his conclusion that this has nothing to do with homosexuality. I think he was wrong about that. While certainly not all gay gays do that, they ones who were doing it were gay because they exclusively sought teen boys, not grils.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t decide if the lack of information available points towards a desire to &quot;forget&quot; or bury the information or just that he wasn&#39;t very noteworthy, besides the single Texas Monthly article and his documentary. It would be interesting to go back into newspaper accounts to get information on his so-called assassination attempt, work with the University, etc.</p>

<p>I took the &quot;pain&quot; in his voice to be more of a general horror/frustration with what he views to be an epidemic and largely ignored by the powers-at-be. It&#39;s tough to compare the context though - today, we have things like the internet and a variety of news sources that report on a number of different stories, while in the 80&#39;s, information was much more streamlined. I&#39;m also under the impression that his partner is still politically active but has disavowed his previous work?</p>

<p>I think the connection to homosexuality you suggest is complete bull-shit. It&#39;s 2017 - we know better than that now. Almost every documentary/book/news story that tackles the issue of child-trafficking/slavery does a great job of considering that children of both sexes are impacted. Just like with everything else, evil knows no gender/sexuality/age/nationality/etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the deal though. These men exclusively want to molest teen boys. That&#39;s pretty much a homosexual situation.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t go after girls. They only want boys. </p>

<p>So in this situation, what he is talking about isn&#39;t human trafficking across the board. He is talking about grown men who only want sex with teen boys. Sometimes it&#39;s worse that just sex, as the boys testified to. But it&#39;s not a cross-sexual situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, I&#39;m not saying that it is singularly a homosexual issue! I apologize for misstating my position.</p>

<p>My point was this: The point at which I personally would disagree with Professor Philpott is his declaration that these men specifically, (who were buying the boys), were NOT homosexual.</p>

<p>His contention was that because some of these high powered men were married, they couldn&#39;t be gay. </p>

<p>My contention is that they were in the closet and this was their outlet. He however seemed to believe that a married man could not be gay. I disagree with THAT part of his conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No apology necessary - I&#39;m just responding to what I understood your argument to be - this is what civil conversation is all about! :) Thanks for being so willing to discuss!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the psychology of so-called &quot;johns&quot; who use and abuse children to be able to definitely state their sexual orientation. While I agree that many of them probably are gay and used the exploitation of &quot;throwaway&quot; children to satisfy their urges, I would think you&#39;d finally a similar dilemma with heterosexuals. </p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be enough information to support the assertion that these sort of events are still occurring, at least at the same rate and in the open like they were in the late 70&#39;s, early 80&#39;s. Do you think the introduction of a gay rights movement and a newly generated social openness about homosexuality has brought those numbers down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never thought about it that way. </p>

<p>I think part of it is also linked to occult beliefs and rituals. Like deep down humans that reach a certain level of power and corruption meet other similar people who are prone to a hidden/suppressed human nature. The same way ancient humans in positions of power would perform weird sacrifices. It would happen in many ancient powerful civilizations like the Mayan and the Inca. There must be something deep down our primitive brains that calls us to commit such acts. </p>

<p>Your comment sparked that theory in me. It makes a lot of sense now that I think about it. I&#39;ve always had the belief that humans really haven&#39;t evolved much in the past 1-2,000 years. We&#39;ve just learned a lot more. Our technology has evolved, but not us. Thus, we have al these hidden and suppressed tendencies about us happening behind closed door. It is hard to fight nature and instinct that is deeply trained into our primitive minds. I believe it has something to do with genetic memory. </p>

<p>There are many fascinating genetic memory experiments that have been done on chickens and other animals that are fascinating. Quick example; take young chickens bred for 3-5 generations sheltered from the outside world. Place them outside and cast a moving shadow over them. A circle shadow does nothing. A square shadow does nothing. However, when a falcon shaped shadow hovers above they quickly run for cover. The knowledge and data has been passed down genetically.</p>

<p>Perhaps, not all humans have the same primitive instincts, but somewhere deep down in our collective DNA there is a possibility for the chance for some of us to come out with a genetic memory to strive for massive amounts of power and dominance. Perhaps with that same gene there is a higher chance to be led towards some sort of pedo and human trafficking vice as well. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s as simple as elites becoming so powerful and wealthy they get bored of everything fun so they have to start doing weirder and crazier stuff. </p>

<p>Thanks for the thought provoking comment!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is an archetype which is nearly ubiquitous in the collective unconscious. It&#39;s the diametric opposite of God, or whatever creative force present in the culture. And due to its ubiquity, it&#39;s powerful. Did you know that there are priests and ministers who don&#39;t literally believe in God, but publicly subscribe to the dogma because of the power that images have? The principles of which God is a personification of, are good, and using God&#39;s image are useful in helping to mend people&#39;s trauma, or give meaning to their life. For many people it works, they have an ally. It&#39;s like a cosmic placebo pill. </p>

<p>Well, Satan works the same if you&#39;re attempting to organize sociopaths and encourage their worst impulses. If a person can commit a horrible crime with the archetype of God, Satan, (or Travis Bickle) in mind, it becomes a way to compartmentalize ones day-to-day self from the crime. And if you were committing child abuse, integrating Satan into your abuse ceremonies just also happens be a fantastic means to discredit witness testimony. It&#39;s unbelievability in our modern secular culture is an asset, not a liability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genetic memory/instinct really is fascinating stuff. There are plenty of examples of it alive and well in humans, too. Being able to swim from birth is one of the big ones. One of the subtler ones that I think gets overlooked is that our earliest dreams are about falling. What better way to warn ourselves than to experience it in a dream. It&#39;s also one of the few universal dreams, dreams that virtually everybody has as a child, diminishing with age.</p>

<p>To your idea of DNA coded for personality aspects, I used to think it played a larger role than I do now. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something there, traits or behaviours that are advantageous, and I&#39;m sure it varies between individuals exactly what traits they carry, but I think experiences play a bigger role in becoming who we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not know about the falling dreams. That&#39;s fascinating. I&#39;ve definitely had those before and so have my friends. Such a crazy feeling to be jolted awake by that dream. Perhaps our ancient ancestors fell of cliffs too much. Or were thrown off cliffs in wars...</p>

<p>True. We are all products of our environment. AI is helping us realize this more. There&#39;s also a great movie about this AI robot that grows in a ghetto environment after he is stolen. I forget the name, but it&#39;s a movie from the UK. I recommend it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The falling dreams have fascinated me for years. I don&#39;t think that we have the first clue about how it occurs or is passed on yet, but I would be very surprised if it weren&#39;t coded somewhere in our genetics.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve figured out recently (we&#39;re starting to figure out) that life is capable of recording new data to its DNA, and can successfully pass these changes to the next generation of offspring. Perhaps our distant ancestors survived traumatizing falls and were able to respond to the threat in this way. It&#39;s clearly a very advantageous adaption, which would go a long way to explaining how widely expressed it is in our population.</p>

<p>Speculation and conjecture, but I hope that one day we see real research on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life is capable of recording new data to it&#39;s DNA. Hmm... I guess that goes along with why the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. The rich grow and reproduce handing down an instinct to succeed in an industry and culture they&#39;re already in. Not only that, but they are born with an advantage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the poor grow and are born in a terrible environment, but also with terrible pre-coded DNA instincts. I hate to sound like a dick, but too many poor people are irresponsible and reproduce way too much. Some of them it&#39;s like they have no self control. Some have child after child with multiple mothers. The parents have no discipline, have built no real talents or business and let nature raise their children. In my opinion that&#39;s no recipe for success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. You&#39;re right in that humans have not evolved much since we discovered agriculture. Techonolgy is quickly outpacing our species&#39; evolution, which is why we have so many illnesses never seen before in first world countries. Our bodies are not built to be in a shelter all day, hunched over in our computers, eating foods high in sugar, having blue light bombard our eyes at night, etc. </p>

<p>In regards to your thoughts on some &#39;hidden drive&#39; humans have for sacrifices and other ritualistic ideas, I disagree. It&#39;s not necessarily that power brings out these psychopathic tendencies in us, but I think that psychopaths naturally seek out these positions of power. These individuals, devoid of any moral compass other than the desire to enrich oneself even at the expense of others, are usually intelligent and possess charisma which they use to manipulate others. </p>

<p>Now, that isn&#39;t to say that power does not corrupt -- it is well known that wealth and prestige change one&#39;s very brain chemistry. But for the most part I think it is psychopaths seeking these positions rather than every human having this &#39;instinct&#39; buried deep inside our genetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Great reply. I agree. A lot of our civilization is very wrong. I wouldn&#39;t say much is on purpose. Just an effect of us stumbling forward as we develop and evolve. One example that comes to mind is our calendar. There is a better calendar we could implement that would make so much more sense. Also, there has been studies done about human&#39;s natural sleep cycles. It goes something like they put people in a dim room for days and the natural sleep cycle that comes forward is much different than the sleep cycle we are forced into by our civilization. These are a couple of examples that science has brought light to that we could implement to create a happier and more productive civilization. I think small scientific reasons like this are part of the reason depression keeps going up with the masses. If we applied these studies to our civilization the impacts would be positively enormous. I make the connection to keeping pets. There are certain ways to keep certain pets. If the conditions are not met, the pet becomes stressed, depressed, don&#39;t eat, and in some cases suicide.</p>

<p>Just want to point out I don&#39;t think all humans have that drive. Sorry if it sounded that way. I agree with your way of putting it much more. I&#39;d also like to point out that there are people that want power to help their families and in the process realize that they are swimming in a pool of psychopathic megalomaniacs. And when in Rome... they must blend in and learn the same behaviors and mentality.</p>

<p>&quot;Changes one brain&#39;s chemistry.&quot; That&#39;s fascinating. I think that also goes in hand with the point I touched on above.</p>

<p>Also, to clarify a little what I meant in my first post about genetics... I meant that in our DNA there is that &#39;instinct&#39; or gene to be powerful, or occult, or submissive. Through chance some people get the Power craving gene and others the submissive gene. I think that even if you kill all the psychopathic megalomaniacs they will always return in some form because it is programmed deep into our &quot;gene pool.&quot; Generations down the line the Psychopathic Megalomaniacs will reign again through chance and nature. Feels like this is what has happened now and we&#39;re all hoping there is a cleanse of some sort soon. Thankfully, all the technology helping us gain new data and knowledge is helping us by providing the transparency the 99% have needed for centuries to stand up to the corrupt establishments.</p>

<p>I remember reading this actually a while back! Wasn&#39;t it something like two 4 hour cycles with some activity in between? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>True. Something like religion seems to be natural to us. I think it is because we are a very social species -- we have the natural drive to  be part of something bigger than us, and religion is one way to fit that mold.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I believe that psychopaths are often more prominent just by natural selection. I would contend that you had to be psychopathic to a certain extent in order to survive before we had modern society. Psychopaths value themselves first. High-functioning psychopaths are a perfect hosh-podge of intellect, charisma, often athleticism, and , to be a little cliche, &quot;evil.&quot; This means strong psychopaths often survived more and were able to pass on their genes.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not Pizzagate. That&#39;s what some people are trying to turn Pizzagate into because they&#39;re embarrassed that the <em>actual conspiracy</em> it began as <em>simply has no foundation</em>. Unfortunately, even those people are stupid, because half of the community is still hung up on Podesta, Comet Ping Pong, pizza shops in general, and every website that happens to have a swirl in the graphic design.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve read everything posted over at Voat. It&#39;s all speculation, and there is no direct evidence of any sex crime.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate was founded on the premise that the food references in the Podesta e-mails are some kind of &quot;code&quot; for child sex abuse. The problem is that the &quot;code&quot; is based on <em>pure speculation</em> and that <em>no pre-existing documentation exists</em> which can verify that code.</p>

<p>So yes, Pizzagate has no credible foundation.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more believable?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>John Podesta, who is apparently known for being a foodie, happened to leave a food-related snot-rag on a counter in a house that&#39;s maybe for sale or had some things for sale in it.</p></li>
<li><p>John Podesta raped a child in someone else&#39;s home, purposely used a hanky to get blood and semen on as a &quot;keepsake&quot; of the crime, absent-mindedly left that keepsake behind, and was bailed out by a real-estate agent who totally gave him the option of <em>not replying at all</em>, and then <em>replied anyway</em> only to tell them that the &quot;keepsake&quot; <em>didn&#39;t actually matter</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If an explanation is based entirely on speculation and <em>raises</em> more questions than it answers, it&#39;s <em>a poor explanation</em>. Plus, deductive reasoning means that you have to eliminate <em>the impossible</em>. In this case, I would consider the first answer <em>incredibly possible</em> and the second answer <em>highly improbable</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do you one better; I&#39;ll provide you with the only single thing Pizzagate has produced that has any potential credibility.</p>

<p>Maybe the graphic designer googled &quot;child care&quot; or &quot;child love&quot; and found that symbol, but it&#39;s still close enough to the mark to warrant inquiry.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t the FBI looking into <em>that</em>, you might ask. Who says they haven&#39;t? The Pizzagaters are asking all the wrong questions, and so few of the right ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get hyperfocused, not unlike the people &quot;researching&quot; this thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m self-employed, but winter is my slow season.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it is about Pizzagate that got me so caught up in it at first, or what it is that&#39;s driving me to take such a hard stance against it now. Maybe I feel like combating human trafficking is a truly noble cause, and Pizzagate has gone about that in literally the most reckless and idiotic way possible.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you have design linking to anything?</p>

<p>Maybe if I can tear myself away from arguing on the Internet, I can work on that. Probably make another Imgur album for it. I hate getting graphic design work, though, so I&#39;m more reluctant to advertise it. Heh.</p>

<p>Also who owns snopes? What makes them msm? </p>

<p>Also you still haven&#39;t &quot;proven&quot; what makes this pizza conspiracy a legitimate concern. And, not some politically charged fever dream of the alt right.</p>

<p>Check out the other dude&#39;s link to rationalwiki on this. More debunking of specific &#39;theories.&#39; If you&#39;re actually going for truth, you have to be skeptical. The stuff that survives scrutiny is what has potential value, not this bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quoting a Wikipedia article that claims it&#39;s a debunked theory, and trying to pass it off as gospel is a joke. And claiming that if the MSM says it&#39;s debunked than &quot;it definitely must be debunked&quot; is also pathetic. You obviously don&#39;t care that the MSM lies on a daily basis to serve whatever narrative they are trying to tell.

<p>Like I said, I am getting help and I want to help other children, and overall I think that pizzagate is just hurting children in the long run. Pizzagate takes takes resources from real investigations. Also pizzagate looks silly from an outsiders perspective, so if a real tip came out of a different kind of business then that business can use pizzagate to its advantages by saying something like, &quot;ohh those wakos are just trying to make us look bad&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be fair, James Alefantis also potentially threatened to kill IsThisGameOfThrones and his family. That is also worth considering. The vast majority of the researchers are simply people trying to ensure that no children are being harmed by these deeply creepy people, get answers, and lobby for a proper investigation, and many of them have been threatened as well, with violence or legal threats.</p>

<p>But no, vigilante justice isn&#39;t a good idea here, and threats only garner support for the suspects. There is likely something extremely shady going on, giving the entrenched network of deeply creepy people and the obvious media cover-up, but we don&#39;t have absolute proof yet.

    <div class="md"><p>James Alefantis also potentially threatened to kill IsThisGameOfThrones and his family</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the video. If it&#39;s true, it&#39;s understandable. Pizzagaters have been doxxing his co-workers, associates, friends, and family, trolling social media accounts, calling him up with death threats. If I were in his position, I&#39;d have lost my shit a lot sooner than he did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not fair to harass someone and then use the fact that they get pissed off as evidence that you must be onto something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the entrenched network of deeply creepy people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kinds of relationships and associations you&#39;d expect high-profile political types to have? Calling them &quot;deeply creepy&quot; is not evidence of a crime. I know lots of &quot;deeply creepy&quot; people, and I have no reason to suspect any of them of being child rapists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the obvious media cover-up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a conspiracy theorist, <em>everything</em> that fits the narrative is &quot;obvious&quot;. A dude with a rifle showed up to Comet. Of course it&#39;s going to make the news. And since there isn&#39;t any actual evidence of any wrongdoing by anyone &quot;involved&quot;, then yeah, the media is going to take Comet&#39;s side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lobby for a proper investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine it&#39;s hard to convince the FBI to take interest in something that doesn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny. Besides, according to the IsThisGameOfThrones, Alefantis claimed that the &quot;FBI liked&quot; it. I would assume that means that the FBI contacted him about the Pegasus/killroom thing.</p>

<p>If they haven&#39;t taken an interested by now, it&#39;s because there&#39;s nothing to take an interest in. But Pizzagaters (half of them, anyway) are <em>determined</em> to keep digging because they&#39;ve already convinced themselves that there&#39;s something to dig up.</p>

<p>Being a public &quot;investigation&quot;, that just encourages people to keep doxxing, keep harassing, keep being unqualified idiots.</p>

<li><p>Monica Petersen was killed for investigating child trafficking in Haiti involved with the Clinton Foundation.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>But then again, can we ever really &quot;know&quot; anything? Right? I mean, Joe Biden was just groping the girls shirt, right? We can&#39;t PROVE he&#39;s a pedophile or anything. It&#39;s really hard to know things that the media hasn&#39;t pre-digested for us, I totally understand. </p>

<p>Laura Silsby was tried by the local authorities.  </p>

<p>Unproven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis visited the White House on same day as Laura Silsby, and also has ties through Max Maccoby.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of people visited the White House that day. Does that mean Alefantis is &quot;connected&quot; to them all?</p>

<p>You can daisy chain just about everyone in D.C.; that&#39;s how the world works.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Making jokes about something doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re &quot;comfortable&quot; with it. Also, &quot;mountains of creepy shit&quot; doesn&#39;t implicate crimes of any kind. It&#39;s character assassination, plain and simple. </p>

<p>Nothing to do with Pizzagate.</p>

Can we please get a new name for elite pedo rings pizzagate is so stupid. I feel people Chase so many and unprovable dead ends. Can we please get some real investigation. There are people talking about these rings but so many of you seem to be focusing on something that doesn&#39;t seem to exsist just because you don&#39;t like certain people.

    <div class="md"><p>If I have to read &quot;Shareblue&quot; again in a post... Fuck it I can&#39;t keep any promise I make about that. This case did involve a high ranking republican lobbyist and I have yet to watch the documentary but from what I&#39;ve read for sure some shady shit.<br/>
The problem is your leap of logic...<br/>
You&#39;re trying to connect an incident with a republican lobbyist being caught with an underaged male prostitute in the whitehouse (In the 80&#39;s) to a non-existent or yet to be proven conspiracy involving pizza related codewords interspersed within the emails of government employees supposedly whose job it is to maintain a underage massive sex trafficking ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong.<br/>
Sounds kinda nuts, huh?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t yall give me a virus and shit.  Holy crap this site is a bunch of prostitutes.  It is so gross.</p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m new to this new level of stupid.   Dudes the entire conspiracy section is non-reddit drivel.  Is that something to be proud of?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any discussion here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was once almost kidnapped when I was about 5 or 6. I got lost from my mom at the store. This lady told me she would help me find my mom. I waited with her as she paid for her things. I remember walking back to her car, with her, it was so long ago I don&#39;t remember why I turned around, but the next thing I remember is running back into the store, finding my mom, and she never even realized I was gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s a possibility. Like we could have put her things in the car then gone back into the store.</p>

<p>I think the reasonable person, if they see a lost child does not take them out of the store. They usually try and find the parents right then and there.</p>

<p>If I were to see a lost child, I would walk with them to the front of the store, and tell the first employee I saw. There is no way I would walk outside with them to my car.</p>

<p>I think I just felt a really weird vibe. I think that is why I went back into the store by myself.</p>

<p>I was once almost kidnapped</p>

<p>But your story doesn&#39;t substantiate this as fact. It only insinuates it as a possibility.</p>

<p>A lot of the conspiracy-type stuff I read suffers from the same problem. If something <em>seems like it might be true</em>, it&#39;s <em>accepted as fact</em> and then <em>reiterated as such</em>.</p>

<p>If you were to find a child lost in the store, what is it you do? Do you tell the child to come with you? Do you buy items without notifying the employees the child with you can&#39;t fund their mother? Do you walk the child back with you to your car?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bigger story is the battle between good and evil, and if there&#39;s one thing that proves the validity of God, its definitely pizza gate. As someone who has gone deep into the rabbit hole Ill definitely spare you tons of time that you can in other words spend on researching something even more interesting then pizza gate, and that&#39;s reading the bible. Truly I say to you all we&#39;re in those days and you all need to get right with Christ, I&#39;m telling you... our government, your fave celebs and talk shows are all in on it, they&#39;re Satanists and most people are too but they just don&#39;t even know of it that&#39;s the crazy part. Satanism is intermingled with new age teachings that sound pleasing to the ear but the reality of the doctrine is much more sinister. Everyone that does not know Jesus Christ is deceived, heed to this warning and prepare yourselves because this world as we know it is about to come to a grinding halt  </p>

<p>So you know why it won&#39;t happen? Because the money is in the globalism. Trump can blather on about America first, but he owns a global business empire himself. Like all rich people it&#39;s &#39;themselves first&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether the visit was johnny, as his mother claims, or someone posing as him, it doesnt really change his mothers reaction to it. She is convinced it was him. If she was keeping the contact with him secret for fear of his life why did she then divulge the secret?  </p>

<p>around 1:11:10 in the documentary the interviewer says &quot;for someone so outspoken and tells the media everything and now suddenly, you dont say anything&quot; noreen responds &quot;it was very simple, my son asked me not to say anything&quot;</p>

<p>but in this interview <a href="http://rense.com/general67/gannn.htm">http://rense.com/general67/gannn.htm</a> noreen says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>CHARLENE: In 1997 a miracle occurred. Johnny showed up at your apartment with a friend and visited with you for several hours. He told you he had escaped the sex-slave ring for the time being. He confided in you, and he recounted what had actually happened to him after his abduction; he pleaded with you to expose the people and the organization that had harmed him and that continues to harm many other children. What are some of the key points that Johnny shared with you that night? Did Johnny ask you to write a book about his kidnapping and forced participation as a sex slave in an elite controlled pedophile ring?</p>

<p>NOREEN: Johnny asked me to get his story out. Soon after he left that night, I decided to begin to put all of my journals, notes and already written chapters into book form. The time had come to tell Johnny&#39;s story. Johnny was here in 1997, I began within a few weeks of his visit.... Zielinski didn&#39;t contact me until Nov. 1999</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to pull a judge Judy here and go with the most logical explanation </p>

<p>The number one thing to always question is Noreen&#39;s sanity. But regardless of that, there are only 3 likely scenarios. </p>

<p>1.) she wasn&#39;t visited at all by Johnny and either hallucinated it or just made it up for attention. </p>

<p>2.) she was visited by someone claiming to be Johnny</p>

<p>3.) she was visited by Johnny and everything she is saying is true. </p>

<p>The judge Judy in me completely ruled out option 2, because, just imo is completely too far fetched. </p>

<p>So that leaves us with 1 or 3. </p>

<p>While 1 is entirely possible, the documentary wants us to believe option 3. It&#39;s a bit biased. The documentary is my main source of information that I have researched on the subject which is why I believe option 3. </p>

<p>Now, breaking down as to why she kept it a secret for so long makes complete sense to me. If he did show up at her door, he spent hours convincing her to keep her mouth shut about it. That gets to you... but then the years pass, you don&#39;t see your son again and you want to, and there hasn&#39;t been any action or headway in the case. Going against what your son told you, you speak out, hoping that they don&#39;t follow through with what your son said would happen if you did, and hoping that coming out about it gives it the exposure that it needs to be featured in news stories/documentaries etc. she doesn&#39;t strike me as an attention whore. She doesn&#39;t strike me as trying to make it rich by exploitation of her kidnapped son. What I see in her eyes is a mother missing her smiling boy.  And that is why the documentary got to me. </p>

<p>This is completely untrue, the emails i&#39;m sure you&#39;re referring to talk about a political fundraiser where someone said three children would be using the heated pool. So starting off with a complete misrepresentation of the truth.</p>

<p>Nah. Read the email, dear. It says,</p>

<p>&quot;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzato (11, 9, and almost 7) so you&#39;ll have some further <em>entertainment</em>, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that, I&#39;m done breaking down the rest of your nonsense point by point. Rich elites fuck children, and from the Westminster pedophile dossier, to Jimmy Savile, to Dennis Hastert, to Jeffrey Epstein, there is proof of it all.</p>

<p>Incidentally, John Podesta was traveling buddies with Hastert. Do you travel with friends you don&#39;t have anything in common with? And who appointed the judge that gave Dennis Hastert his light sentence for fucking children? Obama appointed that judge.</p>

<p>Or what about Epstein and Bill Clinton&#39;s multiple flights to &quot;Sin Island&quot; on the &quot;Lolita Express&quot; without his Secret Service detail? Why would Clinton, a known pervert and serial assaulter of women, travel to a private island where Epstein fucks underage prostitutes without his security detail?</p>

<p>The dissonance reduction is strong with you, my friend. The Democratic establishment, and the Republican establishment, all associate with notorious child fuckers. </p>

<p>Also, there was no email about a &quot;Political fundraiser&quot; where children were going to be playing in a heated pool. Then you have the audacity to say that somehow what he was saying was a complete misrepresentation of the truth when you in fact either have not read the email yourself or are the one completely misrepresenting the truth. Laughable honestly how far you had to stretch that to make it a &quot;This is completely untrue, the emails i&#39;m sure you&#39;re referring to talk about a political fundraiser where someone said three children would be using the heated pool&quot; lol.</p>

<p>Actual quote for anyone wondering:</p>

<p>&quot;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzato (11, 9, and almost 7) so you&#39;ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Please respond to him. It&#39;s time someone with their head in the sand was called on their bs. </p>

<p>free-thinking individuals can come to the conclusion that powerful people can do horrible things and get away with it</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the problem. And actually, there&#39;s plenty of evidence that powerful people can do horrible things and <em>not</em> get away with it, because that&#39;s how we know the people have done those horrible things. We catch them.</p>

<p>Pizzagate hasn&#39;t exposed anything.</p>

<p>Either the thing was never meant to be taken seriously, or the people running the show <em>are</em> stupid fucks for holding an &quot;independent investigation&quot; in a public forum <em>after</em> getting the attention of the people they&#39;re attempting to investigate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>explain to me how it&#39;s SOOO &quot;irrational&quot; and inconceivable that politicians, some of the scummiest, worst people on the planet, can be pedophiles...but THOUSANDS of PRIESTS, some of the holiest people on the planet, can molest little boys...and have the Catholic Church vigorously cover it up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not Pizzagate. That&#39;s what some people are trying to turn Pizzagate into because they&#39;re embarrassed that the <em>actual conspiracy</em> it began as <em>simply has no foundation</em>. Unfortunately, even those people are stupid, because half of the community is still hung up on Podesta, Comet Ping Pong, pizza shops in general, and every website that happens to have a swirl in the graphic design.</p>

<p>As far as the rest, much of it is guesswork, but it is clear in the context of the emails that they were not talking about food. It&#39;s some sort of code. There is no such thing as a handkerchief with a pizza related map.  There is no such thing as playing dominoes on cheese or pasta.  These things make no sense if viewed straightforward.  They are obviously code.</p>

<p>Based on the artwork in Comet, Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection, and known slang (i.e. &quot;cheese pizza,&quot;) it is not a stretch to infer that it refers to something involving child abuse. </p>

<p>True. Something like religion seems to be natural to us. I think it is because we are a very social species -- we have the natural drive to  be part of something bigger than us, and religion is one way to fit that mold.</p>

<p>Generations down the line the Psychopathic Megalomaniacs will reign again through chance and nature. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that psychopaths are often more prominent just by natural selection. I would contend that you had to be psychopathic to a certain extent in order to survive before we had modern society. Psychopaths value themselves first. High-functioning psychopaths are a perfect hosh-podge of intellect, charisma, often athleticism, and , to be a little cliche, &quot;evil.&quot; This means strong psychopaths often survived more and were able to pass on their genes.</p>
