       I posted the Sessions/Franken transcript last night to multiple people in r/FAKE
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       , since no one wanted to include the context behind the first question:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The part no one at the msm or r/FAKE
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       or r/redacted thought was relevant:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Franken: OK CNN has just published a story and I'm telling you this about a news story that's just been published, so I'm not expecting you to know, haha whether or not its true or not haha. CNN just published a story alleging the intelligence community provided documents to the president elect last week that included the information that quote "Russian operatives claimed to have comprising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump. These documents also allegedly say quote "there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The r/redacted and r/FAKE
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       version:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Franken: Now again, I'm telling you this is a scummy (out?), so ya, know. But if it's true, but it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?
       </p>
       <p>
        Sessions: Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians um, and I'm unable to comment on it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The follow up to the question which the msm, r/FAKE
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       and r/redacted thought wasn't important to the discussion and would not be important when discussing trying to make someone resign:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Franken: Without divulging sensitive information, do you know about this or what compromising personal and financial information the Russians claim to have?
       </p>
       <p>
        Sessions: Senator Franken, (yet?) allegations made about candidates get made about candidates all the time and they've been made about President Elect Trump alot sometimes, most of them, virtually all of them have been proven to be exaggerated or untrue. I would just say to you that I have no information about this matter. I have not been in on their classified briefings and I'm not a member of the intelligence committee, and um, I'm just unable to give you any comment on it
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       When I woke up, I got this message:

       When I asked the mods, what gives, I got this follow up response from the mods:

       The mods then muted me after one message for 72 hours, so I can't contact them anymore

       Why doesn't this website just name itself WeHateTrumpit at this point?
      </p>
      <p>
       This was my first "punishment" by the way, but yet it was an instaban, for correcting a misleading transcript. The justification is that I comment spammed, while the same guy who did a quadra-post with insults lashed towards me is free to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's legit insane how far this site will go to push their propaganda.

       This part hasn't been removed from MSM news about this. I heard this part of the video on Morning Joe and they even discussed the part about surrogates, so I don't think there's a coverup

       I haven't checked the news this morning, but as of last night, the full transcipt was not part of the discussion.

       Pretty harsh for a first warning, along with the follow-up responses which shows clear Anti-Trump biases. I also did feel it was necessary for people quoting the incomplete quote to see the full quote.

       is it "siding with corporate" if the quote was clearly aired on an MSM source, when OP says it wasn't? considering we're crusaders of truth isn't it important that we.....tell the truth or allow ourselves to be corrected when we're wrong?

       Did you read the full exchange I posted above?

      <p>
       The question involves if he met with them as a Trump campaign official involving exchanging of information about the campaign. Not as Senator Jeff Sessions, who regularly meets with ambassadors.

      <p>
       I don't think there is anyway you could answer the question asked and think it had nothing to do with the story Franken was talking about.

       I think it definitely does when the true question involved asking if he as a Trump official, not a Senator, talked with the Russians, specifically about election info matters.

       He didn't? He didn't say anything at all about Sessions working for Trump. He didn't even ask if Sessions talked to Russians. Sessions said that on his own accord.

       <p>
        Franken: OK CNN has just published a story and I'm telling you this about a news story that's just been published, so I'm not expecting you to know, haha whether or not its true or not haha. CNN just published a story alleging the intelligence community provided documents to the president elect last week that included the information that quote "Russian operatives claimed to have comprising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump. These documents also allegedly say quote "there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government".

       So all of this, was just completely random and had nothing to do with the actual question? I just want to clear this up so we all know that Franken went through the trouble to mention all of this, and it had no correlation with the following question?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then followed up with this just randomly out of the blue, even though there is no correlation:

       Yes, and it was a lead up to this question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "But if it's true, but it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?"

       So I think it's fair to assume that's a part of the question then and starts to muddle and confuse what exactly is being asked.

       I can totally understand why Jeff answered the way he did and I probably would have answered similarly. The tone is also a bit more relaxed.

       is it "siding with corporate" if the quote was clearly aired on an MSM source, when OP says it wasn't? considering we're crusaders of truth isn't it important that we.....tell the truth or allow ourselves to be corrected when we're wrong?

       You clearly don't like me, as you tend to point me out by name on posts when I'm not the only one questioning the post. But whatever.
