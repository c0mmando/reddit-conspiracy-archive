        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted the Sessions/Franken transcript last night to multiple people in r/FAKE<strong>news</strong>, since no one wanted to include the context behind the first question:</p>

<hr/>

<p>The part no one at the msm or r/FAKE<strong>news</strong> or r/redacted thought was relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franken: OK CNN has just published a story and I&#39;m telling you this about a news story that&#39;s just been published, so I&#39;m not expecting you to know, haha whether or not its true or not haha. CNN just published a story alleging the intelligence community provided documents to the president elect last week that included the information that quote &quot;Russian operatives claimed to have comprising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump. These documents also allegedly say quote &quot;there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>The r/redacted and r/FAKE<strong>news</strong> version:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franken: Now again, I&#39;m telling you this is a scummy (out?), so ya, know. But if it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?</p>

<p>Sessions: Senator Franken, I&#39;m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians um, and I&#39;m unable to comment on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>The follow up to the question which the msm, r/FAKE<strong>news</strong> and r/redacted thought wasn&#39;t important to the discussion and would not be important when discussing trying to make someone resign:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franken: Without divulging sensitive information, do you know about this or what compromising personal and financial information the Russians claim to have?</p>

<p>Sessions: Senator Franken, (yet?) allegations made about candidates get made about candidates all the time and they&#39;ve been made about President Elect Trump alot sometimes, most of them, virtually all of them have been proven to be exaggerated or untrue. I would just say to you that I have no information about this matter. I have not been in on their classified briefings and I&#39;m not a member of the intelligence committee, and um, I&#39;m just unable to give you any comment on it</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>When I woke up, I got this message: </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/XS7q7">http://imgur.com/a/XS7q7</a></p>

<p>When I asked the mods, what gives, I got this follow up response from the mods:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/cuxY7">http://imgur.com/a/cuxY7</a> </p>

<p>The mods then muted me after one message for 72 hours, so I can&#39;t contact them anymore</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/BZmAo">http://imgur.com/a/BZmAo</a></p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this website just name itself WeHateTrumpit at this point?</p>

<p>This was my first &quot;punishment&quot; by the way, but yet it was an instaban, for correcting a misleading transcript. The justification is that I comment spammed, while the same guy who did a quadra-post with insults lashed towards me is free to go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s legit insane how far this site will go to push their propaganda.</p>

<p>This part hasn&#39;t been removed from MSM news about this. I heard this part of the video on Morning Joe and they even discussed the part about surrogates, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a coverup</p>

<p>Pretty harsh for a first warning, along with the follow-up responses which shows clear Anti-Trump biases. I also did feel it was necessary for people quoting the incomplete quote to see the full quote.</p>

<p>The question involves if he met with them as a Trump campaign official involving exchanging of information about the campaign. Not as Senator Jeff Sessions, who regularly meets with ambassadors.</p>
