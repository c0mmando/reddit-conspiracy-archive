       It is so obviously fake.  Why is everything "the left" does so fake? Why do they need to lie so fucking much?  I am sympathetic to a lot of left leaning issues, but the lying is just unbearable.

       I think they were supposed to be the "good ideals, bad outcomes" side of the globalists, versus the side represented by the Republicans which was more like the, "bad ideals, mediocre outcomes" side.  "Leftist" lies are a little more blatant than "right-wing" lies due to the larger gap between stated intents and actual outcomes, but even this dovetails nicely with an intended faux-hyperpartisanship strategy.

       It's not the true left doing it. I'm in the same boat. I'm a left leaning progressive centrist, but I can't stand this shit.

       These crooks in power know the American people want justice, equality, better social programs, etc etc., so they pretend to want these things too.

       The most prominent "progressives" are phoneys. Frauds. Scheisters. Grifters. They are pied pipers tooting a false melody, leading the weak minded away to destruction.

       I've always considered myself "left" but it seems like the definition was changed out from under me. Suddenly the left is all about curtailing free speech and against equality. I don't know how it happened, but it's odd.

       Bernie Sanders was a true left. He was a socialist through and through, a champion of the people! He has the history to back it up, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the DMC showed their true values when they pointedly ignored him, denied him any media coverage at all despite his campaign being surprisingly popular all the while, promoted solely online through social media and the like. Hillary was instead given the spotlight, and unsuccessfully made to seem appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people were so desperate for a change, they elected Donald Trump, an egotistical sociopath who's best friends with Russia, who denies climate change, who can't actually run a company despite his claims (he would have made more money through investing that loan, has run numerous corporations into the ground after buying or making them, and his biggest sources of income are a 'university' that takes your money and gives you nothing in return and various golf courses and the like designed to extort money from the rest of the 1%).
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanted change. Whether they were fed up with the Republicans never delivering on their promises or just didn't give a shit anymore, they voted for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders would have won, had he been given a chance. Instead, the DMC threw the race in a vain effort to put another puppet in the white house. Now we have a wild card who only gives a shit about lining his own pockets and has zero idea how to actually do his job.

       I used to drink the sanders kool aide too. Then he started shilling for Hillary after being very obviously fucked out of the nomination. Now he is saying things that don't even make sense. He has no backbone. Or something. I don't even know.

       Republicans defending Republicans despite intelligence briefings with damning evidence, but you don't see how Bernie tried to get a democrat in the White House even after being screwed? He's been in politics a little long to take his ball and go home after once again being overruled (in theory, in practice more like conspired against) by his own party leadership.

       No damning evidence. At all. It's just dems flipping tables because they lost. I voted Obama twice and Bernie in the primaries but this hissy fit the left is throwing is blatantly obvious and off putting.

       The Establicrats are overplaying how much the hacking affected the election.  Their livelihoods moving forward depend on the idea that Clinton was a "good candidate" who was screwed and their ideology is popular and sound.  It also takes the heat off of the content of the emails which were disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, there is something to the relationship between the Trump campaign and Putin that the hacking story is the window into, the same way that Benghazi was the window into the illegal Clinton email server story.  The Russian ambassador meets with several Trump campaign officials in the lead-up to the Republican Convention, and then all of a sudden, the Trump campaign gets some language about defending Ukraine from the Russian backed insurgency pulled from the party platform?  Christopher Steele's salacious dossier goes public and within the next two months half a dozen high ranking Russian Government officials turn up dead?  The NSA has already been forced to resign after lying to the Vice President about his meetings with Russian officials, meetings that the President was breifed on weeks before?

       No one said the latter wasn't worth investigating? The hijacking of true democracy by malicious parties is always worth looking into, yeah? And you should want that -- you should want us to root out the bad on both sides, not dismiss Russia as false... Based on? Are you in the FBI or CIA? Did you personally overhear conversations? No, you're sitting here trying to figure out what's true like the rest of us. But I know inherently trusting the state to tell the truth is a slippery slope. Let's stop playing favorites and seek justice against all law-breaking liars. Isn't that patriotic? Liberty and justice for all?

       You might disagree with that decision and think he should have supported Trump in order to exact revenge upon the party that screwed him, that's fine, but you gotta admit, it was a close choice either way.

       He didn't want to be responsible for trump. No one could blame him for Hillary's loss. That is all that was. He is not giving up his email list and is not giving up on issues that actually would benefit this country. I do concede he has fallen for the Russia narrative, but he usually sweeps that under the rug and gets back to the issues that actually matter.

       Rofl. Sure. Bernie can rely on presenting the rest of the developed world as an argument for his policies. He relies on people not believing in this bullshit american exceptionalism and thinking that if it's good and works elsewhere, it's probably good and would probably work for the US too. You should try looking at what happens outside the US sometimes.

       Yeah. That's not a circular argument. A circular argument is saying that the bible is true and the proof is that the bible says it.

       It's not a circular argument, because showing an example of something working is actual valid evidence. Otherwise you might as well call all science circular argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here though, is that the examples you gave didn't not have working democracy so they don't qualify as socialism. you can therefore not use them as examples that socialism doesn't work.

       If what you are trying to imply here is that people use Scandinavian countries as proof that socialism work and you say that they can't so that because Scandinavian countries are not socialist, then you can't go and call Bernie a socialist, because what he is aspiring to is pretty much what Scandinavian countries are doing.

       Oh, I didn't realize that Bernie wanted a small ethnically and culturally homogeneous population that was sitting on a massive amount of natural resources. Because that's the only reason it works. And once those resources run out... Venezuela.

       That's aside from the fact that your argument is just dumb. Oh wow! Countries work when they have economic activity and they stop working when they don't? Geez, I never would have thought! /s Economic activity is economic activity. It doesn't matter if it's achieved through natural resources, manufacturing, tourism, technologies or whatever. It generates revenue for the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Venezuela was too dumb to invest to diversify their economy when they had the money. Same thing has happened with Alberta in Canada which is a province that relied heavily on oil. Scandinavian countries don't have that issue. They are smart enough to invest in other sectors of their economy before their natural resources run out.

       Idiots on the right is what happened. Didn't you see their demonizing and dumping everything and everyone in the same basket? They redefined the discourse with their blanket statements and generalizations. It's right on par with calling everyone on the left a communist or a socialist like that's an arguments in and of itself to discredit their position.

       It is mostly the MSM, and now astroturfing efforts that are fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the size of Sanders following, a very big part of the left are actual real progressives concerned about economic justice both as a major left issue in itself, as well as a solution to many social injustices.
      </p>
      <p>
       But MSM and astroturfing efforts only give voice to Trump hate and social justice talk completely devoid of any attempt to make a connection with economic justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This serves both as a way to make left look silly to the right and re-enforce the divide, as well as an attempt to change the way the left thinks of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is disgusting, but the silver lining is that they've been trying too hard during last election season and now it looks even more idiotic because at least during election season they had a candidate to promote. Now it is hate-hate-hate every time all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is backfiring. At least with people paying attention, the kind of people who actually vote and influence others.

       I agree.  I am sympathetic to many leftist causes. What the MSM and the AstroTurfing is doing is making the left look very bad; like a bunch of whiny sore losers.  Of course, the point of the MSM and astro turfing, is to make democrats look good and the republicans look bad.  The problem is,  the DNC no longer represents leftist causes.  They represent corporate causes.

       The funny thing is that if you are left on economic issues, Trump was arguably a better choice than Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abandoning bad trade deals and other protectionist policies that Trump proposed may actually put more money in the pockets of working class Americans by making US job market more competitive than any minor tax adjustments that Clinton would have done.

       Yep. They lost because they let Trump be the only one saying he was for the workers, saying he was going to protect social services, etc. It's so weird, in 2016 while Trump was praising universal healthcare and saying we need it here, Clinton was out there bragging about how single payer healthcare will "never ever come to pass". So fucking stupid, the Democrats aren't even willing to lie to the people like Obama did in order to get their votes. The only rational explanation I can offer is that they don't actually want to win.

       Not a Trump supporter. However i personally belive both sides are taking advantage of reddits outrage to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shareblue, briebart and info wars for example are making a killing off of everyone's anger. It's like the monsters inc moving but their bottling hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more left leaning redditors who hate Trump so I can see why they have more dedicated anti trump subs. I usually avoid all these places as they don't usually allow any dissenting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally find it more valuable to talk to one person who disagrees with me than 10 that do. Those who only surround themselves with like minded people will be forever ignorant.

       Everyone should just leave everyone else alone and we will all be okay. Both sides should chill out and just leave the other alone. Stop telling everyone what to do and we wouldn't be in this mess ya turkey.

       I'm very new to conspiracy, but I stopped following Reddit news groups when they scrubbed all the stories about Hillary collapsing and having to be carried into her van. I searched for the word Hillary in a couple of the subs but all I could find were positive stories about her and nothing related to her collapse. That was a wake-up call.

       The corporate overlords who control Reddit want to keep the site going as a containment vessel where shills and bots can pepper the poor souls who find themselves here with propaganda on any politically oriented subject. They manipulate, delete, impersonate, ban, shadowban, and otherwise suppress and censor speech.

       about as many people hate trump as people hated Obama his first few months in office.  We are a 50/50 nation.  So when you say a lot of people hate Trump, youre right.  but no more than normal.  Half the country, more or less, always hates whoever is president.

       Obama's approval in the first few months was 60-ish. A small number hated him, but most liked him or at least were willing to give him a change.

       Boy, did he let so many people down. And i hear that from a lot of Democrats. Obama has to be one of the worst presidents in the last few decades; the scandals, secrets, and cover ups were too much. Its insane how people perceive someone with the media on his side compared to the media being against someone. Trump smashed the media in the mouth and proved for the first time that the big MSM bully could be taken down and defeated. Also, your statement wasnt true, people really started hating Donald Trump after he announced he was running for POTUS, people actually loved him before that. And if Hillary had won, it would be an absolute disaster for the USA, she has done so many horrible things, thank God she lost.

       I'm a good judge of character. Obama isn't an asshole. Even Bush doesn't appear to be an asshole (I was a little too young to care about US politics pre 2008). Hillary though, has fakeness written all over her face. Wouldn't trust her. Trump is a petty buffoon. Don't trust him either. But the fact that shit things happened under the presidency of what appears to be very fine people really makes me doubt that they have as much as say in things as their position suggests. Or as powerful as they are, they are still human and amenable to suggestion and manipulation. Plus we never really, really know the real reasons they are doing things. Like yeah we can posit that the whole war about WMD was really about oil interests. But we don't know if that's how it was presented to Bush back then.

       the MSM is pushing stories specifically designed to produce Trump-rage. If Trump takes a shit, the MSM will bitch about whether Trump prefers the loose end of the TP to lie on top of the roll or against the wall.

       I didn't and would never vote for the guy, but i find myself playing Devil's advocate on his behalf just to be fair.  The overwhelming majority of the time, those in a frenzy about something Trump did were totally silent when Obama or Clinton were doing something comparable.  You'll get no argument from me about Trump's damage to civil liberties, but the pundits/media outlets complaining the loudest haven't said a word on NoDAPL/Standing Rock.  The Trump/Russia hoopla is just mind-blowing.  Its the corporate left's version of WMD's.

       Hated him when he was jerking his Twitter off over Obama's birthplace and then pretended he never did any of that, even though the tweets are still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hated him for his idiotic scam products that he'd slap his gaudy golden font name on and shill for them until they failed, then he'd like and say he never cared about them and other people fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't need any media pieces to convince me he's an asshole. He did a fine job of that himself when he took out a newspaper ad to convince a couple men of a crime in the court of public opinion and then never apologized when he was wrong. Asshole still won't admit he was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       So stop this bullshit that you either love him OR the media told you to hate him. There are a billion examples of what a shit he was before he ever even suggested he was going to run for President. I'm talking about things from thirty years ago.

       In case you haven't noticed, though - this guy has
       <em>
        historically
       </em>
       low approval ratings in only his first goddamn
       <em>
        month
       </em>
       as President. Two top staff members have extensive ties to a hostile foreign power, the man's agenda is insanely unpopular with a majority of people, and people still resent him because more of us voted for his opponent than him. Hell, more of us voted
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       him (and his opponent) than him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean...is Shareblue really paying millions of us to state how much we dislike him? No one is paying me. (I fucking
       <em>
        wish
       </em>
       someone was paying me to complain about the President online, man!) After a while, y'all have got to start realizing that this man really
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       as unpopular as people keep saying he is,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       he's just another politician just like HRC. The "outsider" thing was just an act.

      <p>
       And not only that, but there is some
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       shady conspiracy shit going down in the guy's administration. You know, stuff that this sub
       <em>

       to talk about.

       Well, I am tired of complaining for free, and evidently George Soros is paying people to do what I do for free. Strangely though, no one seems to be able to come up with a link to where we can sign up to complain about Trump for money. As soon as I sign up, I'll be
       <em>
        rolling
       </em>
       in that cash!
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you were smart, you'd sign up for it too. I mean, fuck: some billionaire will
       <em>
        pay me
       </em>
       to sit at my computer and whine about the President?! Why don't
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       sign up, pretend to hate Trump, and rake in that dough?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I need is that link to sign up. Can anyone link me to where I can sign up? I would bet that
       <em>
        this sub
       </em>
       , with all of its super-eagle-eyed conspiracy spotting skills and ability to ferret out information, would be able to send me the link to the sign up page.

       Because obviously there are established PR firms that the work is contracted out to. Or it is done in house by employess of the PAC. A sign up website would be a smoking gun.

       There were no polls saying Hillary had a 91% chance of winning, from any firm. Polls don't calculate a candidate's 'chance of winning' they measure a candidate's number of supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       National polls said Hillary had 1-3% more supporters than Trump. On election night, 2% more people voted for Hillary than Trump.

       It's not that simple, considering almost the entirety of Clinton's lead comes from California. The data analysts would have noticed that Trump was even/winning in many midwest states, as well as Florida.

      <p>
       This is such a shit argument. Trump has low likability ratings, yes.. but he also has higher ratings for the things he's actually doing. Most Americans, believe it or not, agree with his travel ban. More people think he'll change the country for the better than for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just two examples. This overall "approval/likability" rating is kind of pointless. Who cares if someone approves of Trump the man, what matters is if what he's doing for the nation is what the nation wants him to do. And so far, it seems like it is.

       Gallup's approval rating asks whether participants approve of the job the president is doing, not what they think of the person. Here's the wording of the question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On that metric, Trump currently has a 51% disapproval, twice the disapproval of Obama at the same time in 2009.

       Support for the immigration ban is a bit uncertain, polls are split:

       That question is very vague, which was my point. You gotta look at the more specific questions about specific policies and more pointed questions, such as the direction of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, "handling his job as president" can be interpreted numerous different ways. As a trump voter and a big supporter, I'd actually answer no to that question. While I enjoy his tweets, I think that is a bad way to handle the office. The same goes for his constant attacks on Clinton. I love them but I don't think that's what the president should be wasting breath on.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I do think he's doing good things for the nation. I like most of his policy proposals and EOs (as much as one can like EOs). My overall approval rating for him would be rather high.

       And if we want to get even more specific, more Americans think Trump's EO
       <strong>
        Increases
       </strong>
       the chance of a terrorist attack than decreases. Even among Republicans who support him bigly, only half think the EO decreases the chance of a terrorist attack.

       I can't find any major poll that shows majority support for the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority oppose ACA repeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority oppose repealing regulations designed to fight global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       People DO see him as someone who keeps his promises, but I don't see any data that suggests a majority actually wants him to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see polls that support what you're saying, but if there's some I haven't found I'd like to see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, the OP and most of this thread was about antipathy towards Trump, and the broad question of approval rating is enough to show that people don't like him. The Pew studies also show that those who don't like him are very likely to feel that strongly.

       They were more accurate in the last presidential election, but I'd take that with a grain of salt. They were among the less accurate in their polls for the 2010 and 2012 elections and have continually produced results that tilted more conservative than other polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, is there a particular poll of theirs that shows approval for specific Trump policy?

       If we didnt use the college, many states would not have real representation. It equalizes the big cities with the vast majority of America everywhere else. I dont want a president to run for office and only have to speak in NYC, LA, Chicago, and Houston. If you want to breakdown the electorial college you need to get rid of gerrymandering in the states as well. How that would change the vote would be interesting but still, people in smaller states like Vermont would want to be heard out equally.

       Statistical significance can be determined by way less than 1% of members in a set.  Gallup typically polls about 1,000 people and gets a solid 94% confidence in results usually.

       It's not that they represent them perfectly, it's more so they represent the spread of the data.  1,000 people is usually enough to generate a normal distribution, which we can extrapolate to the whole.  That's why polling 1,000 random people gives roughly the same result across 20 different polling organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical testing, finance, economics, marketing, civil engineering, all of them are based on this principle.  It is not unique to pollsters.

       They pop up quick. R/esist really grinds my gears.

       I feel they use a 'build it and they will come' mentality. Setting up some new hate sub, seeding it with bots and fake users until it attracts it's target demographic and self propagates.

      <p>
       The rate they spawn makes me think it's organized, obviously new subs don't reach the front page on their second day.

       Very true.

       But these are manufactured with an agenda, designed to pull in unsatisfied voters/trump haters/what have you. They control the direction of these subs and unify them for their motives.

       That's why I think it's important. Reddit is where most young voting age adults get their info. Or at least the net-savvy ones do so that info needs to be homogenous with what they grew up in: an 18 year old has consumed 8 years worth of Obama programming via school and media it's all they knew since they were 10. Bush is hardly a thought and is thought of as a joke. So they gotta catch them in the bud yet again before they inform themselves.

       I meant this being a left leaning website is why you didn't see a bunch of anti Obama subs when he was first elected.  He was pretty popular his first couple of months with a 68% approval rating. Even when he started to fuck up with wiretapping and drone strikes he remained neutral to most redditors so not enough anger to create multi anti-obama subs.

       You make an excellent point regarding the forces agenda being DNC and not left leaning. I would venture that about 70% of my legitimate friends (not acquaintances) are left leaning and we are always able to discuss politics with civility. The forced DNC motive is increasingly more apparent than ever before and it greatly inhibits honest opinions without ridicule.

       Act is the key word. They are actors. Don't buy into their failed attempts at manipulating you. The right and the left both expand the powers of the government, work toward taking away your civil liberties, spend like crazy increasing the debt, continue the perpetual war on terrorism and drugs...

       Ah! This is the conspiracy-mindedness I miss. And a republican president wouldn't have had that sweet executive power to throw around if a democratic one hadn't helped pave the way, yeah? Either way, it's just one guy signing off... Kind of ruins that whole checks and balances thing.

       Wait where was the opposition when Obama was elected into office? I dont remember marches and violence? Oh yeah there wasn't, we wanted a peaceful handover of power to the elected president and he got one. W Bush didnt even speak out for or against him over the course of his administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton asked Trump if he would cede power peacefully if she won the presidency, and apparently it was only a one way question.

       It is just a phony attempt to make it look like there is some sort of Trump hate fueled unity on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       They shoved Clinton down our throats despite Sanders beating Trump in most polls, which tells me that people signing the checks to Democratic party actually preferred Trump to Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the same people are now whipping their PR jockeys into a frenzy trying to make Trump look bad in order to get the left to fall in line again is the level of hypocrisy I haven't seen in a long time.

       That literally is paid activist propaganda, it's not even in dispute. The site is run by a Hillary Clinton staff member. This information is freely available online. But I suppose you already know this and are simply trying to convince others that you don't.

       Oh, excuse me. He only used to have money thrown at him by Hillary's campaign in order to smear Trump in any way possible to advance her goals. Now that the election's over, he's no longer a paid propagandist, but a normal citizen like your or me who only has our best interests in mind and has no narrative to push whatsoever.

       LMFAO yes they absolutely are! Theyve both been caught lying an insane amount of times since the beginning of the election cycle. Along with many other media organizations. The fact that you think only the POTUS thinks they're terribly fake is also pretty insane, it's known to everyone outside of r/politics to be extremely left-wing biased media that has been caught lying and selectively editing many of their articles. Look more into it, theres tons of proof and evidence and it just shows you how biased the MSM is nowadays and what little they do to hide it.

       You can stop jumping he shark at every opportunity. Like accusing Obama of being a Kenyan citizen. We've both got post histories, dickhead. Just because I have a different opinion to you does not make me a paid shill. PS: I'm Australian and living in Australia. The only dog in this fight that I have is the one that's bound to blindly follow every dumb war that America gets itself dragged off to.

       He's managed to unite so many people in his own crazy ways. No other person on Earth has managed to motivate people to help refugees so much. Because of him celebrities and thousands of people are working together to help fix the refugee crisis. They've even raised thousands of dollars.

       Basically everything, from his tendency to use superlatives all the damn time (I am the best wall builder / I'm the best with women / etc), which are just weird and dumb and really only just confirm his Narcissistic Personality Disorder. To the things where he is hopefully just ignorant about, like thinking that enacting a tariff would help the US economy or about how the American economy is basically Greece on steroids. Things which if he asked any economist, and paid attention to their answer, he might learn a thing or two about how amazingly wrong he is.
      </p>

       I could go on and on. He blames Obama for the mess he's inherited, but most of the jobs that have been created so far are due to his policies. Not that they're anything special, just that they are the tail-end of things that happened in Obama's term. He praised almost 230k jobs created in January as his work, but either he's stupid or he's lying or he's just in it for the media spin, because that was Obama's work. The wall and other immigration issues will only hurt the economy, but really these aren't economic fixes, they're feel good fixes. They're for the closet racists of America who think to 'Make America Great Again' we need to 'Make America White Again'. He wants to capture the feeling of America after WW2, but little does he know that the job and housing boom during this period was in part due to some pretty high taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the 'terrorism threat' from people who come over our border, when almost every single 'threat' over the past few years was either planted by the FBI or a homegrown white supremacist who has gone crazy on his own, or now has gone crazy because of the Trumpian rhetoric of hate and racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, when he says things like, "Nobody reads the Bible more than me" / "Nobody knows the system better than I do." / "Nobody understands the horror of nuclear more than me." it's so obvious how he's just grandstanding that it simply cannot be true. Especially how he says he knows the system, but then things he says show how he has barely a grasp on how it works, let alone what some of the key acronyms even mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a moron, pure and simple. And many of my fellow Americans have been duped by him, just like so many got duped by Obama. Because they think he'll be a breath of fresh air into the stangnant and disgusting Washington Swamp. Which, of course, he's going to drain by hiring Wall Street cronies and others of the 1%.

       I dont even remember him ever saying our economy is basically Greece on steroids? well ok.

       Wow I am reading the rest, and you are really misinformed. Wow Trump supporters are "Closet Racists" and they want to "Make America White Again'.. Ok no you are really really out the fuck there.

       As for paying attention? Maybe you need to get out of your hugbox, Hillary literally fucked all Democrats over. You don't give a shit though.

       The same people who fund her and funding coups in other countries INCLUDING THIS ONE. You want a person like that for president? Do you not see the corruption?

       Holy shit you dumbass.. You need to think for yourself. The media is LYING TO YOU. They want you to ignore everything the DNC is doing while casting aspersions on the Trump campaign. 75% of the opposition is paid for, its a way to divide the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Clinton lost and the corrupt are scared. You want to defend the corruption to keep hold of the Obama status quo?

       Just stop. You aren't intelligent or informed. You just think Dems good = Trump bad = Nazi.

       No, OP is talking about the rate at which all these anti-Trump subs sprung up. There are plenty of other subs that existed and were already part of the the reddit algorithm before his inauguration. Since then, though, it's like a new one crops up every week and hits the front page.

       I saw a map that said different. The stock market is up at all time highs, so they don't hate him. Most of our allies don't hate him, in fact every person voting to leave the EU doesn't hate him.

       You know what's dumb? The idea that eight -- EIGHT -- people in the current administration have been linked to Russia in a way that at least begs for serious questions to be asked and this sub front doesn't have ONE serious post discussing it. You're transparent. This whole "blame the other side for what we're exactly doing" is played out and thank god. Thank god that social evolution and logic can prevail against the best efforts of some very evil people.

       Get Reddit Enhancement suite and filter all those shite subreddits out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have hundreds of subs filtered.  Go through the first 50 pages of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       filtering all the fucking soppy shit and sjw shit you find (Hover over the subreddit link and a window will pop up with different options including 'filter') and then refresh and repeat. Do it a few times and you should be sorted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also subscribe to
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete

       ,
       <a href="/r/longtail">

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       ? Clearly anti-Trump anything is not welcome here, and I think in a supposed close election that seems a bit statistically unlikely, yeah? Or are all conspiracy theorists pro-Trump and willfully blind to the obvious and fun puzzle that is the Russia connections? Seriously, not a one person here wants to even try to put it together, just to laugh at "how stupid" that is?

       While i am sure that these shill sites are seeding the internet. You must remember that trump remains highly unpopular especially with the average dem of reddit user. It might be easy to fall into an echo chamber and think everything is fine but regardless what shills say he is not well liked. I think what is more damaging is the divisions we are seeing not only on reddit but in society as a whole. I think these paid shills exist on both sides to further exasperate the divisions and troll people. People need to realize that trump clinton ctr are all on the same side its all about the money. People are just manufacturing fake outrage and anger against opposing viewpoint.

       That's what happens when you create a meme. Your cheeto overlord is hated by a LOT of people everywhere in the world because of his shitty personality. No conspiracy here. Just an unbelievably idiotic president that has turned into an Internet meme and is disliked by a serious number of people.

       Yes, it's all a huge conspiracy.. Oh wait, no one forced his team to meet with Kislyak, it would seem they did that on their own. If you like history, let's tie the Trump business dealings to Russian oligarchs.. I'll wait while you dig, this should be fun for someone who actually likes conspiracies, and not someone who's, you know, a disingenuous ostrich.

       Just for shits and giggles, I looked back at early polling. Trump had a massive lead over the other Republicans by the end of July 2015 way more than a year ago.

       It's also bled into nearly every popular sub on here too. Advice Animals has an anti-Trump post hit the front page every day (sometimes more than one). And most of the comments there are "OMG, stop with politics in this sub."

       I live in the UK and I hate going on r/all there's constantly atleast 3 related articles bashing him for things that shouldn't even reach the Trump hate subreddits it lacks any substance, it's normally taken out of context and could be put on the same level as clickbait where if you invested 5minutes of your time you can find out they really dramatiscized it or took it out of context, the only two things I disagree with Trump on is getting the Feds involved in legal marijuana and the mission which a soldier lost his life, the weird things are the comments they are so anti trump always making fun of r/thedonald the people there actually seem to like Trump instead of just preferring him to Hilary which I find crazy how anyone can genuinely like the guy but they are nowhere near as crazy as the pro Hilary lot, to support Hilary you gotta be one of those people that do literally 0 fact checking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like Trump I think he's a smug egotistical cunt, but I think wayyyyy worse of Hilary and for that reason would of voted for Trump or maybe some 3rd party candidate but I was so passionate in my hate for the Clinton's that I probably would have voted Trump.

       Why would anyone believe a poll after the election predictions? For me a certain degree of bias has always been evident in the press, sure it has become more blatant, but it was always there. And we've got the lying press game news narrative. But there's nothing about the polls. Nothing. All the main polling organisations had Hillary clearly in front. It was going to be a near double digit drubbing. How could they all have got it so wrong? I've said it before, the only two answers to why, is that they are all inept or are all complicit in spreading a biased narrative.

       I post anti trump stuff constantly not because I'm paid to, but because he is a fucking terrible president. I know hundreds of people personally that do that same thing on their various social media networks, for the same reason. I think it is entirely possibly that this is a situation that happened on its own. He is terrible. He lies, he implicates the press(they're not great but they're not any worse then they have always been).

       I didn't mean to deny the walls of support, just the unwavering part. This country is divided, indisputable, so we can't paint it as ridiculous (read: a conspiracy) for hate to be flourishing on either side.

       The whole reason Trump is president is because the DNC decided they'd rather sand bag an honest man instead of run a fair election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the DNC and the media have not changed a single thing in their approach to politics shows that they are just as terrible as Trump if not worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not talked about at all and mentioning what I've said in many mainstream subreddits would get me banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of propaganda flying around right now and to only focus on trumps ineptitude is a major disservice to our nations wellbeing.

       Oh I know. What the Dnc did is despicable, and the press isn't going to say that. I'm not saying they aren't biased, but they're not totally fake. They omit information based on their biases, but not every story they do run is fake news.

       Lmao. He has been president a little over a month and a half. It's not possible for any president to be "good" yet. He has repealed numerous common sense laws, like not dumping coal waste into our fucking streams, for one. He lies, constantly - when there is video proof of the lie. There is audio of him bragging about barging in on young, undressed girls because he "can get away with it" due to the fact that he ran the pageants. He takes credit for shit he had nothing to do with. Anyone with any amount of sense knows he is terrible. Most people, including my own family, voted for him because he wasn't hillary. I would have never voted Hillary, but I damn sure wouldn't vote trump. One is the stereotypical slimy secretive backstabbing politician, the other is a slimy, money grabbing, lie to your face and fuck over everyone because his ego is the only thing that matters type.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no Obama wasn't the best president, he did lots of shady shit. But he did care about the environment, or at least passed legislature that protected it.

       Anthropogenic Climate Change is inconclusive. You would know this if you put some effort into researching this.

       And you are an idiot if you believe he is allowing coal to be dumped in water. He deregulated the carbon emissions for several industries. Nothing in that allows the dumping of pollutants in the water.

       And Obama didn't care about the environment as much as you imply. If he did, he wouldn't push the extremely toxic to manufacture photovoltaic products. But then, most on reddit don't care to put effort into knowing what they are talking about.

       They make new ones so they can spam r/all and r/popular. Not only does multiple subreddits give them multiple appearances in r/all when r/all usually won't show a ton of posts from a single sub, but as they create more and more they can show up in the feeds of people who have already blocked their bullshit out. And unless Reddit changes the way their system works dramatically, I can only imagine this is the new normal.

       This and T_D are the only places left that don't constantly shit on the President. Conspiracy still gives President Trump some grief, but much more tactfully and not as often. The rest of Reddit is not worth being on anymore.

       The efforts do change the minds of the young by brainwashing them. Way back in 2008 I was brainwashed by the leftwing spam on here and only when confronted about my beliefs by my family did I realize that I had no basis for them and was only repeating them because I saw them so often repeated online.

       Personally, I'm even more shocked about the flood of pro-45th potus subreddits and users that have appeared in the last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to all metrics, reddit has been heavily left leaning since its inception, and all of that changed around summer last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it can't be explained away by simple growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly: there was a post on how almost all of the frontpage pro-45th material submitted during the early growth was all created by a handful of new users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forum sliding at its best ladies and gents.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we have jokers like OP trying to revise reddit history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't for a second think I'm denying shareblue's involvement. Their blatant acts to support a toxic candidate is part of what is ruining reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate shills of all kinds, and only an idiot would think that just one side is trying to manipulate consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even this sub has become infected by both red and blue shills, and for some godawful reason it seems red won here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really have no fucking clue how that is even possible, we're supposed to be free thinkers, not the sheep we so despise.

       It is basically a (communist) guide to wreak havoc in Congress, just like DNC did.

       I've always considered myself "left" but it seems like the definition was changed out from under me. Suddenly the left is all about curtailing free speech and against equality. I don't know how it happened, but it's odd.

       The whole reason Trump is president is because the DNC decided they'd rather sand bag an honest man instead of run a fair election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the DNC and the media have not changed a single thing in their approach to politics shows that they are just as terrible as Trump if not worse.

      <p>
       This is not talked about at all and mentioning what I've said in many mainstream subreddits would get me banned.

       There is a lot of propaganda flying around right now and to only focus on trumps ineptitude is a major disservice to our nations wellbeing.

       Rofl. Sure. Bernie can rely on presenting the rest of the developed world as an argument for his policies. He relies on people not believing in this bullshit american exceptionalism and thinking that if it's good and works elsewhere, it's probably good and would probably work for the US too. You should try looking at what happens outside the US sometimes.

       Lmao. He has been president a little over a month and a half. It's not possible for any president to be "good" yet. He has repealed numerous common sense laws, like not dumping coal waste into our fucking streams, for one. He lies, constantly - when there is video proof of the lie. There is audio of him bragging about barging in on young, undressed girls because he "can get away with it" due to the fact that he ran the pageants. He takes credit for shit he had nothing to do with. Anyone with any amount of sense knows he is terrible. Most people, including my own family, voted for him because he wasn't hillary. I would have never voted Hillary, but I damn sure wouldn't vote trump. One is the stereotypical slimy secretive backstabbing politician, the other is a slimy, money grabbing, lie to your face and fuck over everyone because his ego is the only thing that matters type.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no Obama wasn't the best president, he did lots of shady shit. But he did care about the environment, or at least passed legislature that protected it.

       Or is climate change a conspiracy too?
