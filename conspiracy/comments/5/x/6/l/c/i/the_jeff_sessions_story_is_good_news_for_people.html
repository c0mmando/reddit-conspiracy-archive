       Now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt they're afraid of him. We know Flynn and his son knew about Pizzagate, so they went after him first. This second smear job is undeniable proof that the establishment media (CIA propaganda outlets) sees Jeff Sessions as their enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sides are becoming more clear, the attacks more egregious and obvious. This is a good thing. The more tptb feels the need to lash out, the more likely they will make mistakes. There will be ups and downs, but at least we know now there are people in power working against these evil child abusers.

       The lying parts makes sense for Flynn and Sessions, since it is done to ensure nobody goes looking for connections.  What they never planned for or expected, was Obama's last minute order to ensure major government agencies would have access to NSA information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/12/obama-expands-the-nsas-ability-to-share-data-with-other-agencie/">
        https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/12/obama-expands-the-nsas-ability-to-share-data-with-other-agencie/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When this was first announced, a lot of people were baffled, as to why he would do this, but as the New York Times reported yesterday, it was to ensure the information that was gathered by the NSA, could not be easily destroyed.  And this move by Obama, is the reason for all these leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of having to worry about only plugging one source, Trump now has to deal with multiple agencies and as we are learning, agencies that are worried about a cover up.  Since it was clear Sessions would not recluse himself from any Trump and Russian investigation, the latest leaks happened to force Trump's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is interesting to speculate, is how much is still known, that the general public is not aware off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to your comment, I would say in Flynn and Sessions case, it makes sense to lie.   Why the fuck would you provide fuel, when you are confident you can easily smother any existing flames in the near future.  Expecting Obama to pull the move that he did was very unexpected and since there were no objections to his executive order, was much to do about nothing for most people, including Trump and his team.

      <p>
       For the most part yes.  Destroying phone recordings that the NSA has, is much more difficult, since there are probably layers of security.  And I would have to imagine to due the shear storage size, would require some expert knowledge of the storage system, to find and delete what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deleting 100s of MB of emails is easy.  Destroying Terrabytes of NSA phone recordings, that can be scattered all over the place, is not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus as we are learning, NATO allies are providing intel as well, which almost certainly contains voice recordings, from their NSA equivalent.

       Cool, maybe I can get some phone numbers back from that little black book I lost in 1987. I always wondered when the NSA's taxpayer database would become available to look up lost connections.

       Since Sessions is the attorney general it's actually a huge deal that they're doing so much to discredit him. It's even more than just a distraction. The deep state is trying to methodically destabilize and divide &amp; destroy Trump's nascent administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's enraging is how stupid and baseless the "Russia" claims are. I mean, it's honestly preposterous for these people to claim Russia "hacked" the election. Even if Russians were the ones to release Podesta's emails (they weren't), that still wouldn't constitute the "hacking" of our election.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone close to politics it's honestly maddening.

       He is trying to relieve you of the confusion they have injected into what "hacking" entails regarding this election. They want to make you
       <em>
        think

       Russia hacked the voting machines. What actually happened was the DNC got hacked and Podesta got his emails leaked. This is incidental though. They just want to conflate all this shit.

       I'm not confused, I was just making a generalized statement. I know that Russia didn't hack anyone. Maybe a Russian Hacker, Guccifer 2.0 but was he affiliated with the Kremlin probably not.

       Going from memory, it looked like the guy who generated the documents tried to make it look like they came from Russia by injecting some Russian characters into it before the final save. There is metadata in the document regarding when and what was saved, and it pointed at these leaks being created by someone in the DNC, who then tried to disguise their origin as Russian before passing them on.

       I think the russian code you are talking about had to do with Guccifer 1.0. This person actually saved the document in such a way as to make it appear that it was saved by a russian. But, wasn't smart enough to not leave a bread crumb trail back to its actual origin.

       They just started releasing them. So far not a lot of dirt. Next week things should gel a bit more when the first hearing regarding the Huma/Anthony Weiner laptop content gets started.

       I really wish that someone would tackle the as yet publicly unanswered questions of "Is Russia and the Russian Federation considered to be an enemy of the US, or not?", and if it is, "Why is it, and based on what evidence?" and if it isn't then why should any normal meetings either on or off the record between any US officials or elected US representatives and Russian diplomats in Washington be treated as if they were consorting with some hostile and unfriendly state when the same kind of meetings taking place with the diplomats from any number of other countries aren't?

       Your comment points out a basic logical flaw in the followers of the msm narrative, like you said, they haven't made one attempt to ask any of these questions that would give intellectual clarity to the situation. They want it to be as muddy and complicated as possible.

       Cool, maybe I can get some phone numbers back from that little black book I lost in 1987. I always wondered when the NSA's taxpayer database would become available to look up lost connections.
