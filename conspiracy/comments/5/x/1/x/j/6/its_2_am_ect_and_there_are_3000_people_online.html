       This is a bull shit effort to bring down Sessions. If you post here regularly there is usually 1500 online during the day. There is no article on r/all from this sub so I can only assume David Brock's little minions are working overtime to shove this story down reddit's throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you follow media matters on twitter they have been so upset with the media all day for praising trumps speech last night. This is how they work. They need balance to keep opposition against trump.

       Are there data logs for this anywhere? Would be great to get a graph of users vs current events (i.e.  Sessions in the news) to illustrate the shillage.

       I'm not sure but that would help. I have notified that CTR will post an article here and brigade this sub to get it to r/all. Like the pissgate dossier and the Sean hannity thing.

       Yeah but always consider that they aren't acting in their best interests to do that... if the Sessions/Russia thing hit's the front page with a tag from conspiracy it kind of discredits the legitimacy of the story in the eyes of the general public. They are inadvertently labeling their own news "fake" and on par with flat-earth to a lot of folks.
      </p>

       Maybe someone else would push it from here to all to discredit it... I swear they used to do that with pizzagate all the time.

       What's funny is back in the day before Aaron was offed, r/all was where I discovered r/conspiracy, the truth about 9/11, and alternative news, editorials and theories that addressed the dissonance between the MSM circus and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy was on the front page all the time. More importantly, even the posts to r/pol and r/news were more likely than not to have diverse and lively opinions that often questioned the official narrative. It seemed like everyone knew the 9/11 story was bullshit. No censorship whatsoever. How the times have changed...

       I see a lot of extra people, but I dunno what they are up to... I don't think we had anything hit the front couple pages of "all" but that usually explains a hop up in visitors, cause the "thinking freely" thing doesn't just count subscribers I don't think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is sure hittin' the Sessions/Russian thing hard right about now though... just not really this sub though the Sessions topic here is kinda lively... just not 1500 people lively.

       I agree that shilling is real and definitely a problem, but how can you be so sure that more people online equals shills? Have you considered that maybe this sub is just growing in base and activity because other subs are marginalizing people and becoming unbearable echo chambers? I didn't spend as much time on this sub myself until after trump got elected.
       <a href="/r/politics">

       <a href="/r/the_donald">
