        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These are supposedly images of <a href="http://medecine-sante.org/wp-content/uploads/img/Les+virus+aussi+vivent+en+groupe+et+fabriquent+des+biofilms0.jpg">HIV</a> <a href="http://hrsbstaff.ednet.ns.ca/halleyp1/Measles2.jpg">Measles</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pictures of ‘viruses’ are indistinguishable from images of <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Medizin/Anatomie/workshop/EM/eigeneEM/Tph/Tph103a.jpg">cell vesicles</a>. </p>

<p>It is likely that images of normal cell vesicles are being presented as ‘viruses’.</p>

<p>This picture of <a href="http://med.monash.edu.au/assets/images/microbiology/research/hep-b-particle.jpg">Hepatitis B</a> is likely <a href="http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/atvbaha/16/5/621/F6.large.jpg">a blood agglutinate</a></p>

<p>Other images of viruses have problems with 3D geometry. The Herpes and Polio viruses are both presented as being spheres.</p>

<p>If this is the case, we should see a variety of widths when they are sliced and viewed under a microscope.</p>

<p>Just as we get a variety of sizes when an orange is <a href="https://youtu.be/hXKRVeLvWmY?t=1m6s">sliced.</a>. The pictures presented of <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_soZ6GfrKb8E/TIE-UzURqxI/AAAAAAAAAxw/BH860-dwwBI/s1600/Herpes_virus00.jpg">Herpes</a> and <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53d811b7e4b0f6dd318a7f03/t/5413a1a0e4b0081a37766ab2/1410572704734/Poliovirus.jpg?format=300w">Polio</a> show circles of uniform size.</p>

<p>This suggests that the viewed images are artifacts of the complex staining procedure involved in electron microscopy, rather than pictures of viruses. Harold Hillman uses the same argument to debunk the existence of cell membranes, in this <a href="https://youtu.be/lq2wBixwuQ0?t=13m35s">video.</a></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>All of this analysis suggests that the photos of viruses are simply normal cell debris/artifacts which have been presented as otherwise. Assuming of course, that electron micrographs aren’t simply drawings, which they may well be, given the lengths which scientists are willing to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a difficult question to answer but I&#39;ll give it a go.</p>

<p>I think there may be small animals like lice which transmit disease, but I don&#39;t think there are any microscopic organisms (such as viruses and bacteria) which cause sexual diseases.</p>

<p>Chlamydia is a disease that supposedly often has no symptoms (a hallmark of medical fraud). </p>

<p>There is even a testimony here from a woman who tested positive for chlamydia after having no <a href="http://www.healthboards.com/boards/sexually-transmitted-diseases/904967-chlamydia-without-having-sex.html">sexual contact for 3 years.</a></p>

<p>HIV/AIDS is a fraud on many levels, as I discussed further down in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5x1xbm/viruses_do_not_exist/deeof2p/">thread</a> but even mainstream sources list the transmission rate by infected partners engaging in unsafe sex at around 1 in 500.</p>

<p>The symptoms of <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Syphilis/Pages/Symptomspg.aspx">Syphilis</a>, a disease which is considered to be an STD, are the exact same as <a href="http://www.lupus.org/answers/entry/common-symptoms-of-lupus">Lupus</a>. Lupus is not an STD.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re just dumb or a troll. Nobody says hospitals are the cleanest places on earth. 
Hospitals are a hotbed for transmission of bugs and bacteria. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what happens when you put several hundred sick people in the same building, despite all efforts to be as clean as possible.</p>

<p>I would ask what is the point of lying about viruses in that case? One might say for profit? But since Pharma Companies will be treating the <em>disease</em> anyway it makes no difference how the disease is transmitted, whether by virus or other means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of the virus causing the disease creates the justification for drugs which target the virus.</p>

<p>If disease was seen as being caused by our environment/diet, then the focus would be on natural forms of treatment, not money-spinners like AZT/chemotherapy.</p>

<p>It would also remove the justification for vaccination (if disease was seen as being caused by our environment).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I routinely use viruses to transfect human cells in vitro. I also work on exosomes. Exosomes stain for ALIX, tgs101 and cd9, viruses do not. Capturing exosomes using magnetic beads reveales miRNA and cytosolic proteins. Capturing viruses reveals transposon like DNA fragments. </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with viruses. Diseases, regardless of origin, itself give reasons for the development of drugs, not viruses. Drugs do not even target them (viruses), they target the transcription machinery of infected cells. T killer cells do not kill viruses, they kill infected cells. Nothing works as you described in the comments. </p>

<p>Also, most drugs are based on or are &quot;natural&quot; treatments. Naming the active compound does nothing. You can treat yourself to chemo, just go eat some taxus. Want to treat your Bradycardia, digitalis is your friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Stefan lanka case. His supporters are claiming that it’s a victory since he wasn’t ordered to pay up, but his opponents are also claiming it as a victory...</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://lrbw.juris.de/cgi-bin/laender_rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bw&amp;amp;GerichtAuswahl=Oberlandesgerichte&amp;amp;Art=en&amp;amp;sid=46bf3db2df690aba6e4874acafaf45b6&amp;amp;nr=20705&amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;anz=1">original transcript</a> of the ruling from the OLG Stuttgart, February 2016.</p>

<p>Paragraph 20 says:</p>

<p>“In addition, the content of the submitted publications did not meet the requirements for the presentation of the evidence. <strong>The phenomena presented as measles viruses are actually cellular vesicles.</strong></p>

<p>Paragraph 29
Only a scientific publication in the sense of original work and not a summary could be submitted, claiming that the measles virus exists, which is possible only through the documentation of isolation and biochemical determination of the isolate, and in which the diameter is determined, <strong>Which is possible only through &quot;negative staining&quot;, which was not done.</strong> Furthermore, the determination of the diameter should not have been carried out on the basis of models and drawings, but this was done in the sixth publication</p>

<p>Ultimately paragraph 122 says this:</p>

<p>“As a result, the appeal, in so far as it is admissible, is in any event successful, because <strong>the criterion of the claim to prove the existence of the measles virus by &quot;a scientific publication&quot; was not fulfilled by the applicant.</strong> Accordingly, the applicant is not subject to any legal costs.”</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my interpretation, but this my impression is that Lanka won.</p>

<p>Indeed, but in this case the deaths are being caused by the AZT drugs.</p>
