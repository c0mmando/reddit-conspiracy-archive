       About a year ago I was reading about the pros and cons of the Internet and we all know it is an amazing system to transfer/store information. My true hope is that it will bring in a sort of neo-renaissance but it seems to be taking longer than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internet and everything on it is, by nature, EXTREMELY vulnerable. It can be hacked/manipulated to obscure or delete data. Its reliance on the electrical grid is even more troubling. Think about it, it would just take one event and
       <em>
        POOF!
       </em>
       it's all gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided, due to this vulnerability, to begin recording every conspiracy that will be relevant for the historians of tomorrow. Eventually there will come a power who will seek to sweep this history under the rug and I refuse to let that happen so easily. When that day comes, and it will, I want there to be so many personal accounts of our current time that history can no longer be suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you but I don't want the historians of tomorrow thinking we were all blindly following like sheep to the slaughter. Some of us saw
       <em>
        it
       </em>
       coming, and we weren't quiet about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy Hunting

       I think it's good to take A LOT more than a singular event to knock out the entire global Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if some sort of global catastrophic event happened, I think we'd have a lot bigger problems to worry about.

       You know, a few years ago, that one politician (I can't remember his name) made himself the butt of many jokes for declaring the Internet to be merely "a series of tubes"... But he actually wasn't wrong.
      </p>

       All it would take to disrupt the Internet is to drop an anchor on a few undersea cables or blow up a few satellites. Our system is extremely fragile.

       Same.  I have gotten to the point that if I believe something may have any potential value at all, I keep/save it (the instant I find it) for at least a while.  As a result, I've accumulated a rather large archive. But it's always easier to trim and purge than it is to find something you know is gone for good.

       me too. I actually have become obsessed with scavaging the internet and downloading every relevant books/articles/collections to a point I started to clean my drives of less important stuff to keep everything. I wish we had a sub where we could share our personal libraries, like r/alexandria . A 'conspiracy' bookclub would also be cool.

       To piggyback off of this, it's good to print off a bunch of "basic" info...gardening facts, tips, knowledge, basic first aid, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the knowledge is always at our fingertips so it may seem alarmist or prepper-ish to do this but it is quite valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think with each passing year gardening is becoming more and more important. It is truly freeing to grow your own food, feels great to consume less poison, keeps you active and is rewarding.

       Huh, interesting. I've always learned better writing things out than typing. But for the past 10ish years I've stopped writing and have been using a phone/computer for literally everything. Time to break out the writing pad again.

       That would work. Military equipment is resistant to EMP by shielding it with Faraday cages, if you knew how to properly build one, it would work on your electronics. Having enough cash, you could build yourself a server storing any info you deem critical, safe from EMPs - on condition that electricity is generated inside it as well - otherwise any cables going into the cage render it useless.

       I know what you mean. I originally wanted to keep a journal but , having nothing to journal lol, I started writing about conspiracy instead. Every time you touch pen to paper it turns into a thought experiment that leads to some very interesting places. I know those people who say they have it all figured out are pretty full of it most of the time but after starting the journal, I think I have a HUGE part of it figured out. I'm just saying everything is connected and it seems to all be pointing towards the same probable outcome.

       I felt the same for a long time, but finally took action and started a journal in 2016. That year was so crazy that I figured I'd kick myself when I was much older for not archiving it. So I started writing down headlines, daily observations about the world, and how I felt about current events. With all of that material, I never ran out of anything to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that gives you some direction. I don't think the crazy times are going to subside anytime soon.

       <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/02/data-storage-for-eternity.html">
        this

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two years ago, researchers demonstrated that data could be saved and reread in the form of DNA.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to do that, his team encapsulated the DNA in silica spheres with a diameter of roughly 150 nanometres. The researchers encoded Switzerland’s Federal Charter of 1291 and The Methods of Mechanical Theorems by Archimedes in the DNA. In order to simulate the degradation of the information-bearing DNA over a long period of time, researchers stored it at a temperature of between 60 and 70 degrees Celsius for up to a month. Such high temperatures replicate the chemical degradation that takes place over hundreds of years within a few weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        As encapsulation in silica is roughly comparable to that in fossilised bones, researchers could draw on prehistoric information about the long-term stability of encapsulated DNA and from this calculate a prognosis: through storage in low temperatures, such as that found in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which is stored at minus 18 degrees Celsius, DNA-encoded information can survive over a million years. In contrast, data projected on to microfilm can be preserved only for an estimated 500 years.

       I am also on board with this! However, I lean more to the science and education side of things with my archives. There is so much knowledge in the world, and every year it's surprisingly harder to find because of all the crap on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even worse, like you said, it can be gone in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a portion of internet backed up locally. Including the entirety of Wikipedia. I am also working on my own custom AC electric generator, just in case the electric grid does go down. My fear is more for internet censorship of knowledge and information however.

       The internet getting shut down doesn't destroy the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, a nuke (or 10) going off in the US would mean very little data loss in terms of information and knowledge. A lot, or most, of that is on physical media too. That doesn't need electricity to be stored, just read. Worst case, we generate our own electricity using solar or wind to read it. It's not going away.
