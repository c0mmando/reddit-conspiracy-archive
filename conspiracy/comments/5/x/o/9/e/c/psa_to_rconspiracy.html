       I see a lot of people whining about posts that don't have mass amounts of hard evidence backing them up. Can we please remember what this sub Reddit is all about? Its about all conspiracies that we find interesting. We can't claim a conspiracy is bullshit because there isn't hard proof when we disagree with it. People need to chill and realize that this isn't about News and facts. While some evidence is important to substantiate the realness of a conspiracy, we must remember a true conspiracy is an agreement to act on certain terms by usually powerful people to get what they want. Usually, evidence is impossible to find at the beginning of the unearthing of a conspiracy. We must know that this sub in fact, focuses on conspiracies and not news headlines.

       When evidence has been promised within the next 24 hours several time and never delivered, it starts to look more like a bullshit conspiracy though. One of the more popular ones right now on this sub has been built up like that more than once and never delivered.

       The point of a "conspiracy
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       " is that it is an explanation of "evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about thinking up some random idea and claiming it is a theory - it is about gathering evidence and piecing it together into some sort of coherent narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bourne Identity is not a conspiracy theory... but someone was able to think up the idea of a government conspiracy to assassinate prominent people using mind-controlled 'drones'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the Bourne Identity and an actual conspiracy theory is evidence. Without evidence, all you have is a good story, not a "conspiracy theory".

       That is incorrect. That is how you end up with ridiculously stupid things. You cannot come up with a conspiracy and then go looking for shit that "proves it". If you do that all you will get is confirmation bias and people reaching really hard/taking shit out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take 9/11-- Lots of evidence that some fishy shit was going on, timelines screwy, a lot of people watched it on TV, massive amounts of conflicting reports is what drives the conspiracy and makes it plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you need 'hard' proof. But I am saying that there is entirely too much wild speculation here and people using "sources" that are pictures of text and other such dubious bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When no one has anything substantial you wind up with people like that one guy Seaman or whoever with pizzagate who everyone jerked off too while he strung fuckers along collecting money from patreon. It's ridiculous.
