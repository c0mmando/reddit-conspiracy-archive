       One example: Most of my friends have no idea that the Soviet Union and China fought in WW2, let alone lost well over 15 million people each. But all of them -- and I mean
       <strong>
        all of them
       </strong>
       -- "know" that 6 million Jews died in Nazi Germany.

       IMO, it's an important part but shouldn't be the focus. The global relationships and events of the past inform our world today. Just focusing on the Jews misses too much and misses the point. "Woe was them" shouldn't be the focus at all, but why it happened and why it's still significant today should matter more.

       People go to high school to be told what they learned in elementary school was bullshit. Then if they go to college they learn what they learned in high school was bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example of this in science is the notion that electrons orbit an atom but they actually just kind of vibrate with varying probability regarding their location.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one lie you've likely been told all your life and unless you looked into science at all, you likely have never heard of that. Another is that light travels as a photon. It also travels as a wave, and scientists have to remember and how they treat light depends on what they are working on. My opinion is that the photon generates the wave, but that's just me.(This is just conjecture on my part)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these things are simplified because most high school students wouldn't be able to grasp the concepts without focusing on it way too much. Other things, like what's being discussed in this thread, are glossed over or left completely unmentioned on purpose.

       Actually it is. It's kept out of education on purpose, just like the Japanese education sector leaving out the atrocities Japan committed in WWII. They are taught atomic bombs were dropped on them but have no knowledge of why. They don't know what Japan did during the war, just like the Germans didn't know what was happening in the concentration camps

       Terrorism? You should ask the Koreans or the Chinese. Is burning the Queen of Korea alive terrorism? What about the chemical warfare committed by unit 731? Or the live vivisection of pregnant women, children and peasants? Or how about conducting frostbite experiments on innocent Chinese people, or spreading viruses which are still affecting people in 2017. Have you researched the games the Japanese played, there were competitions of who could behead the most POW's within a certain time frame. What about the 100's of thousands of people expected to die by putting boots on the ground in Japan at the time, on both sides. You're proving my point, the bombs killed less people than an invasion would have. Clearly, you have zero knowledge of what was happening at the time.

       and I mean all of them -- "know" that 6 million Jews died in Nazi Germany.

      <p>
       Odd. In elementary and middle school we were taught that around 10 million people died in Nazi Germany including 6 million jews. Its one of the reasons I balk at Holocaust deniers because Jews were NOT the only ones to die in the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the is issue is more about media propaganda than what is actually taught (no movies about the millions of Poles and Slavs that died in  Nazi Germany)

       Beyond the local level oil barons do instead. American education was shaped by Rockefeller and Carnegie, one of their collaborators went on to say that they engineered it in such a way to stagnate and limit people now that they already had met their quota for an elite clique.

       It's already controlled at the highest level. Talk to any teacher with real knowledge and intelligence, and they are frustrated people. The system is broken and controlled. I understand that extremists could gain control, but that's where free choice of school is important. The extremist schools won't have as many kids so they'll have to adjust to what the people want, and that's a quality education.

       Look at Trumps pick for Education and tell me he is not hurting our already failing system. Imho that was the worst pick he made, just to appease the GOP and/or donors. It should be brought up.

       A lot of people seem to care about the credentials that decorate our government workers. A lot of people also seem upset by how shit our country is right now and has been for decades. I think a reasonable person would agree that when things aren't working out, change is needed to continue or restore momentum towards the desired goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with the established operative failures we have within our government, what is the source of the failure? Is everything wrong with our country right now merely the result of genuine accident and unavoidable misfortune? Cause and effect... There's a reason for everything that transpires, intentional and unintentional..
      </p>

       I would rather see big changes in a failing pathetic educational system rather than admittance and continued usage of said system. I truly hope others do as well. But that's not to say I am a supporter of Betsy Devos, but rather I am a supporter of outsiders entering new systems, as I see the value in what they can bring. What I know about Betsy Devos is the same as the people who support her and dislike her: I don't know her or her goals

       There's circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know their government services are extremely sub-standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the NK government lies about
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       that might cause them to lose face.  Not fibs or half-truths, but bald-faced Orwellian lies in cartoonish defiance of the obvious truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think the idea is plausible. Children only need a short time to learn how to read, and euthanizing disabled people is something NK has been accused of by defectors, which would take care of exceptions.

       <strong>
        all of them
       </strong>
