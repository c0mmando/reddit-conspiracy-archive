       We've always thought Bill threatened or bought off Lynch and told her to back off Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Bill instead went onto her plane and said
      </p>
      <p>
       "Look I know you guys are going to indict her.  Instead, you need to authorize a wiretap of Trump Towers, because that was denied once and we need this tap to happen.  If it happens then we all, you included, will be presenting the american public with information about Trump being in contact with Putin.  Your name will be remembered for exposing a double agent.  You will be famous.  Grant us that wiretap."
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it feasible this happened?

       The NYT printed it in january that it happened.  Snowden proved everyone was already under surveillance for PRISM.  Do you really think its outside the realm of possibility that Hillary and Obama could have done this?  What about it strikes you as not feasible?  Thats what politicians do?  They fucking lie and cheat and steal.  Anything to win and screw over anyone they deem a threat

       I think it's too early to say that in didn't happen conclusively. There are other MSM articles alluding to wire taps being president, and it's probably unlikely that Trump would bring it up if he didn't have proof. He could absolutely be lying, but I wouldn't say that with certainty until this week plays out. Should be interesting.

       The time frame is right. They met in June?

       That was when the first FISA request was declined.

       Im am certain now that the they discussed this on the tarmac
      </p>

       They knew the leaks were coming, they need something on trump. Lynch ordered the FISA surveilence. First request denied, second request approved by 3 judges. All Bill Clinton appointees

       That conversation went like this I think:
      </p>
      <p>
       BC: Loretta we have moles in the FBI and they have said they don't have a strong enough case to get a prosecutor to go against us. But you're connections to us will still be seen as a conflict of interest. So even though Comey is going to recommend no charges, people will still claim corruption if you decide not to make a case. So here's what you're gonna do. Today's Monday, the FBI is going to make their statement not to press charges next Tuesday 8 days from now. You wait till Friday and on Friday you say you're going to leave it up to the FBI to decide if there will be charges. That way it looks to the American people like you've recused/washed your hands of this and your removing yourself from the decision

       It makes a lot of sense, that's for sure. They thought it would be a "sure thing" and nobody would find out about the wiretapping, their asses would be covered if Hillary won, which at the time the manufactured Russia connection probably would have sufficed. They didn't think Wikileaks would have exposed their inner workings though. That was the wrench that ultimately stripped the nut of their politically charged interference machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, if true, gives a pretty good picture for their motivations in still continuing to delegitimize Trump. The entrenched power structure is just a vehicle for hypocrisy continually calling out other for that which they themselves are guilty of. Wouldn't it be hilarious if we find out that the Obama white house was the real mastermind of interfering in the election, not Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's legitimate worry about Trump, but not in the sense of how he may be perceived to govern, rather they are terrified that he will come after them, for which there may be clear evidence of wrongdoing, on their behalf. It would explain the media hysteria and the unskillful "the sky is falling" acting on behalf of democrats and MSM alike.
