<p>“Congress,” Larkin reminded Congress, “does not give the president a credit card or a cashbox that he can use to purchase goods and services or disburse appropriations as he sees fit. Congress identifies precisely who may receive federal funds.” With the “donations,” Justice rewards congenial groups without any direction from Congress or judicial oversight. Although it is, Larkin said, “a federal offense for a government officer to spend money in excess of the sum that Congress has appropriated,” he noted that the donations represent executive lawlessness known at the state level: When Chris Christie headed the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, he “negotiated a nonprosecution agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb in which the company agreed, among other things, to make a $5 million gift to Seton Hall University’s law school — Christie’s alma mater — in order to avoid prosecution for securities fraud.”</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson, a former New Jersey governor and the Democrats’ first progressive president, was the first president to criticize the American founding. He was particularly hostile to the separation of powers, which he considered an anachronistic impediment to executive efficiency. The bank settlement donations are another step nullifying the appropriations clause’s 16 words, which buttress the separation of powers.</p>

<p>“In the end,” Gray testified, “every other constitutional power runs into the appropriations power.” This is why presidents have “consistently endeavored to seize the appropriations power from Congress.” The Constitution was just 20 years old when, in 1809, Congress felt the need to enact “legislation designed to prevent the president from repurposing appropriated funds from one object to another.” Subsequent presidents have obligated funds in excess of appropriations, thereby forcing Congress to choose between appropriating the funds or impairing the country’s credit. Congress often has been complicit in its own diminution, as when it empowered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to commandeer funding from the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>Base motives of self-aggrandizement have impelled many presidents to disregard the separation of powers. Progressive presidents do this as a matter of principle, which is worse.</p>
