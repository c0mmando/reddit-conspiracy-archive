<p>Your A: They&#39;re Millionaires and Billionaires! Derp.</p>

<p>Not how this  fails as an argument: being a millionaire or billionaire doesn&#39;t automatically make one corrupt. Many Politicians enter politics poor and THEN get rich. Rich people don&#39;t have to enter politics to make money, since they have already made plenty in the private sector. Hell, If one can make billions in business, why enter politics where nobody makes that much? the most corrupt politicians make hundreds of milions from lobbyists over the course of career. Some Billionaires make that much in a year, easy.</p>

<p>But your argument is what one might call &quot;not even wrong&quot;. It doesn&#39;t even address the question. Not only is it completely illogical, it misses the content of the question entirely.</p>

<p>What have they DONE, or what are they DOING that lends you this perspective? This is not a question of their attributes, but of their actions.</p>

<p>Being a billionaire means by definition you&#39;re apart of the establishment, the parasitic elite. Period. That&#39;s what they&#39;ve done. </p>

<p>existing as a billionaire, isn&#39;t a good answer to this question. You could make the case that a day trader is a leach, sure, but one who has built a business empire hasn&#39;t necessarily taken anything from anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their have been stories of Donny borrowing from the Russians dating back to his Taj Mahal bankruptcy- I said it before the election, he is beholden to someone and it&#39;s probably Russia. No one is going to win an American Presidential election without some serious backing coming from somewhere whether it&#39;s money, information, disinformation or a combination of all.
If you are poor or middle class don&#39;t expect any favors from this guy.
Let&#39;s hope we still have clean water to drink and clean air to breathe when he&#39;s done.

The fact that you&#39;re ok with a 97% slashing of a program that keeps the Great Lakes (20% of the worlds fresh water) clean yet you&#39;re surely ok with more military spending shows you are a jackass. I don&#39;t care who is in power- they should be looking out for the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware that people in the high tax bracket pay a large minority if not the majority of all tax. Because of that I think it would be unreasonable to expect my relatively small income tax (UK) to go down. 
In fact, taxation is a major barrier to business growth - only the megacorps have enough to cover the taxes and still be solvent. If I want to start a business and have the opportunity to keep growing, I&#39;d need to be able to break through the taxation barriers, which will be true for any business in any tax bracket, except that the more tax we levy against the rich, the less opportunity there is to break into that sphere. I know a few self-employed people who have had to restrict their level of growth, not due to any solvency or supply/demand issues, but solely due to the massive increase of taxation at certain thresholds.
For me it&#39;s all about equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. If only megacorps can compete with megacorps where does that leave the people who want to take some control of their economic destiny back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the only reason Trump doesn&#39;t owe billions of dollars is because he was able to declare bankruptcy five times and discharge his debts... which is something the Republicans in congress happily made it virtually impossible for John Q. Averagecitizen to discharge normal debts via bankruptcy.  </p>

<p>He was able to wipe out over $2 billion in loans and other forms of debt owed to his creditors with nary a problem...  which is also why he couldn&#39;t get a loan from virtually any bank in the USA or Europe except Deutsche Bank who he started withholding debt repayments on shortly after winning the election and they are pissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount Hillary received from Google, JPmorgan, Citigroup, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Microsoft was over $6.5 Million and I bring this up just to show some perspective. The $6.5 million in private contributions was the total from over 1,000 donations and the max they could give was $5,000. What am I supposed to see here? Please point me in the direction of some evidence that someone&#39;s $5,000 donation got them a nice government contract or a deal of that sort. The man used over $50,000,000 of his own money. </p>

<p>The government isn&#39;t funneling money to his business so he can stay at his own property.

You think he&#39;s going to charge the government over $50,000,000 in rent over the next 4-8 years?</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s not forget, he&#39;s done little to nothing to divest himself from his companies&quot; CNN used that same line for weeks straight. When he starts trading hotel properties for arms deals please let me know and I will happily disavow the God Emperor. </p>

He has no impetus to charge the SS cheap rent, why would he?  He knows the gov&#39;t will just shell out whatever he wants for travel expenses, and he knows that he has to have a large retinue of people following him around.  So he gets to stay at his resorts whenever he wants and charge full price to ever gov&#39;t employee that is forced to follow along.  Not to mention all the Journalists that are staying with him on their bosses&#39; dime.  </p>

<p>What is it about Trump that leads you to believe that he would do anything even remotely altruistic?  What about his actions leads you to believe that he has any interest in doing anything but pad his own pockets? If your opinion of him is based entirely on things he&#39;s said, and it hasn&#39;t changed despite all of the evidence of him being a liar, then you really don&#39;t have a leg to stand on.  You&#39;ve been fleeced and you may as well be a paid shill.  At least the hillbots were collecting a paycheck. </p>

<p>Do you oppose the US having relationships with Saudi Arabia or Israel?</p>

<p>Not to mention, it&#39;s pretty hypocritical of you to say that about Russia when the US has literally encircled their country with military bases, overthrown the governments of all the former USSR satellite states and replaced them with neo-Nazis. Also, many US journalists investigating US crimes have been mysteriously killed for example Michael Hastings and 6 Russian diplomats have been assassinated in the last few months.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not even getting into the other countless countries in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa that the US has overthrown. </p>

<p>So you agree that the US is worse than Russia in everyway yet you oppose a closer relationship between the countries. The US does not stand on the moral high ground here. </p>

<p>You do realize that the US is pushing for war with Russia with their increased propaganda and military presence in their region through Operation Atlantic Resolve? If this new cold war isn&#39;t halted it will lead to WW3. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary is a corporate puppet, Trump cares far less about outward appearance than Hillary does.  She at least attempts to feign non-conflict of interest.  Trump simply doesn&#39;t give a shit.  He is unwilling to divest in any of his corporate interests, which is unheard of going into a presidency, at least outwardly.  He is going to end up stocking the HUD program with his own real estate investments, and he is going to turn the entire government into a corporate profit system from which his very own companies benefit.  Neither Hillary nor Trump care any more about you past how far they can exploit you before you break.  And surprisingly to me, and probably more surprisingly to the entire reign of wealthy and politically connected in this country - America is more stupid than they though and will take it up the ass harder than they ever imagined.  As long as you have liberals fighting conservatives and democrats fighting republicans the rich will continue to exploit the politics and the citizens of this country and you&#39;re a fool to think Trump is not in that club.  </p>

<p>No, but Trump almost certainly took him on because of his oil connections, Russian connections, and in particular, his Russian oil connections.  Wtf do you think a political hack is?  You think because Trump cut out the middle man and saved some money on bribes it makes him more noble?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was nothing random about it at all.  It directly referenced a subject matter you were discussing, and it was both deliberate and calculated to draw your attention to the absurdity and naivety of your position of Trump&#39;s irreproachable moral convictions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please show me the proof or evidence, I would love to see it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence is purely circumstantial, as is any evidence of a media/liberal conspiracy to paint him as a Russian crony.  We happen to be on equal footing there, but that is not the case in regard to Trump&#39;s history of honesty and integrity.  </p>

<p>I have no idea what kind of groups you repeatedly try to lump me in with, but if that is how you wish to look at the world-- as an us/other dichotomy-- you might be living a remarkedly examined life.  </p>

<p>In the past several weeks, Trump has repeatedly made assertions about MSM being fake news in regards to demonstrably true reports THAT HE EVEN ADMITS ARE TRUE.  It&#39;s not Trump vs. Establishment.  It&#39;s New Establishment vs Old Establishment and the New Establishment doesn&#39;t even try to take intellectually sound positions.  It just doesn&#39;t care because it knows that its fan base is either too stupid or too busy riding DT&#39;s dick to notice how fucking stupid the drivel they spew is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russia narrative is important because the real question about the legality of the 2 FISA requests and spying on Trump&#39;s campaign with 6 agencies involved is going to be whether or not they were justified in doing so.  The fact that we haven&#39;t seen anything concrete, when it&#39;s as important as it is to them to find something tangible is telling.  </p>

<p>No, having the one Russian diplomat Obama didn&#39;t deport in Dec. call Sessions at some point so you can ask him about it later doesn&#39;t count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think all that happened was that the Russian diplomat called Sessions, and that the dems made it happen just so they could ask about it? Did the dems also convince Sessions to forget about it just so it looked like he was trying to hide it? Or was that just sheer incompetence? Did the dems also arrange for Kislyak to meet with Sessions personally? Or to go to the RNC but not the DNC?</p>

<p>I know we&#39;re in r/conspiracy but that&#39;s not even internally consistent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same one that sat with the democrats at the joint session speech the other day?  I&#39;m not saying sessions didn&#39;t fuck up/I&#39;m no fanboy, but a little perspective is needed here.  Should he just have said &quot;I do not recall,&quot; 40 times?  What I saw in those transcripts could easily easily be a simple mistake, or more accurately, answers to questions specifically about being in contact with them in he capacity of a campaign operative.  Why does only one side ever get the benefit of the doubt?</p>

<p>6 other democrat senators met with the same ambassador over the same time period.  He&#39;s a member of multiple committees for which it is normal to have met and spoken with a Russian ambassador.  That may easily be a cover, but it&#39;s an angle not presented, and obviously not considered by all of the free thinkers lapping up the new red scare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he&#39;s just super incompetent in your mind, and fell for the alley-oop that the dems set up along with Kislyak, who was obviously in on it. Sessions didn&#39;t want to bore the dems with the same answer, so he just decided to commit a little perjury, nbd!</p>

<p>Seriously? You think Sessions made a &quot;simple mistake&quot; by forgetting to disclose his supposedly innocuous meeting, despite the shitstorm that already surrounded Russia? Your&#39;e the type of person who believes that those 6 Russian diplomats just happened to have heart attacks and died of natural causes at the same time they got shot in the back of the head twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shitstorm that is completely manufactured by one side, with the aid of their propaganda machine, yes.  The shitstorm being pushed so that they can justify having spied on an opposition candidate if they find something, which the 6 agencies involved apparently didn&#39;t, Yes.  It&#39;s all bullshit.  Left and right at that level is bullshit. They are all the same ppl. If you truly believe in the left right paradigm, and don&#39;t understand that sessions specifically represents a direct/visceral threat to those who are attempting to take him out, then you&#39;re still asleep.  I fucking hate that all of this partisan shit is on this sub now. You&#39;re looking at the surface, which is the exact opposite of the spirit of this sub.</p>

<p>Dakota Access Pipeline says different. If you want to talk about a real conspiracy against some &quot;anti-establishment&quot; people, why not bring up the first Nation? Or specifically the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The latest attack handed down from trump himself, and enacted by a militarized police force, and national guard. Using the Military and police in the interests of a private Canadian oil firm, to forcibly remove Americans using their first amendment rights. </p>

<p>Asking us to believe that there&#39;s no conflicting financial aspect to Donald Trumps relationship with wall street is a bit far fetched. Sadly we won&#39;t know the extent of that relationship because Trumps finances are apparently in a state of perpetual audit. </p>

<p>But it’s unlikely that those proposed policies have had much of an effect on U.S. business, yet. While it would be nice if Trump were a magician who could single handedly revive American manufacturing and convince companies across the world to bring back jobs from overseas, few, if any, of the decisions by companies to locate here can be attributed solely to Trump. Indeed, many were made before he was even elected.</p>

<p>This has jack shit to do with Trump and everything to do with the kind of technological advancements that he&#39;ll prevent when he cripples the education system and slashes public sector research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And even if jobs do come back it&#39;s a temporary patch.  There are no long term prospects in high school education level manufacturing labor.  The era of getting a job at ford right out of highschool, buying a house in the burbs and going up north (michigander) every summer is gone.  Trying to bring it back does nothing but a disservice to rust belt workers.  We need to be training and transforming our people and evonomies to fufill 21st century needs, not telling them it&#39;s all going back to the good old days only to have the rug pulled out from them AGAIN i. 10 years.  Michigan can&#39;t afford to go through that kind of hell again, i doubt the rest of the rust belt would want to either.</p>

<p>&quot;But it’s unlikely that those proposed policies have had much of an effect on U.S. business, yet. While it would be nice if Trump were a magician who could single handedly revive American manufacturing and convince companies across the world to bring back jobs from overseas, few, if any, of the decisions by companies to locate here can be attributed solely to Trump. Indeed, many were made before he was even elected.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re leaving out the reason for Trump&#39;s wall to wall coverage in the media to fit your view. It&#39;s all in the emails. Hillary was a flawed candidate and didn&#39;t stand a chance against Rubio and maybe others(not my words, DNC people&#39;s) so they worked with MSM to give more time to the pied piper candidates(Trump, Carson and Cruz) the ones they thought would be easier to take down in the general. Media kept up the plan through the general talking about Trump non stop and taking focus off of all the skeletons falling out of Hillary&#39;s closet. When Ron Paul ran Trump tweeted that the media should give him more airtime and that he has some serious and good ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russia narrative is fake news. Let&#39;s step back to recent global affairs. Our government(whoever runs it) is working on another destabilization campaign in Syria to take out Assad to pave way for pipeline. Clandestine support given to Isis thought Arab nations. Russia steps in to help Assad, find the truth and bomb the moderate rebels Obama funded. Obama and Hillary are pissed at Putin for messing up their operation and accuse him of killing kids while we know the white helmets were working with the terrorists to plant false stories. The serin gas was used by Isis not Assad. Trump is sitting back looking at the situation and probably saying &quot;Russia is trying to clean up the mess Obama started and keep it from getting worse. I would work with him to defeat the rebels and Isis.&quot; MSM and democrats paint Russia as the bad guys in this situation when it&#39;s the complete opposite. Russia is no saint but they didn&#39;t help create Isis. Many countries are hacking us, Trump keeps saying he would work with Russia to defeat Isis so media says he&#39;s a puppet. Trump jokes to Russia saying if you find the emails we would love to see them. Media says Trump calls on Putin to hack Hillary&#39;s emails. The emails were already hacked. Wikileaks releases podesta emails and says they didn&#39;t get them from Russia. Podestas password was p@ssword, he fell for phishing scheme and lost his iPhone in a cab. If Russia hacked those emails so did 100s of others. Hillary camp and MSM point out ties of some trump campaign staff to Russia. Manafort did some lobbying in Ukraine, Flynn was on Russia today and took a trip to Russia years ago, sessions met with Russian ambassador as a senator. Is any of this really out of the ordinary?? Hillary and her people have business deal with Russia and 10x the connections. Trump wins, Hillary blames Russia because her donors are demanding answers. Obama wiretaps trump and finds nothing. FBI finds nothing in their investigation. MSM is still running with Russia-Trump conspiracy. The fake part of the news is how they frame it. It&#39;s perfectly normal for Flynn to call Russian ambassador, it&#39;s perfectly normal for seasons to have met with Kislyak but MSM melts down for 48 hours straight over a conspiracy they know isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s fake. Yesterday trump tweets about obama wiretapping him and MSM talking point is &quot;trump claims obama wiretapped his phones without giving proof&quot;. So now they want proof? If they took the time to search for it they would have found stories on it from months ago but since it didn&#39;t come from CNN or wapo it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount Hillary received from Google, JPmorgan, Citigroup, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Microsoft was over $6.5 Million and I bring this up just to show some perspective. The $6.5 million in private contributions was the total from over 1,000 donations and the max they could give was $5,000. What am I supposed to see here? Please point me in the direction of some evidence that someone&#39;s $5,000 donation got them a nice government contract or a deal of that sort. The man used over $50,000,000 of his own money. </p>
