<p>Plenty of people never hated him. You realize that you can hate somebodies policies without hating them, right? Unlike probably a fair amount of people here, I was old enough to vote during both Bush elections. I voted against him both times. I always strongly disagreed with him, thought he made some terrible decisions, and thought his presidency was a disaster. I never hated the guy himself, he seemed like a decent enough guy trying to do the best he could, he just sucked and wasn&#39;t that bright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with Gore Vidal&#39;s commentary on what may or may not be GW&#39;s disability. But I&#39;d submit that while Vidal ranks among the best political commentators in modern history, Vidal is not qualified to comment on anyone&#39;s dyslexia or lack there of. </p>

<p>Last I checked, Gore Vidal was never licensed or trained in any form of psychology, so he never assessed GW in a professional psychologist capacity. </p>

<p>Why did you mentioned Gore Vidal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I agree with you about Gore Vidal  not having a psychology degree (though still he was a first rate judge of politics). I neither have a degree in psychology. Then I don&#39;t know to many critics of George Bush who simply dismiss him as stupid having a psychology degree.</p>

<p>I mentioned Gore Vidal cause of an interview he did on ABC Radio Australia before he died. He was asked about what he thought of George Bush. I can&#39;t remember the program or date. Gore responded that he thought Bush was dyslexic and this remark stuck for the following reason.</p>

<p>I have female cousin with dyslexia. It is a family heirloom as this woman&#39;s great aunt had it also. </p>

<p>This cousin (if she hasn&#39;t got someone to read for her like her daughters) tells me she can read every forth or fifth word to get a gist of what the writing said. By reading every third or forth word she occasionally makes mistakes when referring to something she has read, like jumbling up the sequence of words as Bush does.</p>

<p>She has told me she doesn&#39;t like people knowing she has dyslexia cause of being picked on at school because of it. So when she makes a mistake in reading something (like a street sign, or something on restaurant menu) she calls herself a ditz and acts the dumb blonde to hide it. Having witnessed her make mistakes reading a menu in a restaurant and acting out the dumb routine afterwards, it makes her sound and act like George Bush when he spoke and jumbled his words.</p>

<p>Despite playing the ditz she is actually very intelligent. Tell her something and she will repeat it back to you some years down the track verbatim, sometimes with day and month attached. She understands the implications and meanings of what is said to her and is astute in picking up minutiae of what people say to her verbally due to fact this is her only way of obtaining information.</p>

<p>Her great aunt, who rose to become very high up in a statewide charity so that she had a hospital ward named after her, also had dyslexia. Her dyslexia was well known in the family as she relied on her husband and her sister (my great grandmother) to read any letter she received. She too is said to have the ability to repeat what was said to her months and years later.</p>

<p>I am not one who subscribes to George Bush being dumb. I think he knew what he was doing. I think Bush just hid behind a persona of stupidity so people wouldn&#39;t see he was a manipulating psycho that he was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel comfortable writing about a third person. </p>

<p>Yes Gore Vidal had no psychology degree that I know of. Neither have I.</p>

<p>The reason I mentioned Gore Vidal was on interview with the ABC radio shortly before his death he was asked what he thought of George Bush. Gore replied Bush had dyslexia.  </p>

<p>This stuck because I know people with dyslexia and they do pretty much the same thing George Bush does and mess up sentences as they read. They also play the dumb person when caught out misreading something rather then tell a person they suffer from dyslexia due to bulling they recieved over this condition by students and teachers.</p>

<p>Have found this person to be very intelligent. Incredible memory. I have seen them getting into an argumeñt with their uncle over when he started a job after WW2, citing the day, date and time in 1947 and a quick check revealed the person was was right. This was in,2006.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Devil&#39;s advocate: It&#39;s also possible that this &quot;whitewashing&quot; is driven by the publicists. Ever wonder why Tom Cruise never gets interrogated about all the claims about scientology coming out? </p>

<p>Basically, a small group of agents and publicists control access to most celebrities. It doesn&#39;t matter that he was the President he&#39;s now on a book tour, and has a full set of publicists and agents managing his press. </p>

<p>Late night talk shows get 3 million viewers if they&#39;re lucky. They are not all-powerful. Without a steady stream of celebrities they are nothing. If you piss off a publicist you are risking losing access to everybody they represent, and even by proxy, other publicists. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge racket that nobody has really exposed yet. Watch Louis Theroux&#39;s documentary about publicist Max Clifford. Louis was openly &quot;threatened&quot; by Max with negative press. Thankfully Max is in jail now, but not all publicists are committing crimes. </p>

I&#39;m a combat vet and I cursed his name all 15 months I spent in Fallujah during the surge. I think there&#39;s a lot more to 9/11 than MSM tells us. But I see a humanity in Bush now, not because he&#39;s being whitewashed by anyone. But because he did something truly humiliating by taking all the heat and making a ton of shitty paintings over the years, then publishing them in a book to bear his soul, and that book has a publisher, so to get his message of regret and remorse out there, he&#39;s on the press junket. I think we are seeing a man who was broken by circumstance like I was as were my fellow soldiers. Compare it to books &quot;written&quot; by Cheney and Rumsfeld. They regret nothing. Bush was a dumb puppet and he knows it. I think he is as sorry that it happened to him as we are that it happened to us. It breaks my heart and I want to give him a hug. When I realized what his project was and how shitty his paintings were, it was truly cathartic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans are hardcore checking out of world politics and foreign policy is really the place where both bush and obama/hillary really messed up. Notice how even though republicans were extremely critical of obama&#39;s foreign policy, no one dared question the scapegoating of Assad. Every msm outlet presented a united front when reporting on the latest assad war crime (I think last month the same people who animated saddam&#39;s purported wmds released a nice piece on assad&#39;s 13,000 hangings...of prisoners...in a time where a genocidal force nearly destroyed the country...and the only evidence presented was testimony from these prisoners)</p>

<p>When you have a media that censors all the bad stuff we do in the world, and creates new fantasy stories where we&#39;re actually the good guys in the exact situations where we&#39;re clearly not, it&#39;s not surprising that people become sympathetic to people they used to hate. What was bush without iraq? Katrina? How much more prepared would Obama have been for an unprecedented hurricane if he were president at the time. Ok w/e i love bush now.</p>

The globalists/establishment had no choice but to honor their wishes, considering HW has the dirt on everybody. HW is 92 years old, George W is not well liked, and Jeb lost badly in the primaries.</p>

<p>It actually made me give them a tip of the cap, having the foresight to see the coming shitstorm scandal, and getting out ahead of time. They&#39;re basically the Brexiteers of corruption/pizzagate scandal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but why? This makes me think divisions are forming within the globalist faction. They were all behind Hillary, but after 40 years of the Clinton&#39;s corruption, it&#39;s finally caught up with them. The Clintons are done. So maybe this failure caused cracks to form within the globalist heirarchy. My theory is that Obama is trying to pull a coup, and now the old-guard are rallying behind the Bush family to take back control. </p>

<p>If I were a betting man, I&#39;d put money on Bush to beat Obama. George HW is a genius, and was the power behind the throne in the Reagan, Bill Clinton, and GWB presidencies, as well as his own.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I am a conservative. I vote 100% unapologetically pro life. It is THE fundamental right in which all society builds upon. I voted for Cruz and I do not believe the American government or a faction of it conspired against its people on 9/11/2001. </p>

<p>I dearly appreciate you guys and believe that you do very noble work in keeping people informed, the government accountable and seek to find truth, no matter where it is found. Peace. </p>

He&#39;s had 3X the education you&#39;ve had and to judge his intelligence based on political smearing, you&#39;re either a fool or just very naive. They want you to think of him as you described &quot;a stooge&quot; when he&#39;s not, but I do believe he felt bad for the vets, because honestly this is unnecessary. If evidence comes out then the fact he was painting vets really won&#39;t make a difference, I believe this is him trying to give back, not for the American people but for himself and his well being, and it&#39;s always good to see your fellow man take that step, no matter what your opinion of them may be.

    <div class="md"><p>I am amazed how everyone is quick to point finger at Trump and even show some form of nostalgia for Bush, when Patriot Act of 2001 act made immigrants deportable for having even a minor association with &quot;terrorism&quot;, and granted the government broad power to detain immigrants for an unspecified time without a hearing, which violated their right to due process. Moreover, these detentions are not subject to judicial review, and the government refuses to disclose information on those detained.  Terrorism is a loose term and any felony automatically falls under this category.  So standard process for anyone who is an alien and is imprisoned as a result of a felony, ICE steps in right after release from prison and places the person into indefinite detention while immigration court is making a review and starting the deportation process.  You may ask what happens to immigrants from countries that US cannot deport to?  Cubans or aliens from a country that has dissolved get to stay in detention for indefinite period.  Detentions centers are typically state prisons.  I personally don&#39;t have any issues with deporting criminals, but this has been done for 15 years and no one seemed to care until pussyhats came along.         </p>

<p>I think it might be like they are trying to slowly get people to forget what he did. Or, it could be a double bluff and the Conservative party know how much people hate him so they are playing on his ego, getting him on the TV and then people are reminded how much they got burned.</p>

Has great timing and makes up his own words AND FUCKING USES THEM. he literally thinks its funny to make up words and use them in his speeches. Come the fuck on. Thats hilarious. He smokes weed for sure. 100%. Is he still an elitist. Yes. But hes the kid of evil people. If you can keep a sense of humor during all of that, thats big. Says a lot about someone. He also is reported to paint to busts of fallen soldiers under his command, and i think he actually does that. He is a vet. He knows what war does to people that around death a lot. It weighs on your conscience. Even though he might not of seen much action. He knows that though of &quot;i hope i go home tonight &quot;. </p>

<p>Everyone is, especially minorities. People who have been brainwashed by Schindlers list might make an effort to appear not to be racist due to neurosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems most plausible. I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with saying he SEEMS like a likeable guy, but was a terrible president. He has always had that charm. I can hold both of those views fine and be able to separate power/politics from personality. Let&#39;s not forget the influence his father and many others had over his terms. </p>

<p>Plenty of people never hated him. You realize that you can hate somebodies policies without hating them, right? Unlike probably a fair amount of people here, I was old enough to vote during both Bush elections. I voted against him both times. I always strongly disagreed with him, thought he made some terrible decisions, and thought his presidency was a disaster. I never hated the guy himself, he seemed like a decent enough guy trying to do the best he could, he just sucked and wasn&#39;t that bright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is possible yes. However, the timing and context of what is being talked about in the interviews leads me to believe it&#39;s more about pushing a narrative for the future, rather than whitewashing.</p>

<p>There is some whitewashing going on while they&#39;re at it, though. Might as well.</p>
