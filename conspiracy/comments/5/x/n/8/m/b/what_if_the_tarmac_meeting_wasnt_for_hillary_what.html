        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of some things coming out about Lynch over the past 24 hours (seems she is the one who green lit the wiretap), it&#39;s made me rethink a few things, namely motivation.</p>

<p>The Tarmac meeting happened June 27th.  </p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/03/03/mark_levin_the_real_scandal_is_that_obama_spied_on_trump_during_2016_campaign.html">timeline of events</a>, this also happened:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>June 2016: FISA request. The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers. The request, uncharacteristically, is denied.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What if the surprise meeting on the Tarmac wasn&#39;t to discuss Hillary?  What if it was to get the ball rolling on these wiretaps?  Clinton was running to hide the crimes of the last Administration, so maybe Bill was a messenger between the two camps?</p>

<p>I bet you don&#39;t even know that expansion of NSA was gained via an amendment to the Patriot Act, that was passed by both Houses of Congress,2007/08 and blessed by the FISA Court and George Bush in 2008.</p>

<p>Very convenient that it became
law just as Obama became President, so yet another Bush Adm nightmare could be blamed on the new president by the media&#39;s paid   liars and Snowden the leaker was employed by the right wing funding intelligence contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, partially owned by the Carlyle Group.</p>
