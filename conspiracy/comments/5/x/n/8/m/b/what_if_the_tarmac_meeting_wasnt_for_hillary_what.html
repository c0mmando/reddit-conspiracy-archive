       In light of some things coming out about Lynch over the past 24 hours (seems she is the one who green lit the wiretap), it's made me rethink a few things, namely motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tarmac meeting happened June 27th.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the
       <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/03/03/mark_levin_the_real_scandal_is_that_obama_spied_on_trump_during_2016_campaign.html">
        timeline of events
       </a>
       , this also happened:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         June 2016: FISA request. The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers. The request, uncharacteristically, is denied.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What if the surprise meeting on the Tarmac wasn't to discuss Hillary?  What if it was to get the ball rolling on these wiretaps?  Clinton was running to hide the crimes of the last Administration, so maybe Bill was a messenger between the two camps?

       I believe that is called a false equivalency, and a topic move.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you don't even know that expansion of NSA was gained via an amendment to the Patriot Act, that was passed by both Houses of Congress,2007/08 and blessed by the FISA Court and George Bush in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very convenient that it became
law just as Obama became President, so yet another Bush Adm nightmare could be blamed on the new president by the media's paid   liars and Snowden the leaker was employed by the right wing funding intelligence contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, partially owned by the Carlyle Group.

       It sounds like you are trying to absolve Obama of any blame. If his policies weren't a continuation of the last 3 administrations policies I'd say you would have a case. But this isn't reality. Obama didn't change the game at all.

       You're arguing with a shill. I've noticed a pattern lately of 2 to 5 year old accounts without a verified email address that are shilling on a lot of these posts.  I think they realized that no one is fooled by the newer accounts &amp; have figured out how to buy slightly older user names.

       All FISA judges were appointed by Bill. I love how liberals ignore facts when it doesn't fit their agenda. If Donald was being accused of this you would probably be out throwing rock thru windows. Am I right??

       Not so. First the FISA Court is supervised by U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts, appointed by GWBush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chief Justice Roberts appointed two who are called Democratic appointments via some interesting telling of the story.

       Hmm that's interesting but not really related to the fact that the specific calls that Mike Flynn made (or at least the ones related to the initial scandal) were recorded because the Russian embassy was tapped.

       Interesting observation. This entire thing is madness, pure madness. I really hope they go down for this. 
What would they have to offer Lynch to sign off on the taps? Blackmail, money, seat on the SC?

       I think an argument could be made that Lynch owed her career to the same criminal cabal she was protecting.  Perhaps this was part of her deal for doing so: to obstruct and delay, etc. whenever possible.  What she (was supposed to) gets in return is a fruitful career no matter how incompetent she is.

       Lynch said on video that it was bill, her, and her husband. The part about her husband being their was very interesting to me, she added it in as a sort of truth in her bullshit. The only reason I can think of her husband needing to be there with her is if the were making a unknown, 10 minute take or leave it, life changing decision
