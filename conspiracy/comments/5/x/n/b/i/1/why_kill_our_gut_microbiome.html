       It seems almost deliberate but for what motive, or is this more a consequence for placing the wrong kinda people in charge of regulating authorities like the fda?

       How far out are you willing to go?
      </p>
      <p>
       The environment in the gut has been directly tied to mental health. If the gut microbiome can be homogenized, pharmeceutical mood control might be more effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kill off diverse natural gut biomes with an overabundance of GMO foods and anti-biotics and then reseed everyone with the same bacteria and maybe the strings are easier to control.

       Great question! Your gut is 2/3rds of your immune system. When you kill gut flora, you are weakening the entire immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more bacteria residing in your gut than there are cells in your body. Their happiness is your happiness and their death is the beginning of a slow decline into poor health and the.inability to fight illness properly.

       I have Lupus, and I before the symptoms started I had a bulls eye bite from a tick.  i still have pictures of it because the doctors refused to even acknowledge it.  I was walking in a tall grass field every day with my dog sometimes 15 miles.  I always found ticks on me after the walks...

       Might want to look into intravenous Vitamin C if you're struggling. I heard about a few cases of people doing super-high doses of Vitamin C with great success, for a couple different ailments. Your plight might be related. It's yet another very straightforward thing that is so simple yet we don't hear about it... it seems to ring true for me. I have my own experience also, to back it up a bit, of feeling extra good/clean after binging on a fat-ass grapefruit or pomelo every morning religiously. The citrus is a perfect food, just gotta watch your teeth. Anyway, been trying to learn a bit more recently about healing and I just want to help. Wish I knew more, but at the moment all I can say for sure is eat raw, clean, organic fruits and veggies... and a lot of 'em. Also herbs (and leafy greens) are important. It's not a chore when you get good at finding amazing fruit and then start to feel the deep rehydration and your ascension.

       I have been looking at this for the past 4 hours, and so many of the symptoms between lyme and lupus are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       they look for ana.  when I look at most people who have lupus they are FUCKED.  I have more in common with symptoms of people with lyme than lupus.  Plus it's pretty fucking rare for a white dude with no family history to get lupus.  it's a woman and black woman thing because of estrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm going to find me a dr this week to look into this more.

       The target/bullseye rash is the simplest thing to diagnose with Lyme disease. I'm sorry the doctors f'ed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen Lyme disease misdiagnosed before and was like how the hell did they miss this when the patient clearly describes the bullseye rash.

      <p>
       Smh, doctors go to school for 10 years and don't even learn basics. Always take your health into your hands and don't trust somebody just cause they wear a white coat.

       Probiotics can help get you back on track and are definitely recommended if your less desirable bacteria has taken over, but you have about 20-40,000 strains of bacteria, viruses, fungus, and protozoa in your gut and even the best probiotics on the market have about 34 strains max (billions of cells of those 34 strains)...so you can create dysbiosis by allowing a few strains to overtake the other 39,966+ strains.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best approach is to consume a variety of fermented foods, mix up your probiotics, shower less, wash your hands less, throw out antibacterial stuff, get out into the soil/fermented plant matter/compost heap with your skin, clean up your food/cleaning supplies/body products, and eliminate pharmaceuticals/OTC products.

       The bacteria and fungi living in our guts provide us with a large portion of our serotonin and the endogenous precursors. If the biome in your gut dies, you become lethargic and depressed.

       I became ill. Fatigue, I thought I had chronic fatigue syndrome. I even considered Parkinsons. Not so much stomach problems but a little bit. I became very depressed which is a symptom but also because my doctors didn't seem to take eit seriously and their only answer was to prescribe anti-depressants. So I ended up feeling worse because I assumed it was psychological and it was my attitude that was to blame. Eventually a friend suggested that it might be yeast overgrowth and I treated with colon cleansers and probiotics, plus I gave up sugar and bread. The result was amazing and the symptoms gradually dissipated. Apparently there's no test for it you just have to treat in the hope but I was so ill I'd have tried anything. Now I'll avoid anti-biotics unless I have no choice and I'll make sure I take measures to restore my gut biome.

       Thanks for the info! May I ask, when you gave up sugar, did you also stay away from fruit and fruit juice? Does that fall under your definition of sugar? Did you notice fruits and juice affect the yeast overgrowth, whether positive or negative? If you didn't notice a difference, or didn't test it, what would you assume would be the case after having gone through ridding yourself of it?

       I avoided anything that contained sugar, stuck to veggie juices. Also consumed raw garlic for a while. Results were pretty instant, within a week I was improving. Now I'm happy to drink fruit juices but not sugar in drinks or in food unless it's something I didn't prepare. I switched to Stevia and still use it. I'm assuming that 4 months of probiotics and no sugar has restored my biome balance and so I'm relaxing the regimen. If it starts up again I know what to do,

       antibiotics really did a number on my digestive system. acid reflux, irregularity, gut always "kinda off," that and many other factors led me to being 280lbs at one time. its a worthwhile pricess learning how to rebuild and maintain a healthy "in your gut" bacterial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       i will warn you. resetting a system like your guts is not to be taken lightly. lots of research and knowing your own body and bodily issues is key. trip to a trusted doctor and nutritionist isnt a terrible idea either.

       I have been looking at this for the past 4 hours, and so many of the symptoms between lyme and lupus are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       they look for ana.  when I look at most people who have lupus they are FUCKED.  I have more in common with symptoms of people with lyme than lupus.  Plus it's pretty fucking rare for a white dude with no family history to get lupus.  it's a woman and black woman thing because of estrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm going to find me a dr this week to look into this more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are killing me with this fucking lupus meds.

       Thanks for the info! May I ask, when you gave up sugar, did you also stay away from fruit and fruit juice? Does that fall under your definition of sugar? Did you notice fruits and juice affect the yeast overgrowth, whether positive or negative? If you didn't notice a difference, or didn't test it, what would you assume would be the case after having gone through ridding yourself of it?
