       She clearly didnt just "faint".  She clearly was completely out of it for a long time leaning against a post with her head bobbling while waiting for her van and when she tried to move foward fell to her knees  while those held her up under her arms. Her head was wobbling while leaning against the post and was completely limp when she was carried to the car.   Her black doctor who always carries the injector in his hand was opening the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was just a  faint she would have been given some water and recovered quickly.  She cleary had a tremendously bad medical problem that did not respond quickly to treatment for a mere fainting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think hillary would be a terrible president but want no one to die or have a serious problem and wish her a fast recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       However it is also clear as was shown before by insider emails and the ever present black doctor with a injection pen and her emails saying she was getting Ldopa that she has a very serious condition and can't be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which raises the question what happens now?

       Not true at all - Gary Johnson and his running mate are on the ballots in all 50 states for the 2016 Presidential election.
       <a href="https://www.johnsonweld.com">
        Their website
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       From their website:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gary Johnson and William Weld offer a breath of fresh air to a presidential election that is otherwise consumed by divisive partisan rhetoric. Both Johnson and Weld are former two-term Governors and both won re-election by appealing not just to their party, but to all voters. In fact, William Weld won his second term with the largest margin of victory in the history of Massachusetts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not only that - there are MANY write-in candidates still in the running.  One such person is Andrew Basiago
       <a href="/r/Andy2016">
        /r/Andy2016
       </a>
       .

       And don't you dare say "well if you vote for any other candidate you're wasting your vote" because that's not what voting is all about.  It's not a "me too" system - it's to cast your vote for who you want based on your criteria for merit.  The reasoning for whom you cast your vote should be independent of whether or not they have a chance to win.

       Couldn't agree more with this statement.

       We have that saying here too, in the UK, but I'll tell you something.  It doesn't matter because people will ignore that statement and vote for who they think can keep the party out they despise the least.

       It's crazier than that.  Her campaign released information saying she had pneumonia, which is related to the coughing.  Her handler is a neurologist.  She was wearing
       <em>
        blue
       </em>
       sun-glasses, which is a method to prevent people with dementia from "sun-downing".  They didn't take her to the hospital, nor react like it was a great unknown, but took her to Chelsea's -- meaning, it was usual, normal.   All of these are signs of late-stage Parkinson's disease.

       C'mon, there aren't gonna be any debates.  She can't possibly remain in public view for 3+ hours, let alone stand for that long.  She's gonna be "elected" without any substantial public scrutiny.  If she lives that long.

       Point is, they won't risk any more public appearances after this.  So there won't be any debates.

       It's a hunch more than anything, yanno? I'm not doubting she's unwell, I just keep seeing signs of alcohol and/or drug abuse in the mix, plus there are tons of "insider reports" of her over-indulging &amp; rumors of both clintons being addicts at one time or another. Even today, she was described as "combative" before she passed out. To me, that reads high/drunk af. Plus, her entrance into that van looks like any given festival vid of that one chick who decided jäger shots were a good idea before lunch. lol
      </p>
      <p>
       On a more serious note, I do have a good friend who (very honestly) struggles with benzo addiction. She too, gets "overheated" if she goes off-schedule with her pills. And if hill is injecting diazepam? Well, just dayum. That brings it to a whole new level of fubar. However, it certainly would explain her rather speedy recovery as well. Perhaps her handler is adept at sobering her up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not sayin' she's not sick, I'm just sayin' maybe she's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       sick.

       I can't quite go that far. She has lied and stolen from the American people for decades, and she should be in prison. The only reason she hasn't been locked up is her illegal influence peddling. I hope she drops dead and rots in hell.

       We're looking at a not perfectly focused set of stills that doesn't clearly show something falling out of her pant leg.  It could have fallen out of her hand and in line with her leg.  Same goes for if it were in her pocket.  She also has a suit jacket with pockets on the inside, outside.

       We have a limited point of view here and the "conspiracies" are honestly sub-human in terms of intelligence.

       I'm not convinced it fell from her. It looks (to me) that it was already on the ground and the "clink" sound happens when her foot is dragged into it. She kinda kicks it with her limp foot. I dunno

       What?  No, I'm not saying she isn't sick.  It could be just a common sickness amplified by campaigning everywhere.  Do you know how hard that is and how much stress it puts on a person?  Elected officials all say it is one of the most taxing things that they've ever done.

       Right this is the first one that the media hasn't been able to hide. She's been fainting and falling and being sick for a good while now. People have questioned her health for MONTHS, some for years, it's just that it's impossible to deny it any longer. You go ahead and call it an isolated incident, go ahead, I've been itching to bury someone in evidence.

       All your petty insults and denial tactics can't change facts friend. Concussions and blood clots in the brain are serious injuries, if the correlation that mosquitos cauce microcephaly is good enough to fly as proof these days, then surely this medical episode, plus all the subsequent Clinton "glitches" during public appearances, could at least be evidence that there's something wrong with her. It's not a leap of logic, it something a perfectly rational person would consider, would that same person jump to it as a conclusion, that would be moronic as it's one point of view among many. But to come here, and say that offering any viewpoint other than the officially accepted one makes you psychotic and ripe for insults is downright bigotry. It makes you seem desperate, don't get me wrong it seems to work because us humans love to gang up on those who are different from ourselves.

       That guy is not her doctor. He's a secret service guy who carries her seizure syringe. Her doctor is the lady to her left who was holding her up - Lisa Bardack (or something similar). Huma was not there that I could tell.

       I think the injector was actually a flashlight, since another picture surfaced with that guy holding it as one would hold a flashlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, your point is no less valid. That same guy, the big black guy who's too obese to be a SS agent, was present even today. If he were not vital somehow to this whole charade, he would have been ditched long ago. We are seeing a huge cover-up, and much trickery. It's obvious. I hope this awakens many people.

       It's a hunch more than anything, yanno? I'm not doubting she's unwell, I just keep seeing signs of alcohol and/or drug abuse in the mix, plus there are tons of "insider reports" of her over-indulging &amp; rumors of both clintons being addicts at one time or another. Even today, she was described as "combative" before she passed out. To me, that reads high/drunk af. Plus, her entrance into that van looks like any given festival vid of that one chick who decided jäger shots were a good idea before lunch. lol
      </p>
      <p>
       On a more serious note, I do have a good friend who (very honestly) struggles with benzo addiction. She too, gets "overheated" if she goes off-schedule with her pills. And if hill is injecting diazepam? Well, just dayum. That brings it to a whole new level of fubar. However, it certainly would explain her rather speedy recovery as well. Perhaps her handler is adept at sobering her up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not sayin' she's not sick, I'm just sayin' maybe she's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       sick.

       What?  No, I'm not saying she isn't sick.  It could be just a common sickness amplified by campaigning everywhere.  Do you know how hard that is and how much stress it puts on a person?  Elected officials all say it is one of the most taxing things that they've ever done.
