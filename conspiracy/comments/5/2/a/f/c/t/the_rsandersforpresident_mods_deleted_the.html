       From day one the users were pissed with the mods. They constantly tried to limit the subreddit, that's why the Donald went the exact opposite way and let everything in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, there was no asking the users opinion. They actually tried closing the page before the DNC(hmmm)but the users freaked out so the "settled in the middle " and decided to close it the day after. Aren't we so fortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm not talking about banning people. I'm talking about banning ways of communication. There was a time when the Bernie subreddits moderators were trying to put self posts all into a weekly thread instead of letting me the users decided the
       <em>
        type
       </em>
       of content that they wanted to communicate through.

       that's 1000% grade-a bullshit, the donald was and remains more heavily censored than just about any other political sub. It's a subreddit run by nutcases and a PR agency and it censors/"trims" every post that doesn't go along with the agenda being pushed there (which is a fake political opposition full of idiots who don't know any better).
      </p>
      <p>
       try telling the truth about anything in the donald and you'll be banned immediately. They allow anything that lets them pretend they're 'political opposition', try posting about trump being a clinton donor and family friend who is now set up to "run against" a clinton, and see how fast you get banned. It's a hoax. The entire trump campaign is joke on you guys.

       BREAKING. This from
       <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidShuster/">
        a fucking MSNBC shill,
       </a>
       even: the DNC might be considering a replacement.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Early voting has already begun. The marxist can't be on the ballot in those states.
       </li>
       <li>
        They'll have to go through the court systems of over 20 additional states to do it.
       </li>
       <li>
        He already left the party, so he's ineligible in those states.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       He's going to die quietly in Vermont, surrounded by his family, never having amounted to anything.

       I voted for Johnson in 2012. America wins when the best candidates of all sides are on the ticket. I'd rather have Bernie than Clinton and rather Gary Johnson kick ass and get on that debate stage. It's by far what's best for the country. I don't care if my side loses and long as we continue this shift in the political spectrum.

       You are more dangerous than the marxists trying to destroy the country from within. Learn what truth and objectivity are and do not vote again until you do.
