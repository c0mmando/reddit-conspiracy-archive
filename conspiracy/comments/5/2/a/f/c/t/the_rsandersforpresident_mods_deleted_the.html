<p>Seriously, there was no asking the users opinion. They actually tried closing the page before the DNC(hmmm)but the users freaked out so the &quot;settled in the middle &quot; and decided to close it the day after. Aren&#39;t we so fortunate.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not talking about banning people. I&#39;m talking about banning ways of communication. There was a time when the Bernie subreddits moderators were trying to put self posts all into a weekly thread instead of letting me the users decided the <em>type</em> of content that they wanted to communicate through. </p>

<p>that&#39;s 1000% grade-a bullshit, the donald was and remains more heavily censored than just about any other political sub. It&#39;s a subreddit run by nutcases and a PR agency and it censors/&quot;trims&quot; every post that doesn&#39;t go along with the agenda being pushed there (which is a fake political opposition full of idiots who don&#39;t know any better).</p>

<p>try telling the truth about anything in the donald and you&#39;ll be banned immediately. They allow anything that lets them pretend they&#39;re &#39;political opposition&#39;, try posting about trump being a clinton donor and family friend who is now set up to &quot;run against&quot; a clinton, and see how fast you get banned. It&#39;s a hoax. The entire trump campaign is joke on you guys.</p>
