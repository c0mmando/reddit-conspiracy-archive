        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After watching and reading countless theories on 9/11 and the ways in which the US government could benefit from the event, I have never come across the reason for making sure that the towers come down. It seems that flying the jets into them would achieve the same result with far less risk of being exposed. Why did they ensure that they definitely collapse? I doubt that the US public would react any differently if the death toll was smaller. It would essentially be exactly the same terrorist act.</p>

<p>I think they were knocked down with a combination of the planes for show, and demolition charges for effect. That doesn&#39;t explain what happened to the Pentagon though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once assumed that they brought the towers down intentionally and they did not come down accidentally, I think there are two possible reasons, and there may be several others..</p>

<ol>
<li><p>psychological effect.</p></li>
<li><p>destroy evidence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the evidence being destroyed there may be two aspects: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>make sure that it’s hard to find body parts, plane parts that might provide clues.</p></li>
<li><p>there is one theory i find quite interesting. A guy named E. P. Heidner released one document in 2008 in which he (as he states in the introduction) develops a context in which 9/11 might be analysed: he says that 9/11 could be considered a crime primarily and not a terror attack. He links Cantor Fitzgerald, Euro Brokers and the ONI at the pentagon (and several others in the WTC complex) to investigations in a big case of money/gold laundering. Actually he’s talking about several hundreds of billions of dollars, that have been transferred to 10-years bonds in 1991 in the context of the destruction of the Soviet Union. These giant amounts of money laid kinda dormant for 10 years and were due for clearing on September, 12th. I don’t know much about this money stuff, so maybe there are errors in my very short version of this document. Just check it out. It’s called:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Collateral Damage, E. P. Heidner</p>

<p>I don’t claim that this is what actually happened. But his theory is quite comprehensive and it’s not very technical. He defines a framework for looking at 9/11 from another point of view, but does not provide many details like as to how the tower might have come down. There are so many theories out there and so many strange people providing them. Most of them seem to be nothing more than gatekeepers. Of all the theories about 9/11 in my opinion this is (even if it’s not [entirely] true) the most fascinating one. There are several events he tries to link together. The most exciting piece is the story of a hawaiian trial Rogelio Roxas vs. Marcos Family. The official file is downloadable and the amount of money Roxas’ trust received as compensation is <strong>out of this world</strong>. </p>

<p>I think a lot about 9/11. And I am sure that looking at litttle details is important but one should frequently step back and tale a look at the big picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen/heard this theory in the form of a YouTube video years ago. My dad and I used to get real stoned and watch these deep, comprehensive, very long videos about 9/11 and every conspiracy theory under the sun. Sadly I&#39;ve never been able to find the video again, though. Him and I have so many saved with no form of sorting it all, we can&#39;t find it.</p>

<p>But yes, this is the theory I&#39;ve found to make most sense of everything. 9/11 gave them a way out of the bonds, as well as giving us a reason to invade for oil and power while making a shit ton of cash money in the process.</p>

I don’t know the reason I cliked on the video despite this meaningless name, but that was definitely the video that made me start doing 9/11 research.

    <div class="md"><p>You said you and your dad used to get stoned and watch 9/11 videos. A year ago me and a friend did just the same. Ok, actually it was him doin&#39; a lot of ganja and me just getting stoned from sitting next to him and inhaling what he exhaled. Both of us had a guitar each and we played &quot;The Roof Is on Fire&quot;, &quot;Whiskey In The Jar&quot; and other stuff I just dont remember. We were so damn good. And then we sat in front of his computer and watched one of these Dimitri Khalezov-&quot;It was nukes!&quot; videos. Damn.. with all that ganja it made perfect sense. We were so impressed. The next morning when all the clouds were gone I watched that &quot;Dimitri&quot; video one more time. And after that second time watching it was am sure: it was NOT nukes and smoking can be fun indeed. I remember Ted (the movie):</p>

<p>John: I don&#39;t know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.</p>

<p>Ted: No. I know this guy a long time. I&#39;ve known him since 9-11. You remember? I was, like, &quot;Oh, shit, 9-11, I gotta get high.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The buildings faces were literally going to fall off into the street because the aluminum fascia was bolted directly to the steel frame and in the salt air plus rain water of New York that caused a condition called galvanic corrosion. If you&#39;ve ever seen the corrosion that builds up around auto battery posts, that&#39;s what it&#39;s like . It eats the metal away. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a witness who&#39;ll tell you in the second part that the WTC was being eaten by it.</p>

<p>A page  about the problem</p>

<p>Galvanic corrosion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC already doomed.</p>

<p>That grandiose Titanic called the World Trade Center, which had been planned to last for at least a century, soon revealed itself to be an engineering stupidity and technological embarrassment. The facade, made of cast aluminum, had been directly connected to the steel superstructure. This caused a battery-like electric flow between the two metals resulting in what&#39;s known as galvanic corrosion. This problem had been text-book predictable in the marine-air environment of lower Manhattan, hence the embarrassment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://teslapress.com/911_history.htm">http://teslapress.com/911_history.htm</a></p>

<p>There was also 40 floors in each tower of loose asbestos in the ceilings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was a multi-pronged false flag in a nutshell. One, to terrorise the populace and galvanise them for a long-planned series of contrived wars in the middle east. Two, to get rid of the twin towers which had asbestos throughout the building&#39;s construction materials. Three, use the event as a launch pad for passing sweeping surveillance, and other Draconian steps to consolidate control over the masses. Four, create a war-promoting, military police-state that literally creates industries around their strategy of tension agenda that generate them phenomenal profits and government careers. </p>
