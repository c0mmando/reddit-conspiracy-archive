       which serves to show how skinny the body double is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this photo is that the aspect ratio of the video screenshot has been skewed to fit a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thumbnail from the source video
       <a href="http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/m_RhcVXVwws/hqdefault.jpg">
        http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/m_RhcVXVwws/hqdefault.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the difference? The aspect ratio is correct (16:9). The image isn't skewed like the top image. The double isn't anywhere as skinny as the comparison image wants you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to believe, but including this comparison image as proof really hurts anyone's credibility. You can't compare an image that's been skewed to another that's been cutout from an image and pass it off as proof or something factual. Why no one is mentioning this boggles my mind. I've seen this being spread here and as much photo/video evidence
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       picks apart somehow this comparison photo isn't being scrutinized because that would go against the sub's narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the evidence is somewhat compelling but this skinny Hillary picture holds no water.

       I remember a time in this sub where everything was almost over analyzed before everyone jumped on the train. People were very meticulous about "evidence" and were quick to share their doubts or findings that solidified their position/opinion. I just don't see it as much around here anymore.

       Reverse psyop. This is the fifth time a shill has mentioned flat earthers without provocation. And why are they openly mocking flat earthers? Because they represent any frame of thinking that does not align with the global reality.

      <p>
       They. Do. Not. Want. Anyone. Questioning. The. Globe.

       Earth is not flat but it most certainly is not a globe. So they make "flat earthers" out to be social outcasts because they know these techniques work.

       The concave earth means that earth, our reality, is literally a prison. We live on the inside, like a fishbowl or terrarium. There is no spinning ball in infinite space with aliens and galactic frequency beams to help humanity awaken. It's all deception. Controlling the knowledge of our very existence and whereabouts is the most fundamental control they have over us.

       If you're talking about the known look-alike posting a photo on Twitter saying they were in New York, the photo also showed her right outside of Chelsea's apartment that the apparent double was video'd leaving. I don't know about geolocated (which can be spoofed anyway, I'm sure), but she literally posted a photo of herself right in front of the location we all saw in the "double" video.

       I made a really long, fully sourced post about this earlier today &amp; managed to delete it just as I was getting ready to post. (Ugh!) I absolutely do not believe the body double narrative in
       <em>
        this case
       </em>
       for several reasons. The aspect ratio is absolutely one reason, but here are a few others:
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the photos submitted for comparison were not comparable anyway. Of course she would look different at different angles, in different light.
      </p>
      <p>
       She does not appear thinner - except in altered photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that she would use a well known actress that impersonates her publicly is absolutely ridiculous. Why not just get the SNL chick to take over the campaign? At best, it's laughable - at worst, a full on disinfo campaign to discredit the theory that her health is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her doctor said she was dehydrated &amp; given fluids. IV fluids have a dramatic impact on a person's appearance, so yeah, she looks less wrinkled. She was also given fresh makeup &amp; her hair was blown out before she emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe she overindulged in diazepam (or something) at ground zero, and was so intoxicated she passed out. I think that's another reason for her to avoid the ER. I also think she was dosed with provigil and IV fluids, getting her upright long enough to make a brief appearance &amp; have a quick photo-op, before being taken home to recover in private.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have more. Maybe I will re-do my earlier post with citations.

       Provigil really isn't that good for this sort of thing (source - I was on it for quite a while... gray market product).
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, it takes quite a while to kick in.  For another, it just isn't that strong, which is why you can get it gray market and which is why it's OK to take every day (I don't any more - I just got bored with it.)

       If she needed a jolt, it'd be Ritalin or Adderall.

       I think your on to something here with the IV fluids. I wonder how long that normally takes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the body double Teresa barnwell's face is rounder then Hillary's. They look alot alike, but if it's a body double I think it was someone else to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it is more likely to be a disinformation campaign (just her reemerging), after all, what a better way to dispel rumors then to reemerge healthy, leak a fake death hoax, and make everyone run with conspiracy theories to discredit trump and any others trying to say their is truth in them. It fits the narrative and no one knows what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: But what about the reports of the body double wearing a different wedding ring?

       Also, everyone was saying how it wasn't hot out. It might have been 75, but it was fucking hot out that day. Especially in the sun. I was sweating bullets sweeping up at work in soho at 730AM that day. The air was thick and dense.

       I didn't think it sounded much like her... And voice impersonation is pretty prevalent. Not the point where it could fool forensic analysis... But I doubt that sort of evidence will be forthcoming. We need more audio to compare in any event. I guess there is an Anderson Cooper telephone interview?

       If she does have a double (which is not unbelievable), they would never utilize it like this. They wouldn't march her out fully exposed to be scrutinized by the public. Doubles are only to be positioned at a safe distance (if that even exists nowadays).

       The proof is in all the photos and appearances this year. There are multiple Hilary's. Is the Hillary that hugged Obama on day 3 of the DNC, the same Hillary that spoke ok day 4? No. Definitely different. But we have seen both of them so many times before, we accept them both. We are familiar with both.
