    <div class="md"><p>If she is already dead, they would want time to minimize the panic. Their excuse would be that they wanted to let the immediate family learn the news first before making it public. Or just continue lying...</p>

<p>The DNC nightmare scenario is that Bernie is sidetracked as a candidate and that there will be a lawsuit as a response. </p>

<p>I personally think that she is dead because everybody are acting strange. The only thing that make sense is that she died or became incapacitated. They had no reason to admit to her having pneumonia. Also, this bit of news came from the doctor and not from Hillary. I believe that we learned about this part just because they needed a week to get things in order. All her main campaign leadership has presumably also got sick. </p>

<p>The only thing that make sense is that the Hillary campaign is over now and that they are looking for the next step without causing panic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another possibility: the latest coughing - symptoms events have been a charade. She&#39;s ill but not as bad as those incidents would show. So, in order to lock down the sympathy vote, she has this breakdown, lays low for a couple weeks, emerges rosy and invigorated (maybe with the help of some of Peter Thiel&#39;s own pick-me-up juice:) ), and pummels down patsy Trump on the debates. </p>

<p>Landslide.</p>

<p>Of course, if she&#39;s dead, guess Kaine, the positively-not-ClA ex-missionary will be the one up and who knows if he would be able to win over Trump on the media circus. Also, if Hillary isn&#39;t around anymore, who knows what happens with Trump: his contract was to make her look good, with her not around, will he get paid? Will he ask for more money to  take the fall against Kaine or Biden? </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna gain a ton with all this popcorn.</p>
