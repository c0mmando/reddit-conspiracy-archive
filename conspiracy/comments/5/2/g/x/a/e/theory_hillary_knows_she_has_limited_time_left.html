       That's why she's fighting so dirty (at the detriment of the democratic party).  It doesn't matter to her what happens after the election, and this is her last chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       She'll pass shortly after winning,  and Kaine will get the job.

       Chelsea will get the Clinton foundation, and she couldn't care less what happens to Bill.

       Sure it makes sense.. However this theory implies the election is more than just theater. Personally I think it is, and hilldog is just an MKUltra puppet. But I've had 100 theories and this is as good as any.

       What happens if she is elected, but resigns or dies before inauguration? Does Tim Kaine move in, or does this trigger a crisis that allows Obama to go into overtime on a third term?

       I seriously doubt this is just a Hillary ego show.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some agenda at place which dismisses every damage this causes to the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not logical that somebody that ill with such damaged image would be allowed to run. She is far
       <em>
        over
       </em>
       the breaking point for any PR reasons and she was damaged goods even before it started.
      </p>
      <p>
       The P2B
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have easily been able to pull up another Obama or controlled ex senator for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       it would be just an ego show what would that tell you about the US power structure itself? That it's just a smoke&amp;mirror show and there's nobody behind the curtain anymore. I don't believe that.

       its more than her being a narcsist. Even if she wanted to quit the race, too many people have too much invested in her. The powers that be will push her for presidency almost no matter what.
