       I'm from Sydney and both my roommates knew about the fainting incident. They're not redditors and  they're not redpilled and they're not into conspiracies (although they're starting to come around). So it's getting out there somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're censoring more heavily in USA?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It's occurred to me that it is now the day following the fainting incident, and she is no longer trending. People heard about it yesterday, but they're not being reminded today. As if "pneumonia" is a perfectly sufficient explanation for her rapidly accumulating strange behaviour.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is a bit fucked up.

       This could be an indication that something is indeed seriously wrong. One would think that CTR would be in overdrive making sure everyone believed Hillary was either fine or quickly recovering from her "pneumonia".
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is, I'd guess that they're not quite sure what the next step is, so they aren't pushing any narrative since they'd run the risk of having to backtrack if they acted prematurely.  Therefore, whatever is really happening must have flustered the Clinton camp and TPTB. And these are people who would have most every contingency planned for.

       The question for me is, why are they making it so obvious. It's like they don't care who knows anymore. It seems they are so terrified of Trump that they are pulling out all the stops. One thing is for sure, the bilderburg's decision to back Clinton has put them in it. I can only hope it was the ghosts at ground zero that caused it.

       Speaking of ghosts, that's the kind of thing that I actually believe in, more or less. It seems odd to me that of all the times and places for Hillary to dump it, it would be 9/11 at ground zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking it could have been planned...but the results were too messy with no clear narrative for that. Maybe it was the "ghosts". I know if I died in that cover-up, I'd be pissed.

       But what's so bad about trump? He uses tax loop holes, has companies that hires migrant workers, doesn't seem too hard on pay to play schemes, etc. Seems like a politician just maybe inexperienced. Is it the wall? I feel like there shouldn't be this much resistance

       Makes you wonder if there's internal etiquette for October Surprises... I bet we get something big the week of the first. Probably Assange's big dump on the 30th. Things are too sketch right now, they can't waste any more time.

       I don't get this thing about if you're a conspiracy theorist don't use facebook. What's the danger? That you might fall in the trap of taking photos of your food?

      <p>
       Who gives a shit? If you're on the internet they prob know everything about you anyway. I live overseas and stay in touch with my family and friends this way, not talk about fake news and people posting pictures of their babies 20 times a day.

       If anything Facebook gives you great insight on what the general populace stance is overall on politics and other stories.

       Yep, I know that. I think it's important to stay up to date on sort of bullshit the mainstream is spewing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say insight, I mean insight on what people are thinking, which way are they leaning, do they believe it, are they doubting. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way in hell I believe anything I see on Facebook, and really anything at all anywhere, unless I have done proper research or have seen it for myself to formulate my own interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I should add, there's a few people who I've managed to convince to question narratives on FB and look into what's going on, they might even be subscribed here now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's some positives for sure in having a facebook account for me.

       2 wrongs don't make a right.  Don't adopt the same spirit that your against no matter how small of an action.  You're also showing how desperate you are to burn her, so you are fulfilling the role of the oppressed in the power dynamic. Killary is more appropriate, but all in all names are just names anyways.

       for. Oppression, power dynamics, you could've just said "name-calling is immature, desperate, and has no real substance", I would've agreed, but you turned such a simple statement into something, ironically, showing how desperate you were to burn him.

       She deserves to die, but relishing and making fun of her illness is immoral and that would be something that she would do.  That is definitely not strawman.  With that statement I was trying to say that he shouldn't let her have a "win" by stooping down to a lower level and thus fulfilling the role in the horrible situation people like her and others have and want to create when he doesn't have to.  It was kind of a hard concept to explain, but a good metaphor is a medieval peasant running around in the streets calling the king a mocking name he created based off of the kings latest scandal in desperation to have some sort of edge when it was the king that creates the oppressive situation that would cause him to say those things and thus the peasant is fulfilling his peasantry.  My last line is the concept you are saying you agree with.  And killary is more appropriate because it has substance and helps people associate her with crimes, and isn't shallow.

       It's funny because of how hard she is trying to hide and cover up her illness. If she was open and truthful about it, it would be a completely different story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would consider lying to the public about major health problems while running to be the president of the united states to be a pretty serious moral crime. Not only is she running, she is possibly the only candidate who has a chance of winning because of how everything has been totally fucked up in her favor. She is in no position to lie about such serious issues.

      <p>
       On the front page right now-
"Reminder: Reagan got shot in the chest. With a collapsed lung and a bullet an inch from his heart, he still needed less help than Hillary to get into a car"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...he shouldn't let her have a "win" by stooping down to a lower level and thus fulfilling the role in the horrible situation people like her and others have and want to create when he doesn't have to.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't see how she is "winning" anything by me simply being the person I'm supposed to be...if no one talked about such things, THEN she would be winning.

       Perhaps people are not seeing your post?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realise not everything you post is shown to other people? The Facebook feed code takes a random sample of all your friends posts and shows those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course - you have to take for granted that "random"
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       random.

      <p>
       Try this: Post a little comment about saving kittens, and a "Upvote this if you see this post!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now post something saying something bad about Hillary - and an "Upvote this if you see this post!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare the upvotes you get.

       Facebook chooses what posts to show in peoples feeds. They purposely block content from appearing in feeds under the guise of using algorithms to predict what the user "wants" to see. It's possible that none of the people you were expecting to "chime in" even saw your post in their feed.

       There was one video i saw about "shadowbanning" on facebook. Some guy made some updates to his feed, without any responses. He asked someone else/made another account to see if they could see them, and they couldnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The workaround was easy though, there was the news feed-settings or something, where he changed the updates to "not public", and then back to public again, cant remember if it was per status-update or a global setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can try to find a video of it later on, need to go to school now, but it was earlier this year, so facebook mightve changed stuff since then.

       Facebook has always been for friends and such for me, sometimes share an interesting link or pictures. I try to ignore the political stuff.

       I don't even use facebook, but I feel like you two are sorely missing the point. Trends themselves and the news itself isn't important. What is manipulated and, more importantly WHY it is manipulated is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of Facebook as a propaganda platform/launchpad is undeniable. It's alarming the same way google is manipulating searches and the nature of news in America (and probably the world) and how your world view can be shaped by design towards something that doesn't reflect the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are millions, if not billions, of facebook users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I don't think it makes one bit of difference where you from or how great you think your country is, your news is almost certainly being filtered and arranged to make you believe certain ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say it's "stupid to rely on FB for news." But you could take it further and say, "it's stupid to rely on any platform for news." But our lives can't be lived in such a way where we can be experts in everything: laws, health and science, tax code, investigative reporting, tech and everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, you shouldn't just write off facebook that way. You shouldn't write off any news outlet. Instead, ideally, accountability should be demanded and consequences should be administered.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while one might say, "well, facebook has a right to choose what and how information is disseminated," that argument ceases when they begin restricting or suppressing others. That's a flip of constitutional rights which rearranges its guarantees to be dispensed by corporations. Thus, corporate fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time for people to wake up and develop a conscience about what they consume, from food, to products and services, to news outlets or websites. The power dynamic has shifted and corporations are the consumers. Consuming you.

       And even if you try and ignore it, you still saw the headline. Maybe you don't even believe the story being told, but you still saw it, and whether you like it or not you were affected by that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well that's how they control the narrative, make sure every headline tells the same story. Even the best skeptic can only make decisions based on what they see, so control what they see and you control what they think.

       All the media was at the 9-11 ceremony. Hillary bailed, and not one of them tagged along to see what was up. If a Joe hadn't captured the incident, it would have gone unrecorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, Hillary's campaign tried to get control of any recordings. Paraphrasing Churchill, Hillary is a fraud wrapped in a deceit, inside a lie.

       It's because right now her people are talking to the writers from the television series House. They are coming up with a decease or condition never heard of before that could be almost believable if promoted and written about enough to fool everyone. Something like an allergic reaction to blue mold spores that affect the nervous system but after antibiotics and other magical medication she will be as good as new in a few weeks. Nothing to worry about.

       The News has already moved on to the story of Ryan Lochte protestors rushing the stage during Dancing with the Stars last night. I like to believe those protestors are all Hillary shills there to create the next distraction. What a joke of a thing to protest anyways.

       Of course - you have to take for granted that "random"

       Facebook chooses what posts to show in peoples feeds. They purposely block content from appearing in feeds under the guise of using algorithms to predict what the user "wants" to see. It's possible that none of the people you were expecting to "chime in" even saw your post in their feed.

       There was one video i saw about "shadowbanning" on facebook. Some guy made some updates to his feed, without any responses. He asked someone else/made another account to see if they could see them, and they couldnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The workaround was easy though, there was the news feed-settings or something, where he changed the updates to "not public", and then back to public again, cant remember if it was per status-update or a global setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can try to find a video of it later on, need to go to school now, but it was earlier this year, so facebook mightve changed stuff since then.

       She deserves to die, but relishing and making fun of her illness is immoral and that would be something that she would do.  That is definitely not strawman.  With that statement I was trying to say that he shouldn't let her have a "win" by stooping down to a lower level and thus fulfilling the role in the horrible situation people like her and others have and want to create when he doesn't have to.  It was kind of a hard concept to explain, but a good metaphor is a medieval peasant running around in the streets calling the king a mocking name he created based off of the kings latest scandal in desperation to have some sort of edge when it was the king that creates the oppressive situation that would cause him to say those things and thus the peasant is fulfilling his peasantry.  My last line is the concept you are saying you agree with.  And killary is more appropriate because it has substance and helps people associate her with crimes, and isn't shallow.

        I would've agreed, but you turned such a simple statement into something, ironically, showing how desperate you were to burn him.
