       For many months prior to the shooting, we could hear gun training, in a rural neighborhood, approximately 1 mile (as the crow flies) from my house.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was every kind of gun, ranging from automatic, to semi-automatic, to pistols, to shotguns; and would go on for an hour, or more, at a time. I was surprised at the amount of ammo that these people went through. This wasn't recreational shooting. It sounded like serious training.
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently listen to the police scanner; and I know the approximate location because there were many calls to 911 about the shooting. The police were aware of it and told the dispatcher that some residents had a (legal) gun range set up on their property on a certain road (which is how I know the distance from my house). There were frequent calls about the activity, but it continued, and the officers seemed to blow it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strange thing is that we haven't heard any shooting since the event. We also had FBI SUVs cruising the neighborhood in the days afterward. Not sure what to think, but it does seem sketchy.

       I live in st.lucie county as well and my mom's an operator at 911. Yes, there are people who fire off there guns on there own property. For example there is a man who lives by midway &amp; 25th who calls in too warm 911 that he will be in his backyard firing his guns.

       Your mom rocks! I love listening to how they handle the calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I've heard of that one off of Midway, as well; and have heard the operator tell the officers that they'll be firing guns over there. This is a different place, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I'd love to hear what she knows about the other one (farther north), if she's legally allowed to discuss it (which I didn't think they were).

       East of 95, north of Midway. If she tells you the road name where the range is, PM it to me and I'll confirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit, it would also be interesting to know if she was on duty when they called in the break-in to his apartment (although I think that would be city of Ft. Pierce?)

       Not sure. Just that I found the timing to be odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've speculated, in every direction; but the way the police responded was very much like they did when someone called to report a break-in at the shooter's apartment. Almost as though to say "Mind your own business, we've got it under control."
      </p>
      <p>
       Most benign scenario would be that it was a bunch of civilians who had a ton of money to blow on ammo and the scrutiny from the shooting prompted them to cease their activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most sinister scenario would be that it was a training ground for a false flag scenario.
