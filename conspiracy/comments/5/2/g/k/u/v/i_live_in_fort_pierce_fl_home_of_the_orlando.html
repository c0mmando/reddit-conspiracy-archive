        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For many months prior to the shooting, we could hear gun training, in a rural neighborhood, approximately 1 mile (as the crow flies) from my house.</p>

<p>It was every kind of gun, ranging from automatic, to semi-automatic, to pistols, to shotguns; and would go on for an hour, or more, at a time. I was surprised at the amount of ammo that these people went through. This wasn&#39;t recreational shooting. It sounded like serious training.</p>

<p>I frequently listen to the police scanner; and I know the approximate location because there were many calls to 911 about the shooting. The police were aware of it and told the dispatcher that some residents had a (legal) gun range set up on their property on a certain road (which is how I know the distance from my house). There were frequent calls about the activity, but it continued, and the officers seemed to blow it off.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that we haven&#39;t heard any shooting since the event. We also had FBI SUVs cruising the neighborhood in the days afterward. Not sure what to think, but it does seem sketchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mom rocks! I love listening to how they handle the calls.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve heard of that one off of Midway, as well; and have heard the operator tell the officers that they&#39;ll be firing guns over there. This is a different place, though.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;d love to hear what she knows about the other one (farther north), if she&#39;s legally allowed to discuss it (which I didn&#39;t think they were).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>East of 95, north of Midway. If she tells you the road name where the range is, PM it to me and I&#39;ll confirm. </p>

<p>Edit, it would also be interesting to know if she was on duty when they called in the break-in to his apartment (although I think that would be city of Ft. Pierce?)</p>

<p>Not sure. Just that I found the timing to be odd. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve speculated, in every direction; but the way the police responded was very much like they did when someone called to report a break-in at the shooter&#39;s apartment. Almost as though to say &quot;Mind your own business, we&#39;ve got it under control.&quot;</p>

<p>Most benign scenario would be that it was a bunch of civilians who had a ton of money to blow on ammo and the scrutiny from the shooting prompted them to cease their activity.</p>

<p>Most sinister scenario would be that it was a training ground for a false flag scenario.</p>
