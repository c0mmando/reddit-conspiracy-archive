        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Msm now says she has pneumonia, Which , as I have heard is a result of a Parkinson&#39;s sufferer having difficulties with the epiglottis, causing food and other liquids to enter the lungs thus leading to pneumonia. It&#39;s one of the most common ways for a person to die of the disease.</p>

<p>The other strange episodes also fall into this category.</p>

<p>I think she is holding this from everybody so that she can be the first woman president. And to keep her friends in power. It&#39;s very sad the length she will take this to while facing this disease. Any person with any respect for this country who is this ill, needs to not be trying to be president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been stuck on this theory for a very long time now and the more evidence that presents itself, the more likely it is seeming.  Which is somewhat vindicating personally, after being called a lot of names for saying that&#39;s what I believe.  It also sucks for HRC that she has the disease (I wouldn&#39;t revel in someone else&#39;s illness), but I hope this comes out and she is shutdown before elected.    </p>

<p>The bottom line is that she is not fit to lead a country.  She is barely fit to be out of bed giving speeches and making appearances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought of the idea of it being a symptom of over exertion, which it could be. It could be drugs. But those are the lesser symptoms imo.</p>

<p>What really peaked my interest in even researching her health was the DNC event when the balloons fell. Around the same period she had a similar episode with the reporters where her head was seized. That led me associate that with the epileptic seizures of Parkinson&#39;s in its advanced state. </p>

<p>But also compare her behavior lately to the other symptoms.
&quot;People may experience:
Tremor: can occur at rest, in the hands, limbs, or can be postural
Muscular: stiff muscles, difficulty standing, difficulty walking, difficulty with bodily movements, involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, problems with coordination, rhythmic muscle contractions, slow bodily movement, or slow shuffling gait
Sleep: daytime sleepiness, early awakening, nightmares, or restless sleep
Whole body: fatigue, dizziness, poor balance, or restlessness
Cognitive: amnesia, confusion in the evening hours, dementia, or difficulty thinking and understanding
Speech: impaired voice, soft speech, or voice box spasms
Mood: anxiety or apathy
Nasal: distorted sense of smell or loss of smell
Urinary: dribbling of urine or leaking of urine
Facial: jaw stiffness or reduced facial expression
Also common: blank stare, constipation, depression, difficulty swallowing, drooling, falling, fear of falling, loss in contrast sensitivity, neck tightness, small handwriting, trembling, unintentional writhing, or weight loss.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piqued! ;)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing - it&#39;s a flashlight, but why does she need an SS guy/doctor to shine a flashlight in her path? Eyesight issues? Falling off a curb - classic diabetic blindness issue...but that doesn&#39;t explain the weird tremor, complete knee-buckling, and being lifted into the car.</p>

<p>I think you may be right about the seizures - a lot can cause that, though, not just Parkinson&#39;s. Even drugs can cause it (drugs used to stop seizures can actually cause tremors, there&#39;s all kinds of trixiness).</p>

<p>The whole thing reminds me so much of family members who&#39;ve had ortho surgery...you always put your arm under their arm like that to support them (but diabetic blindness, not so much, you usually just sort of keep your hand on their shoulders and talk to them about what&#39;s coming up and where to step down). And the handoff, if not done right (as we saw here), can cause issues - but it really appeared that she was conscious but had no muscle control.</p>

<p>Point-blank, both candidates need to divulge wtf medical issues, what drugs they&#39;re on, and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that is what is happening it&#39;s called aspiration pneumonia. Some symptoms include fatigue, difficulty swallowing, cough possibly with green sputum, blood or foul odor, wheezing and chest pain. Additionally this can be a complication of a larger issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she has it she must be pretty advanced by now.. wouldn&#39;t she have the obvious Michael j. Fox-level  contstant shaking that couldn&#39;t be hidden?  I mean he was like that 10 years ago and is still living.  Can apomorphine hide that as consistently or constantly as it would have to?    Or do different people have different symptoms?  </p>
