        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It happens time and time again. Anything they don&#39;t want the public to think about, they call a conspiracy theory. This is a thought-terminating cliche, and it&#39;s been effectively weaponized to get people to stop thinking about the truth. To me, it is really nuts that so many people buy in to this programming, but nevertheless I see it weakening as time passes. People who used to think &quot;conspiracy&quot; = &quot;things only lunatics believe&quot; are now starting to realize that this word has been needlessly charged with smarm, and purposefully so by the intelligence agencies through the media starting in 1967. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">(link)</a> They did this in order to convince people to stop thinking about conspiracies, for fear you might be labeled a conspiracy theorist, then you look like a tinfoil hat nutter and can lose your friends and job. </p>

<p>So if a big scary story comes up that a bulk of the people in power want to hide, like Hillary having bad health, then having programmed the public as they have through the media over the last 60 years, they just need to label any concerns about her health as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; or &quot;right wing conspiracy theories&quot; and then they&#39;re immediately publicly taboo. Think about the power that. </p>

<p>People programmed like a computer by TV and movies, when they hear &quot;this is a conspiracy theory&quot; they immediately think &quot;Then I must disregard it (or else I may be considered a conspiracy theorist which might hurt my social or financial standing)&quot;.  Some smart people see through this eventually. Most people never see through it. But it&#39;s getting flimsier as it gets overused. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re at a critical juncture with this. The media have been downplaying her health issues as much as possible (all except the unabashedly right-wing, like Fox News, thus fueling the idea it&#39;s a right-wing fiction), most saying any concerns are literally baseless conspiracy theorizing. But now, there is this video from the 9/11 memorial of her being unable to walk. Can they continue to call it a conspiracy theory when the whole internet has seen it? </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/mCBCMvk">http://imgur.com/mCBCMvk</a></p>

<p>So now the media has to choose how much to downplay this. Do they just outright ignore it, as we have seen <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> delete posts about it with over 5k net upvotes? With the mainstream media largely in Hillary&#39;s corner, what are they going to do? The &quot;This is a conspiracy theory, therefore you should ignore it&quot; narrative is wearing out through overuse. This is a good thing, it means the strength of that word to create taboos is weakening, and thus weakening its ability to keep people from thinking about certain subjects. </p>

<p>This propaganda is so deep, it is literally us censoring ourselves in our own minds. We have a train of thought, and we think &quot;I can&#39;t have this&quot; and we don&#39;t allow ourselves to go down it. We cordon off entire regions of thought, regions which may be far bigger than we realize, and it boxes us in to old thought patterns which keeps our moral and wisdom development stagnant, which keeps us easy to manipulate. It&#39;s all there, clear as day, but so few see it for the true scope and importance it has.</p>

<p>With the availability to censor news stories <em>even after evidence surfaces</em> by using this label to create taboos, things can be denied for longer periods of time. Maintaining power while doing unpopular things is all about having as many layers of plausible deniability as possible. This &quot;it&#39;s a conspiracy theory&quot; is another layer of plausible deniability they can hide behind to an uninquisitive and media-trusting public. Hillary&#39;s health is one of many issues being hidden in obvious sight by applying these thought-terminating labels, absorbed in to the public consciousness. </p>

<p>But now there is this video. It&#39;s not just some random video, there&#39;s a couple different angles, it definitely really happened, she clearly couldn&#39;t walk, and it&#39;s timely. It happened today. &quot;Everyone&quot; saw it. They&#39;re censoring it on big sites like reddit and facebook to try and stem the bleeding, but it&#39;s not really working. The TV news might have to actually acknowledge this, but I&#39;m sure it will be done in passing and dismissively, except for on fox news who will talk about it obsessively because it helps Trump. I don&#39;t say this to root for fox news, but just to point out how clearly a partisan issue this is. The left and the right not only have different opinions, they have different sets of facts they&#39;re working with! Calling the health issue a &quot;right wing conspiracy&quot; is convincing to many liberals because they <em>only</em> see it being mentioned on right-wing media, and therefore it must not be true and is a manufactured narrative. The right also has many things that are &quot;left wing conspiracies&quot; because they only see them on the liberal media. Facts are ignored by one partisan side because they&#39;re associated with the other side. </p>

<p>Certain facts are hidden as much as possible by people who don&#39;t want you to hear them, by labeling them as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. They do this until they can&#39;t get away with it anymore, because too many people know it&#39;s true, and they also know that just because something is a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true. What kind of sheep won&#39;t theorize about conspiracies when there have been so many historical examples of collusion and misleading the public? <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">(link)</a> Is it really any surprise people with power might cooperate with other people in power, so they all get more power? Is it really a surprise billionaires would pull tricks on the masses to make themselves more money? I mean <em>come on</em>. Let&#39;s get real. Behind every great fortune is a great crime, I believe is the saying. </p>

<p>Essential truths are hidden from us, truths that might make us wake up to the games being played on us. One of the last layers of hiding something is by labeling it a conspiracy theory to scare people away from being associated with the idea once it&#39;s clearly out there. Remember when the NSA storing all our phone calls and internet data was a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;? Now it&#39;s a conspiracy fact. Yesterday&#39;s conspiracy theory is today&#39;s news. </p>

<p>&quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi</p>

<p>Calling an idea a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is them fighting the idea, while trying to laugh at it. They just wish they could ignore it, but too many people are talking, so they have to fight because few people are laughing anymore. With this Hillary health scandal, I somewhat expect this video will be the motivator to push the media from &quot;laughing&quot; to &quot;fighting&quot; on this particular subject. I expect the media to do a million debunkings of this video, and try and to take it back to a place of laughter at the mere suggestion she is ill. But we may be past that now. The public is only so gullible. </p>

<p>&quot;You can fool all the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.&quot; - Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>Report it to the admins, show them that you are not the only one being harassed and keep records of it. The admins are against this behavior so if they see something is wrong they will take care of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Part of our shift in consciousness is addressing to authority. And also very importantly we redefine our terms about what humanity is, and reality is, what everything is.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is really just bringing out what is hidden. What tptb hide from us. And everything we hide from ourselves(the more spiritual knowledge).  Secrets are very entwined with religion as well. Overall I view it as a part of the orchestration which slowly moves the symphony to a crescendo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing how many times this happens, from Saudi Arabia helping with 9/11 to the NSA spying on everyone, conspiracy theorists are more accurate than mainstream news.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Good thing we have people, like you, with skills to make media, that aren&#39;t corporatewhores. But even some of the mainstream is starting to have a hard time keeping a straight face, even the white House press secretary couldn&#39;t get the word transparency out without giggling. I don&#39;t even think they are putting forth the same level of effort. Thank you for your time and efforts</p>
