        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: We do have some late developments as you see at the bottom of your screen, there are reports from CNN&#39;s Nic Robertson in Kabul, Afghanistan, of explosions there. We&#39;re going to get some additional information now. CNN&#39;s Aaron Brown from his rooftop vantage point in New York. </p>

<p>Oh, actually, this is Nic Robertson now in Kabul. Nic, what can you tell us out there? </p>

<p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Joie, it&#39;s about 2:30 in the morning here in Kabul. We&#39;ve been hearing explosions around the perimeter of the city. We&#39;re in a position here which gives us a view over the whole city. We just had an impact, perhaps a few miles away. </p>

<p>If I listen, you can hear the ripple of explosions around the city. Perhaps you heard there. The fifth explosion -- sixth explosion, I think. Gun bursts and star bursts in the air. Tracer fire is coming up out of the city. I hear aircraft flying above the city of Kabul. Perhaps we&#39;ve heard half a dozen to 10 detonations on the perimeter of the city, some coming from the area close to the airport. I see on the horizon what could be a fire on the horizon, close, perhaps, to where the airport might be. A flash came up then from the airport. Some ground fire coming up here in Kabul. </p>

<p>A lot of flashing reflecting off clouds towards the horizon here. We thought that might have been a thunderstorm before the detonations we&#39;re hearing now, much louder than a thunderstorm. Also, detonations very similar to those caused by large missiles. I&#39;ve been in Belgrade and I&#39;ve been in Baghdad and seen cruise missiles arrive in both those cities. The detonations we&#39;re hearing in Kabul right now certainly sound like the detonations of loud missiles that are coming in........&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bush lied, and people died.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>The CNN reporter reports air strikes by planes that only NATO forces would have had.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, maybe it was the Russians who did this......</p>
