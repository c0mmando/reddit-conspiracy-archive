       "JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: We do have some late developments as you see at the bottom of your screen, there are reports from CNN's Nic Robertson in Kabul, Afghanistan, of explosions there. We're going to get some additional information now. CNN's Aaron Brown from his rooftop vantage point in New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, actually, this is Nic Robertson now in Kabul. Nic, what can you tell us out there?
      </p>
      <p>
       NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Joie, it's about 2:30 in the morning here in Kabul. We've been hearing explosions around the perimeter of the city. We're in a position here which gives us a view over the whole city. We just had an impact, perhaps a few miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I listen, you can hear the ripple of explosions around the city. Perhaps you heard there. The fifth explosion -- sixth explosion, I think. Gun bursts and star bursts in the air. Tracer fire is coming up out of the city. I hear aircraft flying above the city of Kabul. Perhaps we've heard half a dozen to 10 detonations on the perimeter of the city, some coming from the area close to the airport. I see on the horizon what could be a fire on the horizon, close, perhaps, to where the airport might be. A flash came up then from the airport. Some ground fire coming up here in Kabul.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of flashing reflecting off clouds towards the horizon here. We thought that might have been a thunderstorm before the detonations we're hearing now, much louder than a thunderstorm. Also, detonations very similar to those caused by large missiles. I've been in Belgrade and I've been in Baghdad and seen cruise missiles arrive in both those cities. The detonations we're hearing in Kabul right now certainly sound like the detonations of loud missiles that are coming in........"

       What angers me the most is how the taliban was so quick to say they were for peace and didn't endorse what happened in NY... Yet we invaded and fucked up their country, Osama bin laden wasn't even afghan.

       The taliban was burning their poppies plus you've got easy acces to Iran from both directions by invading iraq and afghanistan making it easier to implement sanctions.

       That's the problem.

       The CNN reporter reports air strikes by planes that only NATO forces would have had.
