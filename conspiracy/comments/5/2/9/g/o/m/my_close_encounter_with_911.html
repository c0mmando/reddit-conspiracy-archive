        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>these are the 911 truths i know because i lived </p>

<p>On 9/11/2001 i was committed to  helping a friend in N J so i headed to  14th st/6th ave path train ...before i descended underground  i looked left at the #11 WTC buildings [pix news really put that 11 in our heads cuz they used the buildings as an 11 logo] against the most crystaline blue sky blue blue clear sky i will never forget that either beautiful clear 8 am in the morning blue sky ....never in a million years did i think THAT was my last visual of those buildings standing....downtown fixtures that they were</p>

<p>so the path ride was normal 15 minutes straight into nj and here is where it starts to get rabbit holey....8:15 in the morning they were holding everyone on the platforms all  the platforms  and not letting anyone back into nyc and it was wall to wall commuters already and really hard to push thru to get upstairs to meet up with K....so they had been holding them for longer than just 5 - 10 minutes and more and more folks streaming in [this is 8:00 commuter volume folks] nothing being said right but everyone squooshed shoulder to shoulder.....</p>

<p>first question why at 8 or so  in the morning were they not letting folks into NYC ???......[ this makes no sense unless there was some PREKNOWLEDGE or maybe EMPTYING OF THE VAULTS OF THE GOLD which is where the path trains transversed under WTC and where they say the bombs exploded ....i could get out of nyc no sweat but no one was getting back in.....and no mention of THAT in what transit news i remember listening to that morning ....</p>

<p>so when i got into k&#39;s car i was like please no howard stern today [or else i may have known what was going on] ok lets listen to  a tape [i had to push thru all those commuting assholes i was not gonna listen to their king for the next 25 minutes to get to port newark yes the airport at port newark my friend was a spice importer so he was right on the shipping docks  conveniently so but it put me in ground zero NJ ok?]</p>

<p>so we get there  8:45 ish or so and i know i got alot to do so i am busy busy at my desk ...met a new person who just started that day and then this guy comes in with a look on his face kinda horrified and all apologetic ok [ i didnt know him either but] anyway he was like so sorry im late but as i am driving up such and what  i just saw a plane fly into the wtc building and its fuming up i had to stop and watch unbelieveable .....and k is like no way lets go to the roof  so they went up to check it out and meanwhile a bit later  the new woman her mom calls and starts telling her what is going on from the news she is hearing right.... 8 planes hijacked [yup 8! what happened to the other 4?] and flying all whichaway and its not like she&#39;s on speaker phone but she is so amazed at what her mom is saying like disbelief that she is repeating outloud as her mom is saying it so i am hearing what is what  and knee deep in something i knew i had to finish before i could begin to process what i was hearing so around bout 10:30ish  K &amp; this other guy come down and they are like the towers are gone they just collapsed ....i had just finished what i needed to do .... and i knew those buildings were riddled wtih abestos[see below]  and i was like i got to get home [my young asthmatic son was at school downtown omg] once those towers fell all cell phones died our phonelines went dead until about 2 ish  everything was a busy signal or just dead  and computers stopped online access [WTC was the major antenae right so all  blanked out or was purposefully jammed.....who knows]</p>

<p>so the new girl piles me into her car and off we go thinking ok this is the airport someone  can airvac me back into the city right so honking her horn and waving our arms outta the windows  to attract attention  and a military jeep stops us and sez that the airport is on lockdown no one is getting back into manhattan least of all you lady and that we better get our butts back to the office pronto because they have shoot to kill orders ok [terrorists were reported on the loose in that airport at that time or fear thereof] and they just had a hunch that we were so ridicously NOT TERRORISTS.....the entire port newark now was on lock down we had no idea whilest we had driven off officials  came to k and the other businesses there and said evacuate everyone immediately but he had a spice order to fill and decided if we didnt evacuate he could get all the work done  undistracted.... so we actually missed the opportunity to at least head out of being a sitting duck all day cuz who knew what was gonna happen next a day unto itself like no other prior... so me and the new girl went up on the roof for the rest of the afternoon just watching ..... lines and lines of ambulances and militaria driving over the bridges in [and me being totally envious ] and  the rubble smoldering smoldering and the winds carrying all THAT south over brooklyn and onto southern jersey and such and we sat there wondering just how many dead spirits were flying around us felt like 10,000s ...</p>

<p>so finally around six o&#39;clock we get the signal we have permission to vacate ... the girl was goin south to her moms i coulda gone with her but i opted to go with K and his posse  back towards jersey city &amp; ultimately  hoboken...all we had to do was hook a right after leaving the building but k  hooked left and as  we were trying to get to jersey city to see if i could get back to nyc that way and drop off the other guys so we got to the outskirts [you could see folks covered in rubble dust milling about trying to get to decontamination triages[which was a really strange juxtapose cuz k and his guys were just hazmatted out covered in the lemongrass they were grinding that day just perculiar] but there was no getting any closer than that to the path tunnel or any chance to get to nyc for me and thereafter for two or more hours you could not drive right totally quardrined off with military vehicles and police motorcycles crews tons of flashing red lights  check points etc  [and as you drove past these stop points you knew you were not in kansas anymore... complete war zone police state wtf happened to my crystal blue sky and 8am serenity?] and into the deeper part of jersey we drove until the van broke [in hackensack maybe who knows] there was a slide hill down and we died at the bottom of that but in front of a diner as luckwould have it ... these were names of jersey places i had never been to before or since?? and we had to wait for his wife to come and retrieve us.....which took about another two hours so all told at 11:45PM  we hit his townhouse in hoboken and i walk into his living room [filled with chilaen news reporters who were there to cover a sporting event US Open maybe? but ended up with the story of the century right?] and at 11:45 pm chick gets her first visual of a plane flying into a building on 9/11........the next day me and the film crew left at 7 and walked to the ferries which started running at 9ish i was on the first of those back into nyc....i met three girls covered in rubble who had been evacuated to hoboken but left undecontaminated [there was a lot of confusion] and now had to head back downtown where they originally started because they could not go home until they had been decontaminated .... i got the film crew on a bus to 50th street where they had to go i think the embassy was there or their sister station something like that .... and then i walked from the westside home to lowereast side... and on every single street corner all 4 national guard posted no one outside just me walking thru a ghost town that morning and it felt like a total police state ....a total police state</p>

<p>so how happy was i to be home and how happy was my son ...yeah ok but what was goin on for him on the inside he was really young how scary was it to be at school....no mommy tuckin at the end of the day how much did he know how much did he want to tell me.... tv was off all day and we played and things seemed aok normal i m letting him set the pace he&#39;s a kid let him just be a kid and have his childhood safe and sound i kept looking for clues anything and later at lights out we both in the story read ended time to drift off now moment and he sez in his little voice mommi next time planes hit the buildings and people have to jump and die....OMG i swear my heart stopped and i was like DOC seriously a day like yesterday we pray comes once in a lifetime and yesterday was ours not something say kinanhora ever gonna happen to us again......</p>

<p>back in the 70&#39;s my grandfather a russian immigrant was a foreman on the WTC ... he hated this project so much he was a man of  few words but he would yell in the kitchen that they werent building this building correctly .... it was riddled with asbestos.... he lost men working on this building ...he hated it so   one day we walked to the river [ok 5 houses over but still] and he made me promise him that i would never go into the wtc ever.....that they were not built correctly that they would never stand and that when they fell they could easily take half of downtown underwater within minutes..... so tell me WHAT DID HE KNOW......foreman he was </p>

<p>and where are we today ....and who benefitted from this hose and pose......who made $$$ on the put options who made $$ on the insurance policies who made $$$ on all the paraphenalia that was manufactured ready to go in china a year earliest [with the right date on it how prophetic or profitic] who knew not to show up and who didnt and came to silverstein&#39;s breakfast and alll died!!!! ..... same folks who have decided not to count our votes this year not to let our choice electee win when he won what he won even thru their collusion and such.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine how many would die if they did a typical demolition. Not as many as 3000 I guess but still. Explosives were probably out of the question so first they would have to construct a way to lower the material from the top.  Perhaps two 110 story sets of one acre square scaffolding. No wonder they wanted the buildings to have an accident. It paid off for almost every member of the powers that be unless you consider the insurance companies and that money  was paid by the rate payers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i bet the asbestos was part of the plan from the beginning. radiation exposure is bad enough. inhaling irradiated asbestos means you get exposed for the entire decay life of the i-131. </p>

<p>i do wonder just how far back 9/11 was planned. late 1960s (construction)? mid 1940s (manhattan project)? earlier??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The towers were what I saw over the rooftops in Carroll Gardens where I was living on 9/11. Lying in bed the glare from the sun hitting off them was blinding. I was working on 53rd between 5th &amp; 6th overseeing the installation of an international exhibition of craft. My kid was working on the crew that day. We were scheduled to open on the 12th, people were flying in from all over the states and Europe for the opening, so we started work that day at 8am. I was in my office when some of the crew came down the hall talking about a plane that hit one of the towers and we all walked over to 6th ave and saw billowing clouds of black smoke at the end of Manhattan. Some of the kids were freaking out cause they knew someone who worked down there. The phones went dead and the director was not yet on site. The streets were filling with office workers pouring out of the surrounding buildings (we were attached to the Deutche Bank) and I sent my crew home since they were totally agitated and unfocused - and I couldn&#39;t see us opening on time, especially since the airspace was closed and no flights were getting in/out. The kid and I headed uptown 40+ blocks to the apartment of a cousin, along with masses of people headed in that direction, traffic was at a standstill, sidewalks filled with folks -no buses or trains crossing the river, the sky clear but for the black-ops helicopters flying over CPW. No TV but the apartment subway ran under the apt building and we could hear the trains begin running again around 3pm and me and the kid got on a pretty full car on the downtown C train. Creepy, quiet, the passengers looking really spaced as we rode under the chaos above us to our stop in Brooklyn. I&#39;d left the windows open when I went out that morning and the window sills and rug were covered with a thick layer of white powder; and my Dr., who lived a few blocks away, said the streets were full of financial papers that flew over from the offices in the trade center. The crew got back to work the next day, I got balled out for letting them go home, the show finally opened a week later, my subway platform was filled with pictures of people who lived in the hood and worked in the towers and didn&#39;t come home, and the view out my window was a daily reminder of what happened on 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. Very interesting. My best friend in High School and college apartment mate is a civil engineer (I&#39;m electrical) as is his father (sort of - building contractor but no degree). Back in the day engineering underclassmen took roughly the same courses the first two years, and summers and vacations I would often work for his dad, so I know more than a lay person about structural design and sheer forces, etc., although I&#39;m very far from your dad (or my friend). So reading your story had another level for me, as I&#39;ve seen and heard plenty of similar stories (just on a &quot;single home&quot; level) of builders and engineers getting really upset about bad design and implementation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a fascinating read! I&#39;d really like to know about the early closing of traffic into NY. As for the gold under the towers- remember how that was the plot of Die Hard 3? The bad guys created a big terrorism op so they could steal the gold from under the towers. Apparently the FBI actually talked to the film directors out of some misplaced concern about real terrorism. Maybe that&#39;s where they got the idea and sent it back to the higher ups, or maybe that was predictive programming! </p>

<p>i remember the panic on that day with everyoine reportingbizarre things in the media at first. I was just about to wake up to get ready for work when my room mate woke me and said the entire country was under attack. She made it sound like Red Dawn...</p>

<p>To think a whole generation of kids these days have never known a pre-911 world. Sad.</p>
