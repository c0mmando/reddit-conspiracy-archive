<p>They aren&#39;t stealing our money for rocket launches. They are keeping us placated.</p>

<p>They own this terrarium we live in. They created it. It&#39;s all theirs. This elaborate show they put on is to keep people in a profound state of ignorance probably for their own good.</p>

<p>The sun is a simulator at their control. The moon is simulated as well.</p>

<p>This is why the space agencies lie.</p>

<p>The history was laid down over the years to explain this shit out rationally to people trying to rationalize where they were.</p>

<p>Heh. It&#39;s actually amazing engineering.</p>

<p>So.. yea. It is what it is. If they wanted to they could probably cut off the oxygen to this place. Or turn the sun off.  And maybe alter the star constellation configuration.</p>

<p>They call themselves the illuminati because they control the Sun.</p>

<p>They are Gods.</p>

<p>They created the the Bible, a control mechanism. Have been using it to have people kill each other for years.</p>

<p>There is nothing we can do except see how this plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Follow out the end time plans they originally wrote in the Bible. </p>

<p>First, it will be cataclysmic in scope. The “heavens” refers to the physical universe – the stars, planets, and galaxies—which will be consumed by some kind of tremendous explosion, possibly a nuclear or atomic reaction that will consume and obliterate all matter as we know it. All the elements that make up the universe will be melted in the “fervent heat” (2 Peter 3:12). This will also be a noisy event, described in different Bible versions as a “roar” (NIV), a “great noise” (KJV), a “loud noise” (CEV), and a “thunderous crash” (AMP). There will be no doubt as to what is happening. Everyone will see and hear it because we are also told that “the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.”</p>

<p>Then God will create a “new heaven and a new earth” (Revelation 21:1), which will include the “New Jerusalem” (v. 2), the capital city of heaven, a place of perfect holiness, which will come down from heaven to the new earth. This is the city where the saints—those whose names were written in the “Lamb’s book of life” (Revelation 13:8)—will live forever. Peter refers to this new creation as “the home of righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13). </p>

<p>It&#39;s all simulated bullshit, but they have so far adhered to the plan.</p>

<p>They will probably turn up the heat on their sun simulator and scorch the land.</p>

<p>Probably turn off the star simulator in the sky to give the illusion the stars have disappeared.</p>

<p>Maybe turn off the moon simulator.</p>

<p>Cut off the electricity and probably project some insane madness in the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I can&#39;t spoon feed you this shit nor condense a 1000+ page book and Tom&#39;s 40 year career into a single reddit post. He has 380 videos on youtube, pick a topic and go nuts. It&#39;s the best information on the planet today.</p>

<p>The basics are this though: This is a Virtual Reality simulation. It is not objective and causal. It is probabilistic in nature as shown by the double slit experiment in the 1920s (quantum mechanics.) It can be logically extrapolated from two simple assumptions, 1. Consciousness exists  (you&#39;re alive now arn&#39;t you?)  2. Evolution is acting upon consciousness.  It&#39;s as simple as that. Look at what modern computing has created from simple 0s and 1s. It&#39;s all that is necessary.</p>

<p>Because this is a digital simulation, that has some awesome logical consequences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Possible to change and manipulate data (IE energy healing or hurting [voodoo])</li>
<li>Querying the probable future database</li>
<li>Multiple parallel simulations running at once</li>
<li>Telekinesis</li>
<li>Telepathy (think about email just using your mind.)
and much much more.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically anything you can do with a computer system is very similar to what you can do in reality.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the kicker.</p>

<p>DON&#39;T BELIEVE ME.   But!  Don&#39;t DISBELIEVE ME either. Stay OPEN MINDED and SKEPTICAL. Do your homework. TEST TEST TEST. VALIDATE!   When you start diagnosing people from a distance with 80% accuracy then you may be on to something. When you start remote viewing and getting VALIDATION that what you saw was CORRECT then you are on to something.</p>

<p>Have a look in PEAR Labs (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research) , INTENTION is the key.</p>

<p>Yes yes there are some families here that have power and control, but the good news is they are only big fish in a little pond. In the larger reality they are nearly powerless and they don&#39;t have any control. Money does not equal power in the LARGER REALITY. Even if they are preforming rituals that doesn&#39;t mean they know how to do this stuff effectively and have a good purpose for it. This shit is way deep, and it&#39;s not even a conspiracy it can be scientifically validated (and has been.)</p>

<p>Do your homework, you&#39;re on the right path. Best of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied this all year in my own ways. I think the simulation has multiple purposes but the main purpose is to experience imperfection so that we can compare it to perfection which is all that exists in reality. Basically, to truly be aware of the good, we have to experience the bad. Since bad can&#39;t happen in real life, we made a simulation where it could occur. We don&#39;t remember all this mostly because part of the deal is having a memory filter that blocks our past or else the simulation wouldn&#39;t work as intended. </p>

<p>Like you said, do your own research but this is what I gathered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are human constructs that impose various moralities on what we&#39;re wired for (existence, the Creative Principle, pleasure, etc.), both mentally and physically. When you bring terms like &quot;perfection&quot; into it, you&#39;re begging a definition that is pretty subjective. </p>

<p>Why would any intelligent life form (as we can conceive) want or need to experience suffering through a simulation – and likewise impose a reality on the VR beings that involved &quot;imperfection&quot; and pain? We need that to be aware of the &quot;good&quot;? Sounds just like some Old Testament god teaching us a lesson. I&#39;ll agree that the disappearance of that duality is part of our evolution, but from a higher perspective and in terms of a simulation, who the fuck would be getting their shits and giggles out of this human/earth-bound struggle towards that understanding?</p>

<p>There is no good or evil/bad, only that which supports or fights against our nature and evolution. I&#39;m still open to life being VR, but I cannot reconcile the &quot;intent&quot; of the programmers as being being commensurately evolved, i.e., to be intelligent enough to create this and have our reality be the best they could do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let me clarify. I also cannot put thousands of pages in one post but you are correct. There is no good or evil. I now believe that there is only progress and regress. We just call it good and evil. Again, this is what I found and I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe anything. Basically, from what I understand, real life is timeless and eternal. There is huge variety in life and it never gets dull. Everything is under self control even the level of happiness. All of life is one person and there is nothing outside of this one person. This earthly experience is what the one person would look like if it was extremely primitive. Basically we are all the same person experiencing duality and separation. As we progress through billions of years, we will eventually evolve into our complete self. In between deaths we experience actual reality for as long as we want but then we jump back into the simulation to continue the game of evolution. </p>

<p>So imagine in real life you have a Ph.D.  You jump in the simulation and start back in preschool. Why? Many reasons. It&#39;s not only to experience difficulties that can later be used to illuminate a permanently wonderful life. We can do other things here like forgive and heal which can&#39;t happen in reality because there is nobody to forgive or heal. Also, since everything is in full control, the mind is always aware of everything but in human form, everything looks like a surprise. Somehow this unpredictable motion (i.e. A bird flies by and you notice it) stimulates the mind. When the mind is constantly aware, it has some kind of negative side effect. Imagine a guy in solitary confinement who knows exactly what to expect for the next 50 years. It seems the overall point in life is to have fun and as brutal as it can be, this experience will be appreciated and the fun will continue on and on forever however this experience is a minute part of the overall experience which is always fantastic. </p>

<p>Think of this evolution game as a rags to riches experience.</p>

<p>Again, feel free to dump this as nonsense but this is what I believe and I was an atheist for about 7 years. I think the mind will continue on after the body dies. Religion has some good core messages but it has been trashed by politicians over the years. </p>

<p>If you are a physics guy, I highly recommend googling &quot;the law of one&quot;. There&#39;s deep information on the nature of reality in there in complex language. </p>

<p>Sorry but the above is not the logical extrapolation of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you stop someone who&#39;s intentions are bad but they believe they are good?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, because this is a virtual reality simulation, it&#39;s only logical that a simulation CANNOT simulate itself. A simulation is run on something outside of it. For instance World of Warcraft is run on a server outside of itself. The same thing is happening here.  Intention is operating on the level behind this reality, we can refer to it as NPMR or non-physical matter reality  (where we are is Physical matter reality, but it&#39;s only physical to our point of view, but that&#39;s a story for another day.) </p>

<p>This simulation we are in is a consciousness training simulator. A school house for consciousness. We have free will to grow and evolve, and likewise de-evolve. Using powers of Intention is one of the many ways we can interact here. It&#39;s safe to say with the level of Fear in most people incarnated currently that this is like a kindergarten of consciousness evolution. You can&#39;t really do much harm in the BIG PICTURE.  Conciousness is immortal, our virtual avatars are not, but DEATH does NOT MATTER in the BIGGER PICTURE. If the whole planet dies IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE BIGGER PICTURE. This is a single petri dish in millions. Likewise, if the system so chooses, it can just SYSTEM RESTORE to a time in history and allow the simulation to play out again and perhaps the inhabitants of earth choose differently. Things are not planned or pre-destined because what&#39;s the point of having a simulation running when you already know the outcome. Things can be nudged and guided though perfectly fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you stop someone who&#39;s intentions are bad but they believe they are good?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I would say to the above, is that this &quot;someone&quot;&#39;s intention is most definitely NOT STRONG. If they are deluded in their belief of what is TRUELY good (promotes consciousness growth and evolution, decrease in system wide entropy ) and what is truely BAD (promotes consciouness de-evolution, increase in system wide entropy ) then their INTENTION is going to be WEAK. And have very LITTLE effect.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now how about the person who KNOWS what they are doing is BAD. And even has a little skill in the arts of Intention control and data manipulation. Once again I&#39;ll reiterate, WHAT happens does not matter here, but how you deal with it does. Even if someone is terrorizing others with their intentional powers
1) It&#39;s likely to be shut down by system management
2) They can only do so much because of the rule set here (physics.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now I&#39;m not some pacifist, nor does the theory call for pacifism. If someone is terrorizing your neighborhood, breaking and entering, killing others, and going for your family next. If you have the power to stop this , it is your responsibility to do so.   I have no problem smacking down a mosquito trying to bite me. It made it&#39;s choice, I made mine.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the BIGGER PICTURE, it doesn&#39;t matter if the entire planet is enslaved by facist regimes. The simulation will still serve it&#39;s purpose of consciousness evolution. In fact, sometimes PAIN can be the biggest motivator to GROW AND EVOLVE. But, Humans at this point in time, have the opportunity to GROW and EVOLVE <strong>WITHOUT</strong> the pain! It could be a MUCH better and nicer place, that&#39;s for damn sure.</p>

<p>What can <strong>YOU</strong> do about it? The only thing you <em>can</em> do. Grow yourself up. Evolve your consciousness. As you evolve, the entire system evolves. Others take notice. Now whether than means you get involved in local, or global politics. Volunteer. Create something that helps a ton of people. Or just cook some dinner for the little old lady across the street, that&#39;s up for you to figure out. None the less, have no fear that you can serve your purpose, escape the bounds of this reality, travel into other realities, or just merge into one with the larger consciousness system (it feels amazing) just as well as if this is a terrible place to live or a pleasant place to live.  </p>

<p>There are other realities that are much much worse than here, where fear, control, and dominance is the law of the land. Likewise, there are much much nicer places as well, where there is not much growth necessary anymore (sometimes things can even get stagnate in this places.)   An active and intelligent consciousness system is likely to try many different combinations in order to find the optimal balance of Fear vs Love to maximize consciousness evolution potential.</p>

However, many have been the times when a person thought they were right about something and had it &quot;all figured out&quot;, and were ready to move forward with that information, but then someone stopped to talk to them about what they were doing, and after everything was explained, the person in question realized that they were wrong about what they were previously so confident about and ultimately decided to not move forward with what they were going to do.</p>

And not only that, but the time between Noah exiting the ark and Abraham was about 400 years. So the biblical dating of humanity is actually around 7,000 years old. Also, archaeology is not and has never been an exact science. Its fine. I don&#39;t expect everyone to believe what&#39;s written in the Bible.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read all of it. I&#39;ve explained this to others before. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the instances of stoning and warfare commanded by God in the OT, He merely <em>used</em> the Israelites to carry out <em>His</em> judgements on the sinners and pagan nations. Likewise, when the Israelites turned from God, He used the pagan nations to bring Israel into captivity many times. All of the punishment was, above all, God&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>The Israelites were never told that they could just go off and start a war of their own accord without God&#39;s instruction to do so. In fact, the times that men of the old testament did this without God&#39;s instruction, it never ended well for them. So they themselves were punished for fighting of their own accord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then again, after Christ came we were specifically instructed that we were never to do this again. We are never to be used to extract God&#39;s judgement again. We are appointed to be gentle unto all men, share the gospel, and resist not evil - even if it means we must die for our testimony of Christ and His words. We are to turn the other cheek and lay down our lives for the brethren.</p>

<p>And before you even bring it up, yes, the catholic church went against this many times throughout the centuries. However, catholicism is now and has always been a <em>pagan religion</em> disguised as Christianity. Catholicism was formed due to <em>syncretism</em> - merging old pagan practices and gods with Christianity - which completely contradicts the Bible. So if you want to be <em>biblical</em>, Catholicism isn&#39;t even Christianity. So what that church has done and/or still does shouldn&#39;t be blamed on the Bible or Christianity <em>at all.</em> This applies to any self-proclaimed &quot;Christians&quot; throughout history who have gone out and murdered people in the name of Christ. Any &quot;Christian&quot;  that has done or does do this is contradicting the Bible and contradicting Christ.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I find it ludicrous to suggest that the &quot;illuminati&quot; or any other evil secret society had anything to do with writing the Bible, because the Bible itself condemns such things, and says that we are to stand against such people. So if they wrote it like you&#39;re suggesting, that&#39;s a huge fail on their part..</p>

<p>Eph 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

<p>Maybe if <em>you</em> actually read it with your own mind, and not through the atheistic lenses of the people trying to shove the idea that &quot;the illuminati wrote the Bible&quot; down your throat, <em>you</em> might realize that the entire Bible is actually <em>preparing</em> those who believe in God and Christ for what is to come when these rulers of darkness enslave the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More false assumptions about my personal beliefs?</p>

<p>I&#39;m loving this one, though, because it&#39;s one that I love to discuss!</p>

<p>You will probably be quite surprised to find that <strong>I actually don&#39;t believe in free will.</strong> The Bible teaches that God works all things after the counsel of <em>His own will.</em> :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe what most other &quot;Christians&quot; believe <em>because</em> my beliefs come straight from what is explicitly stated in the Bible, and the Bible teaches the opposite of free will! I hate to burst your bubble dear, but I believe the same thing - that it is false to believe both free will AND God&#39;s divine plan for all things can exist.</p>

<p>Do you have anything else to offer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that you don&#39;t believe in free will. I also don&#39;t understand how you can be &quot;taught&quot; from the bible and here&#39;s why. If you read any text without anothers interpretation then the interpretation you come up with is uniquely your own opinions of the meaning. That&#39;s not learning, I see it mode as interpretation and subsequently that interpretation can be taught. I&#39;m trying to make sense while not being offensive because you claim to have learned from something that can&#39;t teach. It can only be interpreted or taught...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry for the hostility as well.</p>

<p>Regarding the idea that there is no free will - I honestly did come to believe that on my own while reading the Bible.</p>

<p>As for being taught, as you said, &#39;from the Bible&#39; itself, I understand why it doesn&#39;t make sense to you. That is something that most self-proclaimed Christians don&#39;t even understand. Though, I think the Bible is very clear about it. If I may... What the Bible teaches is that: </p>

<p>1) When we are saved by faith in Christ, we are baptized with and receive the Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and <strong>ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p>Eph 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also <strong>after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit are one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) The Holy Spirit is what teaches us all things and guides us into all truth. And since the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, it is God Himself that teaches us and gives us understanding through the Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, <strong>he shall teach you all things</strong>, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>

<p>John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, <strong>he will guide you into all truth</strong>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>

<p>1 Cor 2:9-13 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. <strong>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit</strong>: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. <em>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?</em> <strong>even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</strong> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, <strong>but the spirit which is of God;</strong> that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, <strong>not in the words which man&#39;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</strong></p>

<p>Proverbs 2:6 For <strong>the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding</strong>.</p>

<p>James 1:5-7 <strong>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him</strong>. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope that makes sense. It&#39;s explained many times throughout the Bible. I understand and accept if you don&#39;t believe any of this, and I don&#39;t hate you for disagreeing. Not everyone will believe. I&#39;m just trying to share what the Bible itself says about how we learn the true interpretations of scripture. I know a few people on Reddit and in person who learned the same way I do - outside of a church, just reading the Bible - and they came to understand and believe many of the same things I believe and understand. Although, in the sea of self-proclaimed Christians, they&#39;re hard to find, I&#39;ll tell you that. But Christ did say this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matt 7:13-14 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and <strong>few there be that find it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you have to think... If the Bible is total truth, then it must be true that God teaches us Himself through the Holy Spirit, because that&#39;s what the Bible explicitly states. On the other hand, if the Bible is not true at all, then none of it matters. </p>

<p>So the only 2 logical options are either 1) the Holy Spirit teaches, or 2) none of it&#39;s true and therefore none of it matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an answer for that in the Bible, too. I mean no offense when I say this - but the Bible says if you don&#39;t believe on Christ, you don&#39;t have the Holy Spirit. And if you don&#39;t have the Holy Spirit to teach you, you&#39;re incapable of understanding the true interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Peter 1:20-21 Knowing this first, that <strong>no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation</strong>. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <strong>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p>1 Cor 2:11-14 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so <strong>the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God</strong>. </p>

<p>(Man doesn&#39;t know the things of God, only God knows the things of God)</p>

<p>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, <strong>not in the words which man&#39;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</strong></p>

<p>(The things taught in the Bible are spiritual things that we can only understand spiritually through the Holy Spirit that dwells in us allowing us to understand them.)</p>

<p><strong>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God</strong>: for they are foolishness unto him: <strong>neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</strong></p>

<p>(The natural man, the man without the Holy Spirit, can not know the things of God, because they can only be understood spiritually, and he doesn&#39;t have the Holy Spirit to teach him.)</p>

<p>verse 16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<p>Do you believe that the controllers of this system actually walk the surface of the Earth?  </p>

<p>I mean, I believe there are people on earth that know the nature of this terrarium we live in and they benefit from it in various ways. But for example, do you believe that there is a location on the surface of the earth where you could flip a switch and stop the sun in the sky, or do you believe that the controls are beyond the reach of our existence?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of how accurate you may or may not be in what you&#39;re saying (and I think you&#39;re ultimately closer to the truth than not), it seems to me you&#39;re still missing a key important element - a vital element.</p>

<p>There is the simulation (i.e. this world and the physical universe), there are the objects that get rendered onto that simulation (in this case, human bodies), and there is the energy that gets inserted <em>into</em> those renderings to animate them (souls/personal identities).  That energy/those personal identities are put into the bodies that get rendered into the simulation, but they aren&#39;t the bodies themselves.  What that means is that what happens to the bodies in the simulation doesn&#39;t necessarily effect the intelligent identities inhabiting those bodies.</p>

<p>If the identities inhabiting those renderings (bodies) are kept ignorant and in the dark about who and what they really are (and what they&#39;re really capable of), then those identities can remain trapped in the matrix of the simulation, and they will simply get recycled over and over again from body to body, in life (rendering) after life.  This keeps these identities in the simulation for as long as they can possibly be kept.</p>

<p>So long as we&#39;re in the simulation, the <em>renderings</em> manifesting in that simulation (i.e. our bodies) will tend to be subject to the laws and limitations of that simulation/world - but the identity itself that animates the rendering isn&#39;t overly affected.</p>

<p>The key is to realize that you are <em>not</em> the rendering.  You are <em>not</em> the body you look at in the mirror.  That&#39;s just a rendering that that you&#39;re identity got put in.</p>

<p>The more you learn while in this prison body/rendering, the more you can be armed with in order to eventually/sooner or later break out of the prison of the simulation we are all currently living in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!  Absolutely!</p>

<p>What <em>kind</em> of meditation?  Well, there are many kinds, both structured and informal.  What I suggest is at the very least begin becoming self aware.  Not saying you&#39;re not already at all, but spend time - either when you&#39;re alone and by yourself doing nothing, or when you&#39;re out in the street, or <em>wherever</em>...doesn&#39;t matter - and be <em>self aware</em>...like <em>truly</em> self aware.  Try to picture or visualize this physical body as being only a <em>part</em> of who and what the real You is.  Look at it as a vehicle that You are currently using to just travel around in for a while (for a life).  Be aware that this vehicle...is NOT <em>you</em>.  Just like the car you drive or the bicycle you ride.  Doesn&#39;t matter how much you like that car or bike or how much you identify with it.  You&#39;re never going to confuse that car for <em>actually being</em> YOU.</p>

<p>Your physical body&#39;s the same way.  It&#39;s just a vehicle to get around in temporarily.</p>

<p>The catch is that we&#39;re actually <em>stuck inside</em> this particular vehicle and were made to forget that are not <em>it</em>.</p>

<p>So...meditation is a fancy word for simply thinking deeply about who we really are and where we really come from...and getting <em>out</em> of the physical vehicle/body - which meditation can help you do if you go deeply enough.</p>

<p>You can also spend, say, 5 to 10 minutes a day just to sit and try to calm your mind and your senses as well.</p>

<p>So ultimately, yes.  I would indeed suggest meditation - but make sure and don&#39;t mystify meditation too much.  Demystify it and realize that meditation is just another word for &quot;deep concentration&quot;.  Work constantly on having an awake and aware mind, and work on being able to have that level of awake and awareness <em>on your own</em> without the use of any external crutch or substance or device.  Your brain and mind and will power is all you need to get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve found it a little weird, if not unsettling - this idea of what the white light might turn out to actually represent.  It takes a bit of getting used to the idea that the white light that many who have had NDEs say they see and that almost every piece of literature has always claimed is a <em>good</em> thing, and something that you <em>should</em> go toward…is actually a <em>BAD</em> thing, a thing that completely wipes your memory, and something which you should stay very much <em>away</em> from.</p>

<p>I’ve been giving this idea much thought for a while now, and have been thinking that if there is any part of my identity that remains “awake” or conscious when this physical body is finally taken off and discarded, I’m going to try to remember as much as I possibly can to NOT so immediately go rushing into the white light.  Who knows?  I might just stay around a bit or turn around and go in another direction.  I don’t know really.</p>

<p>I’m really rather…intrigued by this idea and would also like to know more about it.  Unfortunately, however, it really does seem that there is <em>very</em> little information on it, and not that many individuals who have discussed the particulars of this phenomenon.  Simon Parkes is almost one of the only individuals I’ve heard discuss this in any real way.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I hope I&#39;ll have the wherewithal to check around before heading toward &quot;the white light&quot;!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Me too.  I understand that.  I mean I imagine that if there are indeed controlling, parasitic, <em>very</em> powerful beings that are enslaving our identities and that are immediately trapping us and wiping our memories after we die/cross over, part of the way that they would GET us to go into the white light is to make that white light appear to be as beautiful and loving and “everything good and positive” as absolutely possible.  It’s a trap.  I imagine they can get our minds and hearts to feel some sort of overwhelming feeling of love or emotion or whatnot emanating from that white light - which I imagine would make almost every soul/identity who has just newly crossed over just absolutely <em>want</em> to go into that “white, loving light”.</p>

<p>So…yeah…presumably, one way to <em>not</em> go into that white light is to have enough understanding and mental coherence and awareness in that moment after crossing over to FEEL that overwhelming feeling of love and beauty and desire…and then just simply turn around and move <em>away</em> from it…turn away from it…and <em>not</em> go into the white light.</p>

<p>Wow.  That really does seem like it would be a difficult proposition and thing to do to be sure.  How many of us would really be able to truly turn our backs on a feeing of love like that?  It seems that one has to have a very deep level of knowledge and understanding in order to know that that ISN’T (or at least might not be) what it claims to appear as being.</p>

<p>And then, on top of all that…what happens then if you DON’T go into the light?  Do you remain a lost, wandering ghost, just aimlessly bouncing around in the spheres of nothingness?  I’ve read quite a few accounts of identities that remained on this Earthly plane…and they are almost always described as lost, pained, discomforted souls that are more confused than anything else…and who are eventually, ultimately persuaded to “go into the white, loving light” so they can “return to source”…and then these books have always say that it is upon these lost, pained souls going into the white light that “they are finally saved and freed”.</p>

<p>And these aren’t any religious books either, btw.  They’re books dealing with philosophy, spirituality, and studies and investigations that different individuals have done into this subject.</p>

<p>So I always thought going into the white light was a <em>good</em> thing.  However, Simon Parkes - an individual that I <em>do</em> actually respect and I <em>do</em> very much think is legitimate and tells the truth as he understands it - is stating something which says the very OPPOSITE of what I’ve always read and heard about.  So yeah…It’s something that I’ve been giving deep thought to here and there for a while.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does he happen to have a video on this topic, that you know of?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  That’s the thing.  He doesn’t have a video specifically dedicated to this particular topic as far as I understand it.  It’s just something that the’s mentioned in various talks he’s given.  Here.  Take a look/listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXznCEtY0rQ#t=114m22s">this.</a>  It’s Parkes talking about the issue a bit.</p>

<p>This following is also a point I made a while back that I’ll post here because it’s relevant to this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is what various ancient Yogis and spiritual teachers have said:  Don’t go toward the dark…but also <em>don’t</em> go toward the white light either.  Go beyond BOTH.  Do not accept the bad of this or any other planet, but also do not accept the limited good either.  You must go beyond BOTH, for both are limiting and will otherwise bring you back down toward physical manifestation yet again and away from direct connection with Source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I figure it, one can actually logically infer much of the structure of things from first principles, not unlike what the Greeks did.  It&#39;s fractal.  It has networkyness.  It has names and language.  Really, just ask yourself how you&#39;d go about modelling something from first principles.  Monad -&gt; Linked List -&gt; Thing of Things.  This is the phi trinity right here.  From these structures you can do everything.  A symbolic math engine is immediately achievable next, because it&#39;s just the model of having a linked list of symbols chained together (digit sets) connected within a larger linked list (placeholders).  Boom, now you can do maths.  From that comes encoding, and thus words.   From words comes language.  Yadda yadda yadda.  There&#39;s a natural design progression to all of it.  It&#39;s decorative / phi.  The ancients knew it and encoded it in their art and architecture.</p>

<p>Anyway once you get to this point you might be tempted to look into language magick.  And then shit starts to get really weird.  And then you realize that the universe actually responds to language.  Woah.  All of this screams systems design to me.  So the sim thing is perfectly consistent with that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Bible was written approximately 5,000 years ago, there was still approximately 1500 years mentioned before the flood. And not only that, but the time between Noah exiting the ark and Abraham was about 400 years. So the biblical dating of humanity is actually around 7,000 years old. Also, archaeology is not and has never been an exact science. Its fine. I don&#39;t expect everyone to believe what&#39;s written in the Bible. But it definitely doesn&#39;t encourage murdering other people.</p>
