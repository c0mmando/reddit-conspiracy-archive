        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The new rap mainly has been changing for the worse.  Songs by artists such as Young Thug, French Montana, DJ Khaled, and other abysmal producers use basic techniques and music schemes.  </p>

<p>As music continues to decline in orginality/creativity, and turns towards songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6OUIjtM6E">&quot;Best Friend&quot;</a>, the audience will grow more comfortable and accepting to whatever they hear.  Good or bad.  As shown with the attraction to songs like this.</p>

<p>As music continues to get so bad, someday we will be listening to chalkboard screeching as the subtle beats in the background, until our senses have diminished through <strong>synaptic pruning</strong>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, you talk about basic techniques and music schemes, but I think production-wise, instrumental-wise, music nowadays is more complex and more meticulous than ever, and that includes the shittiest rap artists as well as the shittiest pop artists. As far as what&#39;s popular, I can&#39;t disagree that lyrically, a lot of it is extremely shallow to the point of being meaningless, but personally, I can&#39;t tell the difference between today&#39;s popular music and the popular music from 20 years ago. There&#39;s always a few deep artists who break through here and there, and there&#39;s always huge dry spells that appeal to the majority because people don&#39;t care. Do you have any data points that would suggest it&#39;s getting significantly worse?</p>

<p>I used to love hip hop because these guys had a story to tell, something to say. Now it&#39;s &quot;45s, 40s, dimes, and dimebags&quot; in just about every song. From time to time a song will come out that I enjoy but 99.9% is shit to me. </p>

<p>Yeah, I agree. The &quot;bling-bling era was cute&quot;, and gangsta rap is counter productive. Mysonne has a lot of mixtapes out that buck this trend though...updates constantly on datpiff. Still from the street and has the persona as far as is rational, but he&#39;s always intelligent in his delivery and analysis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define &quot;basic techniques and music schemes&quot;, instrumentals are normally fairly basic loops right? can&#39;t make them too distracting. The lyrical content? idk you could be mixing up effect with cause. Lots of music uses simple motifs or ideas, sometimes deliberately. In terms of production, it&#39;s probably more complex these days since the tools are a lot less expensive, although i know producers do use presets/sample packs instead of semi-obscure records.</p>

<p>Noise already exists man, Merzbow etc, we&#39;ve gone past the nails on the chalkboard thing. 99% people don&#39;t like it cos it&#39;s pretty technical/academic. </p>

All I hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash
Livin large, tellin me to get out the gang
I&#39;m a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
that I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they&#39;d probably be a friend of me
Since I&#39;m young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cuz I&#39;m the one with the trunk of funk
And &#39;Fuck tha Police&#39; in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there&#39;s more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don&#39;t know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...</p>
