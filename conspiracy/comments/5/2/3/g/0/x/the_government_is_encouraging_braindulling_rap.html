       The new rap mainly has been changing for the worse.  Songs by artists such as Young Thug, French Montana, DJ Khaled, and other abysmal producers use basic techniques and music schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As music continues to decline in orginality/creativity, and turns towards songs such as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6OUIjtM6E">
        "Best Friend"
       </a>
       , the audience will grow more comfortable and accepting to whatever they hear.  Good or bad.  As shown with the attraction to songs like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As music continues to get so bad, someday we will be listening to chalkboard screeching as the subtle beats in the background, until our senses have diminished through

        synaptic pruning

       .

       Been saying for years, plus encouraging violence in order to redirect dissent in the black community towards self destruction. Popularize a literal imbecile like Chief Queef and you'll sure as shit have the ignorant, desensitized masses killing each other in no time.

       honestly, you talk about basic techniques and music schemes, but I think production-wise, instrumental-wise, music nowadays is more complex and more meticulous than ever, and that includes the shittiest rap artists as well as the shittiest pop artists. As far as what's popular, I can't disagree that lyrically, a lot of it is extremely shallow to the point of being meaningless, but personally, I can't tell the difference between today's popular music and the popular music from 20 years ago. There's always a few deep artists who break through here and there, and there's always huge dry spells that appeal to the majority because people don't care. Do you have any data points that would suggest it's getting significantly worse?

       Idk if there is government influence or not, but I have read both old and new accounts of "businessmen" from private prisons working closely with the moguls of the rap industry. Not all new rap is bad though...see Mysonne and Immortal Technique.

       Tbf Immortal Technique is far from new. In the same vein though, check out dead prez, army of pharaohs, and jedi mind tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to love hip hop because these guys had a story to tell, something to say. Now it's "45s, 40s, dimes, and dimebags" in just about every song. From time to time a song will come out that I enjoy but 99.9% is shit to me.

       I know IT isn't new, neither is Mysonne...they're just still relevant is what I was saying. I'm familiar with  Prez and Jedi too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I agree. The "bling-bling era was cute", and gangsta rap is counter productive. Mysonne has a lot of mixtapes out that buck this trend though...updates constantly on datpiff. Still from the street and has the persona as far as is rational, but he's always intelligent in his delivery and analysis.

       Pop music has always been full of fluff, Dave Clark Five, The Archies, Ann Murray, Milli Vanilli, it goes on and on.

       Some recent mainstream hip hop is some of the most interesting music being made in our times, and some isn't. Same with every genre in every time.

       I'm allowed to like Young Thug and still be aware. Harambe is a killer (rest in peace) track, not that Jeffery is getting much radio play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, it's not just rap music that has this quality to it. I have a coworker who only listens to Top 40 from the past twenty years or so and he is an awful, morally bankrupt person with no empathy and an unnatural obsession with sex.

       Define "basic techniques and music schemes", instrumentals are normally fairly basic loops right? can't make them too distracting. The lyrical content? idk you could be mixing up effect with cause. Lots of music uses simple motifs or ideas, sometimes deliberately. In terms of production, it's probably more complex these days since the tools are a lot less expensive, although i know producers do use presets/sample packs instead of semi-obscure records.
      </p>

       Noise already exists man, Merzbow etc, we've gone past the nails on the chalkboard thing. 99% people don't like it cos it's pretty technical/academic.

       Peace - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash
Livin large, tellin me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
that I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

       It is?  Do I have to have a doctor tell you that the song's ive been referring to are very dull?  Do you consider them good/creative artists?  Or basic of the basic.  This is an idea

       I think new rap is being shovelled out, with low standards.  The more people begin to accept it, the more it continues.

       Never said it was good music however there are those who like it. That goes for every genre of music ever made. Do you know why they keep making the music they do? It's because people keep buying it. If people keep buying it then of course they will keep making more. Music evolves with generations and will continue to do so. When it comes to music, to each his own

       These are the sounds someone with a speech problem might make, or a young child watching cartoons.  You really think it is actually part of music "growing"?

       Never said growing, I said evolving. These songs obviously never last longer than a season and are quickly forgotten by the mass. There are those few that are pretty decent thag last while longer but the majority of people knows that those songs you are talking about, never last long

       Take drill music vs 90s hip hop, or even stuff like public enemy (fight the power comes to mind). Drill and other rap like it encourages nihilism (young thug, digits -"why not risk life when you're gonna keep going"... bunch of other examples where that came from) violence, self abasement, etc. Music could be an uplifting platform but instead it panders to and compounds negative tendencies created by a racist system.
