      <p>
       This is really hard to say.......more so to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im a 26 year old white male, Australian and i often browse this sub-reddit as i trust this more than MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i do belive i am 'awake' as in i belive there are powers well above us that are in control is at all levels ie feelings, thoughts, stressors, money, influence etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here is why im worried, i belive its been too long since we have had a World War, there are many signs that are pointing to potential conflict on a gobal scale. (For me to post links i would be here all night)
      </p>
      <p>
       So hence my thoughts......
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The price of precious metals have had a major turn around in the past 5 years not to mention Coal, Coking,Thermal and PCI (used for steel and energy production) has had a price increase ( in percentage) of 13% for thermal and 60% for Coking.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now i know the next 10 years alot of 'renewables' will come online. But Coal has shot up again with China buying more even though its been stated that thier economy is in a 'downturn' (now this is a stressor used to force countries into war as people perceive war to genrate income) not to mention India is trying to impove its standings and try and sort out its energy crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to research records of mineral and ores pre 1939 but there is limited stats. This can serve as indicators of whats to come
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Interest rates set by the 'Reserve Australia Bank' (Rothchild Backed) are and have been at an all time low over the past 5 years. Now why i mention this that i recently fixed my home loan at an extremely low rate so being curious  i questioned this and the repky i got was they are trying to offload money!?, this caught me off guard as why would a bank offload money? Or even reveal that it wants to reduce my debt?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Not to mention Japan, as thier rates are negative at the moment (how the fuck does that work?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Again i am intrested in pre 1939 interest rates, as they may serve as indicators.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We are all in an energy crisis...
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now this is where countries such as China are buying coal (electrical energy), farms and food processing plants, over here in Australia by the billions, the key to life is enegry (food).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the amount of Technology available it the past 30 years ie phone, fax, Internet and automation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have often thought of why everything is made in China, we get told its cheaper. Chapter 4 will address this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still our livestyle tech (ipads, consoles, etc.) are years in-front  of Electricity generation tech. Shouldn't we address this first?? Insted of persisting we focus on lifestyle products.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Its cheaper to buy Chinese goods....
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Well it is when WHS (Work Health Saftey) and Environmently (EPA) don't  exists. Not to mention a communist goverment dis-reguards vitality over production. This point is still subject to research as China is very secreative on its economic standards to a degree.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We are all being groomed....
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is done through Media....Media such as Music, TV, Advertisements and yes even my beloved videogames. We are being brain washed, in the past 15 years look at all the First Person Shooting games have been bought  (ie COD and Battlefield), programming us on how to handle weapons, take out fortifications and hand to hand combat (UFC as a reference as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i can keep rambling on but i need to vent after something i read tonight. I have loads more but i need to go to bed.

       Yes it's all very true. That's why I believe you have to hit every part of your life to make yourself stand above the average in every way possible. Get jacked and learn to fight, eat good so you don't need modern medicine, learn everything you can about the world to educate others. I am a free being, I love video games also but I can tell it definitely takes my emotions on a roller coaster, I can't think of anything that takes my emotions everywhere like gaming.

       I am kind of confused by this.

      <p>
       I think I get what you're trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend posting something like this in
       <a href="/r/economics">
        /r/economics
       </a>
       and see if there's some kind of expert that can bring some light into the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sounds like a classic economics situation - "Where is the money going". That stuff is pretty transparent when it comes down to it

       the reddit parser interprets them as numbered lists and restarts at 1. every time.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If a number is followed by a period at the beginning of a line, Markdown interprets it as a numbered list and always starts at one. For example, if you typed "2009. What a year.", it will output as "1. What a year."
        <strong>
         To fix this, put a backslash in front of the period
        </strong>
        : "2009\. What a year."

       Nice job. But anyway, First person shooters do not teach how to handle weapons or hand to hand combat, they make you more unlikely to handle a weapon or fight successfully so you will get killed when the big day when the american civil war kicks in.

       Yeah i know war isn't  call of duty but look at the first rwo COD: Modern Warfare games and watch the animations of reloading guns its very spot on. They don't teach directly how to handle weapons but subconsciously they give us a general idea.

       Actually COD would be a horrible example. The weapons may be based on real one's but the game has your character running around at high speed in tiny little maps blasting away with no recoil, and respawning instantly in seconds if killed. It promotes a type of a combat that is pretty much nothing like the real thing. If anything it's purpose is more of a recruiting tool. Designed to make the military look as though it would be a lot of fun to work for when it's really boring as hell unless you enter a combat zone then certainly no fun.

       Video games improve hand eye cordination by miles. Im no expert with weapons but on the few occassions where Ive been at gun ranges my accuracy is quite good. I know that those arent moving targets but being able to hit clay discs from 100 yards isnt bad for a ten year old (Im not 10 now by the way lol that was over a decade ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way that GTA 4 amd Forza helped me understand the basics of driving (which made me a competent driver from day 1) shooters help you understand the basic mechanics of weapons and improve your hand eye coordination. Of course you wont become Chris Kyle by playing Battlefield but you will learn some basics about leading your shot, bullet drop and handling recoil by firing in tight and controlled bursts and you can learn valuable strategies regarding bait and switches, flanking menuvers and the foundations of suppressive fire and building clearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Ive played paintball I almost always outclass the people around me because of knowledge Ive acquired in video games. I know war is completely different but the basic fundamentals of combat are in place. If I were in a war against other untrained people I'd definately have a leg up against them as evidenced by my kill counts in paintball which is generally a simulated combat zone against untrained adversaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I know war is an entirely different thing. Its life and death and Im talking about games, but games do instill basic foundational knowledge that the average laymen wouldnt understand.

       Couldn't agree more mate, try to prepare as much as possible and if we're wrong, you prepared for nothing and were intelligently preparing for the worst, but if you're right, you might just be the one to save your family from being raped and pillaged for whatever precious supplies you have in your home. I myself have a small go-bag prepped, nothing much, but I've been investing outside of the banking paradigm as well and if you have some money, I would suggest investing in assets that maintain their value that are not related to funny-money federal reserve notes.

       I would invest but when it does fall apart it would be really hard to pull money back out or even trade the assest.

       That's why you invest outside the paradigm, precious metals, invest in your own body and your own knowledge, work out and learn some basic survivalism.

       Why?  I don't understand what OP is trying to say. It just seems like scattershot fears about running out of energy or something.  I can assure you I know someone firsthand who says peak X is not true (oil, coal, etc).  We'll hit peak phosphorus before we reach peak oil and at that point, phosphorus will be extracted soylent green style (from people)
