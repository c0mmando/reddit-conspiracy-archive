       Basic Income means permanent dependability on your government.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example if you get a basic income of 1500€ as discussed in many european countries, several things will happen:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wages will drastically change.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no point in paying your employee 2500€ if he already has 1500€ to spend. Wages would subsequently adapt and factor the basic income in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that from that point on the government is paying part of your living expenses. Your entire life style depends on how much you get. Government says you have been a bad cow? Basic income goes down. Government thinks you should consume more? Basic income goes up. New government wants to be elected? Promises more free shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic income is nothing else but slavery. Your government can force anything upon you if it pays for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cash would have to be abolished. If the government would pump billions into people bank account every year, money that could be stashed away instead of consumed, there would be a problem sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you make the government angry they will block your means of spending money because cash wouldn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is already doing this in some form.

       Man this is so wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now you are permanently dependent on corporations/your employer. Who pay you too little. Treat you like shit. And fire you at the drop of a hat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites have created a system whereby we need money to secure the basic necessities of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the mechanism of our enslavement, which forces us to work jobs we don't want to do, for the vast majority of our waking lives. In order to uphold a system that benefits only those at the very top.
      </p>
      <p>
       All concerns you've raised about government provided UBI is shit that is happening right now under capitalism. Except that corporations and businesses are the ones dictating your lifestyle. Furthermore we are all under the constant threat of poverty and it's suffering. This makes sure you show up to work everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully acknowledged the capacity for government corruption and the danger they could use UBI to hold influence over people. However if executed properly UBI will give the common person the option to disengage from the system I they so choose... don't like your job at Walmart? It's not that big of a deal anymore if you quit to find something new.... bosses asking you to do something unethical? No problem you are not dependent on them for your survival anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money = power = freedom.. mandating government to redirect cash flows into the pockets of the common man is literally giving them more freedom. UBI is the answer! It's time to redistribute some wealth.

       Man, you're both right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are making valid arguments for UBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do not negate the argument that the UBI you're taking about - one that won't suck - won't be the one we get.  We're going to get the one u/strunberg is talking about.  If it comes from "them" it will be after they've made UBI ≠ UBI.

      <p>
       If we could mandate government to do things, we wouldn't be in the shape we're in.  We can't mandate.  "The Folks in Charge (TFIC)" call shots.  And I guarantee you that if UBI is implemented by TFIC, it will serve to enslave you ... like all of the other "valuable functions" they provide to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to look at this head on.  UBI is a great idea.  It's greatest flaw is that "we" have to get it from "them".  I think that this is a very interesting place to begin a productive inquiry.

       Plus, the idea of capitalism is that workers can "fire" their employers by going somewhere else if they don't like the salary. But due to market collusion on a massive level, those better jobs don't exist, and workers are faced with the choice: take a shitty job, or starve.
      </p>
      <p>
       UBI should be enough to live on. Just live. Get by. This actually makes the job market
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       competitive, because people would rather live on their basic income on their own time versus work their asses off for pennies more. If they go into the workplace, it needs to offer them a truly gainful return. Since they are already surviving, they have a leg to stand on in the negotiating process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides this, a UBI gives entrepreneurs the free time to invest in new businesses. It will actually create a small business boom because people will have the time to invest in their new venture without worrying about starvation. It also allows for basic community building. Stay at home mom? You can now take a greater role in raising your child. Want to grow your own food? You have time to start a co-op with your neighbors instead of relying on the grocery store.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fulcrum in the lever of capitalism is the impoverishment of workers. The American "Middle" Class is desperate to survive. In voting, housing, purchasing... we are given the illusion of choice, and the illusion that our fate is in our own hands. But we must play their game or starve. Put the power of basic survival independently in the hands of the worker, and now real negotiation, real competition can happen.

       If the federal government is responsible for wages and for providing necessities, you have just one place to turn: elections. There's only one government and two parties that most people are willing and able to make their own and thus there is very very little competition and incentive to restrain their base instincts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming the worst of intentions, the large corporations, small businesses, etc, are in some way competing for your allegiance. Yes, some of them collude, some of them wield undue influence, but most workers by a wide margin are employed by businesses with less than 500 employees and the majority of those by firms with less than 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a lot of "masters" to choose from. We could say that the "institution" of capitalism means they tend to act in some sort of mindless, tenuous, bloc. But they will never be as cohesive and powerful as a bloc of one, with the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       legally sanctioned ability to use force to achieve their wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trading the tyranny of a loosely connected, constantly infighting, rarely purposely colluding, indirectly controlling group of 5,000,000 competing masters for the monolithic, violent-force wielding, somewhat cohesive institution of one (or a few, if you want to count the parties or branches of government) seems like a questionable choice of you believe the worst of people (corporations and governments are run by people) and want to protect your freedom of choice and action.

       A solution to the social devastation caused by automation and labor arbitrage is an urgent requirement, and UBI is the best proposal on the table for formerly working people now. If you don't like it, you will have to provide a better one, because something has to be done, and soon, or the class war's going hot in a very big way. You can't just say anarchism; it has to be something workable now.

       I know that's not proof or anything, lol. Check out some history books for concrete examples. There may actually be a way to form government that does not eventually become corrupt but I don't know of any. Lottery selection of officials may work, but then you have the problem of who controls the lottery? There are some interesting advances in the blockchain space that could make governance really interesting.

       it will be corrupt either way.   at least we can mitigate the corruption by replacing the actors - or at least trying to, once in a while.   when that fails, you get what happened in France, or Russia, or China.

       Kind of like you're "permanently dependent on the government" to provide roads, water, power, etc. without child slaves doing the work involved in bringing it to you, huh?

       any group of armed men can already force anything 'upon you'. this post is dumb. basic income is the literally the opposite of slavery. lacking basic income enables actual slavery, where you have no choice but to work some shit job just to survive to do it again the next day, the same as our slave ancestors.

       Most people don't know how (virtually) every system runs. Every system needs  energy/power/money = metabolism. In this sense the current regime (system) is also self-sustained, but at the cost of a massive disconnect between humans and nature, burning out the humans and burning out the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the advent of crypto-currencies there was a defacto-monopoly over money by the state. Policies from the FED to the ECB and BoJ only vary in nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crypto-currency communities however can build their own system (a network) in a decentralized why, so that power is spread over all participants. This makes it much more easy to create solutions beneficial for most community members. If you are against some decision there is now the power of choice. You can either fork the project and try to get more and more people on your side or you can opt-out and join another community with better fitting values.
      </p>
      <p>
       UBI is only one experiment that I can think of and there are many projects in this direction. The power of theses new systems are, that we as society can experiment and do not need to develop a "one-fits-all-solution".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just search for UBI+blockchain+bitcoin+ethereum and you will find some good food of thought!

       You're whole argument relies on giving up all your power to some unknown 'government' that makes all the decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's an idea.  Instead of worrying about socialism versus capitalism, stop playing that shitbrained game and get with what's really happening: this 'adversarial government' is incrementally degrading the will of the people and removing them from the rule-making process.  In the US, it means having things like the 'electoral college' and 'money in politics' and 'lobbying' in the way. Attack THAT.  Then tell me what you think of basic income.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think basic income is a great idea.  I think you should get more basic income if you actually DO work, not less.  So you get like 100 a month if you aren't working , 150 if you are, plus you get to keep everything and there's no income tax and instead everything that is consumed from donuts to yachts is 33% flat.  Want to be rich?  Buy land, live on the grass and bury your earnings in the ground.   You'll be a level 99 wizard witha  charisma of 0 in no time flat.

       If I already have basic income, I don't need to get a job at all, unless it pays enough to bother.  Basic Income will obviously have to come with clauses that prevent the government from withholding it without extreme cause.  Perhaps it goes away while I'm in jail?  Other than that, I can see no excuse.  Maybe they'll take it away if I am outside the country for an extended period?

       So? It's simply the same as living on welfare.  You're right about salaries adjusting to end up essentially the same as today. Taxes will also adjust.  But what will change is that all the administration of welfare cards etc. will no longer be necessary. Living on welfare will still be shit.  But there won't be any paperwork. What it will do is keep people from falling through the cracks. A lot of homeless are simply too irresponsible to know or file for assistance.

       First, I agree with you.  UBI will be used against it's purpose if adopted by "The Folks in Charge". (Henceforth TFIC)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to look at this in a certain context for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start by considering that UBI is a radical idea for a lot of people.  Now, TFIC likes to keep the narrative non-radical.  So when an idea comes along that is popular enough to make people think outside of the narrative, TFIC needs to create ways to guide thought back inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very existence of a popular radical idea has to be dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is good, for us, who would like to have a hand in TFIC failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.  Your argument against UBI is valid.  It's a showstopper.  We don't want to use a showstopper right away, because it's important to allow the radical idea to do it's job - open up avenues for consideration that are outside the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to use the opportunity to build arguments that lead from UBI to other solutions, solutions that are outside the narrative, solutions that TFIC definitely do not want becoming popular.  That solid logic you've got there is a terrific pivot point to use in bringing someone to a conclusion, a conclusion that works for us to build a new non-TFIC narrative.  Would be a waste to just throw it on a freshly opened mind if it's just going to close the door, sending them right back to square one.

       The worst thing about UBI is that a lot of the people who scream for it enthusiastically don't really grasp how economics or business works. Let's take the minimum wage for the example. Your average Lefty voter would be in favor of higher minimum wage. Because more money for lower skill workers is great right? Except now that every employer is legally required to pay at least that much it changes the entire economy. If they can no longer afford 3 employees at the new required wage they fire one an overwork the other 2. And prices of goods/services will go up to match the fact that now everyone has a bit more money on average.

       And it's that second part that's important when considering UBI. Let's say it's now law that every American gets 20 thousand a year after age 18. Because everyone is now 20 thousand richer the price of goods is going to skyrocket. Soon we will be back where we were before where 20 thousand a year plus whatever you make at your job if you have one isn't that much. Worse though is it's going to have a profound effect on people's productivity. Instead of seeking education and trying to land a great job the better strategy would seem to be having as many kids as possible so they can start drawing UBI checks in 18 years.

       So besides being an economic timebomb yes it's also a powerful tool of government/banker tyranny. They really want to push it though since the current economic timebomb of fiat currency that had it's fuse lit when we went off the gold standard is about to explode. I think the elite are hedging their bets both ways. They enthusiastically push UBI, and the idea of cashless negative interest rate society. While at the same time stockpiling gold, and seizing/shutting down the gold mines. Whether the people accept their crazy socialist system, or we have to crash an go back to a gold standard they are prepped to maintain control.

       There would be mandatory  service hours and as long as you are dependent on the state you won't have voting rights.

       Yes, it will be a system of perpetual slavery.

       A far more extreme version of our current tax supported workers called E.I.T.C.  where the employer gets a cheap worker and the worker is kept alive with tax money from other workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They chat this u p as "E.I.T.C." lifts people from poverty, when in fact it barely keeps people alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has moved from poverty to middle class via E.I.T.C.
