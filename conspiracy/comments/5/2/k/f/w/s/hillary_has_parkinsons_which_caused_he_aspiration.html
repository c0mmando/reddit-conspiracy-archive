    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you haven&#39;t read up on a little known scenario that could very likely come to fruition that would secure the presidency for GJ. It would go like this: </p>

<p>-GJ wins at least one state = Carries that state&#39;s delegates, (New Mexico and Massachusetts are the obvious favorites). </p>

<p>-Trump and Hillary have some kind of split of the rest of the rest of the states and their delegates, both failing to achieve the magic number of 270 votes.</p>

<p>-If this happens, then the Speaker of the House essentially assumes the Presidency, as no new POTUS would be elected.</p>

<p>-The vote to decide the next POTUS would then shift to the House</p>

<p>-Since the House is dominated by the Republicans, Hillary is obviously out. Trump has been such a polarizing figure, even in his own party, so there&#39;s a good chance he wouldn&#39;t be elected via the house. </p>

<p>It has been theorized that if this scenario were to unfold, then GJ would not only be the logical choice, but also the choice that would a big compromise and some kind of middle of ground. </p>

<p>Edit: In my haste, I forgot one key step: After the House votes to decide the next POTUS, the Speaker would then transfer power to the next President elect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks. I didn&#39;t know any of that. 
- As far as I know this has never happened before though, correct?</p>

<p>Also, I have no idea how big GJ&#39;s appeal is with the GOP. Is he really a better bet than say, mitt Romney?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, this has not happened, except curiously enough, this scenario was played out in a recent episode of HBO&#39;s &quot;Veep&quot;. </p>

<p>In response to the second part, that&#39;s tough to say because Mitt was the nominee last time around, so that made him fairly popular within the GOP, but also because Mitt doesn&#39;t have a proverbial dog in this fight, as he obviously isn&#39;t running in this election. </p>

<p>In other seperate but related news, it appears Mitt is still on the fence and hasn&#39;t endorsed GJ (yet), but he for sure isn&#39;t endorsing either of the other 2 candidates: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem interested, so I wanted to share two other links with you I&#39;ve just found within the last couple days. </p>

<p>The first is an outlet that is ran by an anarcho-capitalist and legend in the Libertarian scene, in which his writer theorizes that Hillary could in fact be utilizing a body double, and has been for years, (could she be that dumb to take a picture with this person, only to surface years down the road)? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2016/09/phillip-f-nelson/hillary-use-body-double/">https://www.lewrockwell.com/2016/09/phillip-f-nelson/hillary-use-body-double/</a></p>

<p>Within the last week, this video was recently shared on Anonymous official channel. It&#39;s a great history lesson and basically explains how we&#39;ve got to this point in time. Spoiler alert: Its a clusterfuck that is super complicated and yet painfully obvious at the same time. If you have 17 mins to spare, you should watch it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHMe0NfUXNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHMe0NfUXNg</a></p>

<p>And to answer your question in your last comment, I have a solid understanding what&#39;s happened to get us to this point in time, and it&#39;s interesting, but I&#39;m much more concerned what will happened in the coming weeks, months and years. I foresee one of 4 main scenarios playing out:</p>

<p>-Some kind of event, possibly civil war or a false flag attack occurs, and Obama uses the opportunity to declare a Federal State of Emergency, and releases a statement along the lines of, &quot;we are totally fucked and it wouldn&#39;t be prudent to hold elections right now&quot;, and basically seizes power and secures a 3rd term. This could very well usher in the possibility of a full-blown dictatorship here on American soil. </p>

<p>-A General or high-ranking official within the US gov&#39;t doesn&#39;t like the way things are going and stages a coup, seizes power and declares martial law complete with checkpoints and curfews.</p>

<p>-Or as I previously mentioned, there is an uprising which turns into a full-scale civil war. This could happen in the event of a gun grab or some other action which gravely threatens our constitutional freedoms. Actually, this could also happen after the election, especially if blantant election fraud is suspected. The way I figure it, no matter what happens, there will basically be +/- 150 million angry Americans, and we haven&#39;t experience the hatred and divisiveness in this country like we see today since the previous civil war. Who knows? Conditions could be ripe for a revolt. </p>

<p>-Or the election goes off without a hitch and one of these jackwagons somehow gets elected. We get fucked and we take it. The first 3 scenarios are possible, but this one is highly unlikely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I find it much more troubling that her condition has been kept hidden for so long, only to explode in their faces right now on the home stretch, than her lying about it. Confusing? Well, what I mean is: anyone with a bit of research already knows she&#39;ll lie and lie to get what she wants. That&#39;s no surprise. But that her apparatus, her handlers and staffers, have let this charade long enough so she <em>makes history</em> and they get inside the influencer&#39;s inner circle is quite serious since, should she die or become incapacitated in office, this will create such a turmoil in internal politics. Forget about a sick person having access to the fabled atomic button (it&#39;s not like if she or Trump leans on it bombs begin raining in Moscow); if she falters and creates a situation in Congress, that&#39;ll create a logjam and more partisan squirmishes, which are exactly what we don&#39;t need right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trouble swallowing is a symptom for many neurologic diagnosis.  She had a big ass clot in her head.  She could have had some lingering neurologic deficits from that episode.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with you on the Parkinson&#39;s diagnosis but trouble swallowing could be cause by something else in her medical history.  Trouble swallowing is not the definitive diagnosis here but definitely a contributing factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely neuro but there are so many with similar symptoms. My mom has Lupus and with it the memory loss, TIA&#39;s , seizures, falls, dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s symptoms, trouble walking/balance etc. </p>

<p>Guess my point is this is not a person fit to hold any office and even if they tell us something other than the bs over the last 4-5 years who figures it would be the truth anyway? With the kind of money and power the clintons have they can fabricate anything they want to. </p>
