        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has always been something that I&#39;ve felt strongly about.  I grew up in the Nirvana era, and one of the first bands that my older brother introduced to me at a young age was in fact Nirvana.</p>

<p>I probably was the only 4 year old in the world who sang along to Penny Royal Tea.</p>

<p>That being said, over the years, I&#39;ve read a lot about Kurt.  He was a very interesting person, and made some really poor choices, but his death really bothers me.  To the point of--if I suddenly came into a lot of money, I would put some into investigating it more thoroughly.</p>

<p>I really do believe that he did not kill himself.  There&#39;s too many things that were overlooked and too much shoddy investigating.  As time goes on, I figured someone would either prove me right or prove me wrong, but it still seems (almost 15 years later) that no ones really proven anything.</p>

<p>I realize there&#39;s already been threads about Kurt in the past, I looked.  Nothing recent.</p>

<p>I really just want to discuss this as most of my buds think I&#39;m a little loony for hanging on to this for so long.</p>

<p>So, reddit, what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>I keep seeing recurring rumors that Paul McCartney was offed - and they put a body double in his place. Which would explain why McCartney has been making shit songs since the 70s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suicide </p>

<p>Proof? </p>

<p>Suicide Attempts-(None of these were made up by Courtney) When Kurt was 14 he tried to fuck a girl in a special ed class. Everyone heard of it and started calling him the &quot;retard fucker&quot;, after that Kurt went down to the train tracks and waited for the 11:00 train but it went on the other track besides him.  </p>

<p>Nirvana was on tour in 1989, the crowd humiliated Kurt so much to the point where he had a nervous breakdown then he climbed on 30 amplifiers and threatned to jump. After that he said he was ending the band </p>

<p>In 1993, I think, Kurt and Courtney got into an argument and Courtney just kept picking on him, so much so that when the argument was over Kurt threatned to jump off of the balcony </p>

<p>In 1994, Rome, Kurt set up a party at the nicest hotel in Rome for Courtney, when she arrived Kurt went all &quot;Mr.Romance&quot; on her, but she just took some pills and went to bed. Kurt wrote a note saying Courtney doesn&#39;t love him, and he overdosed. Kurt tried to kill himself many times in &#39;94. Courtney mainly caused it. </p>

<p>Reasons-When Kurt was in rehab I think, he passed out and dropped Frances. Courtney called and told him that then he freaked out. </p>

<p>Courtney </p>

<p>Childhood trauma </p>

<p>Fame </p>

<p>Humiliation </p>

<p>Guilt</p>

<p>Evidence-Like I mentioned Kurt attempted suicide multiple times and he said that he was suicidal at a point in his life. </p>

<p>Kurt wrote about wanting to kill himself in his journals. </p>

<p>Crime scene-Kurt was found with one hand clutching a Remington M11 shotgun upside down to his mouth, blood coming out of his ear, a bruise on his head, a blister on his thumb and a bullet to his left, near him were drugs, a coat, glasses and, a root beer. Kurt had a large amount of heroin in his system at the time, 3 times the lethal dose. The gun had no fingerprints on it. </p>

<p>Kurt and gun-Since Kurt was so fuckin&#39; high, he was probably flimsy with the shot gun. The bruise came from him smacking his head off of the gun, there are no finger prints because if your hands keep sliding, it&#39;s just gonna leave (Pat) smears. Kurt probably was holding the gun losely at an angle that (When he shot himself) caused the gun to flip over before he gripped it. The blister was probably caused by Kurt cutting his finger on the gun because he pulled the trigger quickly. </p>

<p>Face it, Kurt did kill himself. </p>

<p>Brief quotes </p>

<p>&quot;He was in a really dark place&quot;-Michael Stipe </p>

<p>&quot;He was out of his mind on heroin&quot;-Krist Noveselic</p>
