       I've worked for a number of companies as a software engineer (specialized contractor).  I've worked for a number of industries including Healthcare (can't name, but top 5), banking (top 5), insurance (clearinghouse used by all the big ones: BCBS, Cigna, Alliance, RC), Telecom (top 5)
      </p>
      <p>
       I specialize in big data enterprise systems (lots of XML, EDI, API integration, data normalization and analytics).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do what I can to inform people of the amount of BS that goes on behind the scenes, but since I'm always under legal restraints about sharing data I can't exactly provide proof without being totally screwed.  This isn't high-profile stuff like snowden, I would literally be sued into oblivion and lose my career if I took the data for proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, much of the dirty stuff is very technically difficult to explain.  Things like automated collusion using XML B2B feeds.  A bunch of companies hire the services of a third party company which then does data analysis of market prices and suggests the prices for all of their clients.  This is blatant market collusion, but since the company doing the 'recommended pricing' isn't technically a part of the industry, they are in the Services industry, it's nearly impossible to prosecute them for collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually been asked to set up mailing lists, business meetings and security for groups of businessmen who collude with banks to get 0-interest loans in order to buy up property from foreclosure auctions just to prevent real estate prices from dipping too low in a region.  It's a completely bogus cabal of private interest monopoly farming and flies in the face of foreclosure laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here comes the 'help me' part: please go and counteract the bullshit downvoting that anyone gets for questioning the bullshit financial analysis in r/finance, r/politics, r/news, r/all, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't promote stupid comments, but please upvote people who legitimately question the system as it exists.  It is horribly broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you.

       Agreed. It's difficult, but here are a few changes you can make to lesson your feeding the beast:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stop using credit cards. I know its hard, but it can be done.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Move to credit union or local bank not owned by the big guys. Close your big guy bank account.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't pay any taxes until the date you have to. They rely on the constant feed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you're using a debt card, select debt and enter a pin # instead of the default credit option for every purchase. Its no diff for you, a huge diff for the credit card bastards.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Help me out, what others changes can/have you made to stop feeding the system?

       This is are some good first steps. How about only making big purchases in cash? Don't finance cars. Buy only what you can actually afford without loans.

       Something I've noticed, in England, is that the amount of new cars on the road. Compared to other eu countries I've been to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most are leases of course. They're by far one of the biggest money holes in this country atm but the amount only increases greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been unfortunate enough to have to rely on a loan when I broke up with my partner, even though it's a very small amount and I'm almost entirely clear now... The self promotion on social media only accentuates this kind of behaviour and makes people believe they need what they actually only want for their own vanity.

       And don't buy new items of any kind; recycle, sell your old stuff or give it away (don't throw it away) and buy primarily used items. Barter beats cash; I fix or upgrade my mechanics computer and he fixes my motorcycle. Good luck taxing that fuckerssssss

       It is a smart move to hold a few digital/crypto currencies for multiple reasons.  You have control over the access to it with your private key, you can own it anonymously, you can store it on a flash drive and protect it from EMP (electromagnetic pulses) with foil or a faraday cage of some other type.  You could hold your savings in physical items like precious metals if you are not keen on something merely backed by a mathematical equation and it's blockchain but the US dollar is based on God knows what by now.

        If you're using a debt card, select debt and enter a pin # instead of the default credit option for every purchase. Its no diff for you, a huge diff for the credit card bastards.

       I thought the extra charge for using debit was paid by the merchant. I remember asking a guy who owns a gas station the difference between paying in credit or debit with a debit card and he told me he pays a little less in processing fees or whatever when you pay with credit. I've been using the credit option ever since. I assume that's why you get extra benefits from cards, like 1% cash back or whatever, since they want you to use the card as often as possible since the merchant pays fees every time you make a transaction. It's why some small local stores have like a $5-10 minimum if you pay by card.

       That's odd, it has been my experience that the exact opposite is true.  At a grocery store I frequent, there's a sign at the register asking customers to use the Debit/EBT option as it saves the store money.

       My local station had a petition going a while back getting people to support them against the credit card companies who kept hiking the rates. At the time they were asking people to select debit if they could because then, in his words, "the bastards don't get a cut" because it was processed through the back and instead of it first going to the credit company and then the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I looked into back then he was right, but again, please correct me if I'm wrong. Cuz I gotta change then...

       I worked for an actual payment processor that offered merchant services to companies.

      <p>
       Merchants would be charged for both debit and credit.  Typically debit was much lower than credit.
      </p>

       E.g. debit at .25% and credit at 1.39%

       Quick google search states that credit is based on a percentage of total cost and debit is a flat fee. I'm not sure on the fee the merchant pays with debit or the percentage on credit, but it seems credit is best if you're making a small purchase. I used to go in almost every day and spend less than $10 which is why I think he told me to use credit.

       This is happening everywhere. It is almost impossible to buy a reasonably priced home. And the few that are a good price are snatched up by investors so they can rent it out. Pretty soon "owning" any kind of land is going to be reserved for the rich or corporations.

       Don't forget the Fed has been buying up homes for the last few years to prevent people from realizing there is an absolutely huge bubble in the real estate markets, even bigger than in 2009, so when a house doesn't sell for a certain amount of time, the federal reserve picks it up.

       There are town hall public records of incentive loans to real estate investors to keep the housing markets 'stable'.  Special interest rate loans to holding corporations who's sole job is to buy up homes that aren't selling, including auction homes.  They can get away with it even though the same people holding the shares hold major shares in the banks that the law says has to auction the homes off when they forclose.  I've even seen them get away with nearly private auctions.  They are technically open to the public, but they refuse to advertise and on at least two instances I'm fully aware of the auctions were held in private gated clubs.  The auction was technically public, but inaccessible to the public because of gating.

       As an example, a common tactic is bundling.  A product nobody likes and nobody is buying is bundled with a product a lot of people want by distributors.  This can be for pay, or interest stake, or anything.  When the bundle is put on the balance sheet, they report the product bundled for free as being paid for at premium and the product the consumer thought they were buying as sold with a slight discount.

       This is especially popular for money laundering with fake services and providers as well.

       Wholly mind blown. This kinda makes sense at maybe why my CEO keeps saying he not worried about revenue at the same time talking about expanding and buying companies. It sounds like bundling but on a larger scale with manufactured product. Shhhiiiiiit!

       Also does this mean noe that if we see any collapse it's manufactured or is there still variable that could cause the financial markets to collapse no matter what they try?

       You say all this as if the government isn't apart of it all. There is a government agency called "the plunge protection team" that intervenes to do exactly what you're describing. So of course they aren't going to be prosecuted, they are acting with the blessing of the government itself.

       Heck in Japan the government buys up all the stock in their equities market so that the prices don't fall.

       Try this one on for 'governments'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to be a little careful about how I say this because my account can be traced back to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       China (I can name them, because fuck them) released a 'tracking company' that was nominally incorporated and legal as an advertising company.  The 'adds' created tracking cookies and remote linking on millions of websites, including some of the most well known.  The obfuscated and minimized javascript was encoding session information into the metrics using data stenography.  They used it to hack some very high profile databases.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the people I was working with found it and reported it, they were told by the government that releasing the information to the public would violate their government contract NDA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was not a part of the group that found it.  I am not bound by the NDA.  I never personally was involved other than water-cooler style 'hey check this out'.
      </p>
      <p>
       incidentally, for those of you wanting to know, form data was being encoded as request vectors for the adds.  The request variables for the adds contained the passwords for dozens of sites, which built a 'most probable' password choice model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always use a password generator, never make up your own passwords, use 'throw away' passwords for all sites and save them in a password store (because you can't remember them all).

We can upvote/down vote all the content we want but when there are unlimited fake accounts and proxies doing the voting for you, the system is completely rigged.

       There are several reasons why this doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to verify anything, I would have to provide evidence.  Any evidence I could provide would require a massive amount of logging and configuration data to show clients and sources for the data.  That puts me in violation of criminal law right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the fact that unlike documents, I would have to explain the programs and what they are doing with the data, which is specialized knowledge.  That would pretty obviously lead back to one of the very few people who know the systems and protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be sued almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike other wistleblowers, there wouldn't be any protection (it's more economic than political).  Attempting to explain any of this to a short-attention-span crowd would be futile, and it's not really news to most of the financial sectors and investors.  They all know this is going on but since it's usually in their favor they couldn't care less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell in some cases it's hard not to see both sides.  There have been massive successes for homeowners and investors with only a very few people screwed in some areas.  The issue is that the whole thing breaks the system, not that it doesn't sometimes work very well.

       Sounds like you are the only one that can solve the problem.  So since it's too complicated for most to understand anyways, I'd start an equally complicated and parallel hidden process to collect information with the ultimate goal of dumping it somewhere that people with brains could parse it and determine what happened.  How the dump could happen just needs to have plausible deniability.  A design flaw that you build in and then accidentally let someone know about is a possibility.

       lol these systems are often so poorly written and managed anyone with half a desire could hack them.
      </p>
      <p>
       shared passwords for ftp servers, no NIDS, no HIDS, no scanning (or only external network scanning), outdated systems and software that can't be patched because of legacy scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just reading a scan report from Qualys or Redseal on these guys is a month long task because there are so many CVSS 9 and 10 vulns.

       Perfection is a vector, not a limited set.  Without boundaries, an unlimited set cannot self define.  Thus your definition of God in this context is an abstract ideal and not a personification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Define 'believe in' in the context of an abstract concept.  Plausibility, probability or certainty.

       To be human is to grow, adapt, learn, explore.  If you know everything, you can't be curious or explore.  If you can't explore and learn because you know everything, you can't be human.  If you don't know everything, you aren't perfect.

       Don't go to the doctors and come home with 5 sets of pills to feel better over a stubbed toe, don't take medical drugs unless you really need too.  Don't take over the counter shit too. I think as a collective we could do the most damage if we stopped buying and taking so much over the counter shit like motrin and advil.  Headaches suck today, but if you work on your life style today you will stop getting headaches daily. Which I see is a big problem for a lot of people.
