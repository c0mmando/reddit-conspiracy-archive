       Each year, as September 11
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       rolls around, the REAL terrorists are quaking in their boots as the world turns focus on their biggest mistake ever. The obvious controlled demolitions of the WTC buildings is their fatal mistake. They know that it was done poorly. Their fuckup is their Kryptonite and the anniversary of 9/11 is the perfect day to use it. Use this opportunity to share what you know about 9/11 with coworkers, family, friends, and anyone who will listen. NIST admitted feefall in tower 7, and this is probably our biggest weapon. Share 9/11 truth related videos on Facebook and even use your smartphones to back up your information on the fly! Let's make this the year. 15 years is long enough.

      <p>
       2 planes hit 2 steel highrise buildings, 3 steel highrise buildings fell.  This was due to extreme fires that weren't, and in a manner that has never happened before in history, and which defies 3 laws of thermodynamics, newtons law of motion, the laws of conservation of momentum and energy (case of the missing joules), if and only if we assume NIST's assessment and reportage to be truthful.  In other words, it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       These buildings were brought down by controlled demolition, and the evidence is so thoroughly undeniable as to declare official story scientifically untenable.

       Just look up the facts surrounding building 7. That alone should be able to at least throw doubt into your mind regarding the official story. Where you go from there is up to you but at least take the time to look up building 7 as it represents the most compelling evidence that certain people among the elite had explicit knowledge of the attack in advance and did nothing to stop it and/or enabled it.

       The majority owner of building 7 made 4.5 billion in an insurance payout, not all of it was pure profit but much of it was as he got the payout doubled from 2.25 billion because the attack was classified as a double attack due to two planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just so happens that he purchased the insurance policy which covered terrorist attacks just a couple months before the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also frequented a cafe in building 7 on his daily routine. It just so happens that he had a dermatologist appointment that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not going to review all of the facts regarding the shadiness of the building 7 collapse, look that up for yourself. The evidence is truly damning. I will say this though. A small, oxygen deprived (as shown by the black smoke) two floor fire in a skyscraper doesnt cause it to collapse at free fall speed. It just doesnt make any sense. Other skyscrapers have burned for 12-24 hours and didnt collapse. Hell, buildings right next to the twin towers that had multiple upper floors flattened by falling debris didnt lose full structural integrity. Even those buildings that were hit by tons of falling steel and concrete survived, yet a small office fire cause a building, that would have been the tallest in 36 states, to collapse into its own footprint at a freefall speed. Complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another motivation for building 7's demise is the presence of the second largest CIA office where numerous hardcopy files were located. The subject of said files was insider trading being done by big names on wall street. This was before online databases were widespread. This was in the era of hardcopy and local hard drives. When the building collapsed, thousands of hours of research from these investigations was lost in entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motivation for the main towers is also pretty obvious. There was a big issue with asbestos linings in the towers that would have costed billions to repair, and there was corrosion in the buildings as a result of a chemical reaction between aluminum and steel which would have also costed billions. It was more economically feasable for the owners for the buildings to collapse (resulting in an insurance payout) than a demolition or renovation which would have come out of pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore you have the motivation stemming from the military-industrial-political complex. War takes money from us through taxes, then the politicians use it to pay war profiteers, who make billions. The profiteers then take the money and pocket it, reinvest it and "donate" it to the politicians who got them their fat contracts in the name of campaign donations. The coorporate owners get wealthy, the politicians get wealthy through kickbacks and the taxpayer and little Jimmy in Iraq get fucked. Mind you, the leaders of our country give zero fucks about us or 3rd world foreigners, and our government has used deceptive tactics to begin wars multiple times, these are not trustworthy or principled people. Just look at the Spanish American war, the sunken ship that started Vietnam, Iraqi WMDs and false connections to Al-Queda who Sadam hated and had nothing to do with, and now we are engaging in more destabilizing wars, all in the name of war profiteering.

      <p>
       Regarding the downvotes, I think a lot of people on this sub are of the mindset that everyone here is in agreement regarding some topics. 9/11 being one.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someome arrives with another viewpoint, even when that person is asking for information to learn, they get blasted for being a troll or a shill. Its a symptom of the mindset that many here have. We are skeptics and cynics by nature and with the criticisms and condescension we face from the mainstream, there is a tendency to be paranoid in regards to those with differing opinions. Many are lambasted immediately as people with some kind of anti conspiracy theorist agenda.

       People here have been butthurt about 9/11 for about 15 yrs now.  That's why. People have called us names. Harrassed the ever-living f-ck out of us.  Even made death threats and told us to kill ourselves.  We find out in 2011 or so those assholes were NSA and GCHQ (JTRIG).
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, more than ever in history, we're on the right side of history and we'll get justice for 9/11.

       Popular opinion is changing to be receptive towards controlled demolition that we can basically prove now.  (

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       The publication replay of the beyond misinformation materian in EuroPhysicsNews was a big win.  That's a legit physics publication that seems to have been won over by our argument of controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main thing now is to keep pushing for independent (ie: NO ONE FROM USGOV) reinvestigation instead of speculating on blame.  I mean, we know it was Dick and Rum (COG is the proof) but let's hold off on that for now.

       I wouldn't pay too much attention to 'soft power tools' arguments. Money is secondary to geostrategy, and much like Pearl Harbor justified the US entry into the Second World War, this justified a new era of expansion of the American Empire, and more control over its citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 could be seen as targeted more for rival governments than even the public and lawmakers. Without it, invading Afghanistan may have been a much harder sell to Russia, China and Pakistan. This event 'justified' an ongoing crusade, from which America has secured itself the means and opportunity to expand in whichever direction it likes, using a villain that they can turn into anyone they please. Before, only governments could be attacked. With 9/11 they have 'justified' attacks - pre-emptive no less - against basically anyone.

       Too much attention is given to WTC 7. Sure, it's a good place to start, but the WTC collapses were for me the 2nd most impossible event that day. The most impossible event of all, is that 19 blacklisted, suspicious, armed saudi arabians went through 4 security checkpoints, in gangs, within the space of two hours, through x-rays and metal detectors, and past experienced, trained professional security personnel, and that all of these nervous-as-fuck jihadists passed through metal detectors carrying metal knives and mace, without one of them being caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds of that happening are so small, that you could probably take the number x in 'odds of x to 1', and wrap that number around Jupiter, with still enough left to bring back to Earth and mildly interest your cat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds are truly astronomical. Higher even than the WTCs coming down due to fires. Put that to NIST and what will they say? "Well, remember that the knives were actually made of Steel. And the reason steel could pass through steel-detectors 19 times on the same morning, is that the temperature inside their clothing where the knives were hidden, was So hot...."
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds just by themselves mean any argument for knives/mace passing through, quite literally just aint gonna fly.

       I want people to explain the Pentagon attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Why were no fighters scrambled for any of the 4 planes in the most protected airspace in ithe world
2) Why was the hole so small, and there was no debris at the crash site?
3) How could an amateur pilot fly a 757 literally feet off the ground for a half-mile
4) Why, out of the 86 surveillance cameras, do none of them show the actual plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this discussion always about the stuff going on in NYC? I do believe those events were pretty sketchy too, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that the government's explanation of the Pentagon attack is false.

       in WTC 7 is the smoking gun. It implies that there was literally no structure below to resist the falling mass. That fact alone is enough to prove that demolition devices were used, implying insider access to the building.

       If you know history and how the wicked elite manipulated the masses then you could already know what this event will soon or later lead to...i was 11 and refused to take part while all classes had a moment of silence...they shouted at me and told me i have no respect and stuff  and i answered "i refuse because millions more will die and we never did this for all the starving kids..."...then i had to leave the class and suddenly all teachers marked me as a troublemaker ...excuse my english skills :D 9 grade lvl english :/ since then im probably 90% of my time inside my 4 walls

       I remember watching a youtube video of a news clip showing a heightened level of alert for security.
       <a href="http://www.aopa.org/images/whatsnew/newsitems/2005/050308missile.jpg">
        It showed a surface to air missile system on a coastal region/airport or somewhere
       </a>
       and I thought the clip highlighted what exactly the feeling the news was rolling with around the time.  I can't find it anymore, anybody happen to know what i'm talking about?

       Yeah but unless they literally have full control of the internet, all it takes is one viral meme and it's game over. Literally. You saw how much attention the blacksmith got over a seemingly logical point. Imagine if that blacksmith actually had truth on his side.

       Well said. But, amazingly, there is neither much consensus nor a focussed task force bringing solid cases against specific individuals to court. The 'movement' (ironic as it has gone virtually nowhere whatsoever) is a bunch of arrogant idiots quoting things as if they discovered them themselves, saying how x couldn't have happened, satisfying only their own egos to feel like they know anything. They then do nothing, bring nothing to the investigation, and think that they are somehow rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something very wrong that, after 15 YEARS, people are still preaching to the converted. About things that were known several years ago. And that no-one has seemingly brought one criminal case to court. This is a criminal investigation, people need reminding of that for some reason. The magnitude of the crime does not preclude the need for the usual procedures to be undertaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have spent years talking about why a ridiculous official report is wrong. Rather than building a watertight case that's Right. Saying how 'this didn't happen', instead of finding out exactly what DID happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       SMART goal objectives have not been set. There are no Deadlines. Specific evidence for what DID happen - not what didn't - are ignored and few bother to make their own investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have made mine. To my great surprise, and with a bit of help from Kevin Ryan's superb investigative talents, I succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crucially, I didn't set out to find 'why' or 'how' or 'why that's impossible'. I approached it as a CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. So my only question, was:
      </p>
      <p>
       WHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I set some criteria, and rejected at least as many suspects as I accepted. It took months, and some hard work. And of course, I'm not some idiot who's content to say 'Bush did it' or 'the Government did it'. Understand it: THAT WILL NOT HOLD UP IN COURT. I went for the names I hadn't seen before, and because I had no bias for or against them, I was able to study them objectively, patiently deducing their role and their importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This list, deliberately kept down to about 25 core suspects, is what we should all have by now. By now, cases should have been built - selected and built very, very carefully - to be brought against these genuine terrorists. That it has not, amazes me. Only with Guilty verdicts, will the people be brought to account for their infinite stupidity. And that - punnishing and exposing the retardation of the people who fell for 9/11 - is what this is all about. Unfortunately that stupidity permeates even the truth 'movement'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a little tip then. It is controversial:
      </p>
      <p>
       What set me apart from other 'truthers', is that I Appreciated the beauty of 9/11 as a special operations masterpiece. I Respect the perpetrators for their attention to detail, craftsmanship, expertise and dedication. This took a Hell of a lot of hard work, and many of those involved had to be some of the most talented minds in the defense sector. I got inside the mind of a neoconservative, and drifted away from that of socialist idealism. This allows you to put your rage and ego aside, and start enjoying the intricacies and devastating focus and discipline required for such a feat of endeavor. Admiring 9/11 as an exquisite masterpiece will make you more receptive to the details of its craftmanship. And detail is what the truth 'movement' needs.

       Did 3000 people really die that day? Most Jews were told to stay home via email. It was early in the morning, so how many people were actually there? The towers lease-wise were at half capacity for almost 20 years. Rockefeller bought up a bunch of the leases in the 90's leading up to 911, but really, how many of these floors were actually doing any business I wonder?

       You are downvoted, but you have a point.
It's pretty much only
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and like minded communities that even care about 9-11 anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making all sorts of 9-11 posts now only serves to annoy people who either don't care enough, or who feel like this dead horse has been beat more than enough already. No matter what the truth is.

       Of course there's still some people that care, heck this sub is an example of it.

       But on the whole? people don't care, and why should they, it's been 15 years since the event. Places like this are the only ones where I even still hear about 9-11 so I don't believe I'm too far off on that.

       But we already know the truth. Many scientists that have actual degrees in the things that people bring up about melting points and building collapse have shown why the things happened the way they did. Was it used as an excuse to start a profitable oil war in Iraq? Of course. But believing that the government is both competent enough to pull it off without anyone actually involved releasing any sort of proof, but still incompetent enough to leave all this "evidence" is mental gymnastics at its finest.
