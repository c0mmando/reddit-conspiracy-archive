        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why not live in black neighborhoods that have homes that often costs only what it would take to pay off the back taxes?</p>

<p>Often these affordable homes are a short drive away from their work place, yet these white liberals who want to force diversity on others choose instead to deal with an hour commute away from their work place,and the homes that they live in are worth  half million dollar homes that are located in gated white neighborhoods with the occasional Asian..</p>

<p>These liberals believe in wealth redistribution,so why not take that 500,000 dollars to buy the back tax house,fix it up,and use the rest to send poor blacks to the same white private school that the liberal&#39;s children are going to?</p>

<p>Also why do these liberals protest charter &amp; private schools, yet they would never dare send their own children to some inner city school?</p>

<p>I bet these liberals supported the refugees until the  refugee housing facility  was built in their neighborhood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come to WV where you&#39;ll see white people avoid crazy drug infested areas that are up hollers and all white. Downtown is fairly well integrated considering we aren&#39;t a diverse area. </p>

<p>Your argument doesn&#39;t work well  in a state with 95% white and only 3.2% black and plenty of bad areas unless you just focus on crime alone. Drop the race issues. Drugs, poverty and lack of education and opportunity can affect anyone, it isn&#39;t color specific. </p>

<p>Edit: my son&#39;s school, near downtown is almost 50/50. Much better school and safer than when we were in a smallish town with lots of hollers. These hills can be scary at times. </p>

<p>So stop making people want to fight each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are forced to be together because we are on the same planet.</p>

<p>Not an argument. Not the topic of discussion, either.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t breathe Chinese air. I don&#39;t drink African water. Explain why they should be able to pollute mine.</p>

<p>So stop forcing everyone to be together.</p>

<p>There&#39;s hope for you yet! Good for you.</p>

<p>Damn straight. But why can&#39;t you see where <em>you</em> are wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whose genocide? What liberal thing is pro genocide? Who and what the fuck is preventing genocide ? </p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of stupid bias getting in the way of discussion. </p>

<p>I&#39;m anti war man. I&#39;m not really a liberal either, although my ideas do lean more that way, I&#39;m not big on excessive authoritarian overreach on any side. I do beleive some regulation is ok, mostly because I DO think we&#39;ve had an impact in the planet, and that&#39;s it&#39;s more important to protect the future than to line coffers. So... I&#39;m pretty ok with not killing everyone. </p>

<p>Nothing is wrong with having different ideas, but so many people, want the same things, and forget because they are supposed to be rooting for &quot;their team&quot; A hundred humans working together towards a common goal will usually get more done than 4 teams of 25. Power lies in the populace, and is easily manipulated by convincing people the other team is evil. </p>

<p>Forced together? Again, what are you even talking about? I never said any such things. Please don&#39;t ask me to explain things I didn&#39;t say or even hint at. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all just to spite you, little man. </p>

<p>Not really, but I don&#39;t think I like you much. </p>

<p>You know what? Fuck you entirely. </p>

<li>Explain what the fuck you meant about genocide.</li>
<li>Explain Who&#39;s forcing people together.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I will actually read some of that. However, I apparently need to reiterate that what I spoke up against was blaming &quot;liberals&quot; (or conservatives, for that matter ) for all the worlds problems instead of realizing most of us (On either side of political lines) DON&#39;T want excessive government control, just what we respectively consider justifiable. And some see zero as the best solution. </p>

<p>As for forcing cultures together, I&#39;ve not argued that point at all. I think we&#39;re on different pages altogether here. I live in Dayton Ohio, a VERY self segregating community, with very mixed communities around as well. But I see towns refuse to allow the bus service over the issues mentioned by OP. He&#39;s not entirely wrong, just misled that only liberal communities engage in these behaviors when it&#39;s not really a political thing to hold bias. </p>
