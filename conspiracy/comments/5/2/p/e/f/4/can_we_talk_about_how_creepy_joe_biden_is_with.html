      <p>
       00:40
      </p>
      <p>
       Plays with girls hair and says "can I have a moment with Jess alone".
      </p>
      <p>
       4:06
      </p>
      <p>
       you can hear him say "And by the way,do you know how horny i get when standing next to a 13 year old?"ï»¿

      <p>
       Touches little girls chest and she pulls away.

       17:46 the grandfather says "I'll beat the hell out of you if you let it happen"

      </p>
      <p>
       4:05 - 4:30 "see you at home i hope" .... "just let me know what you want" So obvious whats going on these are the worst parents allowing this to happen.

       I was just talking about this in another thread a bit ago. Here's a great thread from a while ago on massive pedophile rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically boils down to two main factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         People who have serious pedophilia issues know that they are sick POS. Some of them are willing to do anything and everything to keep their desires secret all the while feeding those desires. If it means bending over backwards to become super rich, so be it. If it means sucking corporate/elite cock to become a high-level politician, so be it. The work required to gain enough wealth or political power is irrelevant when the need to satisfy yourself with 10-year-olds plagues your mind 24/7.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Blackmail!
         </strong>
         So let's say you're getting into the politics game, and you rub elbows with tptb. How do these elite know you are trustworthy? They really don't know, as you could have an agenda that was spawned from your childhood. So how do they keep you in line? They could invite you to a fancy mansion with your pick of sweet young pootang. You're told they're "legal" and to feel free to do what you want with them. During all this you see the others engage in promiscuous acts and think, "Hey, I got a boner too, so why not?" Then you find out later that you just raped a 14-year-old. How do you deal with this when you have a family at home and bills to pay? Well, you just keep on keeping on. If that means keeping your mouth shut about
         <em>
          anything
         </em>
         then so be it.

       I think the blackmail option might be the most common, but it's more likely TPTB only emplace politicians they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       they can control and eliminate if necessary. In other words, you're only promoted if they know you're already a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the ultimate trump card and kill switch. There's zero legal, social, moral, ethical defense if you're outed.

       I would just like to point out that not all pedophiles are child predators. Pedophilia and molestation/rape are different things. Some pedophiles recognize that what they have is a mental illness and actively seek help rather than seek children.

       I definitely hear it. After that its hard to hear but he also says 'you're beautiful'. It looks like the mom heard some of it and says something to the daughter, presumably something along the lines of 'act normal'. As soon as she realizes Joe is watching her she looks at him quickly in a mini-panic and smiles. Whole thing is so uncomfortable to watch.

       When I was young, about 12 or so, Dutroux was the hot shit item on the television for a long time, me living near Belgium and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as an adult, I did some looking into it. It is so far the only conspiracy I stumbled upon myself, and the only one I have investigated.
All I can say is that I feel absolutely secure in calling it a conspiracy; that nobody (from the  police to the prosecuters and all the way up) rang the bell is stunning and very frightening to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see someone else here posted a very good link about it all, please read it my friends. It is the lowest of the low, a shame on all of humanity.

       No need.  He said very recently that despite that talk he's not planning on running.   If he goes back on his word, then we need to spam it x 1000 so everyone knows they hired a liar and its their fault.  At that point, you dig up every pedo connection and quad-down on it
