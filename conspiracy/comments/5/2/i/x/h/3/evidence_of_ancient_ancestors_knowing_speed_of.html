        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;No communications across ancient oceans?  No prehistoric writing that makes any sense? Ignorant stone age progenitors?  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not buying anymore, not when I can so easily find this kind of mathematical evidence to the contrary.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Someone back there had it all: maps of enviable accuracy, a complete knowledge of every inch of our planet, a thorough understanding of mathematics and, yes, even calculators and computers we take for granted today - because without such tools, they could never have put it all together. &quot;</p>

<p>Our ancestors were highly advanced. Almost every ancient temple like stone hedge and the pyramids of Giza are interconnected by math. Almost every structure gives an exact latitude and longitude coordinate of another structure.</p>

<p>Some structures do other calculations including the speed of light in the air as well as the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Meaning our ancestors had advanced knowledge of every inch of the globe. </p>

<p>They must have also had air travel to see the earth from about to do calculations. GPS. </p>

<p>There is an overview of Carl Munck&#39;s work. It&#39;s quite amazing.</p>

<p>Here is his 3 part documentary &quot;The Code&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7b5yDDE2bQY">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7b5yDDE2bQY</a></p>

<p>It will blow your mind how advanced our ancestors were. It makes you wonder why you were never taught about these connections or advanced civilizations in school.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What were taught about our ancestors never made sense to me, and now we are once again knowledgeable enough and  have tools to help us untangle oiur own history.  </p>

<p>That there were catastrophe  geo-physical events that wiped out earlier advanced civilizations, I am not having trouble believing that.  </p>

<p>Some of the ideas about details of those civilizations are questionable but speculation is ok, and re-examining the ancient myths and the few artifacts discovered so far keeps providing more clues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome doc, just watched it.</p>

<p>The pyramids of Giza have speed of light calculation built into the dimensions.</p>

<p>So cool.</p>

<p>Also in this doc it&#39;s heartbreaking seeing the one french &quot;archeologist&quot;  who is clearly there to gatekeep any real information and progress regarding the actual history. Then they interview professionals not linked to the government and they tell it like it is.</p>

<p>Thanks for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize now that most of how I have been educated is a lie. As a teacher, I have to comply with this system or I&#39;d probably get fired. The best I can do is try to teach my students critical thinking and questioning skills, and that is no easy task.</p>

<p>Tell hardest part of all of this is finding few avenues of discussion. I don&#39;t know more than 1 or 2 people in real life who I can discuss these topics with. It isn&#39;t even a matter of ignorance . Nobody is curious.</p>

<p>That is what strikes me. I don&#39;t care what people believe in, but when they stop questioning, it saddens me.</p>

<p>And I get it. We all work. We are all tired. But this life is short. People don&#39;t care for these mysteries.</p>

<p>They read Reddit front page news and a few online articles daily and they feel they know what&#39;s up with the world. To them, the Internet can answer all their questions.</p>

<p>But I now know the Internet could have been that way. And it still is...for some...and who knows how long. But for most it&#39;s just a way to echo their previous opinions and preconceived notions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to the realization that those who hold authority over this civilization have knowledge of all this and keep it to themselves. They are evil in the sense that they don&#39;t just keep it to themselves but actively discourage curiosity, wonder and imagination. </p>

<p>To me they are literally trying to maintain the majority of humanity as ignorant animals of which they&#39;re able to rule over.</p>

<p>The worst part is the victimization of the ignorant by these parasitic authoritarians because they actively cultivate the very ignorance they abhor. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like playing monopoly with a third grader without teaching them the game and then beating them when they make a mistake, beating them when they try to learn the rules and berating them if they naturally do well despite the handicaps imposed. </p>

<p>Sigh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh...each megalithic structures embedded math translates to coordinates of the next.</p>

<p>Did you watch the 4 hour movie proving this? It&#39;s absolutely backed up by solid math. Our ancestors were most likely much more advanced than us.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t make claims that you can&#39;t back up.</p>

<p>How else would they calculated coordinates of earth&#39;s latitude and longitude?</p>

<p>It makes perfect sense and is valid. The guy provides hundreds of proofs that you can verify with Google maps and the coordinates and the math.</p>

<p>Try to broaden your knowledge base a bit. Also, you might need to learn a bit of math as you probably don&#39;t understand the video. Sometimes people fear what they don&#39;t understand.</p>
