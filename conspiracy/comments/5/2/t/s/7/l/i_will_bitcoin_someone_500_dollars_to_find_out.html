    <div class="md"><p>Because (and I really don&#39;t want to come off as a crazy SJW) the men who bitch and complain about abortion are the kind of men who want full control over women in every way. They aren&#39;t happy holding control over just their wives and daughters. They want to control every woman everywhere.</p>

<p>Most of these anti-abortion nuts are highly religious men who were brought up to believe that women are inferior in every way because Eve was a dumbass and ate the fruit, therefore every woman must pay for her sin and must scrape and bow to their every whim. </p>

<p>Edit: and because I&#39;m getting downvoted, I&#39;m NOT saying every man is this way. I know they aren&#39;t. But I can say from experience that the big time anti-abortion men aren&#39;t protesting because they believe in God. They&#39;re protesting because they want to put women in their place. I stopped going to church because I had to deal with too many of them. In the end it&#39;s not about God, it&#39;s not about what Jesus would do, it&#39;s about what&#39;s between a woman&#39;s legs and the fact that some men, ONLY SOME, want to control that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sin, sinfulness and guilt are the main tools of social contol used in priestcraft, because it&#39;s a lot harder to herd happy, independent, free people than those who are psychologically abused, vulnerable and shut down.  It&#39;s a thing called &#39;psychocivilzing&#39; people, from the ghoulish imaginations of nazi dr sidney gottleib, except the original imagineers were from ancient babylon, perhaps even beyond that to some kind of fish people from sirius, judging by the popes funny fishhat and freeman fly.</p>

<p>But to lead happy people, one would have to be an example of excellence.  And that&#39;s too hard for priests, who are generally social outcast weirdos that can&#39;t do anything else...people who have some functional spiritual disorder that causes them to be creepy and touchy with kids like Biden, happy to take your money for a god that doesn&#39;t empirically exist and therefore doesn&#39;t empirically need more money than is needed to keep his agents humble livelihood afloat...and yet this god received far more than that and still continues to tell the world it&#39;s doing the wrong thing when it could easily use that excess to fix it in ways it sees fit---but it doesn&#39;t.  And that&#39;s the W0rD.  (take that colbert, mic drop)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bad self eater in the video is the artist that put out the beast bills that had all the occult symbolism and created hysteria about something really bad happening with a countdown. With all the conpsiracy and crazy social instability and injustice going on, some people (a friend of mine and others here and on cst) were really scared, but it turned out to be an antiabortion snuff film that was flagged as NSFW/inappropriate on youtube and will likely get taken down soon.  </p>

<p>First he starts out telling the audience that we&#39;re all idiots.  did you figure it out?  no because you&#39;re asleep.  Violence happens every day...queue dead baby being wrapped up in butcher paper like grassfed beef from whole foods and into the trash.  (or something like that...i actually watched about 3 sec of it and shut it off).  </p>

<p>So this guy created a terror campaign to abuse conspiracy theorists. It was all a harmful mental abuse that smacks of cass sunstein planning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my belief that no one, short of a psychotic individual with infinite spare time and lots of money, would be that dedicated to this kind of strange activism but the US Government itself, trying to find a unique way to &quot;shut down the conspiracy theoriests&quot;</p>

<p>I did not fall for it, but I was curious what it was about.  It actually worked out in a very similar way than I thought.  I thought it was going to be some kind of live action game, but it was really just a psychotic agent provocateur who is committing treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you posted the wrong links on those, either way I agree with you in part, but this seems to be going into that Godwin&#39;s Law category without examining the idea of and character of Hitler himself.</p>

<p>You watch a THC snippet and it gives you this impression of <em>how the fuck did anyone buy this?</em> but then you start digging. Pictures paint themselves for the most part and this one is painting faster than AI Gangster Computer God but gets all the fucking colours wrong. </p>

<p>Yes, of course this pawn is a clue, but do you think for a second that this elaborate setup has left anything other than monographed handkerchiefs? Smoke signals mate. You know hitlet was about as in charge of shit as son-of-the-great-beast dubyuh (dub you, confound you) Bush. How did that dopey cunt ever make pres? Maybe he knows something we don&#39;t: fool me twice, can&#39;t get fooled again. </p>

<p>And for all of my ego, but of course, I am but a fool. But honestly, what a fucking great time to be alive. I&#39;m alive for it. I know you are too, one day we will eat yiros, or perhaps from your garden, maybe even from mine, but no one comes here: maps won&#39;t work here. That is how I found it. </p>

<p>These lapdogs, they are poor beaten, mistreated dregs of their own lost intentions. They get used time and again. Do not focus on the dogs at the doors, moreso instead the suits in the shadows. They know us yet remain ever shadowy figures, like Joseph K&#39;s charges. </p>

<p>I used to draw, and I want to draw something. If there is any redditor reading with time and inclination, I request the following: a sheep, anthropomorphised, standing on hind legs, arms outstretched and hands open, and draped in the still-bleeding complete pelt of a skinned wolf. If I get a decent image out of this, I will tattoo it on my body and post it here.   </p>

Everyone is leaning so hard one way I like to at least look the other way with an open mind.  And I get that people are upset at the &quot;letdown&quot;, we wanted to see bombs or at least the power go out or something. But this guy makes one of the better anti-abortion presentations that I&#39;ve seen, yet the vitriol headed his way seems &quot;corrected&quot;? a bit, no?</p>
