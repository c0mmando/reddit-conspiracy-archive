    <div class="md"><p>Ay dios mio, this is deep. The most telling aspects that I find most interesting: </p>

<p>-The obvious differences between herself and her purported body double</p>

<p>-The part about the fake secret service van that&#39;s actually an  ambulance</p>

<p>-How she was in a terrible state at the 9/11 memorial, ditched her NYPD escort and went to, &quot;her daughters&quot; house, which apparently is a blacksite hospital, complete with a simulated hospital room for her treatment </p>

<p>-When this person came out of her daughter&#39;s house, her security detail was absent, and after just being diagnosed with pneumonia, hugged a supporter, (we all know the real Hillary would never do that), and said something to the effect of, &quot;it&#39;s a beautiful day in New York City&quot;, which is bizarre into itself considering the tone was obviously somber in remembrance of whatever you want to call 9/11. </p>

<p>LOL! CBS livestream just said they hoped to talk to her tomorrow, something tells me that&#39;s not going to happen. </p>

<p>Without a shadow of doubt in my mind, there&#39;s some shady stuff going on here. I guarantee it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, let me tell you right now, IT&#39;S NOT YOU! </p>

<p>Dems, (Repubs, too, for that matter), will do anything to keep the band together and will fiercely support and defend their respective candidate to the bitter end. These types of attacks and emotional responses are always going to show their ugly head in the face of logic and facts. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced it as well, I&#39;ve learned that FB may not be the best channel for these types of discussions. The sad part is, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore who it is; hearkening back to the first Civil War in this country, these vastly polarizing candidates, policies and politics have destroyed whatever closeness existed between ourselves and our family/neighbors. </p>

<p>I say fuck the haters. My advice would be to find better, more appropriate channels to start these conversations and never let anyone stop you from critical thinking and connecting the dots.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well mainly because have you seen a secret service vehicle used in this capacity to drive around anyone that&#39;s used secret service protection? Weird, because either have I. </p>

<p>The idea is if she&#39;s so fucked up that she needs an ambulance on deck to drive her around, perhaps she&#39;s a bit more fuck up health wise than she&#39;s led the American people to believe. </p>

<p>If she&#39;s breaking down on the campaign trail, pretty sure she&#39;s not fit to do the job. </p>

<p>Poll conducted by politico came out yesterday yesterday and 50% said they thought she hasn&#39;t be honest about her health stuff; meanwhile, 30% polled say they believe she&#39;s going to die by 2020, (before the conclusion of her 1st term). </p>

<p>She has plenty of money to make her own blacked out Clintambulance. She is more of the do it yourself type person anyway, rather then using the secure provided assets by our federal goverment. She will probably delete the Clintablulance when shes done with it too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those aren&#39;t medical records those are bullshit and biased theory notes saying shit like..</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>&quot;Audio is the spoken voice of Hillary Rodham Clinton. However the quick chat with
Anderson Cooper was scripted and rehearsed which is why it sounds canned.<br/>
Remember, &quot;This is CNN.&quot;</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>&quot;Dr. Drew&quot; says he is &quot;gravely concerned&quot; about Hillary Clinton&#39;s
health and her healthcare on his recently canceled television show.
Physicians don&#39;t use the word &quot;gravely&quot; lightly.   When doctors use the
word &quot;grave&quot; or &quot;gravely&quot; they mean &quot;death&quot; is most likely outcome.&quot;</em></strong> Yeah because Dr. Drew is the authority here and has given Hillary a thorough medical examination! lol you guys..</li>
</ul>

<p>and then goes on to list shit like coughing, fatigue, and narcissism as some of the core symptoms of her imminent death from Sepsis. Holy hell you can&#39;t make this shit up. This has absolutely been the worst read I have undertaken all week.</p>

<p>Oh yeah.. those two picture comparisons are obviously edited with one being blurred while the other sharpened to show minor differences. Also you can&#39;t say she is taller in one of the pictures because its impossible to tell just by looking at a picture not to mentions shoes can add like 3-5 inches depending on what kind you wear.</p>

<p>Try harder r/conspiracy you are failing hard with your hillary hate and you should feel bad about clinging to this bat shit asinine information that&#39;s obviously biased.</p>

<p><strong>TRY HARDER</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think something is seriously wrong with HRC&#39;s health, but I totally agree with your points and was about to comment to the OP with similar examples when I thought, &quot;Surely someone has said this.... Oh wait, this is r/conspiracy, someone pointing this out would be downvoted.&quot; Sure enough, here&#39;s what I am looking for at the bottom.   </p>

<p>To add to your notes: No medical record contains links to stories and videos. The way they&#39;re used is juvenile. They&#39;re using links to advance conspiracy theories!!! WHAT?!?! Yes, because that&#39;s what medical professionals do, they offer conspiracy theories in medical notes that they know with 99.9% certainty won&#39;t be released. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, this is just an awful read; a really bad attempt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have to back off the conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>I mean, I am having a lot of fun getting these glimmers of hope that Hillary will have to step down and Bernie will somehow get in, but then reality always hits at some point, and damn.  I can&#39;t keep doing this to myself.</p>

<p>Hillary is fine, she&#39;ll be cackling again by next week, raising millions for her personal slush fund, ignoring Flint now that she figures Michigan is in the bag for her, deciding which country she wants to bomb first.  We&#39;ll probably have a mass shooting so people can talk about that instead of her <em>wobble</em> aka full body rigid seizure, and I just can&#39;t take it anymore.  </p>

<p>I have to ignore it for my personal mental health.</p>

<p>She has plenty of money to make her own blacked out Clintambulance. She is more of the do it yourself type person anyway, rather then using the secure provided assets by our federal goverment. She will probably delete the Clintablulance when shes done with it too. </p>
