        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about it .</p>

<p>The JFK speech. They were mocking you.</p>

<p>They did a good job.</p>

<p>Look at the country.. they are breaking it from all angles. Breaking everyone&#39;s spirit.</p>

<p>This was never about abortions. Don&#39;t be naive.</p>

<p>They have doxxed Mr.Teeth and showed he was connected to the DOD.</p>

<p>The sites IP shows its hosted @ 280 broadway NY which is a governmental building for the Buildings Department. </p>

<p><a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/about/contact-us.page">http://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/about/contact-us.page</a></p>

<p>Someone also pointed out that the guy in the video flashes the double 666 a few times in the video.</p>

<p>Sooo... Make up your mind.</p>

<p>Your government just had you look at babies being ripped out of vaginas while making fun of you.</p>

<p>Seriously, analyze that guys message. His delivery. It was a farce. He spent more time mocking you and calling you a piece of shit for wanting truth than he did with his message.</p>

<p>Look at the end result. People played right into their hands .. donating to the very institution they instated for legal child sacrifice out of SPITE... I&#39;m pro-choice on the subject but seriously. We are being manipulated and gamed.</p>

<p>We were all wondering how much money he had to put out to make this happen and ironically, it was your tax money. How much did you pay for this operation?</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m quoting a friend <a href="/u/911bodysnatchers322">/u/911bodysnatchers322</a> on the situation:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Notice the thumbnail is him taking off his anonymous mask. Anyone who &#39;really knows what&#39;s going on&#39; knows that anonymous is run by cia now and that the guy fawkes mask was about a jesuit conspirator who wanted to blow up world leaders, kill a kind and kidnap/brainwash a protestant princess--can you get behind that? I can&#39;t. Bad icon, badselfeater</p>

<p>I think this whole thing was a state sponsored fear campaign to shut down conspiracy theorists by having them &#39;chase their own tail&#39; and get themselves worked up (ie: the serpent swallowing its own tail aka &quot;ouroboros&quot; aka &#39;bad self eater&#39;) only to abuse you with a video that still calls you &#39;sheeple&#39; / &#39;asleep&#39;.</p>

<p>We are supposed to believe its this one evangelical agent provocateur who wanted to get his anti-abortion message across but I know at least one person that this video terrorized. A friend of mine that was very upset by all of this nonsense as she started to see other things around her that &#39;weren&#39;t quite right&#39;. It has happened to the best of us. Me: several times.</p>

<p>I tried to tell her it was nonsense and that it was more of this kind of occult mockery and it calmed her down somewhat. I really just talked about something semi unrelated until she could calm down...not sure what insights i gave her really.</p>

<p>I think this videos intention has nothing to do with antiabortion. It has everything to do with psychologically shutting you down and quashing inquiry and trying to insult you into thinking that you are wasting your time with conspiracy.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s dead wrong.</p>

<p>In fact, this video should be a validation that we are getting to them. That we&#39;re a splinter in their side that they have to produce these provocative cultural stockholm syndrome inducing videos. That they had to spend their time and creative effort to shut you down.</p>

<p>I really hope some of you are seeing what I&#39;m seeing and coming to similar conclusions that this is more control grid stuff. If you do, consider it an initiation. It never ends and yet when it first happens, like a detox, it feels really crappy before it gets better&quot;</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>This guy had extensive knowledge on secret societies and every hot topic conspiracy right now that should very well concern an awake citizen... Hmm.. and then he mocks the same community he was targeting! Doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>One more thing while I have your attention. He spoke of you being crazy for decoding things in movies and videos. I believe this was a distraction from a recent revelation brought forth about a particular date that has been decoded: 10/04/16</p>

<p>The guy who figured it out is now missing. He was a YouTube truthers who received death threats. I urge you to check out these two videos...there is something to it.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S9WW2HZsaC4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S9WW2HZsaC4</a></p>

<p>You might want to check out all his videos as I think he was on to something before he was disappeared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t invest my time in this selfeater psyop. </p>

<p>Interesting about the decoder of ten/ four who was disappeared. I was watching his vids for a few months prior, I thought they were some of the best I have seen about hidden symbols and agendas.</p>

<p>He starting decoding with a new person called DrJulienn. Shortly after that he was incarcerated, supposedly. She came on his youtube page and posted a message for a jail to send money to him if any are interested, but wouldnt say the charges only it had nothing to do with a Facebook episode where he was being implicated in child things.</p>

<p>In a video about transparency he made he showed his own license. And his name is not in the records of incarcerated persons for the jail she gave. This happened a few months ago. Both are awol.</p>

<p>He also called out russian vids and identified him, his real name and location. Some think that got him in trouble. Others say it was him making threats against russianvids. Whatever the case, this guy is gone without a trace but watch his vids while you can.</p>

<p>To answer your question, Apparently that is the day we could see another 9/11 type event. A YouTuber who was great at Numerology, decoding Hollywood movies, and occult symbology decoded the date and has since apparently disappeared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are hidden in a lot of movies. It&#39;s how a lot of these people communicate. Check out the guys channel... His &quot;partner &quot; shows up and says he got arrested and is in jail. People checked the jail and he wasn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>Hasn&#39;t posted in a few months since he posted a video about death threats. Go through his movies. He will explain why they code things into movies. Music, media.</p>

<p>Some think it&#39;s a warning to people who possess the knowledge to see it.</p>

<p>You would be surprised how many times 9/11 was coded into the first back to the future. Look up his movie McFly Code.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im watching the videos explaining this stuff atm, but if this is true and the elite or whoever is in charge of events like 9/11 use holywood as a mean to communicate, or if its someone trying to warn the people who can decode this stuff, there are so many people involved that i find it impossible that noone ever tried to talk about this and bring this to the outside/mainstream. If this really is true then directors must be involved, editors, maybe even the actors, and noone ever said anything about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.. I think people are just oblivious to it. Once your looking for it, you see it.</p>

<p>And yes, directors are highly involved. Screenwriters too.. everyone else might not need to know except set designers ..</p>

<p>This guy is really good. Explains it all. Your average MTV Kardashian watcher will have no clue.</p>

<p>And yes, these elite already have this shit laid out for years...these dates... They just like to I believe prime people in their subconscious for these uponcoming events. They also like to show off to their fellows how they can cleverly code the dates in. There are so many codings of 9/11 and 10/4 in back to the future. </p>

<p>Here is an example of one I realized today. Tom Petty came out with &quot;Free Fallin&quot; in 1989.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/T3phscjgc_A">http://youtu.be/T3phscjgc_A</a></p>

<p>Read it. It&#39;s about bad boys in the shadows breaking hearts as the protagonist has a day dream about &#39;free falling out into nothing.&#39; And how he&#39;s gonna write her name in the sky&#39;</p>

<p>This song is an encoded 9/11 programming. Petty probably didn&#39;t even write it,  was just given the lyrics to put in a song with the help of the producers. that song still gets played to death on the radio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are creating an event many years in the making, you want to prime the audience. 
Same with fight club, the closing scene. </p>

<p>The idea is that you want to plant ideas in the minds of the nation so that when the event does happen you can direct the narrative. Some are just communications of the plan. 
I remember watching back to the future as a kid and remember when he comes back from the past and there are terrorists in the twin pines parking lot. I had never heard of middle eastern terrorists who wanted  what doc had to make a weapon. But the idea was put into the mainstream for children. Those children grow up to experience the event.</p>

<p>You have to understand the music/entertainment industry is in bed with the elites. For example ,Alice In Chains. What the hell is an Alice in chains?  Well, if you know of monarch and how they use Alice in wonderland as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;amp;ei=VpraV6LKMoOvmQHm1oUI&amp;amp;q=alice+in+wonderland+mk+ultra&amp;amp;oq=alice+in+wonderland+mk+ultra&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0l2.4143.6998.0.7328.10.10.0.0.0.0.253.1808.0j3j6.9.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..1.9.1805...0i67k1j0i22i30k1.H6wTmE54nFk"> program:</a></p>

<p>Also, invert the first letters of the Alice In Chains, and you get C.I.A. One song of theirs, &#39;Dem bones&#39; is really alluding to skull and bones.&#39; Down in a hole&#39; -a lot of the songs on the surface are about heroin use, and if you know how the cia runs heroin....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right.
 some really cool conversations have taken place in the last week or two, and since the video reveal i have been watching a few threads. It pissed people off. But it also changed the tone about abortion and the underlying problems. Ànd how the social issues do underlay our views when it comes to dividing us. Even on ar15, the conversation has begun, about ethics, and finding ways of making things different.</p>

<p>Still really good art and a great primer until the bitter end. Also still very close to serious trauma based mindfuckery. I didn&#39;t watch the thing. I was watching the reactions, and all the initial outrage within an hour became largely great conversations. Think about it. Let&#39;s say you are spot on. Quite a few people softened their tones. What exactly did they gain? Cause I do not think anyone put forth a five yearplan over just abortion, mentally off, anti abortion or not. Looks like it felt like Initiation to me. </p>

<p>Do you mean narc like narcotics agent?  If so that&#39;s doubly funny.  Does a narcotics agent petition the UN to legalize cannabis / mushrooms?  Or write about a dozen other pro legalization stuff?  If so, I&#39;m the best dea agent ever becasue I&#39;m actively trying to destroy my job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are creating an event many years in the making, you want to prime the audience. 
Same with fight club, the closing scene. </p>

<p>The idea is that you want to plant ideas in the minds of the nation so that when the event does happen you can direct the narrative. Some are just communications of the plan. 
I remember watching back to the future as a kid and remember when he comes back from the past and there are terrorists in the twin pines parking lot. I had never heard of middle eastern terrorists who wanted  what doc had to make a weapon. But the idea was put into the mainstream for children. Those children grow up to experience the event.</p>

<p>You have to understand the music/entertainment industry is in bed with the elites. For example ,Alice In Chains. What the hell is an Alice in chains?  Well, if you know of monarch and how they use Alice in wonderland as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;amp;ei=VpraV6LKMoOvmQHm1oUI&amp;amp;q=alice+in+wonderland+mk+ultra&amp;amp;oq=alice+in+wonderland+mk+ultra&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0l2.4143.6998.0.7328.10.10.0.0.0.0.253.1808.0j3j6.9.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..1.9.1805...0i67k1j0i22i30k1.H6wTmE54nFk"> program:</a></p>

<p>Also, invert the first letters of the Alice In Chains, and you get C.I.A. One song of theirs, &#39;Dem bones&#39; is really alluding to skull and bones.&#39; Down in a hole&#39; -a lot of the songs on the surface are about heroin use, and if you know how the cia runs heroin....</p>
