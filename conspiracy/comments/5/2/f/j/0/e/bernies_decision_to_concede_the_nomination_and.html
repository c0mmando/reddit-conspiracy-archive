       Remember the story his photographer told online when Bernie
       <del>
        conceded to
       </del>
       <em>
        endorsed
       </em>
       HRC (see edit 2): "Bernie is playing a masterful game of chess, you'll see."?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie's decision to endorse and campaign for Hillary upon his loss happens to have been literally the only course of action that would have set him up to be a valid replacement nominee in this exact situation that's unfolding before us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean he knew/saw this coming? No idea. What I do know is that, had Bernie chosen to run or support third parties or even go quiet instead of doing EXACTLY what he has done since CA, there would be 0% chance of him replacing her. The DNC would just say "Well, he's not really a democrat is he? He wasn't before the primary, and he turned on us immediately after losing, so we're just going to pick the replacement ourselves. No need to vote, you can trust us."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Bernie can say "Hey I played fair! I was by far the nicest challenger in the primaries, and when I lost I did it gracefully and gave her my full support, it wasn't my fault my supporters didn't want to switch to her."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even his actions at the convention could be considered brilliant in hindsight. Had he put up too much of a fight, he wouldn't be considered for replacement should the need arise. Had he conceded his delegates to her before the convention (as many losing candidates often do in both parties primaries), he would no longer be the candidate with the 'second largest delegate count', which, by DNC bylaws, should make him the de facto replacement nominee. That said, the DNC's collusion with the media to push Hillary and trash Sanders was also against their own bylaws and
       <strong>
        by their own rules should disqualify the results of the Democratic Primary
       </strong>
       , but they aren't doing shit so I guess they're more of guidelines anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
        <a href="http://embols.com/2016/09/12/the-dnc-rules-are-suspended-if-hillary-drops-out-the-second-candidate-with-the-highest-number-of-delegates-gets-the-nomination/">
         Supporting evidence.
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Summary: the DNC has a rule that let's it name a replacement should it's nominated candidate need to withdraw during the general, but it also has a bylaw which says it auto goes to the candidate from the primaries with the next highest delegate count. During the DNC Bernie suspended the rules to declare Hillary the nominee, but he didn't suspend the bylaws. This is still in effect.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: The title is incorrect, Bernie endorsed but I do not believe he ever conceded, which would have released his delegates and ruined this plan. By endorsing, but not conceding, Bernie keeps his 1800+ delegates in an active state.

       Sooooooo... what part of this election makes you think the DNC gives two shits about their own rules, or playing fair? I would love Bernie to be the candidate (as he should be sicne he was cheated out of it), but there they will absolutly do everything in their power to not let that happen...

       I believe it's a result of the fact that Bernie called for a suspension of the normal rules and procedure during the DNC and had Hillary declared the nominee instead. What this did was leave all 1800+ delegates in a technically active state (I believe) rather than hand them over to Hillary. As such, would that mean the primary never ended, and that if the front-runner drops out, the next highest delegate count candidate wins the nomination? Someone posted an article on this earlier, I'll try and find it.

       And you can always just join the Democratic Party later if you want to vote in their next set of primaries too. It's seriously not a big deal at all, unless you're worried about them intentionally fucking your registration up to disenfranchise you. If that's the problem, then I'd just like to point out that life-long active Democratic Party voters were purged during the primaries in order to disenfranchise them too. No one is safe.

       Nope, found it and edited it into the original post. Appears even more so that Bernie seems to have, eerily,
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       this was going to happen, as what he did just before and during the convention now finally makes sense. It was all because he knew she might falter.

       Did Hillary give Bernie cash along with a threat to his life? Was the purchase of the beach house a way of making Bernie look like a sellout if he were to get any other ideas? Hillary and the DNC did steal the primary from him.

       He seemed different after stepping aside for Hillary. A threat certainly has precedent. And further, I'd bet he would get a threat and a financial incentive.

       So when you say "happens to have been literally the only course of action that would have set him up to be a valid replacement nominee" you don't mean legally or by Convention rules? You just mean in purely informal terms?

       Mostly informal, yes, but in all seriousness, had he done this even remotely slightly different, he would have zero chance at being the replacement nominee. As it stands, by refusing to officially concede and instead endorse her, and then to suspend the rules to declare her the nominee rather than let your delegates be handed over to her, which coincidentally suspended the right of the DNC to nominate her replacement and instead force the decision to go to the bylaws (which would give it to Bernie), Bernie has somehow masterfully maneuvered himself into being the default replacement. Granted, the DNC will almost surely ignore this as they did their own impartiality bylaw, but it still gives him his best chance regardless.

       As per your edit, it is significant that Sanders made it quite clear he wasn't conceding to Hillary (thereby extinguishing his candidacy).

       Bernie would presumably have to rejoin the Democratic Party, which would be awkward, but I think moot, because I am pretty sure the Democrats have no intention of nominating a candidate that they screwed over just a few weeks ago. Biden is the most likely candidate.

       The distinction to be made is what the DNC rules and bylaws say
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       happen now, and what the DNC
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       to happen right now. I don't think they could swing Biden when he didn't campaign, no one voted for him, and he specifically said he didn't want to run or be president. The only person I can see them giving the nomination to besides Bernie is Kaine, as he can claim he is just fulfilling his VP duties (even though the bylaws clearly state Bernie should be the nominee, they will either change them, ignore them, downplay them, try to take Bernie's delegates from him, or in some other way 'legitimize' whoever their pick is, because it sure as hell won't be Bernie.)

       All true, but the DNC have demonstrated they will do whatever it takes, however corrupt, to get their preferred candidate on the ballot. The rules and bylaws will be discarded, ignored or changed if necessary.

       IF chosen as her replacement, how could Kaine claim to be just fulfilling his VP duties, when the only reason he would ever replace her legitimately would be AFTER she was elected as the ACTUAL president? As far as I know, the presidential line of succession does not apply to people who "might possibly be elected."

       Bernie isn't even on the ballot though in most states right? Seems like they would have to rewrite the rules entirely to make him the Democrat nominee instead of Tim Kaine at this point. Now if Bernie had run as Independent an was on the ballot the game would have been changed an he might have a real shot with Hillary dropping. I'm afraid things are just too late for Bernie. Shame she didn't fall ill before the convention. The Crats gambled on her health holding out for a few more months to get her in office. They lost.

       Awful lot of shit talk about Bernie 'round these parts over this last 24 hours or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys think it's theoretically impossible for a politician to have a positive impact on the country -- I don't know -- stop being an annoying internet anarchist and go get shot by police for rebelling against the system, I guess.  If you know someone better than Bernie, just say who you'd prefer and why, and we'll see if anyone agrees with you.  But fuck this impotent bitchfest.

       Edit: also, i gave up on the two-party system after I saw what he system did to Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, The president isn't even close to being the top echelon of the military. We have private contractors with greater security clearance than our presidents, and no ONE PERSON will be able to disrupt the (thankfully failing) status quo system that's been in place for hundreds - if not - thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he Bernie energy is greater than that of Obama...but until we see the illusion for what it is, it doesn't matter who we "vote for" because WE need to totally disengage the system of corruption in favor of a new paradigm of relationships that works way much better than the current system.

       It's fun you can still parrot those lies.  Sanders was all talk, and when it came time to actually stand behind his beliefs, his voting record, simply doesn't suport that.  He was against the apartheid state or Israel in voice alone...when it was merely inconsequential.  When it actually held teeth, as in standing against the military industrial complex or the disgusting state of Israel, he voted FOR, FOR, FOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give them more money.  Give them more military hardware...the best we have.  Just give it away.  They need it to murder rock throwers.   NEVER can we audit the infallible, private "Federal" Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite Bernie moment was when he got so offended for being accused of being a dual-citizen of Israel....because politicians that are dual-citizens are offensive.  That whole "cannot serve two masters" and time and time again seeing them vote for ever money for Israel each year.  Surprise!!

       Except Bernie is one of the only politicians seeking a two-state solution to end hostilities between Israel and Palestine. I don't get why you people make shit up to attack him on. Just stick to good old McCarthyism and tell us he's just a damn commie out to steal our hard earned money and give it to vagrants, isn't that what you tried the whole primary season? Then you all found out the majority of America doesn't give a shit about Russia anymore, so you just started making shit up, like trying to link him to child murders ("Lack of gun control is to blame for Sandy Hook and it's Bernie's fault." remember back when Clinton used a mass shooting for political gain? I do.)

       As I said, when it was of absolutely no consequence, he would talk a nightly large game.  When it came time to actually do something, he consistently remained silent.  As is typical with most politicians.  Talking out both sides of their mouth.

       I believe it's a result of the fact that Bernie called for a suspension of the normal rules and procedure during the DNC and had Hillary declared the nominee instead. What this did was leave all 1800+ delegates in a technically active state (I believe) rather than hand them over to Hillary. As such, would that mean the primary never ended, and that if the front-runner drops out, the next highest delegate count candidate wins the nomination? Someone posted an article on this earlier, I'll try and find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="http://embols.com/2016/09/12/the-dnc-rules-are-suspended-if-hillary-drops-out-the-second-candidate-with-the-highest-number-of-delegates-gets-the-nomination/">
        found it
       </a>
       Summary: the DNC has a rule that let's it name a replacement should it's nominated candidate need to withdraw during the general, but it also has a bylaw which says it auto goes to the candidate from the primaries with the next highest delegate count. During the DNC Bernie suspended the rules to declare Hillary the nominee, but he didn't suspend the bylaws. This is still in effect.

       He seemed different after stepping aside for Hillary. A threat certainly has precedent. And further, I'd bet he would get a threat and a financial incentive.
