        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember the story his photographer told online when Bernie <del>conceded to</del> <em>endorsed</em> HRC (see edit 2): &quot;Bernie is playing a masterful game of chess, you&#39;ll see.&quot;?</p>

<p>Bernie&#39;s decision to endorse and campaign for Hillary upon his loss happens to have been literally the only course of action that would have set him up to be a valid replacement nominee in this exact situation that&#39;s unfolding before us.</p>

<p>Does that mean he knew/saw this coming? No idea. What I do know is that, had Bernie chosen to run or support third parties or even go quiet instead of doing EXACTLY what he has done since CA, there would be 0% chance of him replacing her. The DNC would just say &quot;Well, he&#39;s not really a democrat is he? He wasn&#39;t before the primary, and he turned on us immediately after losing, so we&#39;re just going to pick the replacement ourselves. No need to vote, you can trust us.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, Bernie can say &quot;Hey I played fair! I was by far the nicest challenger in the primaries, and when I lost I did it gracefully and gave her my full support, it wasn&#39;t my fault my supporters didn&#39;t want to switch to her.&quot;</p>

<p>Hell, even his actions at the convention could be considered brilliant in hindsight. Had he put up too much of a fight, he wouldn&#39;t be considered for replacement should the need arise. Had he conceded his delegates to her before the convention (as many losing candidates often do in both parties primaries), he would no longer be the candidate with the &#39;second largest delegate count&#39;, which, by DNC bylaws, should make him the de facto replacement nominee. That said, the DNC&#39;s collusion with the media to push Hillary and trash Sanders was also against their own bylaws and <strong>by their own rules should disqualify the results of the Democratic Primary</strong>, but they aren&#39;t doing shit so I guess they&#39;re more of guidelines anyways?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: <a href="http://embols.com/2016/09/12/the-dnc-rules-are-suspended-if-hillary-drops-out-the-second-candidate-with-the-highest-number-of-delegates-gets-the-nomination/">Supporting evidence.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary: the DNC has a rule that let&#39;s it name a replacement should it&#39;s nominated candidate need to withdraw during the general, but it also has a bylaw which says it auto goes to the candidate from the primaries with the next highest delegate count. During the DNC Bernie suspended the rules to declare Hillary the nominee, but he didn&#39;t suspend the bylaws. This is still in effect.</strong></p>

<p>Edit 2: The title is incorrect, Bernie endorsed but I do not believe he ever conceded, which would have released his delegates and ruined this plan. By endorsing, but not conceding, Bernie keeps his 1800+ delegates in an active state.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>where does it say this?</p>

<p>i skimmed through the <a href="http://www.demrulz.org/wp-content/files/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.11.2009.pdf">DNC bylaws</a> and didn&#39;t see anything about this. the only relevant thing i found was that the DNC (committee) is responsible for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>filling vacancies in the nominations for the office of President and Vice President; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the only source i&#39;ve found mentioning the route you propose is <a href="http://www.usasupreme.com/dnc-rules-it-is-still-possible-for-u-s-senator-bernie-sanders-to-be-our-next-president/">here</a>, but it also doesn&#39;t give any links or sources to where it is getting this information.</p>

<p>edit: my other DNC bylaws was from 2009. this is from 2012: <a href="http://www.essexdems.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Charter-and-ByLaws.pdf">http://www.essexdems.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Charter-and-ByLaws.pdf</a> and it&#39;s in color and stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s a result of the fact that Bernie called for a suspension of the normal rules and procedure during the DNC and had Hillary declared the nominee instead. What this did was leave all 1800+ delegates in a technically active state (I believe) rather than hand them over to Hillary. As such, would that mean the primary never ended, and that if the front-runner drops out, the next highest delegate count candidate wins the nomination? Someone posted an article on this earlier, I&#39;ll try and find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly informal, yes, but in all seriousness, had he done this even remotely slightly different, he would have zero chance at being the replacement nominee. As it stands, by refusing to officially concede and instead endorse her, and then to suspend the rules to declare her the nominee rather than let your delegates be handed over to her, which coincidentally suspended the right of the DNC to nominate her replacement and instead force the decision to go to the bylaws (which would give it to Bernie), Bernie has somehow masterfully maneuvered himself into being the default replacement. Granted, the DNC will almost surely ignore this as they did their own impartiality bylaw, but it still gives him his best chance regardless.</p>

The only person I can see them giving the nomination to besides Bernie is Kaine, as he can claim he is just fulfilling his VP duties (even though the bylaws clearly state Bernie should be the nominee, they will either change them, ignore them, downplay them, try to take Bernie&#39;s delegates from him, or in some other way &#39;legitimize&#39; whoever their pick is, because it sure as hell won&#39;t be Bernie.)</p>

<p>Edit: also, i gave up on the two-party system after I saw what he system did to Obama. </p>

<p>Also, The president isn&#39;t even close to being the top echelon of the military. We have private contractors with greater security clearance than our presidents, and no ONE PERSON will be able to disrupt the (thankfully failing) status quo system that&#39;s been in place for hundreds - if not - thousands of years.</p>

<p>Maybe he Bernie energy is greater than that of Obama...but until we see the illusion for what it is, it doesn&#39;t matter who we &quot;vote for&quot; because WE need to totally disengage the system of corruption in favor of a new paradigm of relationships that works way much better than the current system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fun you can still parrot those lies.  Sanders was all talk, and when it came time to actually stand behind his beliefs, his voting record, simply doesn&#39;t suport that.  He was against the apartheid state or Israel in voice alone...when it was merely inconsequential.  When it actually held teeth, as in standing against the military industrial complex or the disgusting state of Israel, he voted FOR, FOR, FOR.  </p>

<p>Give them more money.  Give them more military hardware...the best we have.  Just give it away.  They need it to murder rock throwers.   NEVER can we audit the infallible, private &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve.</p>

<p>My favorite Bernie moment was when he got so offended for being accused of being a dual-citizen of Israel....because politicians that are dual-citizens are offensive.  That whole &quot;cannot serve two masters&quot; and time and time again seeing them vote for ever money for Israel each year.  Surprise!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s a result of the fact that Bernie called for a suspension of the normal rules and procedure during the DNC and had Hillary declared the nominee instead. What this did was leave all 1800+ delegates in a technically active state (I believe) rather than hand them over to Hillary. As such, would that mean the primary never ended, and that if the front-runner drops out, the next highest delegate count candidate wins the nomination? Someone posted an article on this earlier, I&#39;ll try and find it.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://embols.com/2016/09/12/the-dnc-rules-are-suspended-if-hillary-drops-out-the-second-candidate-with-the-highest-number-of-delegates-gets-the-nomination/">found it</a>
Summary: the DNC has a rule that let&#39;s it name a replacement should it&#39;s nominated candidate need to withdraw during the general, but it also has a bylaw which says it auto goes to the candidate from the primaries with the next highest delegate count. During the DNC Bernie suspended the rules to declare Hillary the nominee, but he didn&#39;t suspend the bylaws. This is still in effect.</p>
