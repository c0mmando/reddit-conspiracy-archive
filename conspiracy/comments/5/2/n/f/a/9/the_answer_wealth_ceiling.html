       Just throwing out some ideas, sorry if it's not as succinct as it could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it may not be obvious to some, but it's clear why the world is the way it is. Money. Money results in power, power breeds greed, and greed breeds more greed and the hunger for more power. It's a never ending cycle. There is a finite amount of money on this planet (regardless of how much we continue to create), and as most are aware the majority of that wealth lays in the hands of just a few families. Money as a currency makes sense, but the current distribution of wealth has gone FAR beyond "fair" and is only getting worse by the day. We need to impose wealth ceilings for individuals. At some point, people reach a wealth that there is literally no reason that a person would ever need another cent. Kind of makes you think that the elite actually view the world as a real game of Risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how, but it needs to be done. I believe that has been the answer staring us in the face all along, and we need to start to speak out. We need to demand it, as you can be sure the elite do not care about "fair" practices, and will stop at nothing unless we stand up and try to stop them ourselves. We have the numbers, never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some ideas. What do you think?

       This is a very good idea. The thing going on with these people is that once they have money,  they want power. But this have to stop.

       I'm just really surprised that it's never discussed, or at least I've never witnessed a discussion. the old "that's just the way things are" logic needs to stop, and you can be 150% sure that this change will not come about naturally.

       That would be Communism, so, no thank you. Money is not the problem, humans are the problem. You could have the same amount of money, but I could still have a hotter wife or better life than you. I could have kids and you cannot have kids. You'd be envious, and say: "Why can't I have that?". Humans are never happy with what they have, they always want more of what ever... The world sucks, because Earth sucks and that is the point of this journey.

       Not achievable. Because each individual is different, hence why I live in Alaska and why you probably live in the burbs or a city...

       Sounds like a smart business man, compared to poor people.... I don't see a problem, really.. Do I think they need that much? Not really, but it's not up to me to decide how much someone else deserves or needs.

       Lol, its arrogant to believe in the concept of society.    I'm pleased to have this nugget to illustrate how far you morons will irrationally extend your thinking.  In such a hypothetical scenario where the entire world's population expect for one man have nothing while one man has everything, the situation to you is that every single person must be independently inept.  How mysterious!  That is by far the most batshit moronic lens on world one can have, and is on the front lines of what is wrong on this planet.

       Cool talk.  I have a good feel for why the irrational individualist has come to believe the way they do.  It is a pathetic self-righteous worldview ignorant to realities of human life on this planet.  When you shit for brains people try to chime in on topics like OP suggested, it is at the forefront of what's problematic.  You have no ability to think critically on this subject, but feel the need to chime in.  It is fucking embarrassing.

The more you type, just goes to show you are a name calling bully who self projects insecurities and lack of education onto others.

       Just because you cannot comprehend doesn't mean I've said nothing. Call me a troll all you want, doesn't justify your thought. All it's doing is disqualifying your thought and ideas... Back your shit up, or don't. That is on you... Kiddo... Methinks, you can't so you revert to name calling and covering your ears and eyes, because you do not understand the world you live in. Millennials... I feel sorry for you lot, if it wasn't so sad and funny.....

       keep trying to get the last word in, champ. hopefully it'll help you sleep at night-- just know, again, you've brought absolutely nothing to the table besides irrelevant babble. I truly feel sorry for you, but understand this is all you have in your lonely life. its ok, bud... just try and think before you type out your pointless comments, especially when you choose to follow them with more bouts of nonsense.

       There is no technical fix for abusive wealth inequality.  This requires a complete re-evaluation of what kind of society we want to have.   Working people by and large are morally aligned with their slave owners, thus thwarting any formation of meaningful civil society.  It is incomprehensible that 93% of humans on the planet basically live to survive day to day while a select few make essentially over $6million per day.

       Not really.  People want to productive.  If productivity is directed at the betterment of society (and by extension the ecological sustainability of this planet) that sounds nice.

       And that is true and that is why having all the money at the top. stifles innovation.

       Haven't you noticed the absence of new products while the near monopolists continue that trend to monopoly to expand their wealth and power and can now stop new ideas that would actually compete?

       Absolutely.  There is a fallacy that mitigating the hand of the market stifles innovation while a wealth of social-science research has shown just the opposite is true as you take note of.
