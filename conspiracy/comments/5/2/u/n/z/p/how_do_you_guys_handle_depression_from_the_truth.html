Overall just angry about all the bullshit that they get away with and how others are blind to what&#39;s going on... </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a common thing here or not, but for those of you who feel the same way how do you handle it? </p>

<p>Edit: wow, didn&#39;t expect so many responses. I don&#39;t have time to individually reply right now but i really appreciate all the advice</p>

<p>All the while, you left this comment on a post that claims to be &quot;depression from the truth&quot;. Wtf does that mean? &quot;The Truth&quot;. That is the some of the  most vague shit I&#39;ve read in a few days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really believe in &quot;the truth&quot; either. It&#39;s subjective. I&#39;ve got mine, and you have yours. </p>

<p>OP was referring to being helpless against corruption (this is r/conspiracy..... right?). The AA prayer fits perfectly to address this helplessness. I was raised Christian, but I&#39;ve lately realized there&#39;s not a bearded man in the sky with a list of rules. So the idea of a higher power and the fact that we&#39;re all going to end up somewhere is still comforting to me. </p>

<p>Pray it to yourself or Yahweh or Allah or Buddha or Love or The Universe or the fucking Flying Spaghetti Monster if you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t believe in the truth? Ouch, man. That&#39;s really sad to hear you say. You know, a lot of the propaganda today is dedicated towards promoting the ideology of moral relatavism and solipsism, you know why? Because if they can get you to abandon the reality that there is truth, you become unable to say no. You see things as varying shades of gray, rather than black vs. white, which is usually the way things actually are despite everyone saying otherwise. There is a fundamental truth, there is reality, a reality that you can understand if you put your mind and heart to it. Please don&#39;t give into this cancerous ideology that you cannot understand truth, let alone anything outside of your own reality. That is false.

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;truth&quot;, by definition, must be objective, otherwise we can&#39;t seek it, we can&#39;t find it, we can&#39;t know it. If there are lies, there is truth that is never subjective or else it&#39;s not different than a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, but Christian in nature. Nothing wrong with it. There is something wrong with people who automatically discount because of connotation, though. It&#39;s wise words. People may lie, but ideas ring true... The prayer helps me in a spiritual sense, not religious. Just chiming in, and that user can go get bent...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he meant that. He was quoting the &quot;Serenity Prayer&quot; made famous mostly by Alcoholics Anonymous. The prayer does say &quot;God&quot;, but that&#39;s really not the central theme of that &quot;prayer&quot;.</p>

<p>But I am an atheist and it depresses the fuck out of me whenever I do watch some enlightening video on YouTube whether on 9/11 or some other scandal and in the comments there are countless people proclaiming that Christ is the only answer and &quot;He will judge these evil men who caused 9/11!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah ok, fine Christ can judge them, but I fucking want justice <em>now,</em> not in some ambiguous future imaginary time period when you believe some book in the bible is going to come true (a book that most scholars believe was written with the downfall of Rome in mind).</p>

<p>So anyway I posted this already below, but it&#39;s a good video discussing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=QKMhq6AQ8mc">Five Stages of Awakening</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are feeling is the slow separation from your societal programming. There are prices to pay for everything, and &quot;the truth&quot; is no exception. You will find it harder and harder to put on the mask of &quot;normalcy&quot; day to day. Mixing with people who aren&#39;t interested in &quot;the truth&quot; will become banal and undesirable on a regular basis. Do not be scared, this is ultimately a good thing. </p>

<p>&quot;The truth&quot; <strong>will</strong> change you. You should accept this. You are not going to get too far without first being honest with YOURSELF and your contribution to this system of deceit. You are going to have revelations about yourself that are ugly and harsh. If you choose to fight this, you will be like most others - looking for a distraction from the reality that lies underneath all the lights and advertising. </p>

<p>But if you embrace the truth and do your best to adapt to the world as it is, the rewards are great. It&#39;s a process, and not an easy one. Only the strong can endure it, and for good reason. The weak are not fit to be fired out of their bubble. &quot;The Truth&quot; is not for everyone by design. </p>

<p>If you can make it through this period, if you survive and emerge from it a new person, Humanity needs your help. This is also the price of knowing, realizing your duty. No one will fault you for stepping back from your quest for &quot;the truth&quot;, that is your decision to make. Only the Universe can decide if your effort to know was honest and just. I&#39;ll tell you something a wise person once told me that put it all in perspective; </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s okay if your efforts only save one person. And it&#39;s okay if that one person is yourself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this really helped me. Thank you for your suggestion. I&#39;m going abroad for 6 weeks to get some much needed rest. It just that I felt a moral obligation to do something with this. And I always felt a passion for history and politics so I hope you can imagine how furious and passionate I was in the beginning. I jumped into the rabit&#39;s hole, only to find myself struggling regaining my footing when I went back to the real world. It&#39;s frustrating to know how life could be different for all of us in a very positive way. It breaks my heart to hear stories from refugees of Syria ( I live in the EU ). I feel powerless a lot of the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These will all seem like dumb cliches but these are my simple tools for fighting off depression: Spend time in nature.  Hang out with some non-human animals.  Meditate (this might be the best one— learn about mindfulness meditation and then practice it).  Take a few days or weeks off from either the internet entirely or just conspiracy news.  Look at a starry sky and get some perspective.  And take care of yourself physically and mentally, the two go hand in hand...  Give yourself a break.  </p>

<p>I used to be near-suicidally depressed for several years.  I know all about these horrendous feels. Now, even though the world seems to be getting shittier and I&#39;m more aware of it than ever, I am actually not that depressed at any given moment, largely thanks to some of the above.  But I am still terribly angry, hah... just trying to funnel that into something productive!</p>

After a while the fact that the whole world is utterly corrupt and that we are lied to on a truly heroic scale every day, just becomes completely normal.

    <div class="md"><p>This is something I see pretty frequently.</p>

<p>Honestly, if it&#39;s depressing you, I&#39;d suggest taking a step back. Don&#39;t close your eyes or anything, but take a break. Trust me, the power brokers and sociopaths will all still be here when you get back.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not worth your health.</p>

<p>If you stick with it for too long when it&#39;s affecting your well-being, you&#39;ll ruin your joy of life and start forgetting who you are as a person, and you&#39;ll lose the things that make you happy. Once that happens, people tend to kill themselves out of frustration or feeling helpless, or sinking into drugs and alcohol and becoming a shadow of who they once were. If that happens, the bad guys win.</p>

A theory is that in the past humans could use each sense to replace another sense. Another example of this is Nikolas Tesla it is how he invented so much. I have had such grand insights in the past year I know it&#39;s the truth. I am following the diet and am attempting to go beyond right now. It all depends where I want to put my work.

    <div class="md"><p>Turn &quot;the truth&quot; into a hobby. Find more truths then share with people that have similar interests. Also a risk here and there isn&#39;t so bad. Take Coca Cola commercials for example, there&#39;s prolly some shady subliminal shit going on there to make me give them my money but even if Coca Cola is some sort of device used by coorperations to reduce my health status, I&#39;m gonna enjoy that damn coke on a hot sunny day. Never give up on finding &quot;the truth&quot; because it&#39;s fun and that kind of thinking makes you think twice about what you&#39;re getting yourself into, but you&#39;re also on this earth for a short time, so just do and appreciate what you can do with what little life you got left, and I say even if most things out there have some major conspiracies behind them, try to enjoy it. A part of me thinks it&#39;s both interesting and hilarious how the public is taken advantage of, and yeah a lot of the stuff out there is evil, but it puts some kind of chuckle in me to realize how clever powerful people really are. I apologize if I&#39;m going on a tangent but just do the things you like, try to stay knowledgeable, try to stay in contact with good trustworthy people, never lose your way, learn to adapt and you should be just fine. It&#39;s all a matter of having good judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like so many others here, my &quot;truth&quot; depression culminated in a deeper understanding about the power of the brain, and of the power we have over ourselves (and the powers humans can have on others).</p>

<p>Essentially I have accepted:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Humans are mere animals coexisting in the rock we call earth, and death/pain (from nature or from another human) is often just a matter of probability. Like the saying goes, I accept the things I can&#39;t change, but understand the ones that I can.</p></li>
<li><p>The human mind is more easily manipulated than we realize, so I have come to understand the tools &quot;they&quot; use to influence the masses. I no longer have to a part of that bullshit, and it feels great. I can also design the life I want from better  understanding how humans work</p></li>
<li><p>True happiness will never be found in others, because others are just mere animals with their own set of biases, feelings, mistakes, mental/physical issues, etc. They are bound to disappoint (doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t love others for who/what they are). I love my &quot;self&quot; for it is the one thing I can truly control and &quot;be&quot; with when I  am at my best moments.</p></li>

I&#39;m not saying that some of the things we look into don&#39;t have value or aren&#39;t potentially true. What I&#39;m saying is that people without those sorts of predispositions typically don&#39;t care, they are more concerned with the day to day and immediate life/friends/family/work etc... and that&#39;s why those running the show get away with it. Humans are very social creatures, a psychologically healthy human eats up all the programming because they naturally want to fit in for happiness, reproduction, etc. Absolutely open to debate on this, would love to have a good discussion on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes a fair amount of intelligence to be able to differentiate facts that you&#39;ve learned and have been proven to you, from &quot;facts&quot; you&#39;ve been told without knowing of any reason to question them. Becoming awake is only the first step; reconstructing your world view and re-evaluating things you always assumed to be true is yet another level of this that some people never get past.</p>

<p>Your last point is important too, though. I get a little peeved when I see the term &quot;sheeple&quot; or the like, because the vast majority of them are just that - psychologically healthy. They are operating off of the mechanisms that kept humans surviving and thriving for many millennia. When people lived in tribes, you&#39;d be a moron (and a dead one at that) for not following rules and disobeying your leader, as those rules were made for survival.</p>

<p>But the rules and patterns people follow nowadays were not designed for survival - they were designed to benefit the entirety of the beast. And our brains aren&#39;t yet developed enough to notice that this natural inkling (and need) for trust is faulty, and that it&#39;s being manipulated by those appointed to power.</p>

<p>Anyway, most comedians have depression as well, and not for very different reasons. When your intellect isn&#39;t satisfied by interacting with other people, you seek more awareness and knowledge. Once you set out on that path, you will have higher ups, but lower downs. But that&#39;s part of the fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of good advice from people. Feeling upset and depressed as you learn deeper truths is a common experience. Besides what others have said I would add that you can adjust how much truth you uncover depending on how you feel. Lots of people dive in headfirst wanting to know how deep and dark this secret control really is. That probably isn&#39;t the healthiest way. When you start to feel bad then pull back, stop learning more dark secrets, spend time centering yourself again. Meditating, doing good things. You can learn more secrets later when you feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re depressed huh? Well that sucks for you, I guess. But if you stop for a second to ask yourself why are you really depressed. You say it&#39;s because the world is so bad. Let me tell you, the world didn&#39;t suddenly get bad in the last 10 years or even 20. It was bad when you were born and it was definitely bad before that. Looking deeper at conspiracies throughout history, the truth was always suppressed. Depressing right? People have known the true power that each of us hold and it was their mission to keep us from that truth. At a certain point you have to break through and realize that it starts getting into deeper spiritual truth - truth about who we really are and why we are here. Humans are allergic to limitation, you are a being of limitless potential - thin about it. The reason you are depressed is because you know something. You know this is not how things are supposed to be. What you don&#39;t realize is that this depression is just you trying to break free. That&#39;s a really good thing when you think about it. It means you have this seed of truth inside you. If the evil of the world were removed, what would we replace it with? This depression is a sign that you need to start filling in the gaps here. If you could make the world perfect, how would it look? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is depressing. Depression is an appropriate response for being repeatedly frustrated with no solution.</p>

<p>It takes conscious self-management in order to become happy again, or denial of what you&#39;ve learned.</p>

<p>It got a lot worse for me when I started to believe that this is an occupied planet dominated by beings that feed on fear and suffering. Of course that would be frustrating to believe. How do we fix it?</p>

<p>Why do I believe it? It answers so many difficult questions with plausible answers. </p>

<p>Why are the elites supposedly engaged in child abuse and &quot;Satanic&quot; rituals? Well, it gets their hands dirty for blackmail backed loyalty, their hidden otherworldly masters enjoy witnessing it and want their minions to get addicted to enjoying the suffering and fear of others like they are, so they are easier to control. They&#39;ve lived like this for perhaps millions of years. When humans take up their patterns of behavior, it&#39;s like manipulating children.   The patterns are old, familiar and relatively simple. </p>

<p>Why are there so many places where life could exist and so many UFO sightings when we don&#39;t have any formal contact with any off world civilization? The occupiers want to keep civilizations from interfering with their loosh farm. People could be informed and resist the control imposed on them and are far more likely to do so with compassionate counsel. Also, these occupiers supposedly sold us our ideas of good and evil, our most harmful and prolific religions and divine punishment, which they will be the ones to joyfully administer. The mere existence of otherworldly visitors undermines that loosh farming and control belief system based on the prolific and harmful religions that back it not being able to explain the existence of the visitors in the context of the soul enslavement belief system. Remember, they love to witness fear and suffering. If they can get into our minds and get us to believe we deserve to be tormented after we die, we effectively consent to their torture of our souls through brlief. This gives domination and control type personalities like theirs a deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>It answers the questions people pose about God. Why would he torture your soul if he loves you? He doesn&#39;t torture. Why did he create evil? Cancer emerges and thrives when the immune system fails to kill it. Why are his one true faiths creating wars and suffering? It pleases the ones that made those religions, not God, which is the consciousness inside all things. These sadistic loosh feeders are cancer inside creation, inside the body of God. The other cells of God have to kill them to restore health, but they&#39;ve been fooled into thinking it&#39;s wrong. This is the light forces that condone the torture and condemn killing the cancer. </p>

<p>The answers all exist with the belief in a group of invaders that siphon spiritual energy (the joy of life, that which animates the soul to animate bodies) secretly dominating and controlling our world for loosh farming purposes. Even sacrifice rituals make perfect sense in this context.</p>

<p>The only way it seems to resist them is integrity within ourselves and our society. They are great deceivers and rely on stealth and infiltration of our minds and institutions to corrupt our lives to suit their agenda. Transparency and accountability in government and business erode their influence. Honesty with oneself, yes, the cessation of lying to oneself for any reason, usually emotional comfort,  erodes their influence. They temp us all. We all have a &quot;foreign installation&quot; (Google that), a foreign mind attached to our own. As we reject its temptations, we avoid the reduction in integrity that those temptations would cause. Some say these beings amount to a spiritual test, while others believe that the idea of a spiritual test is a lie made to justify the preponderance of these spiritually parasitic beings. I lean toward believing the latter, as they cause more evil than they cure. Then they make the corrupted light believe we need more medicine, more reflection as they would perceive it. Yet, it amounts to drinking mercury. If we survive it will be despite the medicine, not because of it as they believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alan Watt was saying there is a price to pay for unveiling truths. You will lose friends, you will be alone.  You can never go back, once you dive in. The knowledge is totally worth it, because once you understand the game you can take the steps to free yourself.</p>

<p><em>Basic rules of thumb I have learned over the years:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do NOT try to impress/educate friends and acquaintances unless they express an interest. Debating sheeples is a waste of time and effort, and seems to generate bad vibes.  The trick is to slip little nuggets here and there, and let them ponder things over.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing you can do to &quot;save the world&quot;.  You have to focus on your life, make the best of it --&gt; NOW. You only get on shot at life.  If you are driven to being miserable and tormented with this knowledge --&gt; &quot;they&quot; win.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on community, smaller groups and strive to be self-sufficient, if possible. I have friends living off the grid and they truly do not give a hoot on what happens in the outside world. They figure it is exactly this way so people fret and worry about EVERYTHING  ( see the pattern? )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good-luck friend, peace to you and all your loved ones.</p>

Try not to fall for disinformation campaigns, and try not to listen to anybody&#39;s predictions about the future.  99% of the time, they&#39;re dead wrong and you can get worried over an event that never materializes.</p>

<p>Eventually, a sort of outrage fatigue will set in and you&#39;ll get used to seeing the world as it actually is..  I imagine it is similar to getting used to being a first responder at accidents on a nightly basis.  At first, it would shake you to your core to see the terrible things that happened to people, but you would have to put up a barrier to deal with it emotionally or find a new job.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t separate your most personal emotions from this stuff, you might want to take a break from it for a while.  I have had to step away a couple of times in my course to trying to understand the world better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one way to feel useful in the fight is to understand that this is all about propagation of idea. This is the war. So to contribute to the war, you have to spread good ideas (ie: as close to the truth as possible) and fight bad. Obviously, to be efficient you have to make weapon of mass propagation : media. Be it, written, oral, video, flyers. Whatever.</p>

<p>Maybe join some group and help to fight propaganda as a team and create new media. Being with peers help a lot I think. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a great post. I feel &quot;exhausted&quot; sometimes after doing research. Sometimes I feel like I should just stop because it can make me feel down and in reality what can I do to help? People that aren&#39;t familiar with the research can look at you like your crazy when you talk about things but deep down you know you&#39;re very sane. Too sane. Lately I&#39;ve just came to thank God for showing me the truth and also blessing me with a good woman who also has interest in the truth. To me as time goes on its obvious there are good things and bad things....Satan is real...along with that that means God/Jesus has to be real also. </p>

<p>My recommendation is to pray and ask for peace and to ask God for knowledge and to guide you. We live in crazy times and life can be very overwhelming especially when you add the Truth to life. We are only human....</p>

<li> Maybe 25% of what you read will be the real truth.</li>

<p>The rest is New Ageism, fascist propaganda, transhumanist delusions, and paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<li> The current apocalypse is mostly localised to North America.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the extent that it exists in other countries, it does so in exact proportion to said countries&#39; degree of American influence.  America is the bane of humanity at this point; as a country and a society it has become irredeemably degenerate.  It needs to end, and it will, by its&#39; own hand.  Nobody else needs to lift a finger.  When you see Americans making prophecies of doom on a constant basis however, recognise that in other countries, things are often a lot better.  Americans are incurably egocentric and think that their only their own country has any importance.</p>

<p>(that&#39;s a fart noise)</p>

<p>These psy-ops are pathetic. Imagine: a world where you are trained to be an elite super-soldier at a super secret School of the Americas-style University, and after graduation you&#39;re hired by some black-ops group owned by Dick Cheney&#39;s off-shore bank account, and they hand you your mission assignment, and you open it up, heart is beating, it says.....</p>

<p>&quot;Agent92, your mission is to subvert the r/conspiracy subreddit on the social media website Reddit. You will use your expertise in psych-warfare to achieve the goal of mass-suicides in the internet-using populace. This mission is Top-Secret and you shall report directly to Hillary Clinton.
