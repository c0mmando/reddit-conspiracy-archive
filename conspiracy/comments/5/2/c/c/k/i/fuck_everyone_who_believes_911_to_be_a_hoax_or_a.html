    <div class="md"><p>The OP was saying 9/11 wasn&#39;t a conspiracy because he lived in NY at the time and had firefighter and banker friends. You then say that that makes him an expert on the subject, yet in the post of yours that you linked you say yourself that there must have been inside knowledge. So are you agreeing with OP or not?

    <div class="md"><p>Me, my mother, father and sister all lived through it. It was a sad day and many loved ones were lost. Because we lived through it and experienced it first hand theres bias to it. The pain and heart break shades your views. 15 years later facts and evidence show that this was a planned event. But still this day is to honor the fallen on this day not to talk about this. Bring it up a later day. And if u don&#39;t believe me look at tower 7. physics man!</p>
