        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-09-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/SooperModelsDotCom.html">SooperModelsDotCom</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My conspiracy theory on what will take place later today, Sept 15 2016 (and also then after) is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton will act out a rehearsed severe medical episode while at her rally in NC causing her to be rushed away (similar to the collapse she actually had on 9/11/16).</p></li>
<li><p>Soon after that, the DNC will make an announcement that, due to Hillary&#39;s poor health, they are convening to pick a replacement for the election. (Obviously, they&#39;re just play acting through all of this because this plan has already been arranged).</p></li>
<li><p>The DNC will announce their replacement is Joe Biden (obviously again, they&#39;ve known this for weeks prior Biden would be the eventual Democratic pick).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some of my reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This gives Clinton an easy out to exit the election by playing the sympathy card, not because of the real reason that her campaign is completely imploding and she is being forced out by the DNC (which, of course, the DNC is absolutely forcing her out).</p></li>
<li><p>Most all of her scandal and criminal investigations (emails, Clinton Foundation, hammers, Bleachbit, pay-to-play schedules/meetings) will become yesterday&#39;s news and not have near the attention as they&#39;re getting now.  The attention will now be diverted to the Trump-Biden election.</p></li>
<li><p>There is NO way HRC will participate in ANY debates.  Absolutely no way.
All Mr. Trump has to say in any of the debates is, &quot;I have just one question (pauses and grabs microphone with his right hand while slightly adjusting its position);  &#39;Is Bill Clinton watching this debate tonight or is he still at home dicking the bimbos?&#39; &quot; </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Today, Sept 15 2016, is <a href="https://67.media.tumblr.com/7583a6b38c26ca2d3b79faa5953572f9/tumblr_o0ifrv3R1B1ubm73lo1_500.gif">game over for Hillary Clinton.</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit (3:43pm EST)</strong>:  The weather in Greensboro, NC is currently <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1fh5EMO.jpg">86<sup>o</sup> with 50% RH</a> where Clinton&#39;s rally will soon start.  There&#39;s NO way any competent campaign would put her out there in that type of weather.  </p>

<p>Clinton has the pick of anywhere in this country to hold her rally today and she picks a place like Greensboro, NC with those weather conditions???  Even if the NC rally had already been planned weeks in advance, she still could have changed the location just like she substituted Bill going to California/Nevada in her place just a few days ago.</p>

<p>It all plays into the narrative of Clinton&#39;s collapsing due in part to her health condition but also because of the &quot;extreme&quot; weather conditions during her rally.</p>

<p>You know nothing about her psychology. Even in death there is no command but her own. Nothing short of her execution or actual death by illness will get her to stop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, Sept 15 2016, is game over for Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Once you actually start paying attention to what&#39;s going on in the world, you stop being this optimistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the DNC is just as likely to want her out to ensure they get the Presidency - they thought she was a shoo-in, so slacked on downticket races, so if Dems don&#39;t win, they lose Executive AND Legislative office. Problem is, though, the DNC and campaign are so deep in the corruption themselves that they can&#39;t turn on her without damaging themselves.</p>

<p>(And, be honest, if she is &quot;MEGA,&quot; &quot;elite handlers&quot; want their person to win, either way. So either Trump is or she is or someone who replaces her is. Still not going to be easy to force her out - she has dirt on everyone, too - and there will be collateral damage.) </p>

They&#39;ve constructed this health scare, stools propping her up on stage, spitting out green objects, even the fall into the van, all a show. The real reason is to get her high enough in the polls so that Biden or whoever else could piggy back up to the top. Maybe they felt that whoever they <em>want</em> in office couldn&#39;t get the amount of support Hillary has gotten. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roger Stone said today that Bill was organizing a law team to sue DNC if they try to force her out. She wants this so bad she&#39;s risking her health and can&#39;t face reality everyone around her Bill, campaign spokesman guy both said it&#39;s hard to get her to rest she just keeps pushing it till she drops (again). The other thing Stone said was sources indicated Michelle might be drafted so thus a true 3rd term. Pretty crazy if true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what they mean, it appears that you do not.</p>

<p>fascâ€¢ism (fÄƒshËˆÄ­zËŒÉ™m) A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism. Oppressive, dictatorial control.</p>

<p>Oops, sounds exactly like what Trump is advocating to me.</p>

<p>Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles and policies advocated by Marx; especially :  a theory and practice of socialism including the labor theory of value, dialectical materialism, the class struggle, and dictatorship of the proletariat until the establishment of a classless society</p>

<p>This is NOT what Bernie Sanders is advocating, he is for Democratic socialism only, not violent uprising and dictatorship of the proletariat. It sounds like you are projecting Trump&#39;s fascism on Bernie Sanders here.</p>

<p>There you have it, the actual facts say that you are wrong. Now what is your excuse going to be, that the definitions were modified by the &quot;liberal&quot; media?</p>

<p>He&#39;s a bolshevik jew. It&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s advocating. He himself has said so, numerous times, throughout his career.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;only.&quot; Socialism is marxism. Marx himself said so. Socialism is the revolution by which marxism is achieved. Only a marxist would deny this (because they&#39;re told to), and only marxists and economic illiterates don&#39;t know it. Which are you?</p>
