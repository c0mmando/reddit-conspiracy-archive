    <div class="md"><p>Whatever your stance on Clinton is, one thing is for sure. This is theatre. All of it. The reaction from the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; community is exactly the same as when everyone thought Putin was missing after that supposed coup in Russia. I think she is sick ( with Parkinsons and had DBS ), but other than that everything we&#39;re seeing around her right now is untrustworthy, and maybe that&#39;s the point. Maybe the point is to make you believe something is so true that it has to turn out a certain way, and then it doesn&#39;t, so then you distrust all of the sources you believed in. Just saying, the speculation around all of this seems designed.</p>

<p>Think about it.. the news is all about her health instead of the largest fuck up of her career. If in a few weeks shes back on the trail full steam, the health issue will be history and the media will have passed the anniversary of Benghazi without a peep.</p>

<p>..but of course the Reaper doesn&#39;t care about your political chess game. If there is something major wrong with her health, she&#39;s done regardless.</p>

<p>Her being to sick to continue (ie. Dying) was the only situation I could see her in where she wouldn&#39;t become the next president. </p>

<p>I was surprised at how much I got my hopes up that she was truly sick, but I can&#39;t deny how I felt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe for one minute Trump is going to end any of those things.  He&#39;s spent his entire life looking out for number one, and even giving money and supporting the Clintons when it benefitted him.  People who believe he suddenly will change his spots are completely naive.  He&#39;s &quot;different&quot; because it is to his benefit.  When in power, he&#39;ll be who he&#39;s always been.  A man who looks after his own benefit first.  How is that any different than the Clintons? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol  so how long should i expect you to keep trolling my posts? Any love interests that might pull you away for something of value? Perhaps a new game, or movie you might be into? Surely trolling my comments can&#39;t be the only thing you do.  I mean, besides get upset and insulting when people don&#39;t view things in the same way you do, of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how your six day old account is a stereotypical Trump supporter.  Its like you are literally here to confirm every Hillary supporters view and make Trump hated more.  Since, you know, I don&#39;t really care if you think I&#39;m wrong, but you keep saying stuff and, I imagine, if I look at your post history, you are pretty much a dick to anyone who disagrees with you.  Hard to believe you are really such a stereotypical Trump supporter coming on reddit just six days ago to be a loud mouths ass to people who disagree with you.  Sounds more like a person that benefits hillary much more than Trump....</p>

<p>Think about it.. the news is all about her health instead of the largest fuck up of her career. If in a few weeks shes back on the trail full steam, the health issue will be history and the media will have passed the anniversary of Benghazi without a peep.</p>

<p>..but of course the Reaper doesn&#39;t care about your political chess game. If there is something major wrong with her health, she&#39;s done regardless.</p>
