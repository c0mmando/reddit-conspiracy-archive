      <p>
       just my two cents, but throughout this I have seen much behavior that tends to set off my shill alarm here.
      </p>
      <p>
       not just individuals, but how forums are moderated and controlled. Ive definitely seen the rules of forum control play out here. with groups like CTR that have inordinate power. forum slides et al.
      </p>
      <p>
       ive also seen hordes of people who try to push disinformation in all subreddits having to do with conspiracy or politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       if it doesn't go along with personal bias, often people will discredit others will little proof and lots of big claims that don't actually hold up to scruitiny -- and only reach out to the crowd that will not listen to the mentioned audience to begin with (alex jones support heavily comes to mind, everyone here is absolutely convinced he is a shill himself, even going so far as to say hes owned by the Koch brothers he spoke out against several times actually)
      </p>
      <p>
       but that isn't me saying hes right or to listen to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm merely making an observation that all of us should maintain independent, non-group think will, and often times even go as far as to actively denounce and refuse to support the group think decision making process.
      </p>
      <p>
       take pride in your opponents name calling. wear things like racism, etc, as a badge of honor. continue making unpopular claims, even if it becomes illegal or is considered immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       allowing vested interests to control our opinion using websites and methodologies like this, methods that lead us into a hive-mind mentality, where everyone agrees with the socially constructed rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       let go of biases that say only ONE group that you don't like is responsible. accept that individuals throughout EVERY walk of life have sold their souls and work for a religion/belief system that is NOT openly viewed, they may say they are Christian, jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       they may say things like a purge is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       they may say things like the truth is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       but that is because they are lying, and afraid if people find out these ideas may target them and their extended families, whom have worked for hundreds of generations to accomplish this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       us asking for freedom and peace is literally begging them to give up their entire religion, way of life, ideology, control over industry and massive wealth. it is asking them nicely to pretty pls give us all your stuff and stop controlling us. to give up the dream of society their ancestors created so we can build another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       one that is only subjectively better to us and worse to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       and there may even be trillions of people worldwide into disinforming people, paid by private interests to run public disinfo campaigns. they may be paid trillions of dollars to do it
      </p>
      <p>
       if you guys start seeing how horrific this really is, you'll see that putin totally did the right thing killing off the oligarchs and setting up state run media.
      </p>
      <p>
       you might associate state run media with tyranny. but in a global, corporate tyranny, the very companies you rely on for information are the guilty tyrant party.
      </p>
      <p>
       therefore in Russia, where media was controlled as much as it is here now, but for longer, the only hope was to literally disband all organizations and start a new one with the protection of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you have a government that's actually out for real economic recovery, against unnecessary war, then state run media prevents radicals who dream of nothing more than attaining power, for brainwashing the population into accepting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       putins reaction is the same reaction we need here.
because as it is now, there is NO bastion of free speech where you wont be heckled out of existence, or even come up to REAL LIFE threats of losing everything or even unjust imprisonment if you happen to know the wrong fact and let it slip and they cant stop you any other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not claiming this is just reddit either.
its any and all of these sites where public opinion is openly discussed. it happens passively (information gathering) and actively (disinfo spreading, heckling of the truth to prevent acceptance) and especially on sites with an active conspiracy section.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe I'm totally wrong on all of this, but its just my two cents, after watching posts disappear, and all sorts of general craziness show itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       know thy enemy and know thy self.
      </p>
      <p>
       as a final note, Id like to add, not mentioning the jews responsibility in this, actually has several important supporting reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the NWO is not ENTIRELY jewish. many different groups are trying to create it, and whoever gets their first is best off, or even the last remaining group. each group has factions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the public has been brainwashed beyond hope after ww2, where if you pointed out the jews, you will NEVER get serious backing, taking the jones approach and ignoring the subject entirely leaves people to turn over the stones themselves and see what lies beneath.
if the NWO happens to be stopped, it will not be in his control who is executed. the whole idea is to reach more people that would not listen to the traditional conspiracy narrative -- people who might disagree with current extremist groups, but definitely have a place within our ideology
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         sort of the same as the above two -- but oversimplifying things is dumb. and groups that are more obviously in power and working towards tyranny but happen to be the same entity (catholic church, organized religion), are easier to target and do not draw such harsh criticism.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       in light, the strategy of not attacking the jews in no way absolves the specific leaders and controllers who lie about being jewish. it just prevents unnecessary hate crimes, and the destruction of innocent nobody jews who don't support this.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fall of the oligarchs is the fall of the oligarchs. removing only one group solves nothing.

       I'm not a shill, all you can call someone who has as much irrefutable proof as me is a shill. I am here on my own good will to lead humans to a higher understanding. All you can do is ridicule me as a person in hopes that it somehow discredits me. It doesn't. A shill derails conversation. I don't derail anything I speak FACTS. I have proof and more proof where that came from. Just because your cognitive dissonance is so high you can't accept proof when it slaps your face doesn't make me a shill. You are literally working for the shills for free by calling me a shill! I am here on the goodness of my heart unlike you. You are attempting to discredit someone who has worked very hard to get to this place. I can say everything I say because I have proof of it all. You live by a house of cards and I shit on your house of cards every time to the point where you have to call me a shill. Now that you're asking people to ignore me goes to show your level of stupidity. Get off r/conspiracy go back to r/news there are tons of bullshit facts you can read there that you can pretend are true.

       You're an idiot who has not gone to a higher understanding of the universe. Everything is set in stone for a reason you just don't see how perfectly our world is created for us. I do understand the ultimate truth, the ultimate truth is that we live in a world that is entirely created and that whoever created it did an extremely nice job of making it for us. They created it with many great mechanisms like, growing new brain cells when you're hungry. They created it with naturally growing herbs that heal your body. You are telling me I am a dummy yet I am standing so strongly in light darkness does not touch me. There are others who are here and they do not stand so firmly on their beliefs but for you to think flat earth is a psyop while ignoring everything I say is pitiful. I'm spitting on you in my dreams. You say our human brains is fallible yet I am not using my brain. God lives in us and he's all knowing. How's that for a harsh reality. Sorry you haven't gotten to know him.

       Define proof. You cant expect to have physical evidence of God's will on a peice of paper. Even then you'd question it, asking where did you get that from?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living in a time where science is completely co-opted by financiers and corporations, "proof" is manipulated all of the time. Further, the mainstream media can not be trusted one iota. They ignore what matters to the public interest and bend to the will of their puppet masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       True evidence that reflects the nature of our reality is increasingly found in oral techniques, speech, and stories. If you notice the same story is told from multiple credible witnesses, then that is evidence, and if you ignore a multi-validated point, then you are lying to yourself and will need to re-evaluate your personal belief and moral grounds. This most definitely includes those that are paid to write disinfo on behalf of various agencies.

       i'm all for beleiveing in something without proof it exists.  i believe aliens exist, yet i have no proof of it.  however, when you come out and say x exists with no proof, you should expect no one to listen.  his attitude is what makes conspiracy theorists look bad.  i would doubt with the newness of the account, and it's  desire to mock and ridicule others instead of providing evidence to back up his claims, that it is someone who sincerely believes what they are typing.

       Yeah, but you didn't even read what he said... He said he lives within us, so either you know where to look or you don't, and if you don't you won't find him. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've "found God" through using DMT, psylocibin, etc, and while it ultimately ends up as no more than a construct of my own subconscious, you still cannot deny the feeling of spiritual connection, and "oneness" that comes from such an experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from that I was able to develop my own spirituality and "find God" within myself.

       Mileage may vary.

       there is a difference between saying you believe something lives in you, and knowing because you have evidence to report it.  to say something certainly is, without evidence, is very stupid.

       i'm sure that is what you would like to think.  when you have evidence for the rest of us, say you know god is real.  until then, say you believe god is real, unless you want to sounds tupid.

       if they have no problem discrediting it, then you should have no problem getting evidence to credit it.  like i said, i'm all for people beleiveing in things, but if you want to say 'X absolutely exists'  then you need evidence too.

       I mean... you're half right, in the sense that I did imagine this completely transcendental experience, but you're certainly wrong in the sense that I still experienced it so it's real to me... and just because you've yet to have such a moment doesn't prohibit you from ever having one.

       Tell you what. Assuming you're 18 years of age or older - Find your local Canadian and procure 3g of potent mushrooms. Go to the forest and ingest them. Wait 30 minutes and see what happens! Then come back to me and say there's no God. For science.

       still isn't evidence.  i'm not here to debate weather god exists, i'm here to debate weather you have proof that he exists.  me having a head trip due to poisoning myself with a mushroom or some other chemical is not proof of a greater intelligence's existence.

       we all have the same experience.  our brain is trying to deal with being poisoned and it shows us lots of crazy things.  still isn't proof of a creator of reality, just a fun weekend at best, or a trip to the hospital at worst.

       there is nothing better, I considered opening and moderating my own site, but truthfully I could never stop this from happening without using illegal tactics to hack into and trace all visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       me posting this was more me trying to warn others from the dangers presented by accepting majority groupthink, in an environment which is known to be somewhat censored and controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wanted to punch my own hole in the popular narrative here, apologizing for a few things I think, and trying to possibly get other people to be proud of having opinions that stray from the group opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are some things I believe that this whole forum would say I'm wrong on, and I'm proud that I don't let it affect my belief without TRUE irrefutable hard evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       and all others should be too.
      </p>
      <p>
       group think and social norms, especially by controlling things like sex, and economic standards, is the main tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we can ever start doing something that alters the mate selection in women to defy socio-economic standards, for example, we can make serious strides in attacking the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       because that's how it works, with social censorship and control, who deserves to thrive and who deserves to die off.
      </p>
      <p>
       excommunication has always been their darkest tactic. now its just silent. you can still work, live, even play on your own, and be a modern excommunicate, but good luck on having any sort of life, getting ahead with anyone, or ever winning at life.
      </p>
      <p>
       because the rest of society, especially those that have the things you want, are programmed to reject you under certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I constantly try to think of how I can rig and manipulate things to my advantage, and possibly poison the society with a little bit of real social justice -- with blows to the social policing/taboo structure of society itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       ive said for a long time, walking into exile until there is nobody left not exiled, is the first step towards a truly awakening humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact its the reason so many wake up so late. it only begins affecting them once the amount of things that labels you an exile, is so great that anyone can be considered one, and the punishments so steep everyone risks life imprisonment, torture, and death.

       I'm not romanticizing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason is that the only people legally allowed and financially able to start these networks, by and large, are the problem here.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying in a system like that, the only way to prevent the richest people who support these things from starting media to brainwash people with lies, is to either murder them all and their families/friends and redistribute all wealth and land and means of production,
      </p>
      <p>
       or,less radically, to start up a legally sanctioned news agency and literally make it illegal for them to have a voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       extreme times/problems call for extreme measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem here is the soviet oligarchs, or rather their tentacles which survived long after the beast died, are the ones controlling our media and damning anyone who opposes them.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is nice to be able to have free press, but you have to be able to reign shit in when everyone is coordinating lies.
because how is that any more free than anything else? I say the news that tells the most truth, with the least bias, with the least amount of private backing they are dependant on is the best and free-est news.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, the interests backing state run media are nefarious as well. but at least you know where you stand. and at least in that situation you know the people it removed and replaced, are at the least, equally as bad if not worse
      </p>
      <p>
       at a certain point, what we have is one trust that owns all networks and controls information and the infrastructure used to share/broadcast it.
      </p>
      <p>
       when those people become the enemy, preventing their voice from being so loud is the only real way to stop them from sowing chaos

       furthermore, in a state run system, you can verify the backing and interests of any reporter. verify where the story came from. verify everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       with our system, whatever they don't tell us is covered up, and there is no way to know who they really back and why, unless you follow the money, in which case your a kook or a nut.

      <p>
       in russias system the nuts are the normals, because that is true reality when you stop the brainwashing.

       Unfortunately there are no popular public forums that will not fall under their control. If a new one pops up and gained popularity, it will soon be controlled. All we can do is use critical thinking and decide for ourselves what to believe. Independent research is your best friend. The only way to have real unadulterated discussions is in small groups through secure communications. Anything that reaches a wide audience will be monitored and influenced.

       Yeah, but you didn't even read what he said... He said he lives within us, so either you know where to look or you don't, and if you don't you won't find him. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've "found God" through using DMT, psylocibin, etc, and while it ultimately ends up as no more than a construct of my own subconscious, you still cannot deny the feeling of spiritual connection, and "oneness" that comes from such an experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from that I was able to develop my own spirituality and "find God" within myself.
