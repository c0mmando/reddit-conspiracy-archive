        Hillary Clinton Says U.S. Can’t Legalize Drugs Because There is “Too Much Money in It”
       </a>
       explains Hillary's out-of-touch position.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clinton argued the United States cannot legalize drugs because there is “too much money in it.” Clinton went on to say, “You can legalize small amounts for possession,
        <strong>
         <em>
          but those who are making so much money selling, they have to be stopped.
         </em>

        ”

       Who, Mz Clinton, do you think is 'making so much money selling'?    (We know the answer)

       That somehow she's the
       <strong>
        <em>
         ultimate political cuckhold
        </em>
       </strong>
       , oblivious to wrongdoing in her immediate circle.  Is this a strategy that's supposed to work?  I mean really, does she think we're that stupid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...gulible?  Or forgetful?  Or naive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  To all the above.  Hillary Clinton thinks you're a dipshit moron half baked reject.  And you are, if you buy this cuckhold story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you might argue that it's possible she really does think Kissinger is a good man and that all those facts about him are lies, somehow, even though they are numerous, mountainous in fact,  longstanding, well-sourced and very well known.  It's possible she's still oblivious, they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       In which case ask yourselves: if she missed all the above and truly is a political cuckhold, is she fit to lead?  I mean if she doesn't know what's going on within her own circle of friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, in my mind, Clinton is not some oblivious innocent.  She's a smart lady and a vicious viper.  It's pretty clear to us here that Clinton is a liar, this is just more fuel for the fire.  But in this case it's a hateful kind of infuriating faux-coyness that is so very palpable I want to manisfest it in front of me only to punch it to death.  Lacking such conjuration abilities, I've written this instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately we're left choosing if Hillary is a liar, or if she's an idiot.  Neither looks good for her.  But she'll be our next president.

       Very true.  There have been several spooks to speak out; as well as police investigators that were cuckholded,  finding out after-the-fact of being frozen out, stonewalled by their chiefs and reassigned that they were in fact investigating spooks themselves, when they thought they were tracking drug mafia. Revelation was '

       Nailed it again. Not sure but the conjuring skills required here are a bit much. Maybe this is more of a group project. You get first punch, and you may have mine.

       That would be a good start. Maybe hold them all in Gitmo under the same conditions they find appropriate for all the other enemies of the state. They can even use my rope.

       Believe it or not, it's not just wars and stuff that are supported by drugs.  It's hollywood too.  And porn.  Porn is a loss leader--how could they possibly make money on stuff they put exabytes of online for free, and that is streamed at HD much more reliably than even YOUTUBE?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  Porn streams better than youtube.  They say 50% of the internet traffic. I had this idea of making a tube that plays normal videos split screen with porn so you could stream it better than youtube and their damn buffering problems.
