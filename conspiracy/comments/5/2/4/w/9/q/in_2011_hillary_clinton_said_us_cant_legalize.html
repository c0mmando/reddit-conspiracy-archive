        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Democracy Now article in 2001 entitled, <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/2/8/headlines/hilary_clinton_says_us_cant_legalize_drugs_because_there_is_too_much_money_in_it">Hillary Clinton Says U.S. Can’t Legalize Drugs Because There is “Too Much Money in It”</a> explains Hillary&#39;s out-of-touch position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton argued the United States cannot legalize drugs because there is “too much money in it.” Clinton went on to say, “You can legalize small amounts for possession, <strong><em>but those who are making so much money selling, they have to be stopped.</em></strong>” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who, Mz Clinton, do you think is &#39;making so much money selling&#39;?    (We know the answer)</p>

<p>She would have us believe that <em>she</em>, who has been in politics for all her adult life from the time of her legal management of Watergate<sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/06/the-zombie-claim-that-hillary-clinton-was-fired-during-the-watergate-inquiry/">[1]</a><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/07/06/forty-three-years-after-watergate-hillary-clinton-is-new-richard-nixon.html">[2]</a></sup> to Sentator to Secretary of State to political candidate, and who during which time has been herself a very close political and social ally with Henry Kissinger<sup><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/hillary-clinton-kissinger-vacation-dominican-republic-de-la-renta">[3]</a><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/hillary-clinton-kissinger-vacation-dominican-republic-de-la-renta">[4]</a><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-henry-clintons-relationship-kissinger/story?id=39195203">[5]</a>,</sup> could not possibly be aware of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYtcaFdFTzA">Henry &quot;Narcotics Emperor&quot; Kissinger</a>&#39;s drug trafficking activities<sup><a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1990/eirv17n04-19900119/eirv17n04-19900119_030-what_henry_kissinger_doesnt_want.pdf">[6]</a><a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1989/eirv16n26-19890623/eirv16n26-19890623_034-kissingers_china_card_the_drug_c.pdf">[7]</a><a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Drug_War/DOPE_INC_part1.html">[8]</a><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/indefensible-kissinger-102123_Page2.html">[9]</a>.</sup>   That somehow she&#39;s the <strong><em>ultimate political cuckhold</em></strong>, oblivious to wrongdoing in her immediate circle.  Is this a strategy that&#39;s supposed to work?  I mean really, does she think we&#39;re that stupid?</p>

<p>Or...gulible?  Or forgetful?  Or naive?  </p>

<p>Yes.  To all the above.  Hillary Clinton thinks you&#39;re a dipshit moron half baked reject.  And you are, if you buy this cuckhold story.</p>

<p>Some of you might argue that it&#39;s possible she really does think Kissinger is a good man and that all those facts about him are lies, somehow, even though they are numerous, mountainous in fact,  longstanding, well-sourced and very well known.  It&#39;s possible she&#39;s still oblivious, they say. </p>

<p>In which case ask yourselves: if she missed all the above and truly is a political cuckhold, is she fit to lead?  I mean if she doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on within her own circle of friends?</p>

<p>No, in my mind, Clinton is not some oblivious innocent.  She&#39;s a smart lady and a vicious viper.  It&#39;s pretty clear to us here that Clinton is a liar, this is just more fuel for the fire.  But in this case it&#39;s a hateful kind of infuriating faux-coyness that is so very palpable I want to manisfest it in front of me only to punch it to death.  Lacking such conjuration abilities, I&#39;ve written this instead.</p>

<p>Ultimately we&#39;re left choosing if Hillary is a liar, or if she&#39;s an idiot.  Neither looks good for her.  But she&#39;ll be our next president.  </p>

<p><del>Unless we&#39;re lucky and she chokes on one of her tongue-eggs disguising itself as a cough drop.</del>  (too mean.  I need to be nicer)</p>

There have been several spooks to speak out; as well as police investigators that were cuckholded,  finding out after-the-fact of being frozen out, stonewalled by their chiefs and reassigned that they were in fact investigating spooks themselves, when they thought they were tracking drug mafia.

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, it&#39;s not just wars and stuff that are supported by drugs.  It&#39;s hollywood too.  And porn.  Porn is a loss leader--how could they possibly make money on stuff they put exabytes of online for free, and that is streamed at HD much more reliably than even YOUTUBE?</p>

<p>Yes.  Porn streams better than youtube.  They say 50% of the internet traffic. I had this idea of making a tube that plays normal videos split screen with porn so you could stream it better than youtube and their damn buffering problems.  </p>
