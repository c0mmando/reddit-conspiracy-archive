    <div class="md"><p>They tried to initiate war with Iran almost immediately after the Iraq fiasco by claiming that they were pursuing nuclear weapons, but they failed to garner the public support for conflict with Iran after the whole WMD lie - choosing a similar lie of &quot;Iran is now trying to obtain nuclear weapons&quot; probably did not help their cause.</p>

<p>Over the past decade or so the US (and Israel) have tried many times to get public support for open conflict with Iran but have failed each and every time to spark fear similar to the Iraqi WMD fear. So instead, they decided to choose the &quot;next best&quot; route - sanctions, shutting Iran out of the global markets and removing their ability and right to use SWIFT (the underlying system used across the world for payments between countries and banks).</p>

<p>More recently, these sanctions have been lifted (well, most of them) and Iran is now able to participate in the markets - most notably the oil market. However, this does not mean that the warhawks in US government (as well as other Western governments such as my own here in the UK) have failed and are stopping their efforts to get to war with Iran. Quite the opposite in-fact. </p>

<p>Part of the reason for the conflict in Syria (essentially started by SA, and by extension Washington, backed terrorists) was that the Syrian government is an ally of Iran and the thinking was that by overthrowing Assad and trying to install yet another puppet regime, they could start a conflict with Iran via this proxy war. Again, this has largely failed as Assad remains; personally, I don&#39;t believe that the US and allies thought that Russia would go to the lengths it has to keep Assad in place, they got blindsided in this case and utterly out-maneuvered by Russia on the geopolitical chessboard. </p>

<p>But, again, despite these continual failures of TPTB to get to war with Iran, they will not stop trying. We see evidence of their persistence in the media lately with mainstream outlets pushing anti-Iranian sentiment via the whole &quot;ransom money&quot; debacle, several cases of US ships supposedly being harassed by Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz and also a story pushed a few weeks ago about &quot;German intelligence that Iran was still pursuing nuclear weapons&quot; that failed to gain traction and was forgotten about (at least for now). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they take too long the Dynamics of the geopolitics will change enough to alter it. I don&#39;t have a clue what those changes might be though. Like if Iran suddenly decided to be friendly with the Western world, set up banking and the whole bit, it would mean no reason to attack them. Trouble is didn&#39;t Libya  pretty much do that and it still didn&#39;t work? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Irony is that everyone thinks Iran&#39;s WMD threat is nuclear, but that really doesn&#39;t matter in a world where Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, and India are nuclear powers. The WMD of concern to Washington is Iran&#39;s dollar reserves, which they no longer need, and must be paid interest to hold. Only the interest payments can&#39;t be called that, and must be called something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I was TPTB I wouldn&#39;t &#39;take out&#39; Iran.  I&#39;ve got a great client state in the Saudi&#39;s. They pump oil for me and buy my weapons. They NEED an adversary to keep them worried, to keep needing my protection and weapons. Israel isn&#39;t that threatening anymore.</p>

<p>Further I want to build an anti-ballistic missile system around the world so that I can dominate even countries with nuclear weapons. I NEED a reason to do that. I need a religious leadership that is willing to be a little crazy and resort to supporting terrorists.</p>

<p>I could go on but to be honest, Israel wanted to take out Iran very, very badly. The US stopped that plan. It simply isn&#39;t in US interests to &#39;take out&#39; Iran.</p>
