       What do the American people, as well as the wider world population do? Who gets held accountable, and what impact does it have on the government at the time?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Brit I'm intrigued to know if this has been discussed anywhere, and what conclusions have been drawn. Sorry if this has cropped up previously but it's something that I've always wondered.

       The American people will never address 9/11 head on. We will actively cover our eyes &amp; ears in order to not see or hear, just as we do with our governments crimes against humanity on a global scale, just as we do with the collective wealth of millions of families being stolen nation wide, just as we do with the unconstitutional war on drugs, with the NDAA, police militarization, quantitative easing, and our broken

       This is not a sound plan. The first step is identification. Obviously there are many perpetrators involved. We only want the head of the snake brought to justice as going after henchmen would be a waste of resources.

       After I replied to you I realized that the most likely answer would be something along the lines of the French revolution. Lots of death, more on citizen side, but some officials, too. In the end, the Royal Family would remain and get back to their business of despotism and control. I've often marveled that the US independence was largely a function of isolation and thought to myself that the next time a "revolution" is likely would be on Mars, or the Moon, or somewhere else where the fomenters would have physical isolation working in their favor. And of course you'd have the equivalent of Alexander Hamilton immediately begin working from the inside the restore and consolidate the power of the elite. And now I'm sure I've said too much :\

       French Revolution style perhaps, I'd like to see a complete purge of our congress, Supreme Court, and come November, our executive branch. And a massive reduction in income for political servants. Two term limits on congressmen and senators, and 5 years for justices. I suppose this is wishful thinking.

       I'm sad to say that americans are so cowed and stupid now, that nothing will get them off their fat asses, especially if they've got the latest iphone.  Only a small minority would rise up, but it would be put down like Kent state in no time.

       They'd never sign out of Facebook long enough to take back their country. They'd read about their brothers and sisters fighting and dying for what's right, and side with the police and government every time.
Take for example a Cherokee employee of mine. Someone mentioned the pipeline debacle, and he said "those protestors are just causing a ruckus"
I proceeded to lay it all on the line and explain what's going on. You're a Native American, this may not be your tribe but they are your people, I'm not Indian but they are my people because they are fighting for what's right, why do you think they're just causing trouble?

       We have militants in communities across the country. These are the groups often labeled as gun nuts and the tea party. The moment the second amendment is outright attacked you will these groups occupy government installations en masse. They are a new minority, citizens and veterans who know there is a negative trend in our culture.

       MSM were active participants in 9/11.

       CNN had a camera setup and operating and filming the WTC1 burning less than three minutes after the first
       <em>

       impacted WTC1. 8:46:xx and 8:49:xx, something like 2m50s.

       how long does it take to get a camera crew up onto a rooftop, setup the equipment and cabling into the stations feed, convince the execs to interrupt the normal schedule, broadcast to the world.

       We know who they are.  We've known for years.  It starts with people who actively worked on initiating cog:  rummsfeld and cheney.  And branches out to everyone who took actions that cleared the way for our military to fail on 911; including those involved in coverup: FEMA guiliani and NIST, the blue ribbon team etc, Harley guy and those involved in active confabulation in the media

       The thing is, a perception of "authority" would do well for this type of thing. There would be much resistance from the (ignorant) populace if people with no perceived authority suddenly start detaining high-profile authoritative figures. They would be cast off as subversives and enemies of the state. It would be much easier to garner support from the (ignorant) populace against an action like that. With "legitimate" authority given, instead of "radicals held prisoner several high-ranking officials in the U.S. government", it would turn into "Officials detained several high-ranking suspects in the U.S. government".

       Just my opinion, but it looks like they're running the JFK playbook on 9/11. Discredit anything other than the official narrative. Rely on cognitive dissonance as much as possible. Put out disinformation to drown out the real information coming out. Deny everything until those responsible have all died of old age... and are six feet beyond the reach of justice.

       revenge can be decades down the line. the Jews (of Venice) organized the sacking of Constantinople nearly a thousand years after the genocide of Palestine by the Byzantines in the first few centuries.

       There is an internal war happening behind the scenes.  Many elements of the global ruling cabal are being removed or are already gone.  The son is dead.  The simulation is over.  Now we may learn and heal each in our own time. We all feel something incredible is about to happen. Are you ready?

       It will probably take another government entirely to help the Americans from our corrupt leaders. We as a whole are still mostly brainwashed by the event. Hence here we are 15 years later and the minority of us who aren't deceived are still stuck in conspiracy land.

       If it actually does get publically revealed in this decade, there would be a LOT of pissed of people using their 2nd amendment rights.

       However, if it were over 50 years from now, people will shrug their shoulders and say, "Typical US government." The Kennedy assassination has basically been debunked as to suggest there was an inside job of some kind, yet no one today will do anything about it because those key players are already dead.

       The thing is, a perception of "authority" would do well for this type of thing. There would be much resistance from the (ignorant) populace if people with no perceived authority suddenly start detaining high-profile authoritative figures. They would be cast off as subversives and enemies of the state. It would be much easier to garner support from the (ignorant) populace against an action like that. With "legitimate" authority given, instead of "radicals held prisoner several high-ranking officials in the U.S. government", it would turn into "Officials detained several high-ranking suspects in the U.S. government".
