<p>Enough is enough. These clowns are secretive and they hold our tax dollars and our technology. Basically, a few people are living like gods thanks to 300 million slaves. </p>

<p>They even killed their own people in 9-11 and millions across the Middle East and for what? Nothing more than more money and power for themselves. As if a bank account with 50 billion wasn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>For Gods sake Willie, there&#39;s enough to go around but not when it&#39;s all hoarded by government/elite. We can all live well but not with these corrupt policies. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally time to replace corrupted minds with service orientated systems that serve the people. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Before Bacon&#39;s Rebellion we certainly have distinctions made between blacks and whites, and we certainly have attitudes on the part of whites and presumably on the part of blacks where they differentiate themselves and where they probably think each is superior to the other.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we see them behaving pretty much the same way. Some numbers of people of African descent have moved into the land owning class, are sometimes owning the servants, are connected with churches, are cognizant of the legal system and so on.</p>

<p>And of course substantial numbers of people of European descent are caught in a system of coerced labor called indentured servitude. And indentured servants, whether they are black or white, are pretty much treated the same way as slaves. Very badly.</p>

<p>Bacon&#39;s Rebellion changes that, and what seems to be crucial in changing that is the consolidation after Bacon&#39;s Rebellion of a planter class. The planters had not been able to control this rowdy labor force of servants and slaves. But soon after Bacon&#39;s Rebellion they increasingly distinguish between people of African descent and people of European descent. They enact laws which say that people of African descent are hereditary slaves. And they increasingly give some power to white independent white farmers and land holders.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to dig up the letters, it&#39;s been ages since I posted about them. Not having much luck tho. Will keep trying. </p>

<p>Not exactly what would happen but it&#39;s what I think of when we try to get everyone to agree. Differing views are part of society, and when they come together out of necessity, more often then not a third party gets hurt. Yes! Something in the government needs to change, but how we build a government that views all beliefs equally? That is the real challenge that is at the core of our issues. Too many differing opinions trying to run one nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most effective method used to stop us from rising up is keeping our minimum wage a &#39;slave wage&#39;. Many of us can&#39;t take any time off of work to even begin starting such a revolution as we barely have enough money to eat, let alone travel.</p>

<p>As far as BLM goes, personally, I believe it to be a very legitimate movement against police violence towards minorities, but it&#39;s used as a wedge issue, exactly like you describe, by the media. Maybe working with an established movement like this, convincing the leaders that police violence against the poor is a bigger issue, since <a href="http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/95-police-killings-2015-occurred-neighborhoods-incomes-under-100000">95% of Police Killings in 2015 Occurred in Neighborhoods With Incomes Under $100,000</a>, stemming from the oligarchy, and all banding together with one focused cause: to seize the means of production from these corporations and pry them out of the public sector.</p>

<p>These things may seem unrelated, but police violence comes from police militarization and hostile policy like the War on Drugs, both of which make corporations (Lockheed Martin and big pharma respectively, in these examples) tons of money. If we&#39;re able to get private interests out of the government (campaign donations, for example), we can get our elections back, and our representatives will actually represent <em>us</em>, who will then be able to make regulatory laws stronger. It&#39;s these regulatory bodies that will be tough to maintain, but if we enacted laws that stop employees or ex-employees of corporations from serving on them, make all regulators&#39; finances completely public, investigate any fishy influxes of money, and make bribery a crime punishable by nothing less than life in prison, for both the giver and receiver, <em>maybe</em> we could get our country back. For a little while, at least.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my current, totally unprofessional, opinion. Though I&#39;m more than open to suggestions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont believe the BLM movement is legitimate at all. Especially cause of Sorros donations. I think its funded chaos. The police violence issue is something thats making me think.</p>

<p>Why? The data actually doesnt actually prove police are more violent. It doesnt show how many people are in gangs, armed robberies, drive-by shootings, etc that occure in those areas. People making over 100000 are (imho) probably not engaged in that activity as far as I know.  I get it, I wouldnt go against the violent gang types without a big upper hand. So im not impressed with the so called data. But I live in a shithole so maybe Im closer to the reality, or my own thoughts about it.</p>

<p>Has anyone actually wondered WHO wants police outcast, demonized, or untrusted? Maybe its a move for a FED police force or something. I dont think its joe blow public making the waves against the cops. I think they dont want people from your neighborhood being cops, and implement and insert a Fed force. Or something. I think ill look into this theory a little more. Its weird cause we know the media is controlled and really pushes alot of this issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard people saying that police violence towards minorities is not greater than that towards whites, but have not seen any data to support this claim. It&#39;s tough because the only official statistics are those provided by the FBI, which precincts report their data <em>voluntarily</em>, such is clearly not a good representation. So, those databases that do exist are created by journalists or non profits and they don&#39;t go back very far. For example, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database">The Guardian has data</a> counted &quot;with traditional police reports and witness statements, by monitoring regional news outlets, research groups, and open source reporting projects such as the websites <a href="http://www.fatalencounters.org/">Fatal Encounters</a> and <a href="http://killedbypolice.net/">Killed by Police</a>.&quot; Both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis">The Guardian</a> and the <a href="http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">&quot;Mapping Police Violence&quot;</a> project have found that <strong>an unarmed minority is about 3x as likely to be killed by the police as an unarmed white person</strong>. Also referenced is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEGQ3eAFKpFBVq1k2mZIy5mBPxC6nBTJHzuSWtZQSVw/edit#gid=1144428085">U.S. Police Shootings Database</a> and <a href="http://killedbypolice.net/">Killed by Police</a>, coupled with Fatal Encounters, FiveThirtyEight called these the three largest, most comprehensive and impartial croudsourced databases on police killings in the country. If you have another source, please let me know, but if not, this data stands as the best we&#39;ve got to go on.</p>

<p>Point being that this was regarding unarmed people, which should have nothing to do with the &quot;violent gang types&quot;. I think the militarization of local police is <a href="http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/06-2013/preparing_officers_for_a_community_oriented_department.asp">very real</a>, and is particularly dangerous in regards to training, as there&#39;s far too much focus on shooting and not de-escalation. The more a precinct looks and acts like an occupying force, the worse off it is for everyone. Keeping in mind your theory, the last source is a federal site, but if their goal is to take over local precincts, bad mouthing militarization would not be the way to go.</p>

<p>Regardless of all of this, what I was really looking for was thoughts on how to effectively get our country back from the rampant corruption. Mine was more about seizing the means of production.</p>

It&#39;s just too big, no one would stand for it (physical vs. digital presence are very different), and what would the corporations get out of it? We&#39;re already keeping ourselves busy buying the newest smartphone and staring at it, hoping we won&#39;t be noticed on the street. Anything physically invasive like that would decrease sales on most fronts.</p>

<p>Depends on your definition of &quot;greater&quot;</p>

<p>By numbers, whites are killed more than blacks by police</p>

<p>By demographic percentages, blacks are at greater risk than whites</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s never mentioned is how over 90% of people killed by police are male</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely right in all accounts. I suppose the male thing is that police officers trend to feel not threatened by males? Males <em>tend</em> to be more physically powerful, and account for something like 80% of violent crimes in the US. Do you have other thoughts on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What percentage of crime is committed by minorities? There are studies showing even black cops are more likely to fire their weapons at suspicious looking black males. I don&#39;t think the majority of police are &quot;out to get&quot; any specific ethnicity. They merely do their job, and adapt to survive. I treat people the way they deserve to be treated. I don&#39;t care what color you are, only about your actions. Being a specific color does not mean it is OK to commit crimes or run from the police. We should all be held accountable for our actions, it is the only way for the human RACE to advance together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed that anyone should be allowed to act criminally, civilian or police. I also never claimed that anyone is &quot;out to get&quot; anyone. I think that this bias in police violence is clearly an issue (looking at the data we have), and while there&#39;s a certain percentage of cops that are acting purposefully malicious, I think the vast majority of this is due to an unconscious bias. Being unconscious, the only way to overcome it is through training. The best way, I think, would be training that <em>strongly</em> downplays the use of force and <em>strongly</em> emphasizes de-escalate techniques. This way everyone&#39;s biases (regardless of what they are) become less of an issue across the board. If you read the last article I linked in my previous comment, the DOJ has seen police training becoming increasingly focused on using a weapon, and I think that is what needs to be remedied.</p>

<p>There are probably other, better ways to fix this, but this isn&#39;t my field. We need the DOJ to enact proper training techniques developed by professional sociologists and psychologists based off of well established science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s funny how you discount the data then attempt to use it, saying that you can&#39;t find it. the data shows that when the suspects are armed, that more often whites are killed.
also when it comes to being unarmed, most of those times the people were killed attempting to grab a police officers gun. 
This kind of talk divides us, cherry picking stats to fit a narratice. It isn&#39;t a race issue, it&#39;s an issue where the police, certain members of the populace and poor protocols are to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea what your first sentence means. None of this data is cherry picked, it&#39;s all unarmed civilians that have been killed by police, unarmed because if it was everyone killed by police, people would complain that it&#39;s including those threatening to kill the cops with a gun. Until you have any data to back up the bold claims you&#39;re making, I would say please don&#39;t make baseless statements. And I agree that this is a failure in protocol, training protocol, to be specific.</p>

<p>Regardless, my original comment expressed the same idea that, seeing as 95% of police violence is against the poor, banding together with movements that protest racial inequality, maybe we could create a huge movement, of every color, fighting with the one clear goal of taking our country back from the people we should <em>all</em> be angry at: the robber barons that have us and our country by the balls.</p>

<p>I think we agree on a lot of this, but my main point here is that it&#39;s a classiest issue turned into a race issue and on both sides an us versus them mentality (civilians vs cops) where it shouldn&#39;t be. Police are a necessity but shouldn&#39;t be used as an internal military presence as they so often are. We (as a people) should look at shootings on a case by case basis and not defend those who are trying to kill cops because of their skin color . I&#39;m not accusing you, just making a blanket statemenr.</p>

That&#39;s basically the point I was making, that if we could ask all factions of protestors, protesting against systemic racism against various groups regarding various systems (which is definitely an issue), to put that temporarily aside and all come together under the issue of being oppressed as a group because of our income, maybe we could take this country back together.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the division was there.  BLM is just shining a light on it.  </p>

<p>That may be a bit knit picky but I think it&#39;s important to direct conversations toward remembering that forces in the past created that division and then they are maintaining it (with our help -to varying degrees depending on the person).  </p>

<p>Where BLM faulters is some of their members&#39; lack of desire to be more specific than &quot;white people&quot; as the creators and maintainers of The Divide.   </p>

<p>This is exactly what the architects of that divide want.  Allow them to blend in to a sea of white.  (Even convince that sea that they should help with maintaining the divide: Trump&#39;s racist factions)  </p>

<p>We need to get very specific in the practice of blaming.  And we need to get accurate with who we define as the movers and shakers for the oligarchy.  </p>

<p>Once there is specificity then pressure can be applied and reapplied.</p>

<p>Right now the brute force method of just being loud af and getting people&#39;s attention is at least waking ppl up.  But the oligarchy is using that alertness by catching people in their cultural hegemony.  </p>

<p>How we fight cultural hegemony without having our own content creators (TV, internet) that are removed from their control I do not know.  </p>

<p>A brainstorm session would be good. </p>

<p>[Edit] Changed the wording in the second paragraph</p>

<p>...no? In theory that money helps you. The issue is capitalist greed keeping that money away from you. Capitalism is the reason you hate the government.

    <div class="md"><p>Black Lives Matter is smeared by the media and most middle class people, though. This is just a tactic - used again, and again, and again - to turn slightly better off people against oppressed African Americans. This tactic was used with indentured servants (you&#39;ve got it so much better than the slaves!) and poor white land owners. So don&#39;t blame the other people who are protesting.</p>

<p>The real &#39;wedge&#39; issues involve stupid stereotypes like the black welfare queen, the lazy Mexican, the entitled millennial, the &#39;useless&#39; liberal arts graduates, the &#39;feminazi&#39;, the crazy environmental activist, etc. Note - fighting for African American / women&#39;s / LGBT / whatever fair treatment is not a zero sum game where their rights somehow diminish yours, but even on Reddit you would think that&#39;s the case. Additionally, the elite abuse policy stances on things like abortion, birth control, taxes, public schools, healthcare and the minimum wage to make us poor, sick, and incapable of caring for our own kids. Before Black Lives Matter, it was &#39;those stupid millennials&#39; at Occupy Wallstreet. That doesn&#39;t mean they had nothing legitimate to protest.</p>

<p>EDIT: Stop trying to get me to talk about abortion or any other wedge issue. I am saying that issues where there&#39;s agreement are the important ones. Issues of conversation meant to confuse everyone and sidetrack them into debate are what I have a problem with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Further, one&#39;s opinion, honestly, is not going to effect a change in a term or even two terms.</p>

<p>I remember back in 2000 (when I was very apolitical), the liberals then were screaming, &quot;OMG, you can&#39;t even consider George Bush...he&#39;ll appoint Supreme Court justices and overturn <em>Roe!!&quot;</em> </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t care much for either candidate then, but I knew that <strong>if</strong> there was a vacancy, a conservative leaning judge probably would be appointed, but that did not guarantee he would only write pro-life opinions, and further, even if said justice was a rabid, singular minded pro-lifer, it would only matter <strong>if</strong> a case on point was granted certiorari and heard... That&#39;s a lot of hoops. To me, the whole argument was unnecessary panic.</p>

<p>But they did it again in 2012. You had an amazing bipartisan grass roots movement for Ron Paul, running on a lot of principles of Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign (which turned out to be a masterful swindle). Ron Paul wanted out of the interventionist wars, he wanted to sever wall street and federal government ties, ending the Fed, end bailouts, end quantitative easing, promote transparency,  support whistleblowers, etc. It was simply a candidate with integrity who was not going to play the game in Washington.</p>

<p>But in interviews, when asked about his abortion stance, he answered honestly and said he was pro-life, <strong>but</strong> that <em>this view was personal and he didn&#39;t believe in influencing policy based on his personal views</em> [He did however believe that— like gay marriage (and following the doctrine of federalism)— that states should decide for themselves.]</p>

<p>That one particular view turned every liberal against him (and of course later, there were the so-called racist newsletters which were so distorted by the media), not to mention the fact that countless primaries were stolen from him... </p>

<p>But my point is...who the fuck cares about someone&#39;s pro-life life opinion, especially when surveillance and the police state, and the TPP, and innumerable other issues are of more importance. And anyway, such a view almost certainly will not upset the current policy in place with <em>Roe.</em> </p>

<p>Well, ok, but did you look up what he actually <em>did?</em> Or was his lip service enough? Because what he did was attempt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctity_of_Life_Act">pass legislation to ban abortion at the Federal level</a> <em>every single year</em> he served in Congress.</p>

<p>So much for his view being <em>personal</em>; individual choices about the sanctity of life is just a little too much personal freedom for ol&#39; Ron Paul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... This is legal and complicated. I don&#39;t know what he voted for. But the federal government can only do certain things. The President, Congress, Courts, all have enumerated powers. If it&#39;s not specified as something they can do in the Constitution, then they can&#39;t do it. This is why there was a debate in ~1790 over whether or not there should even be a bill of rights.</p>

<p>One one hand, some people wanted it...a list of natural rights guaranteed to everyone. But opponents said, &quot;Why? The Constitution <em>gives</em> power from the people to the federal government, so it follows that anything not given is automatically retained...And further, in 100 years, people might believe that this bill of rights merely enumerates a finite list of rights—at the exclusion of all others.&quot; [And this has pretty much happened.]</p>

<p>They agreed on the Bill of Rights, or Ten Amendments to the Constitution, but only with the following 9th and 10th amendments. These amendments are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IX</p>

<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I know how things have evolved today, and that the Constitution is ignored. Essentially our government is illegal. But Ron Paul can&#39;t vote on a bill to ban abortion at the federal level because the federal government has no rights whatsoever as it pertains to abortion—either in the Constitution or derived from common law. What <em>Roe</em> did was in a very vague and convoluted way bring it under substantive due process stating that a woman could have an abortion...that was the only way at the time to settle that issue. I think the outcome is good (I&#39;m pro-choice), but I think the way it was done was flawed and if you read the opinion, somewhat of a reach.</p>

<p>Compare this to gay marriage... I loved it when fucking Bush was saying that he was going to pass a law prohibiting gay marriage... That&#39;s ludicrous! The federal government has no power whatsoever to say word one about marriage. What finally happened with gay marriage is what should have happened: the federal government just stopped talking about it, and the states were left to decide on their own. Historically, things like marriage and family have always been governed by reach individual state (it&#39;s how most laws should be...as in a laboratory of democracy..the states would ultimately choose the best laws based on another state&#39;s enactment of a law and whether it failed or succeeded...whether the people liked it, whether they complained, etc. It&#39;s like pot laws now...other than fear of the federal drug laws (which are illegal by the way), every state would have already passed laws legalizing pot because of the tax revenue.)</p>

<p>So Ron Paul was not voting to &quot;ban abortion&quot; in any way. He was however trying to proceed the same way that Gay Marriage ultimately resolved itself: take federal hands off of it, let the states decide.</p>

<p>But then of course liberals heard this and immediately thought that every woman was going to be forced to go back to coat hanger abortions in alleyways. But in 2000 or 2005 (in other words in our more enlightened era today) this would not happen. Admittedly. there are still some backwards states in the bible belt who would race to try and pass laws banning abortion. But they would not last. Public policy and common sense would overrule the moronic religious right in time.</p>

<p>Look, I mean, you can look up his record yourself - he <em>regularly</em> voted for bills that would have made abortion illegal at the Federal level, by finding for fetuses a Federal right not to be aborted. He absolutely was voting to ban abortion at the Federal level, which indicates he absolutely believed the Federal government had the Constitutional authority to do so.</p>

<p>Look, you said yourself you don&#39;t know what he voted for. Why don&#39;t you educate yourself on what Ron Paul does, instead of what he says? The theories of government by which he actually tries to govern, instead of what he purports to govern by?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be happy to. He has a huge congressional record and I don&#39;t even know what years or the name of the bill..whether he was the sole sponsor, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only saying that until <em>Roe</em> there was no way the federal government could do anything regarding abortion. With <em>Roe</em> they used medical necessity and legal gymnastics to fit it into a substantive due process right. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede that RP might have been voting to simply remove abortion from the purview of the federal government. If George Bush had brought a Supreme Court Case to place all marriage under the domain of the federal government (which would then allow Congress to pass a law prohibiting gay marriage), it would be the same as someone voting on a bill which <em>removed</em> marriage from being under the authority of the federal government...</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a different goal. Voting to take abortion out of the hands of the federal government so the federal government would have no authority over it is not the same as &quot;banning it&quot;, and banning then would apply to the entire country. The drug laws ban &quot;drugs&quot; at the federal level, so no matter what the states have as their drug laws, the federal laws control and they are illegal. </p>

<p>So if RP was voting to create a law that banned abortion (as a federal statute), it would apply to every state, and that would have been a huge issue that would have been brought up every time he sat down for any interview...it would have been a nightmare to run on such a record.  </p>

<p>RP was far more of a &quot;no law&quot; or &quot;less law&quot; kind of guy as opposed to more laws. So I could see him voting for removing all laws having to do with abortion at the federal level...leaving it up to the states to decide.</p>

<p>All of that is fully in the public record, and I definitely linked it to you as well. You can read the text and explanation of the bills Ron Paul submitted to Congress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m only saying that until Roe there was no way the federal government could do anything regarding abortion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you&#39;re mistaken. For instance, the Federal government could have passed a constitutional amendment banning abortion throughout the country, which could then be ratified by a majority of the states, thereby banning abortion in all of them. That&#39;s the most extreme example - what Ron Paul <em>actually</em> tried to do was backdoor-ban it at the Federal level by finding a constitutional right of <em>individual fetuses</em> not to be aborted, which would have the same effect, because the states cannot restrict your Federal constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll concede that RP might have been voting to simply remove abortion from the purview of the federal government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what you think you&#39;re &quot;conceding&quot; there. I mean I&#39;m directly telling you that&#39;s not the case. Ron Paul&#39;s proposed legislation would not have removed abortion from the purview of the Federal government; it would have <em>banned</em> abortion by requiring the Federal government to prosecute any abortion as the murder of a US citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Voting to take abortion out of the hands of the federal government so the federal government would have no authority over it is not the same as &quot;banning it&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I get that. But that&#39;s not what Ron Paul ever attempted to do. What he repeatedly voted for was a ban on abortion that applied universally within the borders of the United States, and which would have pre-empted state authority of the issue altogether, by the supremacy clause.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if RP was voting to create a law that banned abortion (as a federal statute), it would apply to every state, and that would have been a huge issue that would have been brought up every time he sat down for any interview...it would have been a nightmare to run on such a record.</p>

<p>But if he really was engineering an end around to <em>Roe</em> (and such endeavors were motivated purely on his personal beliefs) then these actions would stand in diametric opposition to his oft-stated philosophy of government: that representatives act on behalf of their constituents, and the federal government should act within the parameters of the Constitution: echoed in his views to end the drug war or require that Congress declare war, etc. In other words, the federal laws and executive power must fall within specifically enumerated authority granted by the Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bill that redefines personhood to conception, has at its core a philosophical debate and not Legal one. I don&#39;t agree with it, but I can see how he could reconcile such a bill with his views as a libertarian.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to read the entire bill, but my guess is that it was a way for him to implement his pro-life views but allow him to sleep at night.</p>

<p>Further, the pro-life perspective, though it&#39;s inherently flawed, is rooted in that person (who subscribes to pro-life) believing that, through some kind of imaginary subjugation <em>they</em> are the voice of the fetus, so they believe that pro-choice rights infringe on them. I agree it&#39;s not a legal argument, and I disagree with it entirely, yet I still empathize (or at least try to) with the way they feel. It&#39;s the way I&#39;d want to be treated.</p>

<p>Sure, but for the explicit and sole purpose of banning abortion. It wouldn&#39;t apply to, say, calculating your age for any legal purpose - your legal age wouldn&#39;t be advanced 9 months to account for the extra time, retroactively, that you had been a person. That indicates that this is just Ron Paul reasoning backwards from the outcome he&#39;d like - a total ban on abortion within the borders of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I mean it does - what&#39;s <em>libertarian</em>, explicitly, about the Federal government determining on behalf of the states when life begins? If the people of California desire to affirm that life begins at birth, for what reason does Ron Paul override that view with his own more restrictive definition?</p>

<p>Well, obviously, because it&#39;s his desire <em>as a social conservative</em> that the people of California not be able to avail themselves of abortions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First regarding, &quot;banning abortion&quot;, I didn&#39;t mean that specific language. A bill redefining when life begins doesn&#39;t address abortion, but it affects it indirectly... And I know he never promoted a bill that sought to regulate abortion <em>directly</em> in any way. I know the manner in which laws prohibiting a certain act or undertaking, or the possession or sale of some item are drafted.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;ll acquiesce and say that RP&#39;s promotion of those bills are not one of his prouder moments. But I still believe that above everything, his integrity is the most important value to him. As such, (i) he promoted a bill redefining when life begins, and not abortion itself, avoiding in form if not substance, a patent legislation of his personal morality, <strong>and</strong>; (ii) <em>probably had the requisite numbers of those in his Texas district in favor of such a bill as he&#39;d want to be sure he was acting on behalf of those who put him in office.</em>   As I suggested, maybe he did these things so he could sleep at night... because he definitely <em>knows</em> better.</p>

<p><strong>But waaaiiit just a bit on your conclusion that he&#39;s a social conservative.</strong> He may have his view on pro-life... But come on, <strong>there is no fucking way I am putting him in the same Venn diagram circle with Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann,</strong> and any other Republican (from 2012) I can think of. He had a &quot;hands off&quot; policy on gay marriage (which is the current working policy) and he wanted to end the war on drugs. </p>

<p>Do you know of other social issues in which his leaning was something other than his libertarian ideology? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The effect is obviously direct, and obviously the intent of the legislation. No one cares about the definition of the &quot;beginning of life&quot; except those opposed to abortion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I know he never promoted a bill that sought to regulate abortion directly in any way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean except for the bills I keep showing you. Additionally, Paul voted in favor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act">Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act</a>, which, in section 3 (&quot;PROHIBITION ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS&quot;), enacted:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 1531. Partial-birth abortions prohibited</p>

<p>``(a) Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, again, you&#39;re completely mistaken - Paul <em>has</em>, on regular occasions, supported and voted for bills that directly prohibit abortions at the Federal level. I don&#39;t know what else I have to show you to prove to you that this is <em>not</em> an issue that Paul &quot;leaves to the states.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But waaaiiit just a bit on your conclusion that he&#39;s a social conservative. He may have his view on pro-life... But come on, there is no fucking way I am putting him in the same Venn diagram circle with Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and any other Republican (from 2012) I can think of. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, sure. Uniquely, he&#39;s the only southern conservative Republican trying to hoodwink you into thinking he&#39;s some kind of Republi-tarian who opposes abortion but won&#39;t vote on that basis. The problem I&#39;m trying to get across to you is, all the evidence you have from that comes from Ron Paul telling you it&#39;s true. But it isn&#39;t. He just wants you to think that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had a &quot;hands off&quot; policy on gay marriage (which is the current working policy) and he wanted to end the war on drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only the second of those is true. Paul was a supporter of the Defense of Marriage Act and co-sponsor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Protection_Act">Marriage Protection Act</a> which would prohibit any Federal court from hearing challenge to the DOMA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my mind the <em>biggest</em> social issue is the unbelievably costly and harmful War on Drugs™ ...and on the political side of things, I rank surveillance, the police state, the monetary policy and the Fed, the trillions spent on wars, and the military-industrial (Wall Street) -intelligence complex (essentially the reason why Occupy arose). </p>

<p>From everything you&#39;ve told me and that I&#39;ve read today, I am more acutely aware of Ron Paul&#39;s politics as a representative. I&#39;m disappointed in Paul and that he would sponsor the Marriage Protection Act— an Act that would have prevented federal courts from interpreting DOMA (before it was struck down).  I give you credit for enlightening me...you have certainly altered my opinion about Paul on these issues. I sincerely mean that.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all of that, when you balance out the bad from the good, there was still no better candidate than him in 2012. I voted for Obama, and he lied about virtually everything he campaigned for (transparency, whistleblowers, slashing military budget, etc). Paul had the Republican nomination stolen from him, as a follower I saw every media outlet ignore him, and the Establishment Republican party insert Mitt Romney. I couldn&#39;t stand Romney, but Obama had himself only given lip service to everything he supposedly was for. I didn&#39;t vote in 2012....I couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Four years later things are worse. If you hang out in this sub you know they are. </p>

<p>Ron Paul is not relevant any more, and I suppose the only reason I put effort into defending him today (though I was wrong about some things) is because I brought him up above as a viable candidate for president in 2012. I&#39;ll admit he&#39;s not as libertarian as he professes, and he is conservative on some social issues, but despite that, he was better than any Republican candidate, and a better candidate than Obama, who had shown for four years that he could do the opposite of what he campaigned for in 2008.</p>

<p>I mean they&#39;re not. Not by anything objective we can measure. I don&#39;t anticipate convincing you, but the reason I ever click on a link to r/conspiracy is to read a bunch of 13-year-olds try to reconcile their inchoate feelings of rage and powerlessness and desire to be special and important with the world as it&#39;s presented to them by the media, and by the alt-media, and the alt-alt-media, all with a vested interest in selling them something.</p>

<p>But the truth is that things are <em>not</em> worse. That&#39;s scientific fact, if you recognize science. And nothing happens in this subreddit except what conspiracy the<em>rists are always doing, which is attempting to explain the world in some other way than the most obvious - that the world is just what happens when you mix up a lot of basically good but human people and a small number of sociopaths and unevenly distribute them in the very thin layer between rock and space, in the places where it&#39;s not too wet and not too dry. That the problems of the world are *real problems</em> and it takes the best humanity has to offer to even make microscopic progress on the important stuff, and since we&#39;re <em>rarely</em> the best, or even at <em>our</em> best, things don&#39;t get better very quickly. And then it just takes one idiot, or one true villian, to really cock things up. And the story that the world is controlled by a small number of powerful evil-doers is just that, a <em>story</em>, a story mental children tell themselves because the notion that the world is someone&#39;s evil vision and they themselves are the heroes who will eventually do something about it is still less scarier than the truth that <em>nobody&#39;s</em> really in charge, and this world is what it looks like even <em>when</em> our institutions are run by decent and honest people (which, overwhelmingly, they are.)</p>

<p>I mean I don&#39;t even think <em>Ron Paul</em> is a bad guy, even after the stuff I&#39;ve said about him; I think he&#39;s just got a very different view of things than I do, or ever will, and even his dishonesty could be explained as the act of a basically good person who believes in something feeling like he&#39;s running out of time to achieve it, and starting to take shortcuts.</p>

<p>None of that&#39;s meant to talk you into support for Obama. It&#39;s meant to talk you <em>out</em> of pinning all your hopes on the next charismatic leader. Because the world isn&#39;t <em>helped</em> by leaders. Believe it or not, it&#39;s helped by committees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just charisma that draws me. I was out of college in the early 1990s, and things weren&#39;t bad. I went to law school and became an attorney, and made a good amount of money and then invested in commercial real estate. I did well, sold some but wasn&#39;t on top of everything in the mortgage market (have you seen &quot;The Big Short&quot;?), and lost a good deal of it. I&#39;m working my way back, but a lot has changed since I graduated law school.</p>

<p>During the 1990s (while in law school) the law and the constitution <em>were</em> still applicable. I may be an atheist, but I believed in a certain level of predictable stability with the rules of government, and the rules that I expected the government to heed. </p>

<p>Then 9/11: And the day they passed the Patriot Act, I brought it up to everyone that that was not how government worked. But since 9/11, everything has changed, and every year, things have gotten worse.</p>

<p>We as a nation were maybe two trillion in debt in 2000 (I can&#39;t even remember). As I said above, when Bush was running I was apolitical. <strong>But after 9/11, I became very interested in government because I was appalled at the audacity of that administration.</strong> After the Patriot Act, and Iraq..Then Obama and his crushing of whistleblowers, and invoking state secrets bullshit. It&#39;s wrong. And it&#39;s not how the game was played before 9/11. [I&#39;m sure that the there was some illegal surveillance before 9/11, but the government worried about getting caught doing it.]</p>

<p>I did take solace in Obama&#39;s words in 2008. Then in 2012, the same with Ron Paul. But remember above where I compared them? I said that Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign had similar promises as Ron Paul? That&#39;s because they did...it wasn&#39;t charisma, it was respect for constitutional authority, Obama gave it lip service, but I believe that RP with a 25 year record (which I checked for consistency but not pro-life or gay marriage bills).  And I liked what they both said when they did  because I wanted the rules back in place. Back as they were when the government was worried about getting caught surveilling you without a proper warrant, back when there was fucking due process. Sure, the 4th amendment had eroded a bit before 9/11—with RICO and other overreaching laws, but since 9/11, the rules are gone. It&#39;s gotten dramatically worse.</p>

<p>I mean fuck, there may be some inchoate whiny people in this sub, but I am not whining because I can&#39;t make sense out of disorder. I am upset because I witnessed the semblence of order we once had. Go explore for yourself. I often tell people to download or cue up David Fincher&#39;s <em>Se7en.</em> there is a scene where Morgan Freeman is talking about getting library book info about their killer from &quot;people he knows&quot;, (and I know such things took place, but it was not talked about, it wasn&#39;t done with impunity as it is today). Then after Morgan Freeman&#39;s character suggests this, watch Brad Pitt&#39;s character&#39;s reaction. He goes off on him for even suggesting they do something like that. Watch that scene today and it seems quaint, like the &quot;olden days&quot;, but it was 20 years ago! If you think the world under a handful of sociopaths in 1995 is not much different than the same world under a different handful of sociopaths now, you are blind. It&#39;s night and day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I did review the sanctity of life acts. And it doesn&#39;t speak to abortion, but it does attempt to redefine legal personhood, which then would be protected simply by federal murder statutes (which as an aside, aren&#39;t exactly constitutional either, but no one complains...it&#39;s just that no one envisioned &quot;federal police&quot; 240 years ago, and given all 50 states handle criminal law, the federal government doesn&#39;t need to).</p>

<p>I do vaguely remember these. While I am not in favor of them, he is a representative. I would hope that he had the support of his constituents at least.</p>

<p>But the difference is, and my apologies because I wasn&#39;t thinking this through because there is a difference. Just like I said above where he believes that only Congress is authorized to declare war, he was a strong proponent of the separation of powers. You can believe what you want, but the executive branch—at least  constitutionally defined—is not the legislative branch. The executive branch only has a say in the legislative process through his veto power...and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>What I forgot to consider above was that he was a representative on one hand, and drafting and passing laws (pursuant to the will of his constituents) is the job of the House. </p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t second guess you, but I&#39;m going to predict that you will say that he&#39;d somehow steamroll his &quot;sanctity of life&quot; bill through Congress as president. But how? It never got passed when he was a representative, so how would he possibly get it passed as president, especially when he is such a strict constitutionalist? He  didn&#39;t even have his party backing him (I don&#39;t know how much these bills lost by, but it was likely 60% republicans, and a few straggler democrats). </p>

<p>So, I was wrongfully invoking hyperbole above because he was pushing a bill that redefined when life began, which obviously then would make the fetus protected as a person. So you were essentially right. [Although, you kept using the phrase &quot;banning abortion&quot;, and I knew of no bills that had any such language. ]</p>

<p>I am pro-choice and would have been upset if those bills passed...But had he become president, he had stated that his priorities...what concerned him...were things like surveillance, the Federal Reserve, secrecy, and a litany of other issues. His followers would have been livid if, as president, he somehow tried to backdoor through Congress a law that nullified <em>Roe.</em>  Why? Because doing something like that goes against everything he stands for...which is the Constitution.</p>

<p>But I apologize for not recalling those &quot;sanctity of life&quot; bills, and for drawing this discussion out further than necessary.</p>

<p>I mean, ok, but Ron Paul is (was) a legislator in the legislative branch. So I don&#39;t see the relevance of this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m not speaking to this point at all. It&#39;s not relevant what he <em>would</em> do in an office he&#39;ll never hold. It&#39;s sufficient to demonstrate the phoniness of his &quot;libertarianism&quot; merely by demonstrating what he <em>did</em> do as a sitting US Representative - attempt to legislate his socially conservative views on every American, consistently, every year he served in the House.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although, you kept using the phrase &quot;banning abortion&quot;, and I knew of no bills that had any such language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No (well, few if any) bill that bans something uses the phrase &quot;X is now banned.&quot; &quot;Banned&quot; is just a way that we describe the prohibition of an act, or possession of an item, by force of law or other means. Certainly a law that has the <em>effect</em> of it being unlawful to obtain an abortion is a law that can be described as &quot;banning abortion.&quot;</p>

<p>As you say, the laws were proposed as the <em>Sanctity of Life</em> acts. In your view, is it consistent with libertarianism for Congress to take an official stance, and enforce by law, what Americans are to hold <em>sacred</em>? I don&#39;t see how it can be, or how that bill can be viewed as anything but an attempt by Ron Paul to hold <em>all Americans</em> (since it would apply anywhere within the borders of the US) to his own individual notion of religious sanctity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because doing something like that goes against everything he stands for...which is the Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he doesn&#39;t stand for it. That&#39;s my point. We can judge what he stands for by his activity as a legislator rather than by what he merely pays lip service to. And that activity as a legislator betrays him as someone who believes the Federal government is a tool to enforce his social views on Americans. Anything he <em>says</em> he believes about Constitutional limits on Federal power is merely an attempt to mislead people and gain their support. That&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you, ignore what he <em>says</em> he believes about Federal power and the libertarian view, and look at what he <em>acts like</em> he believes about Federal power.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care about of abortions but this shows a pretty big lack of perspective.</p>

<p>If you literally think abortion is murder (right or wrong) would that seem inconsequential? </p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t think abortion itself a big deal the definition of the liberty in a 14th Amendment context is (or should be), which is where the Constitutional issue stems from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get this. When you think about actual murder, callous people ending the lives of others for a bit of money or some other convenience, do you think &quot;oh well, who am I to judge, I steal a candy bar once in a while&quot; or do you think that should be illegal? Even for Christians the idea that the slightest thing is exactly as bad as murdering children is not remotely ubiquitous, in Catholicism for example they have &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;venial&quot; sins where something like being jealous of your neighbors wife is forgivable but murdering a child is a ticket straight to hell.</p>

<p>For any reasonable Christian it&#39;s not about judging others, it&#39;s about protecting the children from death. Some believe they have to grow to the age of reason and choose Christianity to get to go to heaven, for example. Those souls are being damned for eternity to purgatory or worse by the people committing the abortions, they are trying to save those people not judge the murderers. Trying to shame them is mainly a tactic to try to make people stop aborting by overwhelming them with guilt before they do it.</p>

<p>The arguments against abortion are more complicated and important than you give them credit for here. The issues at stake are deeply significant, we are talking about the right to have control over ones own body, and the body is an integral component of the self. A person forced to carry a pregnancy is very literally a slave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im always divided on the abortion issue. It&#39;s interesting you say that &quot;a person forced to carry a pregnancy is very literally a slave&quot;. What always boggles my mind is, what is the difference between a fetus and a kid? like is a mother a slave because she is forced to care for her born child? I guess she could give it up for adoption right? It&#39;s not like we would let the mother kill the kid, or just completely neglect the born child. like it&#39;s not slavery to force a mother to make sure her baby doesn&#39;t drown in a bathtub. And yet, by law she literally has to do that or she will go to jail if the kid dies. Is that not a similar type of &quot;slavery&quot;? what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you said adoption is an option. This is essential to the idea of slavery because everything else you said is negated by adoption. You don&#39;t have to force them to not neglect because they have options to not care for the child at all. That is a legitimate way to completely renounce all responsibility for the child&#39;s welfare. There is no equivalency to that while pregnant, except of course abortion.</p>

<p>You are not a slave if you can quit and walk away. That is adoption. But if once pregnant you have to carry to term, and brave the inherent risk of death or debilitation, &quot;quitting&quot; the responsibility is not possible, hence slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abortion isn&#39;t the issue, I could have chosen any topic, it&#39;s labeling the things people care about as inconsequential that I took issue with. I&#39;ll continue with it as an example though. </p>

<p>Something isn&#39;t going to seem like a wedge issue if it directly affects your life. There was another abortion SCOTUS case this year out of Texas. Now, it&#39;s easy to look at it from an outside perspective and think &quot;Why are we still talking about this? There are REAL problems to deal with!&quot; But, if you are a woman from Texas who needed an abortion for a medical necessity or used the centers for other types of care it was a pretty big freaking deal. </p>

<p>My point is, most issues have actual people within them who are going to be affected by the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of this argument about toilets.  I don&#39;t get up in arms when i need to reach down and lift a up a seat in order to piss. Nor do i care when i have to put the seat down for a shit. Jesus fuck it&#39;s a god damn toilet. Leaving a seat up or down does fuck all good if the next person needs it the opposite that it was left.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s got a good damn option on it. So that if you don&#39;t like the way it is you may adjust it.  Jesus fuck toilets are the dumbest thing to argue about making the world a better place. I seriously hope that line was a joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about a boycott. It would require individual financial sacrifice, but it would be a non violent way to send a strong message. I see it happening like this: Submit a list of grievances with a due date, if the grievances are not remedied in time we stop going to work and stop unnecessary purchases; basically stop participating economically. The corporations and govt would have a shit fit due to the lack of revenue. The grievances could include the elimination of the lobby, reversing citizens united, setting term limits for politicians and campaign finance reform. The best part is, we can do this from home. Non participation. </p>

<p>this isn&#39;t something you have a lot of time on.  the rise of AI is going to make their job much easier for them and a lot harder for you to do yours.  they still require humans to do things for them, and that is the only advantage we still have.  </p>

<p>keep in mind, you don&#39;t even need tech to robin hood most of the corrupt corporations that abuse their wealth.   you don&#39;t need any tech to remove merchandise from stores, or destroy means of production and transportation.  just need a lot of like minded people.  tech would definitely make it easier, and make you require less people, but simply having more or better tech isn&#39;t going to cut it for them as long as humans still have to use it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why we do not go through the traditional social structure. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. The internet is where the revolution will be televised because it is harder to control than ever.</p>

<p>We need a website in which we can share our ideas intelligently and uncensored.  We&#39;ve seen it before in Egypt with the use of facebook. This corruption though, it&#39;s not just American. It&#39;s a global crisis. We need a GLOBAL INTERNET-BASED COMMUNITY that is decentralized, in which we can expose truths and make plans. Let&#39;s be honest, reddit is great as sort of humanity&#39;s working memory, but we need version 2.0. We need more organization. We need more focus. We ALL need to be able to see the issues that truly matter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m building such a website, but I can&#39;t share it with you yet. Whether I build it or not though, it will be built, and we will come together outside of our governments awake.</p>

<p>Just remember that forgiveness and love are your two greatest weapons. They are truth serums. Through love and forgiveness we will rise together like bread. Violence only breeds violence. We&#39;ve seen it over and over. We all know it in our hearts. Love your enemy and they will become your friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. Dehumanize the enemy by making them &quot;the other&quot;. The word terrorist does a great job of that. The idea that soldiers would all defect (and if I&#39;m not mistaken they would face death for doing so if not a very long prison sentence) instead of firing on their countrymen is laughably naive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s never going to be &quot;the American public is in an uprising! Kill them all!&quot; It&#39;s going to be &quot;group x is a terrorist threat, kill or capture them all and try to avoid civilian casualties&quot;. Once enough of these groups are absolutely decimated the motivated strength to unify more groups will be eviscerated. Anyone who thinks they&#39;re going to &quot;take their country back&quot; by stockpiling arms to use against the US military is a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>So folks take to the streets with their guns against the government. The government calls it a riot/civil disobedience/whatever. Media follows suit of the most part. Gov. orders police and possibly national guard or whatever to contain this. They&#39;ll avoid &#39;civil war/rebellion&#39; phrasing like the plague cause those might garner more support, not less. No one likes a riot except folks already rioting. Since we&#39;ve already brought guns into the mix we can kind of assume the police will assume you intend on using them (presumably on the government officials you&#39;re targeting).</p>

<p>Assuming groups get to government buildings they&#39;d either take hostages or shooting folks deemed guilty (or did you think civil war would be bloodless). Suffice to say this will be covered in great detail by the media. Not too many folks get warm fuzzy feelings about watching old people held at gunpoint (or worse). From that point on it would go poorly for the rebels. </p>

<p>A few pointless cogs in the machine get shot, statues unveiled a while later. No major players would get killed because..well they&#39;re rich and powerful, use your imagination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about the north Vietnamese army. I&#39;m talking about the Viet Cong. Poor farmers who used small arms, booby traps, the cover of darkness to do hit and run guerilla tactics, and psychological warfare against our troops.

    <div class="md"><p>While a lot of this is very, very true we have to remember a few key elements here. </p>

<p>1) The Vietcong were fighting for their homeland. They wanted to be left the fuck alone. They were sick of French rule and viewed the invasion of American forces as just &quot;more of the same&quot;. <em>We</em>, the common man, might align with those ideals, but so would any U.S. soldier. </p>

<p>2) The majority of U.S. forces were conscripted. They did not understand the point of the war and many thought that Johnson, Nixon, &quot;Democracy&quot;, &quot;The Domino Theory&quot; etc. were the problems of politicians and governments, not them. They were more concerned with getting out of Vietnam <em>alive</em> than they were progressing Democratic ideals throughout Vietnam. If you haven&#39;t already, check out a book called &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; by Tim O&#39;Brien. It sheds some brilliant light on the psyche of the American soldier in Vietnam. </p>

<p>3) Supplies. Where do you think The NVA and The Vietcong got those AK-47s and mortar rounds? Also, where do you think they got the <em>education</em> on how to use them? Vietnam was a proxy war in its finest form. The NVA was supplied by Russia. The Vietcong were supplied by the NVA. Same theory applies to Russia&#39;s involvement in Afghanistan. We gave them arms to fight against the Soviets. Who supplies the American people fighting for Freedom in times of War? Who comes to our aide? I highly doubt any country would touch us with a 10 foot pole, and I certainly doubt that any uprising by the American public would be looked upon as a way to capitalize by countries like Russia or China. Imagine the havoc that would come from street-by-street fighting. Army vs. population. Then imagine an invasion from another country coming in after all the destruction. </p>

<p>4) The common man. This is the biggest issue. Most people do not have the training, and, further more, most people are not in <em>shape</em> for some sort of conflict. This applies to physically, emotionally, or psychologically. We have been eating at the trough for far too long. We&#39;ve gotten soft. All it would take is for the common man to turn on the news, see some people in a distant American city getting slaughtered by tanks and helicopters and they&#39;d give up. I&#39;m not talking about us, I&#39;m talking about <em>commoners</em>. The people who love their beer and football. Who value their lives and are willing to sacrifice their &quot;liberty for security&quot;. Sadly, those people &quot;deserve neither&quot;. </p>

<p>If something were to happen it couldn&#39;t be like Vietnam. It would be quelled before it even gets off the ground. Technology is too intense and we are too monitored. </p>

<p>Truthfully, I think we are all fucked. But that&#39;s just me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make excellent points. Our situation wouldn&#39;t be the same as Vietnam. A majority of Americans have been made fat and stupid. Our culture is confused. Men are encouraged to be more soft, sensitive, and anti confrontational. Not alot of real men any more. I guess I&#39;m kinda speaking for myself but if SHTF and all I had was small arms I would be implementing sneaky underhanded guerrilla tactics because that would be my best chance with the tools available. Wishful thinking at best but it&#39;s better than no plan at all.</p>

Plus infantry isn&#39;t the only job that can cause harm I mean tankers are a whole different job for example. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is infantry isn&#39;t the biggest problem because you can just shoot them.

<p>There are only 1.3 million active duty in all the military branches.  It&#39;s estimated that 300 million people own firearms.  300. Million. People.  It&#39;s simple math as to which side would win.  To say nothing about how the military would defect in <em>droves</em> if ordered to fire upon its own citizens.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason a lot of the more homogenous European countries have all the social programs they do.</p>

<p>You view the majority of your population as brethren. We do not in America. They have been dividing an conquering us for a while now. Unless that other person is also a middle income, African American, Republican just like you, you tend to view them as... &quot;them&quot; rather than us.</p>

<li><p>revising the standards as to what constitutes corruption and the evidence that must be presented to prove it (it&#39;s way too hard to prove right now, and we should also consider giving standing to any constituent of a corrupt politician to bring a lawsuit)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Then things will need to be fixed again in 20-30 years. I think that will end up being a lot more effective than hoping some overthrow of the government results in a better government. Besides in that new government, why wouldn&#39;t you ultimately end up with the same problems that need fixing in 20-30 years? Also, with a constitutional convention, you can completely change the constitution; it could be effectively the creation of a new government.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>It is wrong to go this route before actually attempting to participate in the Congressional election system. If you haven&#39;t tried that avenue, it&#39;s no wonder it hasn&#39;t worked. Elections are this November and they&#39;re direct, popular votes. You can fire your representative with very little effort and replace them with a better one, but you HAVE to participate from the primary onward.</p>

<p>Until I see this genuinely attempted, it will still be the most sensible, effective course of action we have. You can tell me all you want that the system is too corrupt for our congressional votes to work, but that&#39;s a blanket assumption based on abusive systems like the electoral college.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> no electoral college in Congressional elections. Go out there and vote your fucking mind. You <strong>can</strong> choose your candidate if you participate in the primaries, and we get a chance every two years to make this change. We just never, ever do. We continue to call the government as a whole corrupt while ignoring our Constitutionally guaranteed right to hand-pick our representatives. <strong>Wake. Up.</strong> We <strong>already have</strong> this power, and this is <strong>no</strong> time to take it for granted.</p>

<p>2 reasons why. First off, we have one of the most transparent governments in the world so bribery would be difficult at best. Second, our two countries haven&#39;t really done a whole lot of good for each other outside of trade and if anything, the war in the middle east we got dragged into just kinda ticked everyone off.</p>

<p>So yeah at the very least, your Northern brothers wouldn&#39;t try to stop it. Not like we&#39;d be able to anyways, I&#39;d imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s to prevent hate crimes/groups, like the KKK, from being legal and existing. Most western (European/North American) countries have this law. The US doesn&#39;t have it for more historical reasons, rather than political ones (i.e. the confederation wouldn&#39;t have it and the idea has stuck with the more southern states ever since).</p>

<p>To clarify, you&#39;re allowed to say &#39;I hate immigrants&#39;. It becomes a crime when you have a serious public speech saying &quot;we should round up all the Jews and put them in labor camps&quot;. I can totally see where, at a glance, these laws would be concerning to an American but they really don&#39;t affect 99% of peoples day-to-day lives at all. It exists purely as a counter to violent extremism of any kind.</p>

<p>Take away their monopoly on violence first. Then burn the place where they sit to &quot;earn&quot; their paycheck. </p>

<p>They will crawl under rocks and hide. Drag out the ringleaders, and hang them by their necks until they are dead.
Elect sheriffs, and hold public elections, with paper ballots, and ink stains on thumbs, just like the third world nation we are.</p>

<p>Put the faith community in charge of community services, and require some number of hours of community service per work week from each individual as a condition for voting rights.</p>

<p>Start over.  Don&#39;t nationalize anything that doesn&#39;t need to be nationalized. Sheriffs should regulate public utilities like waste water and water treatment facilities, with State plumbing boards in charge, and the IBEW in charge of power distribution. A temporary suspension of metering should be instituted, with a resumption from square one scheduled six, or twelve months in the future on an assigned date. </p>

<p>Put everything to a public vote, until Americans are sick of it. By then, things should be functioning on a baseline level. </p>

<p>Capitalism will win the day. Barter and trade in the hard, early days, and institute backed currency hard and fast. Free markets always win the day.</p>

<p>When people get that slap in the face and realize that when they try to dominate others, they might swing from a street light, watch everybody try to out-do each other with their &quot;civic responsibility&quot;.</p>

<p>A new age of civility. Of course, things will be tough in a lot of places. I suspect it will be easy in Texas, among other places. Texans don&#39;t generally have a problem with taking responsibility, or looking out for the common good, or doing what is right, or being polite. </p>

<p>I suspect the lights will stay on in Texas, and probably Louisiana, and Colorado, and Arkansas. There would probably be a minimal disruption in services for producing members of society. The entitled population will migrate to other areas, or fall into step with the new civil society. 
Capitol cities, like Austin, will experience a sharp population decline, quickly, as a lot of the entrenched criminals will run away, and leave the Capitol building and a bunch of houses in west Austin vacant. Good fuckin riddance.
Then, it will be back to work for the rest of us. There will be a lot of opportunities for a lot of disenfranchised people to step up, and take their place at the table. 
A new meritocracy. That&#39;s what we need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After giving this quite a bit of thought myself and continuously deducing the right course of action. I came to the simple conclusion to do absolutely nothing. If things get bad, move. It makes complete sense that successful leaders need to be ruthless, and ruthlessness is not inherently moral or good. Understand as individuals we contain control but hold little power, where as in a group we gain power but lose the ability to control the group for long (using moral measures). In conclusion I believe humans are inherently corrupt and are to easily controlled by our primal needs and emotions which is in where lies the problem. Even if you fix it, were bound to go right back to being corrupt, look at history we kinda suck.</p>

<p>But what now?  What can any of us really do?</p>

<p>Mass labor strike seems like it would work, but most people would probably rather have a guaranteed way to pay rent and buy food than potentially throw away everything for a chance that something might change.</p>

<p>Taking up arms in any way isn&#39;t going to be popular either, for the reasons stated above, and also mostly everyone would be horrified by the reality of a violent uprising, even if they thought it sounded good in theory.</p>

<p>I legitimately can&#39;t imagine anything people would believe in, come together and fight for.  I&#39;ve thought there were some pretty huge catalysts in the past decade or so that would certainly be the tipping point for change, but they always seem to blow over in a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>Start a religion. Make countering corruption the tenents of that faith.</p>

<ul>
<li>if you&#39;re imprisoned, God says you must receive a specific healthy diet, proper medical care and being held in solitary is an affront to God... Now for-profit prisons can&#39;t feed you the disgusting crap they feed inmates now, they have to treat your conditions/injuries and they can&#39;t throw you in solitary, which has been found to have an adverse affect on people&#39;s health.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s one example and there&#39;s so many ways you can apply it and it will work as long as you don&#39;t push your luck and do something dumb like refuse to pay any and all taxes on religious grounds or say it&#39;s your religious right to own hand grenades, etc.</p>

<p>Churches are also tax exempt and donating to them is tax deductible. Instead of being like those assholes that take the donations so they can live like kings, you invest it back into the community. Hell, maybe you could even work it like a tax shelter, a bank account they can&#39;t touch. Or do like Scientology did and build massive wealth through real estate. Look at the shit they do, the government doesn&#39;t lay a finger on them. Now imagine having that power dedicated to enriching the lives of others in the community instead of one&#39;s self.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to fight in their wars, you can protect some of your money from taxation and if the corrupt government does something stupid that tanks the economy, the community is shielded from the downfall.</p>

<p>If it works well enough, you could even start spending some of that religious freedom to other countries in the world.</p>

sadly people are much more likely to come together out of fear or more importantly, hate, than love. 
the watchmen did a great job of articulating that very idea with doctor manhattan.  hate brings the masses, peace brings a few hippies to electric forest.. sad af.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Most people have the general idea that something is fishy, but relatively few in the US, for example, believe their government actually murdered thousands of Americans on 9/11. Step two is to make this common knowledge, along with other false flag ops (Oklahoma city, Kennedy assassination, for example).
IMO, step three is to make everyone aware of the existence of sociopaths, and evidence that most of out &quot;leaders&quot; are sociopaths. Step four is to withdraw support as much as possible. </p>

<p>Only when mass society understands the problem and gets this far will be be able to see the way to really fixing the problem (as opposed to just replacing one batch of criminals with another.)</p>

<p>Oh, it&#39;s that simple...just never purchase any goods or base material to make any goods, of any description,  since inevitably part of the chain of everything you know and see and touch has had someone lobby for  some aspect of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might be kinda tricky, some industries seem to hardly exist outside of the companies that lobby, and the alternatives are either impractical or more expensive.</p>

<p>Some hurdles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Petroleum</p></li>
<li><p>Most major telecom companies</p></li>
<li><p>Most major insurance providers and drug manufacturers</p></li>
<li><p>Boeing / Lockheed Martin / Northrop Grumman (and many smaller companies that are tied into pretty much every form of transportation)</p></li>
<li><p>Google / Amazon / Microsoft / Apple / (along with nearly every major tech or internet based company)</p></li>
<li><p>Dow / P&amp;G / other food corporations - Produce pretty much 90% of things that are on grocery store shelves that people use on a daily basis.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I just scraped the very top of the most prominent lobbying companies, but you could see how that could get a little hard to manage, even on a personal level.  Damn near impossible to convince an average person to stop buying and using most of the products and services they&#39;ve depended on for a long time.</p>

<p>Often for good reason. In this thread I see a lot of delusional people that are just going to get themselves killed real quick. The US hasn&#39;t even gotten to the point where there are major mass protests. Most people are unhappy with what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s not bad enough to just start bloodshed like a lot of the people in this thread would love to see.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking honestly, I want to know how to open their eyes. Anyone have any tips? I feel the less tech savvy generations of America are the people who get baited by the msm stories and don&#39;t actually &quot;do their own research&quot;( -hilly)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling bullshit works wonders on Reddit and social media. It&#39;s why this whole site does it. </p>

<p>Gawker showed Hulk Hogan but not J-Law! Hypocrites. </p>

<p>Trump said this. Clinton said this. Bernie is a saint! </p>

<p>Educating, explaining, telling people it&#39;s wrong doesn&#39;t really help anyone who is over 25. We&#39;re aware. We are complicit and we make our peace with it.   </p>

<p>Why? I mean, all you need to do is open your eyes about news. Or see why a traffic ticket costs 8x what it should. Or that it&#39;s impossible to prove innocence of malfeasance by cops unless there&#39;s a camera. Or that our health care is a fucking joke for a first world country. </p>

<p>Yeah, but why don&#39;t we change? Because what is there to change to? </p>

<p>The government is corrupt. So, ok, is the solution to rip everyone out and start from point 0? Even if that could be accomplished, everything is partisan, so we&#39;d wind up with the same root issues of binary choices. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a revolution or a slow evolution. And it&#39;s solutions, new ideas people can get understand, get behind, and support without facing an upheaval of their life that needs to be there. Not to produce change, because we&#39;re all willing. But to promote the change and improvement in lives, a short solution needs to be waiting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normal, humble people don&#39;t have the thought in their head that they should decide how everyone else lives. Normal people don&#39;t have a hole that cannot be filled no matter how much money/power they achieve. Normal people have a conscience.</p>

<p>The people who make it to the top of the of the government/corporate pyramid (essentially the same thing these days) are different. They possess high levels of narcissism to fully believe that they should be the ones to decide the policies that govern the lives of others. Being a millionaire or even a billionaire does not satisfy them. Being in a position of high authority does not satisfy them. To make it to the top you have to be near sociopathic, able to act without any sense of remorse.</p>

<p>The top of the top are extremely intelligent to boot. They&#39;ve built a near perfect machine to achieve their control and practically have unlimited resources to perpetuate it. The masses are dumbed down, have the attention span of a kitten, and still rely on TV news talking heads to form their interpretation of the world around them. Until humanity wakes up in much larger numbers we are at their mercy. Do your best to enjoy life and stock up on popcorn to watch shit happen. IMO we&#39;re at least a few generations away from the type of change that most of us want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to be careful with some of these words; There&#39;s a crucial distinction between talking about narcissism, sociopathy, etc. ( which are objective, observable, afflictions of the mind ), and making statements such as &quot;they are different&quot;, &quot;they are not normal&quot;, &quot;they are not like us&quot;.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with George Carlin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07w9K2XR3f0">here</a> when he states that politicians come from the same stock as the &#39;ordinary people&#39;. By claiming otherwise you are basically creating a scapegoat. &quot;If only we could get rid of <strong>them</strong>!&quot;. But that&#39;s not it. There&#39;s no convenient &quot;us vs. them&quot; angle to this. It&#39;s systemic. Until you address the root causes, the environmental factors from which the politicians emerge, it&#39;s never going to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have no idea what objective, unadulterated and non-culturally/economically-influenced &quot;human nature&quot; truly is. </p>

<p>This is because practically every human has grown up within the systems we have as they exist now and in the past.  Certainly if we&#39;re making conclusions about human nature based on the narrow sample (both temporally and population-wise) of how <em>Americans</em> behave, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll get an objective picture of human nature.</p>

<p>Of course human nature seems to be greedy and ruthless and paranoid and violent and ignorant etc etc if you look at a bunch of humans raised in a sick culture that values such things (or, historically a bunch of humans raised in an environment of needing to constantly fight for survival).</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real problem actually, that capitalism and our whole system and society reward sociopathic behavior.  The more dishonest and wealth-hoarding and non-empathetic you are, the more rewards you reap in this society.  It&#39;s true.  Arguably those who provide the least good for humanity get the highest rewards of power and money... Sports stars, CEOs, celebrities, Wall St. guys, high level politicians...hell even on the small scale, bureaucratic middle management types get rewarded more than those who do the actual work, in most industries.</p>

<p>Imagine what &quot;human nature&quot; might look like if we instead rewarded philanthropy and empathy and real concrete contribution to the good of society. Imagine if companies promoted the most honest and selfless employees, instead of the most backstabbing and self-interested.  Give someone else credit for your project, you get the selflessness award and a promotion! Volunteer the most hours in your community, you don&#39;t have to pay taxes next year!</p>

<p>If we ever actually got to see how humanity would react to living under a system such as that, there&#39;d probably be people claiming left and right how it&#39;s &quot;human nature&quot; to share and be kind etc.  </p>

<p>Human nature at any given moment is more like a bunch of positive and negative feedback loops than a set objective thing... a reflection of the dynamic between humanity and our systems... It&#39;s kind of like how if horses had gods, the gods would be horses. </p>

<p>if as you say &quot;Some people have a greater potential for psychopathy&quot; than you need to back that up with medical evidence. Like, are you talking about some gene or kind of birth defect? than you need to specify what that is, and to link that to the individuals we are discussing.</p>

After years of being in the workforce I can tell you that there are plenty of average wage individuals that are sociopathic and/or narcissistic.  Passive aggressive tactics are a daily thing with many people as well.  It&#39;s frustrating for some of us that are able to work as team players, respect one another, and be honest people.  Just look at what goes on here in the forum.  Look how people treat one another.  I&#39;m saying that while the general population is being treated as glorified slaves by the elite, the general population has plenty of blame for the horrible treatment of fellow citizens and society.  </p>

The fact that you can post on Reddit alone is proof were not living in this 1984 society <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would have you believe. Your data isn&#39;t being tracked within the continental US. Your senators aren&#39;t all corrupt assholes, at least for my state - go Bernie! The government can&#39;t make everyone happy all the time. Look at this though, poverty is on the decline and middle class wages are growing! This is good, this is progress. 
Maybe it&#39;s not that &quot;normal&quot; people don&#39;t think about how to govern others, more normal people leave those decisions to elected officials we pay to make these decisions. As a single person your strongest tool is the power to vote. If you&#39;re not happy with the current state of affairs, find someone who represents your beliefs and campaign for them. Something to remember though is the majority rules, so you won&#39;t always get your way. Personally I&#39;d hate working in the gov, but I still want my ideas heard. Your vote is your voice, use it. </p>

You want a liberal socialist government?  Go move to that state that agrees with you.   You want the conservative religious population around you?  Go there.  Right now we&#39;re trying to do too much with a federal government that cannot possible end well.  Everyone is just getting angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently fascinated by Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote <em>Democracy in America</em> from the early 1800&#39;s. Surprisingly, what he said has culminated in 2016 with our present situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Society will develop a new kind of servitude which covers the surface of society with a network of complicated rules, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate. <strong>It does not tyrannise but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Alexis de Tocqueville</p>

<p>His book is a treasure trove that I have to keep digging through, but the bad news is that the corruption we have has been a constant throughout the history of man.</p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; are!? Remember who your audience is. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and quite a few readers here know that the US (inc.) is engaged in carrying out plans which &quot;we&quot; were never part of. On this sub you&#39;ll find people bandying about terms like &quot;Zio-Masonic&quot;, or &quot;Anglo-Zionist&quot;, or &quot;NWO&quot;. I&#39;ve read about many plans for America, which involve the US (inc.), and <em>not</em> the states or the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Restart Occupy Wall St., but this time partner with the tea party nuts on declared issues.</p>

<p>That way we get Occupy with armed guards and if they really want to shut it down they can go through the 2nd Amendment guys first.</p>

<p>This solves everyone&#39;s issues. The socio-anarcho left can do their crust punk squatting but this time with an agreed to agenda with the tea party.</p>

<p>The tea party can parade around and display their 2nd amendment rights and fancy guns with a purpose other than pissing off cops.</p>

<p>Occupy/Tea coalition goals could be simple; stuff like &quot;Bodycams on all Cops.&quot; &quot;Lowering lower/middle class taxation, raising corporate taxes.&quot; &quot;Overturning Citizens United.&quot;</p>

<p>Keep it simple. There&#39;s no longer any need for those ridiculous circle jerk occupy meetings I used to attend where no one is in charge and everything gets muddied by trying to honor every person&#39;s feelings.</p>

<p>Keep it simple. Occupy. Tea party armed guards.</p>

<p>Cause I doubt anyone here on reddit is going to be doing any uprising.  They currently are on a computer, using internet, have electricity, water, food, a home and probably enjoy a relatively decent life.</p>

<p>You going to go protest in the streets real quick now?  Nah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there are a lot of hurdles. I&#39;m not clued up on law myself and you would need to have at least some insight. </p>

<p>But, if someone with more experience or the time to do a proper investigation was to pick a single point of clear law breaking, and compiled enough evidence to present a good case; if it was high profile enough, there are maybe some possibilities to approach the money hurdle like crowd funding.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make I guess is that taking a high profile person to court is no different than taking your neighbour. It may just be much more work. As long as what you are saying in your case is true, anyone can learn as they go and eventually compile a good enough collection of evidence and knowledge.</p>

<p>I just thought this video rang out as one possible option.</p>

<p>There is no doubt there is corruption in the courts. But, even having your case thrown out or not heard might be enough to spread the word and enlighten more people.</p>

<p>Edit: Ahhh. The down votes from the armchair warrior. Well played, sir. That&#39;ll teach me!</p>

<p>Seriously, &quot;What&#39;s stopping you?&quot;. You shouldn&#39;t focus on a defeatist attitude, and if you can&#39;t answer that question without at least trying, go do it. Or at least investigate it.</p>

<p>Granted, it would be a TON of work, research etc. But, then the question was.. &quot;WTF do we <strong><em>DO</em></strong> now?&quot; Sitting at your computer dismissing a good avenue of action, simply because you think all courts are corrupt isn&#39;t acting. It&#39;s simply expressing a negative attitude. </p>

<p>Even if you are not given the time of day, your case is not heard or you meet a complete brick wall, your still <strong>doing something</strong>; and believe it or not, it still has an impact. Sitting at your computer dismissing good idea&#39;s doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>In that video (if you watch it all for the context) he&#39;s talking about taking Obama to court as well, not just anyone.</p>

<p>There are tons of people that don&#39;t have the time, energy,  resources or could even be bothered to do it and that&#39;s fine. But, you don&#39;t have to be one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Restart Occupy Wall St., but this time partner with the tea party nuts on declared issues.</p>

<p>That way we get Occupy with armed guards and if they really want to shut it down they can go through the 2nd Amendment guys first.</p>

<p>This solves everyone&#39;s issues. The socio-anarcho left can do their crust punk squatting but this time with an agreed to agenda with the tea party. </p>

<p>The tea party can parade around and display their 2nd amendment rights and fancy guns with a purpose other than pissing off cops.</p>

<p>Occupy/Tea coalition goals could be simple; stuff like &quot;Bodycams on all Cops.&quot; &quot;Lowering lower/middle class taxation, raising corporate taxes.&quot; &quot;Overturning Citizens United.&quot;</p>

<p>Keep it simple. There&#39;s no longer any need for those ridiculous circle jerk occupy meetings I used to attend where no one is in charge and everything gets muddied by trying to honor every person&#39;s feelings.</p>

<p>Keep it simple. Occupy. Tea party armed guards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overall, their root cause is money problems in the US, the Tea Party is focused on the government debt, and Occupy Movement was focused on social and income inequality (or in some cases, anger at corrupt rich people).</p>

<p>Generally they both support major services, such as education and welfare.</p>

<p>The tea party&#39;s solution was to basically make illegal immigrants get no benefits and still pay taxes, and the Occupy movement was mainly focused on getting the government listen to the people.</p>

<p>aka both groups are generally monetarily progressive, tea party is generally socially conservative but they want to plug up the ballooning deficit somehow. For example, the Tea Party dislikes abortion but have stated that their main focus was not abortion policy, as they&#39;re economically focused.</p>

<p>The tea party&#39;s downfall was that they trusted too much of money they raised to Super PACs with supposedly similar &quot;conservative&quot; goals, but then they would use the money to do other things that didn&#39;t go with the tea party ethos.</p>

<p>The Occupy movement on the other hand focused around social protest to change government. They helped restart the conversation about increased minimum wage.</p>

<p>They wanted Washington to tighten regulations around the banking industry and arrest &#39;financial fraudsters&#39;.</p>

<p>A lot of their demands were ignored by government.</p>

<p>These two groups have one UNCOMMON goal: Tea Party is against taxing the rich, while the Occupy movement wanted a Robin Hood Tax.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Overall we have two groups undermined by the government with a root cause based around economic unrest. Both groups wanted to tighten up regulations to get money from fraudsters (whether from banks or illegal immigrants). Both appear to be starting to run dry of funding and members now, and seem to be on the tail end of their respective movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully done my friend. I did not know the Tea Party was against taxing the rich. Interesting as I wonder what their solution to fixing the budget would be, as reducing the discretionary budget wouldn&#39;t work without reducing the size of our military, and I remember they are against that.</p>

<p>Now how about this? The Tea Party is an &quot;official&quot; organization, with a website, etc. Occupy just has their old FB pages from when it was happening. Not really a center to the structure of the movement. How do we bring those together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a far-left occupier, I support our nation&#39;s troops. I do not support war. You&#39;ll find many many tea-partyists saying the same thing.</p>

<p>This is why we just pick a few issues and unify.</p>

<p>Body-cams, check. Lower taxes on the people, raise them on corporations, check. Get money out of politics, check. That&#39;s it (as an example anyway). All other politics are left at the tent flap.</p>

<p>Keep it simple. Don&#39;t bring divisive politics into it. We&#39;re all human. My entire Wyoming fam identifies as tea party members. We get along just fine at family gatherings and always find common ground politically.</p>

You recognize the awful situations many of the military folk come from, or are in. It&#39;s horrible. But to say I support them just sounds wrong. I empathize with them, I wish the best for them, but I certainly don&#39;t support anything they&#39;re doing.</p>

Unfortunately, while it sounds like a good idea, it would never work. The American people have been brainwashed into believing that harming one little hair on one of our dear leaders heads is horrible and makes you a terrorist. Their sympathies lie with the master at the moment. Any person trying such a thing, I fear, wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the government to come and snuff them out.

    <div class="md"><p>Those systems kind of still exist in very rural areas of the U.S.  Of course no one can/will completely cut themselves off from money, but there are some people that still live a very simple life. </p>

<p>My wife&#39;s family is from a very rural part of Georgia (think dirt floors rural) where they still trade goods throughout their small community. One family has fish, one has deer and pig meat, one has vegetables. They all trade these good between each other and live very cheaply. </p>

<p>It is possible to live like this, but too many people aren&#39;t willing to give up their luxuries to be independent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the solution, in a nutshell, is to decentralize/localize power. People should defend the 10th Amendment with the same passion as they do the 2nd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice:</p>

<p><strong>Homeschooling:</strong> It&#39;s nearly/completely unregulated in states such as New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, etc... this counters Common Core, Mandatory Vaccinations, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Marijuana Legalization:</strong> Recreational use is legal in 4 states... this partly counters the War on Drugs. This issue is on many state ballots this November, legalization will likely spread. So it&#39;s not hard to imagine marijuana&#39;s removal from schedule 1 in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Gay Marriage:</strong> This began at the state level as well. I&#39;m not sure what exactly it counters, but it&#39;s further proof that states can refute the authority of the central powers.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum Wage:</strong> Some states keep it low and some states even have no state minimum (they must still pay the Federal minimum)... this helps people stay employed, i.e. less dependent on DC.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Health Treatments:</strong> There are a variety of them which are not approved by the FDA, yet they are available in respective States... this counters Big Pharma.</p>

<p><strong>Other Issues:</strong> Civil asset forfeiture, Obamacare, Police drone use, Hemp cultivation, License plate tracking, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you understand how political parties formed you would understand that getting rid of the 2 parties does not change much. The political parties formed from people having similar views. There was no parties in the beginning of U.S. History. People tended to have the same views , so they grouped together to make their views a reality. If 30 people all agreed on the same topic, they would most likely agree on other topics. while the 2 political parties have too much power in our society, 2 sides of an argument led to the formation of political parties. What I just stated is not 100% applicable to today&#39;s society, but the theme still follows. Unfortunately the problem I see with political parties is that if one party supports a view the other party will always disagree. Unfortunately my dad will always vote for democrats because he is apart of a labor union, even if he does not support the candidate. If we had a political leader that had his/her own views, not the parties views I would think that could end the power of the parties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? Back away. Governments/institutions can&#39;t be righted without extreme pressure either from within (corruption) or without (rebellion). Neither is good for the people. Now isn&#39;t the time to poke the bear that government has become, now is the time to buy a small house in the country, plant a sustainable garden, and wait ten years. You can put money in the system, but that just rewards the system. Getting rich rewards the system, staying poor feeds the system&#39;s impetus, like a drug addict. But staying small, as off the grid as you feel comfortable, and living off your own production is a big fuck-you to both sides of the corrupt government. Don&#39;t get so rich that you become a tax slave, don&#39;t be so poor that you become a welfare slave. Be insignificant, and the bear will pass on by.</p>

<p>Stop sending your children to government schools.  Let go of your statist faith.  <a href="http://harrybrowne.org/articles/PrinciplesOfGovernment.htm">Government is the disease posing as the cure.</a>  Use open source when you can, and don&#39;t develop for proprietary, centralizing, enslaving, technologies.  Create, &amp; contribute to, individual empowering technology, and efforts.  Understand that if you are working for NSA, or IBM, or Google, or Apple, military, police, etc., you&#39;re a tool of the slaving establishment.  They&#39;re paying you to assist in the enslavement of yourself, &amp; your loved ones for generations to come.  Rely on yourself, your family, your friends, and neighbors.  Avoid the state as much as you possibly can.</p>

<p>There are only two groups that matter; individuals who respect the rights of others, &amp; those who don&#39;t.  Divide &amp; conquer is the oldest trick in the book.  Don&#39;t allow yourself to be distracted/divided.</p>

<p>Create freedom in your own life.  It&#39;s the only freedom you&#39;ll find in this world.</p>

<p>Most of us are forgetting one thing... there is still a &quot;middle class&quot;, or, there is still a dream of the &quot;middle class&quot; which keeps people showing up to work to make money so they can buy shit they dont need in order to put them closer to the &quot;middle class&quot;.</p>

<p>The majority of the citizens in pre-revolution Russia / France were desperate, hungry, poor, sick, and forgotten about. There was no allusion of &quot;class mobility&quot;. Revolution was their one, true option. </p>

<p>People here still believe there is a chance to make an honest, moral living. They don&#39;t want to be bothered. They&#39;d rather work until 70 (if they live that long) and just try to provide for their family. </p>

<p>When the <strong>average</strong> American is poor, starving, indebted and desolate, then revolution will be seriously considered. Unfortunately for us that time will be far too late due to the advance of technology. </p>

<p>People are too easy to track and identify.  The moment the leader of an anti establishment group becomes too popular, they&#39;ll be destroyed via slander, framing then framing, or death.   </p>

<p>Look at the many cases where politicians have tried to make a stand and were smeared or attacked.  That female lawmaker from new mexico or arizona, shot in the head at some rally.  She&#39;d been a big opponent of some powerful industry or group.</p>

<p>John edwards was hard on big pharma.  his infidelity made headlines.  Paul wellstone.  The former new york attorney general was messing with the banking system.  His trist with a hooker made the news and inspired a tv show where his fucking wife stands next to him during his apology.  </p>

<p>lincoln and jfk both opposed the central bank federal reserve system because its owned by private for profit groups.  ultimate tryanny.  they both were killed.</p>

<p>they tried to kill andrew jackson when he killed the first incarnation of the fed but the guns jammed due to humidity</p>

<p>The vast majority of people are ok with a corrupt government as long as their quality of life is not seriously threatened.</p>

<p>For example take the French revolution or the Russian revolution. The people had been abused for centuries, but it wasn&#39;t until they started dying of starvation that there was enough momentum to start a revolution that had a long lasting impact.</p>

<p>In the recent Spring revolution of the Arab countries it all started when the price of bread was so high that poor people couldn&#39;t afford to buy it anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? You clearly don&#39;t understand what happened in the middle east if you buy the narrative that there was some sort of &quot;revolution&quot; by the people. Jesus, man, stop watching the mainstream media. You couldn&#39;t be more wrong about what happened in the Arab Spring. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a message from a poor Syrian who just wants someone to listen: </p>

<p>Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them.
The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people… the chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by USA and UK etc… everyone knows that here.</p>

<p>American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone.</p>

<p>Every massacre has committed by them. We were all happy in Syria = we have free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF — controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank.</p>

<p>Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions.</p>

<p>I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country who has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure… they behead babies and rape young kids.</p>

<p>They are satanic. Our military helped.by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda but now the usa want to bomb the shit out of us so the al Qaeda can get the upper hand.</p>

<p>Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government.</p>

<p>Impeach that bankster puppet ape you have as president… support Ron Paul or Rand or anyone the like who are true American patriots. But be sure of one thing: if they attack and I think they will, it will be hell.</p>

<p>Be sure that it be world war and many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war.</p>

<p>Russia and China eventually if it escalates… and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US gvt and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries who do not go along with their new world order agenda !?</p>

<p>American people… you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for.the.death you bring almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Ask the Iraqis…the Afghans…the Pakistanis…the Palestinians… the Syrians… the Macedonians and Serbs…the Libyans… the Somalis… the Yemenis… all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars stop wars. Enough wars. Use diplomacy, dialogue… help… not force.”</p>

<p>Consistent testimonies from Syrians, as well as well-documented, open-source Western sources, and historical memory, all serve to reinforce the accuracy of the aforementioned testimony.</p>

<p>Syrians are living the horror brought to them by the criminal West. They can not afford the complacency of shrugging their shoulders in indecision, not when their lives and their ancient civilization is being threatened by Western-paid terrorist mercenaries of the worst kind.</p>

<p>“Our” proxies, slit throats, chop heads, and take no prisoners as we waffle in indecision, ignore empirical evidence, and take the comfortable easy road of believing the labyrinth of lies promulgated by Western media messaging.</p>

<p>The veil of comfortable confusion, nested in an unconscious belief that our government knows best or that it is patriotic to believe the lies and fabrications implicit in the hollow words of politicians (who no longer represent us) and the false pronouncements of Imperial messengers, is concealing an overseas holocaust.</p>

<p>Western societies are rotting from the inside out because of these lies and this barbarity.  We are protecting a criminal cabal of corporate globalists who do not serve our interests and never will.</p>

<p>Our democracies, which we should be protecting, have long disappeared – except in the hollow words of newspaper stenographers. Instead we are supporting transnational corporate elites and their delusional projects.</p>

<p>Poverty and disemployment are all soaring beneath the fakery of government pronouncements, as the public domain evaporates beneath words like “efficiency” or the “economy” — all false covers that serve to enrich elites and destroy us. Internal imperialism at home is a faded replica of the foreign imperialism abroad.</p>

<p>As countries are destroyed, and its peoples are slaughtered — think Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and others — by abhorrent Western proxies — public institutions are contaminated, and ultimately replaced by parasitical “privatized” facsimiles.</p>

<p>Public banking is looted and destroyed in favour of transnational banksterism, World Bank funding, and IMF usury. Food security is destroyed and replaced by biotech tentacles and engineered dependencies on cash crops and unhealthy food.</p>

<p>Currencies are destroyed, sanctions are imposed, and the unknown, unseen hand of totalitarian control imposes itself, amidst the cloud of diversions and confusions, aided by comprador regimes, oligarch interests, and shrugging domestic populations.</p>

<p>Syria refuses to submit. That is why the West is taught to hate her, and the rest of the world learns to love and respect her.</p>

<p>Yet, Syria’s struggles are our struggles. Syria represents international law, stability, and integrity: the same values that western peoples overtly cherish but stubbornly reject, as our countries wilt beneath suffocating veils of lies and delusions.</p>

<p>I support Syria, because I respect what remains of international law.
I support Syria because I reject Wahhabism, Sharia law, and terrorism.
I support Syria because I reject the undemocratic, transnational oligarchies that are subverting our once flourishing, now dead, democracies.
I reject the lies of our propagandizing media, the hollow words of our politicians, and the fake   “humanitarian” messaging that demonizes non-belligerent countries and their populations.
In the name of justice, humanity, and the rule of law, I support the elected government of Syria led by its President, Bashar al-Assad. Syria, an ancient cradle of civilization, is leading the way towards a better future for all of us.</p>

<p>All we have to do is open our eyes.</p>

<p>Alright, I&#39;d like some citations on the GMO, fluoride, chemtrail claims, because that&#39;s all outright silliness. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like some regarding the assertion that Western nations or proxies were responsible for the situation in the Ukraine. As far as I&#39;m aware, that was one of the few recent hotspots of instability Western nations didn&#39;t really have a whole lot to do with. </p>

<p>And finally some good sources on your claim that Arab Spring wasn&#39;t really driven by the people. The United States certainly took advantage of it, particularly in Syria, but there were demonstrations from Algeria, to Iraq, to Jordan, to Kuwait, to Morocco, and even to Oman. </p>

<p>Aaand that&#39;s about it. I mean, you&#39;re glorifying Assad a <em>little</em> too strongly, but I wont dispute that he&#39;s certainly what was best for the country. </p>

<p>&quot;He&quot; is <em>you</em>, mate.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Alright, no. That&#39;s not true.</p>

<p>They&#39;re fighting because America paid to <em>arm</em> rebel forces, absolutely. And yes, a great many of those rebels either sold the arms they were given to ISIS, or defected to them and took the arms with them, totally. And the whole reason they armed the rebel forces was so that they would destabilize Syria, that&#39;s entirely correct.</p>

<p><em>But</em> they&#39;re not paying them <em>to fight</em>. That has never been proven by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, what do you think we&#39;re doing in Syria? Fighting ISIS? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No &quot;we&quot;, I&#39;m Canadian. We pulled out participating in Syria, because that&#39;s pretty much the highest form of protest to America&#39;s arming of the Rebels that we can offer. </p>

<p>That said, there&#39;s absolutely a good amount of fighting ISIS going on. Contrary to what you seem to believe, even the United State government is no fan of ISIS. They&#39;re fans of the Rebels, which is why they arm them, and why they&#39;ve been bickering with Russia, who wants to bomb ISIS and the Rebels both. </p>

<p>Unlike those Rebels, ISIS is also active in Iraq, which is extremely contrary to US interests. They just got a government in charge of Iraq that is willing to play ball with them, the last thing they want is for that to be jeopardized.</p>

<p>You&#39;re deliberately trying to redirect the discussion away from the claims you made which you know you can&#39;t support, because you are an intellectually dishonest coward and a liar. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You leafs really are garbage and incapable of critical thought. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s hilarious coming forming from the complacent piece of shit that can&#39;t even control their own government. </p>

<p>Fuck, and even knowing perfectly well about all the horrors and atrocities the money <strong>you</strong> provide them with funds, you don&#39;t even have the decency to so much as relocate to avoid financially contributing to the war effort. </p>

<p>It&#39;s revolting. You barely even deserve to call yourself a human being, prioritizing your convenience above the lives of actual people, even as we speak. </p>

<p>By choosing to continue living in the place that demands you contribute to the war effort for the continued privilege. You can speak out against the American government from anywhere in the world, you just choose not to because moving would be &quot;too much of a hassle&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s downright revolting that you&#39;re making excuses for it when you know this to be true. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And how much has that amounted to? Like damn near everything else that comes out of your mouth; nothing. Not a damn thing.<br/>
People like you are the reason this shit continues unabated: to cowardly and weak to do anything about it no matter how much they know. You&#39;re not even willing to stop helping them! Just thinking about it makes sick. </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t believe anonymous Facebook post, filled with claims you&#39;re incapable of defending, and provided by an organization which repeatedly lies to my face to be true? </p>

<p>Oh noes! We bombed what you claim to be mercenaries hired by America!</p>

<p>How will we ever live it down?!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No Canadian participated in the invasion of Iraq. </p>

<p>Afterward, during the occupation, while a few people with Canadian citizenship did participate, Canada never did. The only people involved militarily were the 40 to 50 exchange officers on loan to the US and UK, and it&#39;s not up to us what they do with them. Just like it&#39;s not up to them what we did with the men received in exchange, which was not allow them to participate. </p>

<p>So no, not really. </p>

<p>We didn&#39;t have a choice regarding Afghanistan. <em>You</em> invoked Article 5 of the NATO charter, requiring <em>all</em> NATO members to assist you, whether they want to or not. </p>

<p>But at the end of the day, I don&#39;t have a time machine. I can only control what I do right now, and unlike yourself, I choose not to willingly contribute to the wealth of atrocities you insist are occurring with <em>your</em> money, at <em>your</em> behest. </p>

<p><em>You</em>, on the other hand, simply make excuses. Just look at yourself, so cowardly that you can&#39;t even admit responsibility for your ongoing voluntarily contributions. People like you are the reason America gets away with what it does, too lazy to do what&#39;s right. </p>

<p>I&#39;m upset because they&#39;re not really bombing ISIS, they&#39;re bombing Assadists who are protecting their own sovereign country from proxy armies funded by the West (including CANADA)</p>

<p>And what evidence do you have to rebuke me? Witty evasions and distractions, but you asked me to provide sources for the fundamental claims for which I have.

    <div class="md"><p>The Duran reported in a post entitled, “Why the Syrian conflict is not a civil war”…</p>

<p>Alfred Marder who, is the President of the USPC firstly acknowledged that the US peace and anti-war movement has been in a state of confusion about Syria and that this has caused division within the movement.</p>

<p>He explained that the domestic tactic used by the US government to sway US public opinion, is, to demonise the leader of whatever country the US is targeting.</p>

<p>“Whether it’s Noriega, Hussein, Gaddafi, or Assad, there’s a definite pattern here”</p>

<p>He said the story the US people have been told about President Assad and Syria have been purposefully false. Concerning the reporting he said</p>

<p>“This is not accidental. This is designed to confuse people’s opinions on these Leaders.”</p>

<p>Jamison was blunt in his assessment and likened this quote to the dangerous attitude of so many Americans who think they know about Syria and President Assad but “….what they think they know, just ain’t so!”</p>

<p>In his opinion the US motive is to destroy Syria as an independent secular Arab state and make it compliant to US interests and policies, like Iraq and Libya have become since the US invasions and bombings of these two countries.</p>

<p>Just like Libya before the NATO bombing, Syria has universal free healthcare and free education from childcare through to university.</p>

<p>Jamison pointed out that the US government supports Jabhat al-Nusra and other groups (whose names change often) who they claim to be ‘moderate rebels’ but who in truth are not moderate in any way and are affiliated either with Al-Qaeda or ISIS.</p>

<p>He mentioned the foreign backed mercenaries (ISIS) are fuelled by the Wahhabi doctrine which he described as</p>

<p>“a sick medieval and backward ideology driven by the Muslim Brotherhood with its genesis in Saudi Arabia.”</p>

<p>He affirmed his opinion by describing how so called ‘moderate’ Jabhat Al-Nusra mercenaries beheaded a 12 yr old boy during the time the delegation was in Syria. There is nothing ‘moderate’ about beheading a 12 year old boy.</p>

<p>The other major story they shared was the generally unreported sanctions that the US has imposed upon the Syrian people.</p>

<p>The US government claims the sanctions target the Syrian government. However they are actually aimed at wearing down the resolve of the Syrian people.</p>

<p>The US has imposed sanctions similar to the ones Iraq experienced before the invasion, which even the US admits killed half a million children.</p>

<p>Syrians cannot get baby formula, common medication, medication for chemotherapy, child immunisation etc.</p>

<p>These sanctions are so insidious that they affect medical clinics throughout Syria because they are unable to get parts for machines used in medical practice. Think: X-ray, CAT, MRI machines right down to dentists drills.</p>

<p>President Assad has claimed from the beginning that there was no uprising and that the country was being invaded by foreign backed mercenaries. Gaddafi said exactly the same thing when NATO started bombing Libya.</p>

<p>Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<p>The same scenario was acted out in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and now Syria: invaded and bombed into submission without any politician, general or complicit media representative tried or held to account. There is not even an acceptance of error or a conciliatory voice of remorse.</p>

<p>“The campaign to confuse the American people has been intense.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You basically need a &quot;Million Man March&quot; for an extended period of time across several, several major cities across the US.  So you need several tens/hundreds of thousands of people to quit their responsibilities and go and protest at city halls, capitols across the nation.  But it needs to be well organized, people need to have specific demands, it needs to be a movement, and it needs to have good leaders.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of people willing to follow, but very few who are willing to lead.  And be wary of those who are, because it is a rare person that leads as an equal.</p>

Small, and local power moves, strikes, civil damage, etc.. guerrilla tactics.</p>

<p>Real, tangible movements. Mass arrests would be the best case scenario. Many other people have said in this thread, that is seems hopeless because people are so fucking comfortable with their lives. Unaffected, uninterested. That is the majority. 
There is a small group of people like us. There are many other small groups outside of this place that would join. Hell, think of Native American tribes.

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing, you can&#39;t do anything. You need co-ordinated action and that isn&#39;t going to happen with 2/3rds of the country sucked in by the BS currently being spewed by presidential candidates. Anything you do try to do will be crushed before it starts. You are not taking on a bunch of elderly crooks who don&#39;t know what they are doing, they are well practised and their interests are well and truly covered, backed by a powerful army - also on their payroll and the scenario you face has been engineered very carefully and methodically and &#39;they&#39; are not about to let a bunch of upstarts shut down the party.</p>

<p>Normal everyday people can&#39;t agree on jack shit, they need to be led, they also need to be convinced of the cause. Right now, convincing someone to throw away everything they have to join some half arsed militia probably isn&#39;t the best proposition and any traction gained will go to shit fast without co-ordination and and end game that you are pushing towards - with solid, unwavering agreement among constituents. If you&#39;ve nothing to offer outside of some faint hope things might be better at some stage, then it&#39;s even less reason for anyone to be upset enough about to want to start fighting. The best you can hope for is that society slowly crumbles and the whole cycle repeats itself again without too much bloodshed, famine and misery, with the inevitable new blood rising from the ashes. Another pretender to the throne, someone else to bullshit the people for their personal gain and well being. Create an empire with friends and like minded people, control trade routes, resources and commodities. So you&#39;re straight back to needing a plan and you have to have one that works and takes everything that&#39;s happened so far into consideration so a &#39;brave new world&#39; isn&#39;t just another in a long line of doomed societies and cultures. Talking of cultures, those and religions will be your other enemy, existing regional groups and associations will bind people. </p>

<p>When you sit down and think about it, you have to realise what is happening and try and eek out an existence within that framework, because in this day and age, trying to pull down the establishment even in the slightest way, will quickly result in incarceration and/or death on a larger or smaller scale. It&#39;s one thing being aware that you&#39;re getting shafted but another to realise that the odds are massively stacked against you and that&#39;s the way they like it and how it has been orchestrated so for centuries. The information isn&#39;t hard to come by, now it&#39;s a google search away and the irony is that those who hold the reigns of power no longer try and preserve the &#39;secrets&#39;  of their business and also know that trying anything to undermine them is a fools errand. Changing the world order is a whole other proposition.</p>

<p>Because it can decentralize the bulk of production to the individual - effectively limiting the voraciousness of the Capitalism buying our Democracy without sacrificing ownership to the State, as in Communism and Socialism.</p>

<p>Our country is corrupt largely because the hierarchy you described gives massive amounts of wealth and control of resources to a few people who, despite any best intentions, are invariably corrupted by the warped reality which money and power provide. To defund and reduce the power of the hierarchy, we need to stop needing their stuff and their protection. We are controlled mostly by our inability to respond en masse to large threats, by our dependence on what they stock on the shelves, and by what information they put in the textbooks. Our ignorance, our vulnerability, and our dependence on material goods doled out by Oligarchs: land, water, food, transportation, electricity, clothing, shelter; our consumerism and attachment to material wealth; our wasteful tendencies; our apathy toward politics and law - these are our chains. </p>

<p>Growing our own food, and using the incredible low-technology and amazing versatility of 3D printers to create most of our material goods, via not only home use but public Maker Spaces, can cripple the ability of massive conglomerates to buy media coverage, buy elections, buy politicians, and thereby dictate policies which allow them to continue robbing the rest of us blind, poisoning us, mis-educating and lying to us, and experimenting on us, while profiting from the fruits of our labors like we were cattle. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we need organized assaults on the laws regarding property ownership and taxation in this country. No one here owns any land. Look at a deed; it says you&#39;re a tenant; a lessee. And you pay rent on your land, in the form of property tax, in every State but Washington, where ridiculous sales tax makes up the difference. Similar problems with water rights, and these insane perpetual contracts that conglomerates like Nestle have to raid billions of gallons of water, for fractions of pennies per gallon, and then sell it to us for dollars per cup, while farmers go bankrupt from drought. And similar contractual rights of oil and gas cartels, Big Agro, Big energy, and Big Chemical to rape the land and leave poison in their wake for us to deal with. </p>

<p>It will involve an attack on Citizens United, and all the limitless, anonymous campaign spending. We need public campaign financing, guaranteed airtime, and guaranteed debate participation for any candidate who meets the required number of signatures. We need to get rid of the caucus system. We need to impose Congressional re-election limits, remove the ability of Congress to vote on its own pay raises, get rid of the electoral college system, and audit, then dis-assemble the Federal reserve; returning the power and responsibility of printing money to the US Treasury. </p>

<p>And it will involve a lot more people studying Legalese; studying the terms of the law. Our ignorance of the legal arena of warfare is perhaps our most crippling weakness. The rulers have devised Legalese as a kind of code language hidden in plain site. It is spoken in the local tongue, but with alternative definitions used for all kinds of words. And courts hold those different meanings as law, not the meanings you&#39;re used to using for those words. So they can get you to agree to all kinds of things, admit to things, and contractually bind yourself to diminished rights by speaking this foreign language in your own dialect. It&#39;s invasion of the word snatchers, and we need to take our language, and thereby our legal system back. In particular, copyright and patent law are stiffling human ingenuity and progress to considerable degrees, while serving as a legal conduit to ensure the vast wealth of very few people buying up all the rights to processes and information in the world. And corporate law is taking over and superseding our nations&#39; and the world&#39;s court systems. We need to stop them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask an anarchist. We&#39;ve been interested in peaceful revolution for years.</p>

<p>Violence is easy, but it doesn&#39;t solve the problem, even in the short term. The goal is to reduce the demand for government, to reduce the supply, and to restrict its powers.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Privatize things that the government cannot do better than private industries. No need for a public post office or printed money when we have UPS and cryptocurrencies.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduce or expose state income and the money flow between the explicit state and implicit state. Turn civil forfeiture into dispensary taxes and expose the deep relationships between industry and government mandate. Drive wedges between government and the education industry, for example, by moving to open-source textbooks rather than forking it all over to Pearson.</li>
<li>If you hate both candidates, don&#39;t play their game. You will be upset either way, so resign yourself to being slightly more upset while making a protest vote for other parties who will seek to destroy the 2 party system.</li>
<li>In your own personal life, learn to rely less on government. Educate yourself so that you can school your own children, or so that you can undo the propaganda they are fed in public schools. Get off of whatever government money you are receiving. Forget social security, start saving for your retirement on your own. Defer to authority less, and solve problems on your own when possible. Do not ask for laws to help you solve problems. Solve them yourself, preferably legally and certainly morally and nonviolently. Give to charity, even if in small amounts. Prove to yourself that you do not need to be trained like a dog to be civil. Prove to yourself that you are a human capable of everything your self-proclaimed masters are.</li>
<li>Erase the hierarchical mindset. No one is better than you inherently. No one is smarter than you or more capable of understanding complex issues.  Many people know more than you do, but you can fix that in 6 months to a few years, depending on the topic. No one is worse than you. Almost all people are capable of being better than they are today, and a world with smarter and stronger people is a better one.</li>
<li>Shift power to the local sphere. Take action in your local government to make good decisions and prevent further reliance on or invasions by a corrupt government.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1: Awareness.</p>

<p>This is the very first thing you need to do. Your media is corrupt as fuck as well, and thats why the Leaks wont reach as far as they need to. So in order to fix that, you need to spread this stuff yourself. </p>

<p>How? First, the Internet. Use memes, post websites, do videos, whatever. Spread the information, and where to find them (wikileaks) far and wide, while also creating a centralized hub for people to discuss this stuff and collaborate spreading it more.</p>

<p>After you got plenty of netcitizens aware, spread it in RL. Contact your local media, regardless how small it may be, and direct them torwards the info. Push them to write articles and do reports about this stuff. If several people are contacting the same newspaper or whatever at the same time, then chances are they at least take a look. Keep doing this until the whole thing explodes by itself. </p>

<p>Step 2: Now it gets complicated. Your goverment is corrupt, and likley will try everything possible to avoid being fucked over. You can try it the normal way, and completly avoid Dems and Reps by going third party, or just walk into DC and take over. No idea what you could and should do really, im not even American so its not really my place to talk about your future, even tho I will be affected by whatever the fuck you guys pull over there.</p>

<p>One thing tho: Whatever you do, dont sound like conspiracy nuts like OP does. Base EVERYTHING you do on the facts you have, not on some theories you cannot proof. Otherwise you will just be ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For any action to be initiated there has to be a tipping point of public awareness and anger reached by the general population. But if you&#39;ve scratched the surface of &quot;the engineering of consent&quot; and the depth of the government propaganda and public relations rabbit hole, you&#39;ll know that their control in this area is quite sophisticated and  formidable as it is, at many points of connection, in league with the mainstream media.  </p>

<p>But this type of awareness requires a more astute mindset and the control over the population is statistical - centered around the middle of the bell curve aka &quot;the lowest common denominator&quot;.  That is why it seems our political discourse is so inane - it&#39;s not designed to sway thinking people, it&#39;s designed to sway the largest number of people populating the middle of the bell curve. </p>

<p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/">It was also made legal recently by the NDAA for the government to propagandize the American public</a> which is a bit of legal ass covering since they&#39;ve been engaging in it so heavily. </p>

It will be difficult, these power players really like to hide their own asses. This is an idea, I do not know whether it will help.

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to stop it is if a bunch of companies got together and refused to pay corporate taxes and refused to take payroll taxes from their employees... Its all about the money. Lets just stop giving it to them. Keep in mind, those taxes pay for roads, clean water, schools, other good things...but we should have a say where our taxes go. When you start a new job, there should be a form with a bunch of boxes for different categories, and the people should decide what percentage of our taxes go to which cause.</p>

The water is poisoned, public schools are basically prison training/state indoctrination, and roads should have been mass transit systems decades ago.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea...fluoride. Public schools are not that bad...maybe from a holistic perspective, but my kids teachers have always been super caring. It is definitely true that their school education must be supplemented with at home learning, but we keep them busy with extra projects. I mean, standardized testing is a mess...but they need a way to measure things from a national perspective.</p>

<p>Remember, that at the local gov&#39;t/teachers level, and even at a federal level...things are run by people. There are some lazy folks, some power hungry; but most I have met genuinely care and are trying their best to make things better, at all levels. </p>

<p>I totally agree, we need much better mass-transit. I am hoping Elon Musks hyper-tubes get some Dept of Transportation funding in US. Or imagine a fleet of self-driving solar panel vehicles federally run that park at gathering spots in suburbs, rest areas on the highway and such. You just walk-up, scan your &#39;car tax permit&#39;, get in, and enter your destination.</p>

<p>Regarding tax corruption thru fed hackers, that is a good point, but at least it would give us as individuals some power and I am always hopeful the good people out-number the bad. </p>

<p>Your government is the equivalent of a cheap whore.</p>

<p>Your police force poses more threat to you than any terrorist or gang.</p>

<p>Your police force is also armed to the teeth like a military force. So even if the American military was on your side, they would still get wiped out.</p>

<p>A while back I said that this massive invasion of rights on part of the government need to be seriously checked. EVER DAMN TIME I got multiple responses from people saying at least we aren&#39;t like China/Russia/North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest taking away the motive for people to exploit others. You become self sufficient and you stop working for them. I know, it&#39;s a shock for people but it isn&#39;t all that hard. With tech today you can set up a nice home and live a very simple and basic life. Use your labor to live and barter for essentials.</p>

<p>I wish people good luck if they try to change the system but I think they are heading for a violent confrontation. TPTB have built up quite a military and police force to protect themselves. Non-violent protests such as refused to work for them seem a better alternative. Just imagine if everyone in your country in the 99% refused to work for a week and demanded real profit sharing from their employers. It would be chaos as grocery shelves would be empty, gas stations dry, etc. Total chaos. If TPTB don&#39;t relent then tell everyone to prepare for a 2 week shutdown. TPTB don&#39;t make money when people stop working for them and buying their useless things. Eventually they have to relent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lenin described three prerequisites for a successful revolution: </p>

<ul>
<li>The government is uncapable to rule as before. It&#39;s weak, it&#39;s incapable to perform basic functions</li>
<li>The vast masses of people can&#39;t live as before due to dramatic changes in their living conditions and the wide spread feeling that they do not have anything to lose</li>
<li>The presence of organized party of ideologically very close individuals, capable intellectually, spiritually  and physically to lead those masses towards revolution</li>
</ul>

<p>So, back to your question:</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

Everyone wants more and more instead of less and less. Compare this to India&#39;s revolt against Britain, they were all willing to give up their lives for the betterment of their country. They weren&#39;t afraid of death as people in the west are so when push came to shove they were willing to risk it all.</p>

<p>Just wrote a rather long and thoughtful as fuck reply to this, then hit the wrong key and it got flushed down the intertubes. I have no proof but take my word it was insightful without being preachy and had a few facts that really illustrated my point perfectly. I anticipated all the natural counters to my point and respectfully rebutted them. I was so fucking conciliatory and inclusive you would be putting me forward as the next head of the U.N.</p>

<p>But now it&#39;s gone never to return, the woes of the world will continue and we&#39;re all screwed. Think it might have revolved around rounding up all the descendants of Charlemagne and after purging, there would be digging party&#39;s organised to to get those fucking lizard people sorted once and for all, but the important details are gone forever and we&#39;re all fucked as a species.

    <div class="md"><p>The Super Bowl, March Madness, FIFA, World Series, beer, cars, a mortgage, a family. These are all things governments use to fuck the constituents. Want to really fuck with your government? Take your money out of the big banks. Watch what laws are negotiated and passed during those big events where it is almost guaranteed you&#39;ll be too drunk to notice them.</p>

<p>1- Take your money out of big banks</p>

<p>2- Pay off your mortgage or don&#39;t get one</p>

<p>3- Pay off your credit cards and don&#39;t get more</p>

<p>4- Buy Teslas and Electric cars, walk more, bus more, ride trains more</p>

<p>5- Organize</p>

<p>Edit: Quit arguing over democrats and republicans, they are one and both the same shit. They have both had equal chances at the wheel and nothing has gotten better. They have both let you down. </p>

<p>These are things that won&#39;t happen. Why? Hell, it&#39;s too comfortable to do my banking at the big banks. Teslas are too expensive. Who wants to organize during football season?</p>

<p>Everyone is too comfortable and all these problems mentioned are too ephemeral and unreal to us. Nobody can actually imagine billions of dollars in cash exchanging hands in Iraq or where ever else corruption takes place. Unless it hits you right in the face, nobody wants to leave the comfort zone. So we all zombilly throw our arms up, act indignant for a few minutes, and go back to the game lest we miss an awesome pass and can&#39;t talk about it on Monday. </p>

<p>More Edit: tried to fix the formatting on the list</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shed ideals of globalism. Instinctively follow urges towards national sovereignty. Realize that the liberal/left agenda is the most harmful influence in society and politics today.</p>

<p>Vote with your dollar. It&#39;s not just a cliche. Educate those around you if you have the information yourself.</p>

<p>The last 26 years of activity in the U.S. has really devastated its foundation. If we can make people realize that the best movement is towards restoration of the foundation, that would be the best way to begin fixing the problems.</p>

<p>There are so many problems now that I&#39;m not sure resolution is politically possible. There is going to be one of two outcomes: people passively surrender (which is possible with liberals being such a massive portion of the population, believing the Trumps are hunting stegosauruses) or there is a grass roots usurpation of the political class. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve missed the boat in so many election cycles.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t ultimately think anything can be done. There are way too many divisive and insidious influences functioning within politics and society at large.</p>

<p>Stop voting for the political class. One of the biggest complaints I hear about trump with people I actually talk to is that &quot;he has no political experience.&quot; That translates &quot;he&#39;s not a member of the political elite, so I don&#39;t trust him.&quot; But when you tell them the political class got us here, it&#39;s like running into a wall of circular, impenetrable logic.</p>

<p>Not that I think Trump is a great candidate, but the mindset is prevalent and illustrates a major obstacle.</p>

<p>I could sit here and list 500 things that need to happen just to get us to a semi-legitimate state of governmental function, all politically neutral, and those arguments would be debated until the ruination of the country comes.</p>

<p>We needs to remove lobbyists entirely, and we need to remove any Jewish influence from all levels of government. Period.</p>

<p>But we are left with a divisive wedge. People say to stop buying into the left-right paradigm. But we are divided as such. People believe that government&#39;s function is to protect and insure them, and others believe government&#39;s function is to be small and erect an equitable system of rules through which we all have opportunity.</p>

<p>Naturally, one side is going to be the eternal enemy of the other. These divisions create splits and distortions; an existential tug of war with no civil remedy.</p>

<p>We need to reinstate the death penalty - and use it frequently - on the political class. That would take care of most of the problems today. Clinton&#39;s trial would take 5 minutes, as would Lynch and Comey&#39;s, Bush Sr, Jr, 50% of Senate and the Congress, Soros, and the list could go on quite extensively.</p>

<p>If we could just create the standard that politics aren&#39;t sexy and lucrative, then we&#39;d be well off. Politics should be a place for people who want to WORK for the people, creating a nation with rules that are beneficial to them and their families. Right now we are rewarding them with wealth for selling off pieces of the country.</p>

<p>If anything should be lucrative, it&#39;s whistleblowing. Bounties. $500,000 for a whistle that gets someone impeached. $1,000,000 for a whistle that results in trial execution. $250,000 for a whistle that results in a trial. Create an incentive for individual, private whistleblowers, political detectives, to operate. I&#39;d much rather see the money we&#39;re sending to the Middle East and the Jews going into the pockets of vigilant and patriotic Americans.</p>

<p>Obama almost had a good a good plan with his civilian security force. But, instead, let&#39;s use that force to keep him and his cronies honest. The Civilian CIA. Take over the Utah data center and claim it as a base of operations. We paid for it, afterall.</p>

<p>These politicians and elites think you&#39;re dumb, useless eaters. And they may be right. But where they&#39;re wrong is not realizing they&#39;re the truly useless ones. Humanity survives just fine without any of them. It is our labor and ingenuity that built the world. All they can do is destroy it (and themselves).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing they fear the most is cultural unity and the voting power that goes with it. They have been trying to destroy this since the early 20th century. This is evident in the recent native-American and Indian revolts. They love a divided, multicultural, individualist, materialist population and hate a unified one.</p>

<p>People need to know that if they form communities and come together on every issue and form opinions on everything and stop tolerating everything, they will have power. Corporate money is fake. People are real. And they are only going to be used if they can be bought. They definitely don&#39;t want people to be critical of everything they promote in society and on an international level.</p>

<p>Stop falling for their distractions of gender war, pro-mental illness, pro-race racism, saving the world, minority concern (anti-democratic)... etc. Start coming together as separate cultures and divide their labor pool and remove their political control. Break up the concept of the big power nation and start recreating the borders that used to keep people safe from intrusion and safe from interference.</p>

<p>First we need to make a list of all the definitely corrupt people in the government and start with them. Here, I&#39;ll start:</p>

<p>Obama &amp; Mooch
Holder
Hillary
Bill Clinton
Chelsea Clinton
Huma  Adbdin
Nancy Pelosi
Diane Feinstein
Mitch McConnell
Paul Ryan
Lois Lerner
Loretta Lynch
Joe Biden (he has to know what is going on and be party to it)
Comey of the FBI
... 
please feel free to add. We need to make a list, get all their addresses, and then decide what we are going to do with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve almost given up. People are lazy and the American people tend to be extra lazy it seems. We&#39;ve lost the moral backbone and fortitude to do what needs to be done to admit that what we have now has failed and wipe our collective slate clean. We&#39;re too busy voting for the next superstar on America&#39;s Got Talent or The Voice to worry about doing research and voting our conscience for the next batch of people that will lead our country. We&#39;ve become totally fine with choosing the &#39;lesser of two evils&#39; because finding &#39;no evil&#39; is a bit too much work for the average person.</p>

<p>In 2013, I though the Snowden revelations were going to send people to the streets and voting boxes. It didn&#39;t. I had hopes for Occupy Wall Street, that fizzled. What hope is there left? Can a small group of committed Americans fight the propaganda and brainwashing machine that&#39;s the media, the government, and our own fellow citizens to become victorious and get a country that <em>actually</em> works for us instead of the upper ends of the upper end?</p>

<p>What do we do? I have absolutely no fucking idea.</p>

<p>TLDR: Use ads from corporate media as a guide for boycotts. </p>

<p>Armed revolt is literally just another excuse to expand the police state and another avenue for their divide and conquer approach that&#39;s worked perfectly thus far. They need us to keep buying their stuff for all of this to keep humming. The ballot box is useless (if not outright forfeit); <strong>We really vote with our dollars.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder what would happen if a group of people went to a police station to talk to the chief with all this evidence organized (&quot;beyond misinformation pdf&quot; AND &quot;wtc 7 evaluation results&quot; AND COG proof) and then kind of &#39;lobbied them&#39; and said, &#39;can we count on your station to protect us from these criminals and not, you know, shoot us all to death because you get orders from washington&#39;?</p>

<p>If we all did this to local stations, I&#39;m sure there would be a big problem with any kind of &#39;martial law&#39; ideations from above, once the groundswell of dissent is in place.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, many of these guys fought for our country long ago or did so under the undestanding they were protecting us.  Although they might not like it, if you present it to them as &quot;we were all lied to, but we know you do what you do for US not for Washington&quot; there going to be some people who really listen and respond favorably to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the biggest consuming nation in the world, it is the world that relies on us in these difficult times. Putting in some rules to protect americans and bringing back jobs will help the people here, with minimal balking from the other nations.

<p>As for allies, we alone can nuke the whole world 100 times over. The biggest risk to the world is another cold or hot war with nations we keep poking at like Russia and China. Why can&#39;t we have better relations with them? Hillary would start WW3 with them. Ukraine and South China Sea  were perfectly fine in relation to our national interests until Obama/Hillary decided to stir up those hornet nests. We need to be strong, but not interventionist.</p>

<p>Between looking for upvotes and revolution orientated posts which have no research or manner behind them besides &quot;Fuck the government,&quot; there is clearly an abundance of people lately, who think that they know enough to able mindedly abstain from corruption. I mean how fickle and stupid can you be to think that it is the government that controls you? In the first place, there are nameless corporations which hold a lot more power over the government than what political entities hold over you.</p>

<p>To think that a revolution is enough to relinquish oppression and corruption is childish and naive at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying he makes the point that billionaires who seek to screw anyone &quot;less&quot; than them are bad. 
Valid point, correct? </p>

<p>Trump is a billionaire, who uses Mexican labor, who criticizes others for using Mexican labor, who stiffs American contractors forcing legal fees upon poorer people. </p>

<p>Trump is part of the problem. Sanders is/was the answer. 
He wanted to make sure dicks like Trump who pay less in taxes than the middle class but hold onto the majority of the wealth, and have tax havens like Panama got their come uppance.</p>

<p>Then use the Taxes for something good. 
Like not a useless wall that will do nothing than give Republicans a racism boner. 
Rather bolster the US with education investment, Healthcare! Legalizing marijuana which as seen in Colorado brings in a TON of money.</p>

<p>Oh yeah it also cuts spending on privatized prisons meaning more money. 
With all this extra money health care and education can be a thing. 
Then the future will be smart and healthy! </p>

<p>Holy shit then America will be great. 
Because it hasn&#39;t been great for a long time.
In fact we are a 2nd world country. We are about as smart as dirt on average. We lead the world in ego thats about it. </p>

Like his inability to run a company much less a country? 
His friendship with Hillary Clinton his 1%er attitudes 
His ties to the same evil Islam people he talks about? 
The Russian mob? </p>

<p>Yeah no he is of no help, and I&#39;m far from ignorant neither candidate in this race is something that will make a change, both mainstream candidates are shit such shit in fact that they have record high disapproval rates. </p>

<p>She wants to be the first woman president and spend money on stupid shit.
He wants to spend money on stupid shit and use nukes.</p>

<p>Both of them make those points VERY clear. 
Government corruption is too far along that a president will matter.
It&#39;s ignorance from people LIKE YOU not me that perpetuates this bull. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not time to hope a liar will ya know not be a liar.
It&#39;s time for an overhaul. Rewrite laws that are set in ignorance, write laws dictating who can hold what offices. 
Comey for example is VERY unfit to run the FBI he has 0 law enforcement experience. </p>

<p>Clinton and Trump can both run for president but by no means are they experienced in the slightest to run a country. 
She has no idea how laws work, he is a shady business man who skirts tax law to ensure he has lower than middle class tax rates (as do most 1%ers) and preaches that he is some hard working Messiah.</p>

<p>In reality he has others do his work tries to not pay them, and takes credit for everything. 
He speaks &quot;everyone loves me&quot; he is literally brainwashing his followers. They&#39;re so far up his ass that despite record disapproval rates when he says &quot;everyone loves me&quot; his following get hard-ons and believe him. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Ego vs Control </p>

<p>Neither of which have a place in a leadership role. 
And it&#39;s safe to say that both are so hated that it seems inevitable that attempts on their lives will be a thing.</p>

<p>I expect both to have 0 transparency (so more of the same) and to hide behind closed doors in fear of their lives </p>

<p>I mean more power to you but the pros and cons of both candidates are fucking abysmal. 
You seem to be Republican minded so I can see why you take everything Hillary says as evil. Hell she&#39;s likely lying about most of it anyways I am not voting for her.
But at the same time you&#39;re putting an idiot on a pedestal.</p>

<p>They BOTH are playing keywords to gain votes. 
&quot;BUILD A WALL! EVIL MUSLIMS!&quot;
&quot;GUNS! 9/11 WAS BAD! OH NO&quot; </p>

<p>you&#39;re being played by 2 sides of the same coin. 
As is most of America. Sanders was the best option for any hope of 1 man change. Why? Because he was effectively a third party candidate running on the big stage under a guise as it was.
He would have shaken up everything and corruption is a fragile thing it&#39;s just very well protected. </p>

<p>Ie; Snowden it was right there but you had to get inside to do anything. </p>

<p>Trump is literally just a Reagan copy. Seeking to make his private profits sky rocket while cutting his own taxes. 
And get in dick measuring contests with foreign nuclear power. 
Which the powers that be will GLADLY let happen we need a war to fees the banks we need a war to put banks in Syria and remove Russia </p>

<p>Trump and Hillary are the keys to that. 
Either one will do fuck all in office and end up starting something for our overlords. </p>

<p>You&#39;re getting shit on by the rich man. </p>

<p>But it seems you&#39;re more concerned with assuming things and painting myself in a very stenciled light so you can regurgitate propaganda and make me out as a Hillary supporter when in reality as I have said both candidates are shit and it makes you seem like you can only argue nonsensically with Hillary supporters, forcing me into a mold I don&#39;t fit in because I have negative thoughts on your candidate of choice.</p>

<p>Same with Hillary supporters, criticize her and you&#39;re immediately a Trump supporter. </p>

<p>Two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Also you seem REAL shill like. In a &quot;hello fellow kids&quot; way trying way to hard &quot;get woke bro&quot; spouting the same bullshit I could hear from the Conservative propaganda media arm </p>

<p>If someone needs &quot;woke&quot; I think it&#39;s you. 
Both candidates have pros and cons. 
But both candidates have cons that HEAVILY outweigh their pros. </p>

<p>So my vote will be that of third party to attempt to break the country away from corrupt 2 party fascism. 
Which you&#39;re playing a part in again enjoy you karma when Trump gets us nuked because let&#39;s be honest Hillary isn&#39;t winning</p>

Said his name was John Doe.  He was very friendly, ate dinner with these people and was always at the meetings.  These nice people that brought pot luck dinner and discussed how best to petition the government or to protest certain things didn&#39;t realize that John Doe the software guy/accountant (or whatever he said he did) was actually an undercover policeman that infiltrated their little political group until he was killed in a car accident unexpectedly and his picture was on the front page of the paper.

I don&#39;t like the selective coverage the news does.  Do you know how big that anti war rally was before going into Iraq in NYC?  Nobody does because it wasn&#39;t covered.  And its not getting any better either.  You&#39;ve got a small amount of people controlling what people are exposed to and they keep buying each other up.  The people that are trying to tell the truth and actually report are blown off as &quot;bloggers&quot; not press.  Press ask prescreened questions in fear of losing access and get the front row seats while the more independent reporters ask actual questions that haven&#39;t been or need to be asked.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure service oriented systems makes sense but its a long road to there from here.</p>

<p>The reality is that basically the whole planet runs on this system or its appendages, including us.  Another thing I believe is that what we know as government in the context of current monetary systems is &#39;corrupt&#39; by nature.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the solution is to start over, revolt and reset to some kind of constitutional libertarian utopia, try to create some kind of socialist technocratic utopia, or anything like that.   I think the solution is to gradually decentralize and take advantage of technology to do that in a way that allows holistic views and cooperation when necessary but still allows the system to evolve freely.</p>

<p>Anyway I think its going to be gradual improvement.</p>

US government attacked Syrian citizens with chemical gas. Lied and blamed it on Assad. Russia is allies with Syria and stepped up and told the US to stop. Now US citizens are being told Russia is on Assads side going against his own citizens. This makes the US citizens more likely to agree to invading Syria or helping the rebels. US government has been funding Islamic Rebels to fight against Assad and his army. Killing thousands. Innocent families. Probably like you and I. Could you imagine just sitting at home with your family, then BOOM, a bomb come out of nowhere ? Leveling everything around you. Killing babies and children. Or injuring them badly. And hopefully someone finds them under all the rubble from the building before they die.
Just sit and think about that for a second. 
That is what the God ol USA is doing to Syrians and at the same time spreading PURE PROPAGANDA! Putin has warned his citizens of possible nuclear war if US keeps up the killing. Obama hasn&#39;t warned us of anything. US IS THE REAL TERRORIST. Only thing you ever really see in the US is propaganda and fearmongering media. Scaring everyone about Muslims and ISIS rebels (whom the US created, funded and trained.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha I&#39;d love to join, but really, how would a non-American even join? lol.</p>

<p>I looked through the doc you posted and I respect its general message but many of the points don&#39;t work for Europe.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have &quot;states&quot;, we do have provinces but those don&#39;t have their own government in any way. Our provinces aren&#39;t as souvereign as American states are.</p>

<p>Also, I respect the &quot;right to bear arms&quot; but that doesn&#39;t really exist in Europe, here in the Netherlands, even having as much as a small gun is virtually impossible and open carry is just fantasy.</p>

<p>We do have a constitution but it doesn&#39;t resemble the American one and we don&#39;t have any amendments at all.</p>

<p>Things like the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights etc are things we don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>Not to mention the small parts about Christianity. Europe has become very seculair and the Netherlands is one of the most seculair with something like 70% atheists. Building a militia based on &quot;gods nation&quot; or anything like that would fail here.</p>

<p>Like I said, the militia seems great and I&#39;d love to join or even help set up a European chapter but while the ideals and goals of the Militia seem perfect for the United States, they don&#39;t work in Netherlands and pretty much nowhere in Europe.</p>

<p>Still, I love the ideals and hope the best for the Militia but its made for the laws and people of the US, not the Netherlands, Italy or Russia or anywhere in Europe for that matter.</p>

<p>All of the 9/11 conspiracies have been debunked. I&#39;m not talking about a snopes article either, I mean there is hard data countering all of this &quot;Bush did 9/11&quot; foolishness.</p>

<p>You are right about the foreign aid and the wealthy having the power... but when you start talking about 9/11 and act like it wasn&#39;t a terrorist attack, you lose credibility and many people that would otherwise support your opinions (we don&#39;t need to send money out to other countries, we need it here for Flint and other places) suddenly realize that they&#39;re not going to be with the side that understands how things work in real life if they support you.</p>

<p>Every single time someone posts this 9/11 crap, they have already made up their mind and no proof in the world will tell them otherwise. But the truth is that they don&#39;t really believe it themselves. People protested by the tens of thousands for gay marriage, which could be argued as a luxury (I support it, I just mean people are starving and the first concern is to have gay marriage legalized) and out of all of these truthers, I only see posts online, there are no organized protests because none of it has any credibility.</p>

<p>Maybe your fundamental problem is your belief that if one goes against the &quot;fire brought down the towers&quot; logic they are also in your &quot;bush did 911&quot; group. &#39;Ignorance&#39; is &#39;ignoring&#39; everything in between like some people just wanting to know why this is the only instance in human history that a building imploded due to fire from an adjacent building 350 feet away, or why engineers and scientists who have looked at the rubble found thermite and other evidence that goes against the official reports but make a lot more sense rationally?</p>

<p>I provided you a list of a thousand people who have college level education in the principles of how buildings are made saying something is fishy but a crazy guy on a politics forum is enough proof for you to make your own educated opinion that they are all just stupid?</p>

<p>This is your expert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdNkRyt3S0oTQQdzlKJtXyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdNkRyt3S0oTQQdzlKJtXyg</a> ?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, someone with that name exists. I can look up dozens of no name engineers and put them on a list of big foot witnesses... that doesn&#39;t mean it is true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done though. You&#39;re the one who believes that your government killed thousands of its own people but you&#39;re sitting on reddit instead of doing something about it. If you actually believe 9/11 was an inside job you&#39;re literally the opposite of a patriot because you haven&#39;t done one damn thing about it. You&#39;re just a talking head with no courage to stand up for what&#39;s right. That&#39;s not a personal attack, it&#39;s just true.</p>

<p>Let me ask you something. Are there <em>any</em> credible mainstream scientists that you trust to know more than you on the subject 100%? Because not one intelligent credible person believes the 9/11 conspiracy joke. You&#39;re only making a fool of yourself with this. I tried to show you the light. But you might as well believe in big foot or the loch ness monster if you&#39;re going to be that unreasonable..</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t agree that people like Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking know more about <em>everything</em> than we do, you are unreasonable. Go see what their opinion is on 9/11 being an inside job, you&#39;ll be laughed away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not attempting to bring race into the discussion.</p>

<p>That said, the Black Power movement is a great starting point for thoughts and patterns dealing with oppression, community building, and bypassing the system.</p>

<p>AFAIK, this is the most recent group of Americans who were openly oppressed by the government and set out to deal with it pragmatically. Oppression was a part of their daily lives and people started to feel that they had nothing to lose, which is the catalyst that is required to enact change. </p>

<p>Edit: I keep forgetting the religious alt-right have become the core audience of &quot;alternative&quot; thought.  You are just a micro version of the same system you claim to despise. The old guard all know you&#39;re pacified with bibles, &quot;guns&quot;, and a fear of dark skinned people. How about you stop fucking your shotgun barrel and put your weapons to good use you cowardly fucks.
Where&#39;s your stupid fucking god?
Are you pissed that you haven&#39;t been taken by Jesus already?
I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re cowards because I don&#39;t want to live under your religious extremism. Fuck you assholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US government attacked Syrian citizens with chemical gas. Lied and blamed it on Assad. Russia is allies with Syria and stepped up and told the US to stop. Now US citizens are being told Russia is on Assads side going against his own citizens. This makes the US citizens more likely to agree to invading Syria or helping the rebels. US government has been funding Islamic Rebels to fight against Assad and his army. Killing thousands. Innocent families. Probably like you and I. Could you imagine just sitting at home with your family, then BOOM, a bomb come out of nowhere ? Leveling everything around you. Liking babies and children. Or injuring them badly. And hopefully someone finds them under all the rubble from the building before they die.
Just sit and think about that for a second. 
That is what the God ol USA is doing to Syrians and at the same time spreading PURE PROPAGANDA! Putin has warned his citizens of war, Obama hasn&#39;t warned us if anything. Only thing you every really see in the US is propaganda and fearmongering media. Scaring everyone about Muslims and ISIS. 
THE US IS NOT THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD</p>

<p>If that is Gods idea of covert I would hate to seem him being obvious.</p>

<p>Truth is he doesn&#39;t exist. Otherwise so much suffering wouldn&#39;t be allowed in the world and there would be atleast some form of proof.</p>

<p>If God existed he wouldn&#39;t be stupid enough to expect everyone to believe without leaving some form of viable evidence. A real God as described biblically would leave hard evidence for the children he loves, protect them, and if they wander try to pull them back. If God couldn&#39;t then atleast he tried. </p>

<p>But God does nothing and Jesus does nothing and there is nothing to prove either exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born to two aggresive alcoholics and the rest of my family were disinterested in the fact I was being raised by a mentally troubled alcoholic mother who herself grew up in care. When my dad left at a very early age I was left with one alcoholic who could barely function herself and visiting another when it suited him. When I was 11 he left me in his flat on christmas day, dissapeared for 11 hours to drink, came back called me an ungrateful cunt because i didnt want the WKD he brought me then kicked me out and left me wandering around with nowhere to go. So that pretty much ended that for a while though I would make the same mistake of thinking the grass was greener later on.
I have been homeless and hungry at an early age aswell. 10 years ago when I was 14 I was hanging around bins near a kebab van so I could take the half eaten kebabs people threw away and try and salvage what I could without eating the bite marks and sleeping in fields. When I was 15 me and my friend had a sleeping bag each that we stole and ate whatever we stole during the day. From 16-18 I lived in Youth hostels and when I was 19 I lived in an adult hostel before I couldn&#39;t pay the partial rent we had to pay and then I went to prison for 2 and a half years for robbing two partnered drug dealers who turned snitch. I then couldn&#39;t find any job but one that pays less than a minimum wage 8 hour a day job but you have to work 16-17 hours 5 days a week (So basically you work the first 8 hours for just under minimum then the next 8-9 hours for free). I quit that shit but am left unable to get any other job so theft might be the only way forward.
God has done me zero favours. Its me myself and I and survival doesn&#39;t fit in well with the bible if God isn&#39;t answering your prayers. Look out for number one. Fuck everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again that ment nothing. I could replace good and evil or God and Devil with any words from mythology and it would work.</p>

<p>The powers that be are evil yes because they help to orchestrate wars and civil unrest for profit at the expense of blood. But that doesn&#39;t prove anything in terms of God.</p>

<p>Again that doesn&#39;t prove that God exists it just means your enviroment, family, lifestyle, friends, upbringing, dna, or whatever helped shape you into a caring individual. Its no coincidence that most murderers, thieves, gangbangers etc... come from poor or abusive or both backgrounds.</p>

<p>I would argue it isn&#39;t the evil people who are cowards but the good people. As Albert said &quot;the world will not be destroyed by evil, but by those who do nothing to stop it&quot;. That is exactly whats happening today &quot;good&quot; people to scared, selfish or whatever to stand up and do anything.</p>

<p>Sorry pal. Keep your beliefs by all means but unless you can justify existence to me, even with minor hard evidence, im not interested.</p>

<p>God is meant to be sought out through love and spirituality. It makes sense as well, we are not necessarily as intelligent as we think, especially to determine whether or not there is an all knowing God out there or not. </p>

<p>Personally, I think it&#39;s mostly our ego. <em>GOD</em> needs to show himself to me, <em>GOD</em> has to directly answer my prayers to be worthy of <em>MY</em> belief. </p>

<p>No its logic and critical thinking. If I was buying your house or your car you would want evidence that I paid you or that I could pay you. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t sell me your stuff.</p>

<p>I would love for God to be real the world would be a better place if he was as powerful, loving and fair as he is made out to be. The world however is the best proof no such deity exists or existed.</p>

Imagine if everyone did live the way Jesus intended? That would be awesome. Accept Christ, acknowledge that you are a sinner, and ask for forgiveness.</p>

<p>And like I said before as well. If you do believe in God and the Bible. You would also believe in Satan. And I do think the works that he has in play in the world currently are pretty effective. He is the second smartest being to God. If you also believe Satan is real, google, &quot;Did Satan create Islam&quot;. And that&#39;s pretty interesting as well. </p>

<p>The bible says you need true faith to get into heaven and it also says without works(good deeds) faith is dead. So actually you do buy your way into heaven with good deeds.</p>

<p>Well I personally think its a load of controlling propaganda. I respect real christians because they are a worthwhile addition to the planet. Part time christians however are just annoying. They preach God but follow the ways of satan. Nothing more annoying than a hypocrite.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean that&#39;s where it gets interesting. Like if you do accept that Satan is real, he would be the king of the Earth. Now his main objective is to separate people from God. God said that the world is damned and not to be attached to it. That does make sense in terms of how nothing tangible or earthly will sustain your soul. (If you believe in a soul) Sure there is suffering and such. Although nothing can save you from spiritual suffering other then God. In the end we all die anyway, and spirituality out ways everything else in the big picture. </p>

<p>Then why haven&#39;t you committed your life to helping others, including the time you spend on reddit and you could also sell your computer and feed a few more poor people? God said to sell your possessions and give to the poor how are you talking to me right now?</p>

<p>Life is God. So living off the land, the plants and animals, is holy. Anything else is materialistic and anything materialistic is the product of satan.</p>

<p>When jesus was taken by the devil he was shown all the material wealth of the world and told this could be his but he said no I take eternal life. But you can&#39;t have both. &quot;A spring cannot produce both salt water and fresh water&quot; so also can you not claim to be of God and yet be of the Devil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and the messages are everywhere. The way to get a strong connection is by eating high vibration food. God vibrates at the highest frequency in the universe. Eat fruits and high vibration foods, in turn making your being a high vibration being, which will allow you to pick up on God&#39;s vibration. God is all knowing, you know God when you get all knowing. Comes off arrogant saying I know everything but I do and everyone else can too if they follow those instructions and keep a clear mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you considered that modern-day Christianity and its denominations&#39; presentation of the Jesus figure are potentially skewed and/or distorted? Surely the institution of religion that has committed crimes against humanity throughout history is a rather &#39;unhealthy&#39; enterprise. If you are an apologist, from which denomination do you draw your explanations and derive discussion? Permitting the truth of the existence of the Jesus character, I think it would be reasonable to assume that his teachings have been coopted for less altruistic ends; the propagation of fear and rendering believers to be subjugated by their faith appears to be the more apparent agenda of the less-thanbeneficent side of humanity. There remains an interpretation of the Christ archetype that Gnostic texts have provided. I have only begun to contemplate this rendition of the Christ figure, but from what I gather there appears to be less emphasis on the paternalistic and domineering view of a &#39;god&#39; that demands worship and an elucidation on the &#39;divine&#39; nature within and without each and every being. So I ask you friend, from which view do you derive your perception? Does your awe of the visionary experience prompt a sort of knee-jerk kowtow and demand your senses to acquiesce at something seemingly greater than yourself? Do you bow your head in solemn deference to the outwardly appearance of some deity or god perched upon his nimbus of regnant omnipotence? Or do you see something... something alluding perhaps your own &quot;unknowable truth?&quot;</p>

<p>But, if someone with more experience or the time to do a proper investigation was to pick a single point of clear law breaking, and compiled enough evidence to present a good case; if it was high profile enough, there are maybe some possibilities to approach the money hurdle like crowd funding.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make I guess is that taking a high profile person to court is no different than taking your neighbour. It may just be much more work. As long as what you are saying in your case is true, anyone can learn as they go and eventually compile a good enough collection of evidence and knowledge.</p>

<p>I just thought this video rang out as one possible option.</p>

<p>There is no doubt there is corruption in the courts. But, even having your case thrown out or not heard might be enough to spread the word and enlighten more people.</p>

They don&#39;t trust sources on the internet which are legitimate, instead trusting a heavily biased media! </p>

<p>2 reasons why. First off, we have one of the most transparent governments in the world so bribery would be difficult at best.

Unfortunately, while it sounds like a good idea, it would never work. The American people have been brainwashed into believing that harming one little hair on one of our dear leaders heads is horrible and makes you a terrorist. Their sympathies lie with the master at the moment. Any person trying such a thing, I fear, wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the government to come and snuff them out. Their neighbor would likely be their biggest enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is wrong to go this route before actually attempting to participate in the Congressional election system. If you haven&#39;t tried that avenue, it&#39;s no wonder it hasn&#39;t worked. Elections are this November and they&#39;re direct, popular votes. You can fire your representative with very little effort and replace them with a better one, but you HAVE to participate from the primary onward.</p>

<p>Until I see this genuinely attempted, it will still be the most sensible, effective course of action we have. You can tell me all you want that the system is too corrupt for our congressional votes to work, but that&#39;s a blanket assumption based on abusive systems like the electoral college.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> no electoral college in Congressional elections. Go out there and vote your fucking mind. You <strong>can</strong> choose your candidate if you participate in the primaries, and we get a chance every two years to make this change. We just never, ever do. We continue to call the government as a whole corrupt while ignoring our Constitutionally guaranteed right to hand-pick our representatives. <strong>Wake. Up.</strong> We <strong>already have</strong> this power, and this is <strong>no</strong> time to take it for granted.</p>

There is no protest against government, there is a proxy army paid and funded by united states and Israel. Tell me why anyone would call it a &quot;protest&quot; who rightly knows otherwise? I don&#39;t care what that message looks like, if it looks like &quot;Russian Propaganda&quot; or something else, I really don&#39;t care, because it&#39;s correct.

All of what he has written is provable, there is no &quot;Arab Spring protests&quot; against governments, there is only PAID mercenaries that go by the names Daesh, Isis, Al-nusra, all the same fucking mercenaries funded by Israel and America. What do you think we&#39;re doing there? It&#39;s not like this is breaking news, this  has been reported many times before for the last 3 years. Hell, Putin himself says it, so does Hillary Clinton. This is not some conspiracy theory, it&#39;s reality. Again, what do you think we&#39;re doing in Syria? Fighting ISIS? Hah!</p>

<p>It&#39;s never existed in reality.</p>

<p>Communism, by definition is a classless society. Every &#39;example&#39; of Communism has a very clear leading party. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You make money by exploiting people under you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You make money for the government.</p>

<p>...no? In theory that money helps you. The issue is capitalist greed keeping that money away from you. Capitalism is the reason you hate the government. It requires greed, and greed causes corruption. Communism, and other Socialist policies relies on sharing and empathy. Actually caring about fellow man. </p>

<p>Take away their monopoly on violence first. Then burn the place where they sit to &quot;earn&quot; their paycheck. </p>

<p>They will crawl under rocks and hide. Drag out the ringleaders, and hang them by their necks until they are dead.
Elect sheriffs, and hold public elections, with paper ballots, and ink stains on thumbs, just like the third world nation we are.</p>

<p>Put the faith community in charge of community services, and require some number of hours of community service per work week from each individual as a condition for voting rights.</p>

<p>Start over.  Don&#39;t nationalize anything that doesn&#39;t need to be nationalized. Sheriffs should regulate public utilities like waste water and water treatment facilities, with State plumbing boards in charge, and the IBEW in charge of power distribution. A temporary suspension of metering should be instituted, with a resumption from square one scheduled six, or twelve months in the future on an assigned date. </p>

<p>Put everything to a public vote, until Americans are sick of it. By then, things should be functioning on a baseline level. </p>

<p>Capitalism will win the day. Barter and trade in the hard, early days, and institute backed currency hard and fast. Free markets always win the day.</p>

<p>When people get that slap in the face and realize that when they try to dominate others, they might swing from a street light, watch everybody try to out-do each other with their &quot;civic responsibility&quot;.</p>

<p>A new age of civility. Of course, things will be tough in a lot of places. I suspect it will be easy in Texas, among other places. Texans don&#39;t generally have a problem with taking responsibility, or looking out for the common good, or doing what is right, or being polite. </p>

<p>I suspect the lights will stay on in Texas, and probably Louisiana, and Colorado, and Arkansas. There would probably be a minimal disruption in services for producing members of society. The entitled population will migrate to other areas, or fall into step with the new civil society. 
Capitol cities, like Austin, will experience a sharp population decline, quickly, as a lot of the entrenched criminals will run away, and leave the Capitol building and a bunch of houses in west Austin vacant. Good fuckin riddance.
Then, it will be back to work for the rest of us. There will be a lot of opportunities for a lot of disenfranchised people to step up, and take their place at the table. 
A new meritocracy. That&#39;s what we need. </p>

<p>The people that have all the power don&#39;t need your help. When faced with taking sides with an individual or the most powerful sociopolitical system on the planet, chances are the individual could use your sympathy more. Creating an environment where siding with the powers that be seems like the right idea is an age-old technique used to divide us against each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Just like I said above where he believes that only Congress is authorized to declare war, he was a strong proponent of the separation of powers. You can believe what you want, but the executive branch—at least constitutionally defined—is not the legislative branch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, ok, but Ron Paul is (was) a legislator in the legislative branch. So I don&#39;t see the relevance of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t second guess you, but I&#39;m going to predict that you will say that he&#39;d somehow steamroll his &quot;sanctity of life&quot; bill through Congress as president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m not speaking to this point at all. It&#39;s not relevant what he <em>would</em> do in an office he&#39;ll never hold. It&#39;s sufficient to demonstrate the phoniness of his &quot;libertarianism&quot; merely by demonstrating what he <em>did</em> do as a sitting US Representative - attempt to legislate his socially conservative views on every American, consistently, every year he served in the House.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although, you kept using the phrase &quot;banning abortion&quot;, and I knew of no bills that had any such language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No (well, few if any) bill that bans something uses the phrase &quot;X is now banned.&quot; &quot;Banned&quot; is just a way that we describe the prohibition of an act, or possession of an item, by force of law or other means. Certainly a law that has the <em>effect</em> of it being unlawful to obtain an abortion is a law that can be described as &quot;banning abortion.&quot;</p>

<p>As you say, the laws were proposed as the <em>Sanctity of Life</em> acts. In your view, is it consistent with libertarianism for Congress to take an official stance, and enforce by law, what Americans are to hold <em>sacred</em>? I don&#39;t see how it can be, or how that bill can be viewed as anything but an attempt by Ron Paul to hold <em>all Americans</em> (since it would apply anywhere within the borders of the US) to his own individual notion of religious sanctity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because doing something like that goes against everything he stands for...which is the Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he doesn&#39;t stand for it. That&#39;s my point. We can judge what he stands for by his activity as a legislator rather than by what he merely pays lip service to. And that activity as a legislator betrays him as someone who believes the Federal government is a tool to enforce his social views on Americans. Anything he <em>says</em> he believes about Constitutional limits on Federal power is merely an attempt to mislead people and gain their support. That&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you, ignore what he <em>says</em> he believes about Federal power and the libertarian view, and look at what he <em>acts like</em> he believes about Federal power.</p>

<p>Back in 1854, there were just three Muslims in what was then Upper Canada. By 1871, there were 17. This rose to 478 in 1921, 1,800 in 1951, 33,430 in 1971, more than 253,000 in 1991, and over 1.05 million during the last census in 2011.</p>

<p>Over this period, the percentage of the Canadian population that is Muslim has been doubling approximately every decade. In 1901, 0.0009% of the population was Muslim. As of 2011, it was 3.2%. When this consistent century-long growth rate is extrapolated into the future, Canada becomes a majority-Muslim country before 2050.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overall, their root cause is money problems in the US, the Tea Party is focused on the government debt, and Occupy Movement was focused on social and income inequality (or in some cases, anger at corrupt rich people).</p>

<p>Generally they both support major services, such as education and welfare.</p>

<p>The tea party&#39;s solution was to basically make illegal immigrants get no benefits and still pay taxes, and the Occupy movement was mainly focused on getting the government listen to the people.</p>

<p>aka both groups are generally monetarily progressive, tea party is generally socially conservative but they want to plug up the ballooning deficit somehow. For example, the Tea Party dislikes abortion but have stated that their main focus was not abortion policy, as they&#39;re economically focused.</p>

<p>The tea party&#39;s downfall was that they trusted too much of money they raised to Super PACs with supposedly similar &quot;conservative&quot; goals, but then they would use the money to do other things that didn&#39;t go with the tea party ethos.</p>

<p>The Occupy movement on the other hand focused around social protest to change government. They helped restart the conversation about increased minimum wage.</p>

<p>They wanted Washington to tighten regulations around the banking industry and arrest &#39;financial fraudsters&#39;.</p>

<p>A lot of their demands were ignored by government.</p>

<p>These two groups have one UNCOMMON goal: Tea Party is against taxing the rich, while the Occupy movement wanted a Robin Hood Tax.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Overall we have two groups undermined by the government with a root cause based around economic unrest. Both groups wanted to tighten up regulations to get money from fraudsters (whether from banks or illegal immigrants). Both appear to be starting to run dry of funding and members now, and seem to be on the tail end of their respective movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea...fluoride. Public schools are not that bad...maybe from a holistic perspective, but my kids teachers have always been super caring. It is definitely true that their school education must be supplemented with at home learning, but we keep them busy with extra projects. I mean, standardized testing is a mess...but they need a way to measure things from a national perspective.</p>

<p>Remember, that at the local gov&#39;t/teachers level, and even at a federal level...things are run by people. There are some lazy folks, some power hungry; but most I have met genuinely care and are trying their best to make things better, at all levels. </p>

<p>I totally agree, we need much better mass-transit. I am hoping Elon Musks hyper-tubes get some Dept of Transportation funding in US. Or imagine a fleet of self-driving solar panel vehicles federally run that park at gathering spots in suburbs, rest areas on the highway and such. You just walk-up, scan your &#39;car tax permit&#39;, get in, and enter your destination.</p>

<p>Regarding tax corruption thru fed hackers, that is a good point, but at least it would give us as individuals some power and I am always hopeful the good people out-number the bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After giving this quite a bit of thought myself and continuously deducing the right course of action. I came to the simple conclusion to do absolutely nothing. If things get bad, move. It makes complete sense that successful leaders need to be ruthless, and ruthlessness is not inherently moral or good. Understand as individuals we contain control but hold little power, where as in a group we gain power but lose the ability to control the group for long (using moral measures). In conclusion I believe humans are inherently corrupt and are to easily controlled by our primal needs and emotions which is in where lies the problem. Even if you fix it, were bound to go right back to being corrupt, look at history we kinda suck.</p>
