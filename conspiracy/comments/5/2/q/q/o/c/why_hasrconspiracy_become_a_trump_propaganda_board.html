       Trump sucks but Hillary is everything we are against here.   She is the enemy.  Shes exactly what the US needs to purge from its system.  She will continue with the war mongering/profiteering just likes shes always done.

       At least with trump we have a chance for something dramatically different.  I hope.

       Sorry if that came out snappy, I'm just frustrated. I got people I know who think Colin Kaeparnick or whoever not putting his hand over his heart is ruining America who, when you explain what a dumpster fire the US and world would become with Trump at the helm just shrug, giggle, and say, "At least it would be something different!" 0_o

       Hillary proving conspiracies and cover ups and government corruption isn't pro Trump. She is validating what this sub is all about,  unfortunately for her, it is due to her own choices and mistakes.

       "Hillary bashing" and "Trump propaganda" are not the same thing. There is some pro Trump crap here but the Hillary bashing is a vindication of some of our kooky, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy's being true. It's titillating.

       He has the support of many alternative right leaning people, who while being educated and informed, sometimes fall into the trap of believing that we can vote our problems away. Naivete is a great weakness even amongst this crowd, also I'm sure some people come here posting pro Trump knowing how much Hillary is hated around these parts.

       Hillary hate does not equal Trump support. Most of us here hate them both but Hillary is everything we should be against. One is a loud-mouthed hypocritical idiot who only cares about his own ego while the other is a hypocritical lying warhawk who does not have the best interests of the American populace in mind. Team Coke or Team Pepsi, we should know by now it'll be business as usual anyway. #VoteGiantMeteor2K16.

       Trump has talked about conspiracies himself, so we identify with him, while Clinton has a record of dodging and being shady. Trump was a proponent of the birther conspiracy of Obama, thought 9/11 had some funk to it that needed to be dug into and he also has gone on record stating that he has greased palms of politicians for pay to play situations. He also has loose ties and affiliation with Alex Jones with the "9/11 was an inside job" concept. The only thing Hillary has really said that would appease us is UFO disclosure, but with her track record, it would be a crap shoot of how full that disclosure is.

       Because trump may not be ideal, but as far as i know, he hasn't had any one murdered. Plus, the general consensus is that hillary has already been decided as prez, trump can't actually win, so it's important to keep a spotlight on the person who will be running our country further into the ground soon.

       All I can think is that a state actor seized on the opportunity to link anti-Clinton sentiment to any conspiracy they can find.  The result is that a lot of moderate right-wingers have jumped on every conspiracy bandwagon they come across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you know the right-wing email lists?  I got a forwarded story this morning about a nice Russian couple that has a pet bear... Headline was "enough talk about politics" -- Right.

       My theory: Trump has allotted a more significant portion of his advertising budget for online PR and astroturf as opposed to traditional print and tv inventory.  Probably a good move since it's cheaper, more targeted, and can appear to be native grassroots support.

       In what universe does anti-Hillary mean pro-Trump? I'm (not) surprised that others aren't chiding you for "accepting the two party narrative" (not because I've not seen anyone here sharp enough to even think of something that deep from a post like yours).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could rape children and he'd still be squeaky clean compared to Hillary. And guess what? He hasn't. Nor done anything else of even questionable intent.

       Hillary's corruption is so obvious , she is creating easy content and jobs in conspiracy theories. She said it herself.

      <p>
       Trump is Trolling Americans with the Cold truth. He isn't going to make it better, Trump will walk away, he doesn't give a fuck.

       Yeah, Trump can go fuck a cattle prod, but at least I haven't spent the last 20 years reading about his corruption including multiple murders, and commercial drug trafficking.

       Because it's run by people who support Trump. There are ways to equalise the coverage but they refuse. All the uncensored subs, which normally I love, have been taken over by organized Trump shills. And the admins allow it. They probably organize on voat. But just see how this mild post is being brigaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everything posted about Hillary is a lie. But the mildest truth about Trump is brigaded down. Which I find interesting. Historically. A lot of what we think about ancient rulers were lies spread by their opponents, such as the lie about Catherine the Great dying while copulating with a horse. Or a lot of stories about Caligula or Nero originated with their political opponents or with critics hundreds of years later, men who could not have known what they did or did not do. The lies had more staying power than the truth. As I suspect the lies about Hillary and President Clinton will.
