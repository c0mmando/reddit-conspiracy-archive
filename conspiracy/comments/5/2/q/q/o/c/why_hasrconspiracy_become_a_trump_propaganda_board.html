    <div class="md"><p>Trump has talked about conspiracies himself, so we identify with him, while Clinton has a record of dodging and being shady. Trump was a proponent of the birther conspiracy of Obama, thought 9/11 had some funk to it that needed to be dug into and he also has gone on record stating that he has greased palms of politicians for pay to play situations. He also has loose ties and affiliation with Alex Jones with the &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; concept. The only thing Hillary has really said that would appease us is UFO disclosure, but with her track record, it would be a crap shoot of how full that disclosure is.</p>

<p>In what universe does anti-Hillary mean pro-Trump? I&#39;m (not) surprised that others aren&#39;t chiding you for &quot;accepting the two party narrative&quot; (not because I&#39;ve not seen anyone here sharp enough to even think of something that deep from a post like yours).</p>

<p>Trump could rape children and he&#39;d still be squeaky clean compared to Hillary. And guess what? He hasn&#39;t. Nor done anything else of even questionable intent.</p>

<p>Almost everything posted about Hillary is a lie. But the mildest truth about Trump is brigaded down. Which I find interesting. Historically. A lot of what we think about ancient rulers were lies spread by their opponents, such as the lie about Catherine the Great dying while copulating with a horse. Or a lot of stories about Caligula or Nero originated with their political opponents or with critics hundreds of years later, men who could not have known what they did or did not do. The lies had more staying power than the truth. As I suspect the lies about Hillary and President Clinton will.</p>
