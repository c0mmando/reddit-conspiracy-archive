       He's holding her up, but that doesn't mean she isn't wearing handcuffs. Her arms never raise. When you trip your body's natural instinct is to raise your arms, but hers remain behind her back

       5 downvotes in 11 minutes eh? And now the vote counter has been removed it seems? It's not a low quality post, so that means I might be saying some things that aren't supposed to be said... They'll try and keep it off the 'rising' section, this always happens anytime a big thing gets hit on

       Okay I see it now, I see the very last second before she gets in you can see her left hand go in front of her body. I think I'll delete the OP in a few minutes after I think about it some more

       Hi.  I'm one of the five downvoters.  :)  I didn't downvote because "you were saying things that shouldn't be said," I downvoted because it was fucking stupid, and I have this wish -- I know, I know, it's crazy -- to come to this sub and read up on what the latest CIA regime change/coup is.  What I really need to do is go to r/actualconspiracies and stop browsing this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, mystery solved!  It's not bots or CTR, it's pissed-off blond girls like me who are sick of reading trash.

       Doesn't seem likely since the FBI cleared her of charges. Plus it looks like she really did pass out or had a seizure. We should know when the first debate happens, they can't use a body double for that.

       Yeah I'm starting to realize this theory doesn't have legs. I can see her arms come apart right as she gets in the van, looking at it more closely
      </p>
      <p>
       With the body double for the debate: Can't they, though? Aren't all the questions pre-scripted?  I mean it would definitely be more difficult than just a walk-and-talk but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibilities

       Not sure if it is scripted, but if there really is a big problem with her health it will prob be announced right before the debate. I just can't see a body double being able to perfectly imitate her voice.

       I mean I could imagine someone whose actual job is to perfect their Hillary impression just in case they ever need it, so it'd probably be a very good impersonation. But like you said, it's probably more likely that they'll just call off the debates for her (or Bill's) health reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then there's 2 more debates after that

       Yeah, or the Secret Service. Or some 4th organization.

       This election is very good theater, but I think too many people are starting to realize it's a show because it's getting so outlandish. That means they'll have to bring things to a climax to draw everyone back in. Probably with a false flag and then a war. I'm so tired of them getting away with starting wars.

       Definitely a deep state organization, that's for sure. As for the rest of what you said, sadly I think you are right. Something has to give. We are going through a great awakening, and the TPTB know it (maybe caused it). I too am sick of these endless wars.. sigh.. There is a perfect storm coming and that scares the shit out of me...

       Agreed, and it's extremely hard to tell how much of this perfect storm was engineered as a sort of next-level trap for humanity, vs how much is just organic shitstorm from overcoming natural human ignorance and shortsightedness. I want to say it's like 20/80 based on everything I know, but I'm scared it's more like 70/30. But it could be 5/95 for all I know and I could be overblowing things, or it could be 100/0 if this reality is a pre-written game or simulation. It's literally impossible to know for sure. Just gotta take it a day at a time, I guess...

       Alright I'm going to delete the OP. On closer inspection you can see her hands come apart right as she enters the van, you can see her left hand pass in front of her torso

       Yup, I got proven wrong, and I now have a more confident grasp on what is reality and what isn't. Hard to say that's a bad thing
