<p>Hi.  I&#39;m one of the five downvoters.  :)  I didn&#39;t downvote because &quot;you were saying things that shouldn&#39;t be said,&quot; I downvoted because it was fucking stupid, and I have this wish -- I know, I know, it&#39;s crazy -- to come to this sub and read up on what the latest CIA regime change/coup is.  What I really need to do is go to r/actualconspiracies and stop browsing this sub. </p>

<p>Anyway, mystery solved!  It&#39;s not bots or CTR, it&#39;s pissed-off blond girls like me who are sick of reading trash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t seem likely since the FBI cleared her of charges. Plus it looks like she really did pass out or had a seizure. We should know when the first debate happens, they can&#39;t use a body double for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m starting to realize this theory doesn&#39;t have legs. I can see her arms come apart right as she gets in the van, looking at it more closely</p>

<p>With the body double for the debate: Can&#39;t they, though? Aren&#39;t all the questions pre-scripted?  I mean it would definitely be more difficult than just a walk-and-talk but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outside the realm of possibilities </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I could imagine someone whose actual job is to perfect their Hillary impression just in case they ever need it, so it&#39;d probably be a very good impersonation. But like you said, it&#39;s probably more likely that they&#39;ll just call off the debates for her (or Bill&#39;s) health reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, or the Secret Service. Or some 4th organization.</p>

<p>This election is very good theater, but I think too many people are starting to realize it&#39;s a show because it&#39;s getting so outlandish. That means they&#39;ll have to bring things to a climax to draw everyone back in. Probably with a false flag and then a war. I&#39;m so tired of them getting away with starting wars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely a deep state organization, that&#39;s for sure. As for the rest of what you said, sadly I think you are right. Something has to give.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, and it&#39;s extremely hard to tell how much of this perfect storm was engineered as a sort of next-level trap for humanity, vs how much is just organic shitstorm from overcoming natural human ignorance and shortsightedness. I want to say it&#39;s like 20/80 based on everything I know, but I&#39;m scared it&#39;s more like 70/30. But it could be 5/95 for all I know and I could be overblowing things, or it could be 100/0 if this reality is a pre-written game or simulation. It&#39;s literally impossible to know for sure. Just gotta take it a day at a time, I guess... </p>
