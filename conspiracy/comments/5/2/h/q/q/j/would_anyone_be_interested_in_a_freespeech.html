       I'm just throwing this idea out there to see if there's any interest... I'm trying to learn Python and this might be a good challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has been taken over from within and from the outside for quite a while now, as a trip to
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/HailCorporate">
        /r/HailCorporate
       </a>
       ,  or
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       will quickly show you. The shills are far, far out of control, as are the admins and mods. The vote brigading is endless, and ubiquitous. Anything outside of the mainstream is typically culled from the major subreddits. Reddit remains free to use because it is an excellent thought /interest monitoring and propaganda system, useful for private and government interests alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're thinking: just go to voat. Voat sucks. I tried it for a while, but it falls victim to exactly the same issues that reddit does, and has an odious community which precludes popular traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       My idea is to recreate a reddit with free-speech as a core value and moderator/administrator transparency by design. As a companion to this, I envision a replacement for the up/downvote system that relies on a few basic tags-- agree/disagree, complex/simple, well sourced/rhetorical, suggests a product, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea here is that shills, propaganda, weak posters, and advertisements will very quickly accumulate an abundance of user-reported  "simple", "suggests product", and other similar tags, allowing people to filter them out. This will also encourage deep, well sourced, and open minded discussion, which I would like to be the primary product of the site's comment threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the kicker: I'd charge a buck a month for access to the site. Aside from providing for operating expenses, this would also dissuade casual propaganda drivebys like we see here whenever Russia or Israel makes foreign policy moves. It'd also disincentivize sockpuppeting, etc-- but I'd probably want an additional system for that as well. The end goal is a free speech community that is fortified against the slow-corruption that we've seen take Digg and Reddit, among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, what do you think? Worth a dollar a month, or is that too much? Any ideas?

       I've had similar ideas as well. I'd go crypto-currency if you were to charge. At the end of the day, there are inherit tech and legal difficulties in creating a site like reddit. You need lots of money, or you go decentralized which has it's inherit risks as well. Whether it be downloaded software (small user base) or the sharing of illegal (but encrypted) data on ones computer. If you do decide to do this, just know, they will find you and try their damnedest to shut it down. Know that what you are looking at is climbing a mountain 1000 x's taller than mt Everest.

       I don't want to be a buzzkill, but I'm a web developer who is also a "conspiracy theorist" and have experienced what the spooks/TPTB do to opposition (JFK).

       i don't envision this as a conduit for illegal data... at this point i'd say it's not for filesharing either. i'm not too worried about it getting shut down by virtue of illegal content.
      </p>
      <p>
       besides, it's not widely accessible opposition by design. charging a dollar and trying to keep conversation relatively intelligent is enough to keep the userbase small and therefore not worthy of violent attention.

       I know you don't, but thinking agent provocateurs wont do it to sabotage the site, is kind of naive. Also, people are fucked up on the internet, you have to understand that and the task you are trying to do. It's really more of thinking this out thoroughly, all aspects. That's all I'm saying. Running a website like reddit is no small task (admin-modding-legality wise). I'm more just hashing out an idea with you, coming from experience is all. I'd love a website were freedom of speech is king, I'm just saying reality is a bitch in the world we live in today and the forces who are against it...

       ah, well, critical thinking is not an option (rather, it's a responsibility, 100% of the time), even on this hypothetical website. it's highly unlikely that anything i put into place would be 100% effective, just vastly better than the cesspools which don't have some basic protections.

       Absolutely! When you do, make sure to abolish the practice of targetting and manipulating user's comments and posts. Reddit is either using bots or there are certain agenda-driven personnel who have a list of targetted users that they punish by driving their comments to the middle or bottom of the page of posts. This has happened to me and others persistently and it is NOT an accident. It even occurs across the different subgroups.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same targetted user's posted content is also deliberately driven off the page and out of existence by stealth downvoting. When I first noticed this happening I just thought it was odd until I saw a consistent and definitive pattern emerge. That my friend is Stasi-like censorship in action and where is the redress for such actions?
