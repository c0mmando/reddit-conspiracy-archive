    <div class="md"><p>The myth of the flat earth has actually always been used as a tool for this purpose.  It started as an enlightenment parody of the church to point out their &quot;anti-science&quot; ideology.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_flat_Earth#Historiography_of_the_flat-Earth_myth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_flat_Earth#Historiography_of_the_flat-Earth_myth</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_thesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_thesis</a></p>

<p>what&#39;s so interesting about its resurgence as a tool against &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, is that it really is the same group acting as proponents.  It&#39;s the Scientism (Science<sup>TM</sup> as a religion) crowd - militaristic atheists/ radical secularists who promote a humanist agenda and technocratic society with reductionist and leoliberal ideological argument.   This is an aspect of the new enlightment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have pondered the same thing, that science is the new dogma people thrust their faith in. Every time you see peoples grasping at scientific papers like science can&#39;t fail. We&#39;ve seen stellar advancements in the field of science in the last century, disproving earlier findings, but we still put our blind faith in what scientist and experts are feeding us. </p>

<p>The recent article about the sugar lobby proved nefarious forces were trying to influence our thoughts<a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-sugar-industry-coverup-20160912-snap-story.html">, as recent as the 60&#39;s.</a>The tobacco industry has tried <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/media/07adco.html?_r=0">this</a>. Even to this day this strategy <a href="https://realitieswatch.com/scientist-attacked-for-proving-gmo-dangers-wins-defamation-suit-in-french-court/">is being applied.</a></p>

<p>I recently read an article that goes into more depth. It&#39;s called <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/science-as-the-new-religion/5433889">&quot;Science as the new religion.&quot;</a> by Tony Cartalucci.</p>

<p>As another person notes below me we should always keep a healthy amount of scepticism, may it be the government, experts, or scientist. They are still people, and they can also be wrong, or make mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s such a philosophically hypocritical concept.  you can&#39;t prove positives.  the entire point of science is the process and evolution.  it&#39;s not static.  the &quot;It&#39;s Science&quot; crowd is inherently flawed in its foundational premise.  And where there is such obvious hypocrisy, you have to read in between the lines for the true agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s a strange loop considering you can&#39;t prove that statement.  So any concept which relies on that premise should be viewed with immediate SKEPTICISM.  But they&#39;ve managed to coopt that word and concept too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the impression for a long time now that flat earth and some other very ridiculous ideas are counter intelligence products. For example, whenever you see good videos about UFO phenomena, and I mean the good ones that look into it scientifically you always get suggestions of wacky flat earth conspiracy.</p>

<p>I know at least 6 people who have seen a real one, whom i trust and i know they can distinguish a satellite, airplane or meteorite from a UFO. All of those find flat earth ridiculous.</p>

<p>I had the long term impression and it got proven by the snowden releases for me, that those are counter intelligence acts to make any credible but unwanted topic look suspicious for someone who does not look into more details.</p>

<p>Any platform with enough users will attract the attention of those groups and will get spammed. With some really good analysis, some of those trolls could be exposed i guess. very much depends on the effort they put into to hide their tracks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are professional made video productions about just about every conspiracy topic there is. The aforementioned 9/11 theories, for instance. <em>Loads</em> of high quality productions around that topic.</p>

<p>I know people <em>in real life</em>, face-to-face, who believe the Earth is flat and who devote a lot of time to spreading the word and &quot;educating&quot; others about their beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP, and I&#39;m not gonna discuss the things you&#39;ve mentioned as in my experience those who have faith in the concave earth theory tend to disregard any skepticism of their affirming experiments. That said, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re stupid if you believe in such things as skepticism on any front is a healthy mindset. I do however have a few questions for you, if you truly believe in the concave earth.</p>

<ul>
<li>How come when I climb up high, either in a tree or to the roof of a building, and look out towards the horizon I see no concavity?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if I have a set of binoculars the further out I look the more convex the earth appears. Considering I&#39;m high up in the air I should be able to see some sort of concavity, even without the aid of reference poles.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we account for gravity?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know a popular theory is that gravity does not exist and instead we are experiencing a type of simulated gravity from the centrifugal force. However, gravity is an observable phenomenon without the aid of rotation. So if gravity exists, and the earth is concave, then anything on the axis of rotation would be pulled toward the center, and disintegrated by the sun (assuming you believe that is real). Now let&#39;s say gravity doesn&#39;t exist, how do you convince the millions of STEM students that they <em>really are witnessing</em> such a phenomenon if there isn&#39;t one?</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we observe &quot;major&quot; red and blue shift in stellar objects?</li>
</ul>

<p>If everything is contained within the earth, then what&#39;s with all those specks of light we see at night. When we observe them and they show a dopplar effect that requires they be <em>quite</em> far away, what is going on? If they are contained within the earth then the earth would have to be <strong>massive</strong> to account for such shifts. People have known the circumference of the earth (which is irrespective of whether it be concave or not) for thousands of years because of how relatively simple it is to calculate. Assuming the earth is concave, how do we fit all these stellar bodies in what must be a relatively tiny space? Are they just an illusion? </p>

<p>I have other concerns with the concave theory but these are some big ones I&#39;ve never seen a good explanation for. I hope you don&#39;t take offense in any of this, I&#39;m genuinely curious to hear your opinions. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would take that to mean you would have to be repeatedly commenting on the users posts, PMing them, or following them around. This would just be a post where the mods choose not to remove or warn comments, and the users calling out those users they feel are shills. If some users decide to then follow those called out, that would likely break reddit&#39;s rules, and those users could face measures by the admins. But I don&#39;t see the post itself as breaking any site wide rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the mods are pretty good at that.  Just use RES and tag accounts, and let the mods do their jobs.  If you have a public source list of shills, watch how fast your name ends up on it.</p>

<p>the problem is that if you start disagreeing with people about details or some conspiracy theories, some people who lack nuance will react and presume shilling.  </p>

<p>interestingly, actual shills use this as part of their defense.  they say &quot;lol, anyone who disagrees with conspiracy theorists is automatically a shill&quot;.  The shill subs actually use that as part of their MO.  They hide behind jokes about how everyone calls them shills.  Helps bring in the useful idiots and gives the shills a nice little smokescreen.</p>

<p>So then you have accounts pop up and try to discredit mods as shills.  And when you have a paranoid group (with some legit schizophrenics and some legit shills and cointel guys, and some legit idiots), it&#39;s easy to turn people against each other.  It&#39;s why you don&#39;t see a lot of cohesion in the conspiracy theory community.  Every conspiracy theorist who gains any notoriety will be discredited by other conspiracy theorists who disagree with some minutae of their thesis as a potential shill.</p>

<p>And then you just introduce something to associate with the group youre trying to discredit.  Anti-semitism, tea party/ republicanism, patriot party/ militia movement, white nationalism/ seperatism, flat earth, islamic extremism, black seperatism, etc.  Now anytime there&#39;s an overlap in beliefs from another controversial ideology, you can discredit any &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; concept.</p>

<p>Do your own due diligence and make your own determinations about who is or isn&#39;t a shill.  Beware of those who call everyone a shill, though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about debunking. It&#39;s actually about manipulating the way we perceive these stories. Creating prejudices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an aside, I did a bout three months of Urban exploring in the twin cities, and St. paul has literally hindreds of miles of tunnels underneath it. Down to a confirmed 7 stories below ground. It is awesome. I onpy got 4 stories down, had a hard time getting there, dropped into a four way below an old 1800&#39;s sewer with a skull carved into the sandstone and lost my cool a bit. The tunnels there stretched out beyond my vision all four directions. There is a whole counter-culture of explorers (and other very strange people) who seek these places out. Definitely there is a goverent aspect to these areas as they are kept secret and carry many utilities. There was even a very strange 80&#39;s looking office door that had strnge signage on it that we were convinced would trigger some alarm if we opened it. Theorized it was a possible escape route from the city under the Mississippi to the airport. Definitely more goes on underground than we know.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something about referring to McDonalds products as &quot;low quality&quot; that leads me to believe this wasn&#39;t written by McDonalds. Do you disagree? I only spent little time browsing through the subreddit but things don&#39;t look good when it comes to critical thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome fellow lizard to the flat earth society.  You are totally right.  I&#39;ve noticed if you post about</p>

<ul>
<li>Freemasonry, which is the common denominator implicated in all the intrigues</li>
<li>Jesuits, also implicated</li>
<li>Catholic church</li>
<li>Alternative Jesus theories or anything to do with Gnostiticsm</li>
<li>Conspiracies involving the US Military</li>
<li>US military enabling global drug trafficking</li>
<li>Luciferianism in the military</li>
<li>Pedo intrigues</li>
<li>Criticisms of Amazon or Google; how their algorithms show bias, suppression or gaslighting or hidden linkages / collusion</li>
</ul>

<p>Then these topics will be downvoted.  While flat earth is promoted, so is david icke, so is George Carlin &quot;it&#39;s a big club and you ain&#39;t in it&quot; and old 9/11 videos (perhaps rightly so, but it&#39;s been posted so many times I believe it&#39;s done as a forum sliding technique to suppress other stuff by diffusion--some argue politics is as well)</p>

<p>These things will get some traction but usually end up with &lt;5-10 upvotes after being immediately and aggressively downvoted to 0</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a fundamental lack of understand about how people work, here. Both in this sub and this thread.</p>

<p>First, there are two spectrum of people on this sub:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>people that want to use it for legitimate reasons and getting to the bottom of what might be actual conspiracies.</p></li>
<li><p>people, probably outnumbering the former, that wait around for people to float ideas, then poke the be give for fun. On occasion these people also drop a totally outlandish post, thinking they&#39;ll get karma for it, not realizing what the two groups actually are. They only get their own group&#39;s upvotes, it&#39;s an echo chamber where then they all sit around waiting for someone to attack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that is all different from when someone from the first group that posts something they think is legit, but us easily debunked by average means. A lot of posts here have huge logical holes, on every side, and one group fights the other.</p>

<p>Honestly, no one gives a shit about r/conspiracy enough to pay teenagers to come in here and fuck around. There&#39;s no hard-hitting journalism, no links to original pdfs of damning documents. It&#39;s just a nested circle jerk that now exists inside a circle jerk.</p>

<p>Downvote away, my pretties!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is absolutely on point. Your conspiracy info / conspiracy noise theory describes what I see.</p>

<p>The vocal majority will peddle left-right political propaganda, absurd theories, things that are absolutely nothing to do with conspiratorial events. This was always the case, but it&#39;s much worse since Reddit itself became a broken model that doesn&#39;t understand transparency and upvoting/downvoting principals which made the site so great.</p>

<p>Through design or lack thereof, at this point, there are so many people who use the sub incorrectly that noise and disinfo is an expected part of the sub. Mods do nothing about shitposts. If they did, they would be accused of censorship. Ironically, there really is no need for paid shills (although they do exist!) on this sub because we do such a good job or burying actual news, resources and facts ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank god someone gets it. I personally think it borders on arrogance to think that this sub is so hugely impactful to anything ever that it takes an organized group being paid for their time and talents to disrupt it. First, once a month someone whines about this sub &quot;not being what it used to be.&quot; That&#39;s too meta to be allowed if there&#39;s organization behind it. The first step to treating a problem is acknowledging one exists, which paid shills wouldn&#39;t let happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit - Big Brother is Watching You</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information on Reddit. If your post contains articles or reveal crimes about the following subjects: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Economic Inequality, Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or certain well connected individuals - if you do, you will become a targeted of their censorship. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Algorithms that automatically detect specific wordings 2) Banning independent media outlets. 3) Subtle vote rigging. 4) Manual removal of posts. 5) Intimidation. 6) Banning of accounts. 7) Allowing Strolling by Chills &amp; Fund-its (it rimes!). It is a very smooth and professional operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Reddit has now fully established a core of loyal followers and employees. If they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t see it, by design not accident. We can&#39;t fully observe the process, nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch <del>17</del> 22! (<strong><em>Example:</em></strong> r/conspiracy)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Reddit</a> has censored most of the independent media, with an increasing zeal, mainly because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. The alternative media punches holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, lies and polarization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> Reddit has become a cesspool of irrelevant trivia and celebrity gossip. Like mainstream TV it is now merely there to distract and entertain us with stupidity. This is how Reddit are dumbing us all down, turning all the forums into a mere shadow of their former glory, echo valley&#39;s full of idiots padding each other on the back.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you think that sub, which is public would work any differently than any other public space?  </p>

<p>People will go for the shiny stupid stuff and disregard the boring actual conspiracies.  </p>

<p>Popular shits are always Trump/Clinton related, 9/11 but only the least plausible stuff, ie &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams lelelelelel&quot; then you have all the foaming at the mouth NASA morons that will spend hours watching at rocks until they manage to see Elvis in there.  </p>

<p>Exactly like any other news sub, most political conspiracies will be forgotten after a month, nobody cares about Jesselyn Radack but everyone will spam &quot;dem commies be taking muh guns&quot; at every public shooting along with more far fetched idiocies telling how every shooting/terrorist attack is fake/inside job so someone can come to your house and steal your granddad&#39;s shotgun.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need shills to make a sub uninteresting/irrelevant, you just need a bunch of idiots.  </p>

<p>And if mods dare to try and make some order out of this mess, they&#39;ll get dragged into the conspiracy theory themselves, cause they&#39;re shills hiding the truth or whatever.  </p>

<p>People on average are gullible idiots, you have to face the truth that heavy conpiracists have an important populations of giant paranoid idiots and deal with it.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t(burns at 900C optimal), but it wouldn&#39;t need to if there were explosives on the plane/already planted on the towers, either by terrorists or whatever. Don&#39;t forget the 3rd tower that collapsed without a plane hitting it. Probably explosives via A: Terrorists, or B: some govt agency, whether it&#39;s ours or someone else&#39;s. Plus fuck the micro nuke shit people are proposing, I think I would notice a gigantic flash of burning/blinding light from one of those.</p>

<p>I think, yes there&#39;s more to that story, but I doubt that our govt did it. Probably a foreign govt of some sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone seen the Tucker Max story &amp; how they taught people how to create controversy for $$$. It&#39;s in the film TRUTH ABOUT LYING (on Netflix ).  It explained that Tucker created fake accounts of people calling him out on being controversial to get the media to talk about how evil he was - thus getting him a book &amp; movie deal.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s def happening with this campaign. 
The funny thing about the internet is that there&#39;s no way of identifying anyone &amp; it&#39;s too simple to have one person run 25-50 accounts without being too noticeable.
You&#39;ll see disgusting racist comments on twitter from random users and reddit and then it&#39;s reported on CNN, Daily Show, etc.  They could be coming from 30 year old adults. They could also be coming from 12 year olds. Or they could be coming from people within Jones camp to make her into a victim. </p>

<p>Perez Hilton also talked about this being part of his strategy when starting his website. </p>

<p>The left is talking about race &amp; sexism in this election. Instead of the fact that the economy is still struggling after 8 years of bureaucrat shadow games. </p>

I used to post on democratic underground a lot. The first couple of years of its existence it seemed to be a legit site.  Especially when it came to the 2000 election and Sept 11. Around 2004 or so, it became painfully obvious that it was not a legit site.<br/>
 One good thing about that site now is that it is a good place to find out if a topic needs more scrutiny or is complete bullshit. All I have to do is go see what a certain group of posters there have to say about stuff. If they are supporting a particular topics or catapulting propaganda,it&#39;s a good bet it&#39;s bullshit or mis/disinformation.</p>

<p>there&#39;s also a lot of nutbars who ramble about their imaginary stuff.</p>

I&#39;m so tired of all the shit posts with zero proof or even correlation to the claimed conspiracy, on top of which you can&#39;t even have a discussion about the issues or ask for clarification on the suspected end game of a conspiracy.

<p>When did r/conspiracy become so closed-minded?</p>

<p>If your post isn&#39;t related to the US election in some way, you get downvoted and called a shill. I&#39;m well aware that shills have a presence on here, and yes they spread disinfo, but to label anyone a shill who takes interest in the more esoteric/fringe conspiracies is quite frankly disingenuous and bordering on paranoid.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going on about people discrediting the sub, but are blind to the fact that accusing everyone of being a shill discredits the sub. </p>

<p>The shills on here are glaringly obvious and they aren&#39;t posting esoteric stuff, they&#39;re <em>correcting the record</em> on the political stuff.</p>

Today on FB I tried to talk about her recent episode, and her seizure in July with a supporter. He linked a snopes article claiming that she never had a seizure, and made a ton of comments like &quot;oh it must be a conspiracy, she is a Muslim too and hangs out with Tupac&quot;</p>

<p>This was on FB. Just parroting exactly what they read on their circle jerk Hillary threads. He literally REFUSED to believe that she had any episode at all, because snopes referenced a reporter who thought she was ok. &quot;I have done things like that before&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me ask you if you think that there&#39;s admins and mods on here that are government shills suppressing possibly important information?... the reason I&#39;m asking is because I wrote a post about a petition I created about the CDC, proposed amendment following up Barack Obama&#39;s executive order 13295 , in The Patriot Act originally  executive ordered by George Bush jr.... </p>

<p>Anybody familiar with proposed amendment from CDC?  it basically gives the CDC the authority to detain anyone etc.
Containment of communicable diseases. Its being suppressed everywhere. I put it on another petition website 3 times and it was deleted immediately after I made it, since I drafted the original one like two nights before on care2. After I wrote it and posted it my phone&#39;s been acting buggy my Facebook too.</p>

<p>Their proposed amendment is about forced apprehension detention (possibly indefinitely) medical exam in mandatory vaccines or else detention anyways without say.. and basically anybody could say that you&#39;re not looking well and tell then and they will come and arrest you and put un medical detainment</p>

<p>for when they plan to spray the zika virus pesticide Nationwide, I know they&#39;re already doing it in Florida and back east and on commercial Airlines supposedly.</p>

<p>It actually is it&#39;s a factual thing on the Federal Register it&#39;s not really conspiracy,  I wrote a petition slamming the government and CDC and all the governors who support mandatory vaccines in it...the fuck is Obama and the government thinking...38 billion dollars to Israel and this proposal ,it&#39;s basically an outdoor concentration camp Nationwide and we&#39;re going to be like concentration camp prisoners.</p>

<p>I definitely think that reddit is tainted with government people and and suppressing really important information it&#39;s like this whole thing with Hilary it&#39;s like sleight of hand you know, they (gov) go around setting these fires and all of us are running around trying to put them out while they&#39;re robbing the bank...</p>

<p>To me this proposed amendment should be in headlines. What worries me the most is how they&#39;re not talking about it and not putting it on the news at all.
 I can&#39;t believe people are actually reading it &amp; they&#39;re just like whatever . I think it really says something  that most of us Americans are like that were so conditioned  by now to just roll with the punches in this country. People don&#39;t even think anything about it .  It&#39;s sad, I feel like Americans are like horses when  they get their Spirit broken so they can be ridden :/</p>

<p>Yeah, The few people that I was talking to they&#39;re like &quot;<em>Sigh</em> it&#39;s just a proposal not a law &quot; and I&#39;m like&quot; I don&#39;t give a shit if it&#39;s a proposal or law, my point is just the implications it&#39;s probably what the FEMA camps are for..&amp;  it&#39;s just treasonous for it to even be written up.&quot;  And they&#39;re totally missing my point.
.I mean to me this  proposal puts Hitler to shame and I wrote that in my petition .</p>

<p>15 brave people have volunteered to put their name on it so far..To me the conspiracy is how much
this government and our president could care less about our lives or any lives,I don&#39;t think he would even Flinch about doing this to citizens. I see the Hillary thing going on and just this it&#39;s just everything..</p>

<p>When the electoral fraud happened in Nevada for Bernie Sanders, I wrote the national Sheriffs Association and the Constitutional sheriffs and asked them what they&#39;re doing about the fraud, and why they&#39;re not present at these elections for their states, because constitutionally the sheriff&#39;s department is the first and last line of defense against tyranny from the government for the people and I asked them whose side they are on, like seriously what&#39;s going on ? you guys are just kicking back collecting a paycheck from the citizens. I told them what a shitshow Nevada was .. it was just crazy to see all the  Bernie Sanders people just Milling around instead of calling the sheriff&#39;s to arrest the DNC DEMS for electoral fraud.
Nobody knew what to do, see people should know their rights and laws It&#39;s very important, there&#39;s many many laws and bylaws at least should know the election law and basic law.</p>

<p>I told them the Nevada Sheriffs are idiots they turn their back on the people that were being frauded and protected the fraudsters and that&#39;s treason. </p>

<p>To me I just have this feeling that Obama is going to try to stay in office make this amendment happen .. I mean the correction in the whole thing for federal the state is just crazy and I wouldn&#39;t put it past them...
Obama sure is spending money like he is staying in office &amp; writing laws like he is .... this proposed amendment.. it&#39;s basically martial law without calling martial law.</p>

<p>Anyways I think that every person in America should know about this proposed amendment...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are paid shills here, but it&#39;s honestly hard to say how many.</p>

<p>There are over 380,000 subscribers to this subreddit now. Like in any large group of people, when dealing with that large of a number, you have to expect that a certain percentage of that group suffers from mental health issues.</p>

<p>Would it be unreasonable to assume that out of that 380K, there could be at least a few <em>dozen</em> unwell people, or perhaps a few hundred, or even a few thousand? </p>

<p>Here in Canada for example, Our <a href="http://alberta.cmha.ca/mental_health/statistics/">Canadian Mental Health Association suggests that 1 in 5 adult Canadians will suffer a mental disorder in their lives.</a>. </p>

<p>If we take those same numbers and apply them to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s sub count, 1 in 5 of 380,000 gives us <em>76,000</em> people with potential issues. Obviously this isn&#39;t completely accurate, but using rough percentages of the amount of people with mental health issues in society as a whole was about the only baseline I could think of using for a guesstimate, so take that as you will.</p>

<p>Even if that total of 76,000 is off by a few thousand in either direction, it&#39;s still <em>more</em> than enough to completely fuck with the dynamics of any subreddit, especially so when it&#39;s a sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which deals with subject matter that can easily appeal to those suffering with mental health issues.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: my bet is on crazy folks moreso than paid shills</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A lot of posts asking for evidence are downvoted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trolls often ask for a source on something that is easily found in order to start a fight about validity of sources. If something can be easily found just by searching and I see someone asking for a source regardless, I just downvote. Even if they&#39;re not intending to troll or start a stupid argument, commenting just to ask for a source that&#39;s easily found by a single Google search is just a bad comment that adds nothing to the discussion. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely noticed the pro-Hillary shills come in here when a topic has a lot of upvotes and has something to do with Hillary. I haven&#39;t noticed any other definite shills. That said, I have noticed a pervasive element that seems to want to actively push anti-semitism even at the expense of making sense or offering a rational argument. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that sort of commenter is the type of person you&#39;re talking about, just here to make legitimate &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; look stupid by association. </p>

I&#39;m going to add that either way it doesn&#39;t matter whether someone is being paid or not, the response should be the same.  Ignore them, and if they consistently cause trouble the mods will ban them.  This kind of PSA, whether it is true or not, doesn&#39;t really accomplish anything.  There&#39;s nothing you can do about it that is any different than what we are already doing, and it only serves to promote a kind of self righteous persecution attitude.  This is what I really have a problem with because that kind of rhetoric pretty much immediately shuts down any chance of productive conversation by framing the issue as us-vs-them. </p>

<p>&quot;some kind of secret cabal of uber rich&quot; &lt;- Legit; who would disagree?</p>

<p>&quot;some life extension serum&quot; &lt;- There have been actual news stories lately of blood transfusions from young blood donors that partially reverse the effects of aging.</p>

<p>&quot;linking clinton issues to aliens&quot; &lt;- Clinton is the biggest news story right now and there&#39;s a whole lot of deception/misinformation from their campaign, complicity/coordination with the media, people left scratching their heads brainstorming explanations in the absence of trustworthy facts, an amateur blog-o-sphere that feeds on situations like this to turn headline clicks into cash, and a whole bunch of shills angling every side of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite. As OP said, it&#39;s more subtle than that. It&#39;s not just &quot;debunking&quot; or whatever. It&#39;s about reinforcing the cultural stereotype that conspiracy theories are the product of diseased minds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed it in r/UFOs as well. The comments play on the rational person&#39;s tendency to avoid crazy shit and crazy people. A classic one you see literally everywhere when someone posts a UFO experience, some person will come along and say &quot;I saw the exact same thing in &lt;some random state&gt; back in &lt;a while ago&gt;&quot;. The commenter goes on to describe some crazy bullshit. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about debunking. It&#39;s actually about manipulating the way we perceive these stories. Creating prejudices.</p>

<p>The vocal majority will peddle left-right political propaganda, absurd theories, things that are absolutely nothing to do with conspiratorial events.

<p>Through design or lack thereof, at this point, there are so many people who use the sub incorrectly that noise and disinfo is an expected part of the sub. Mods do nothing about shitposts.

So they can then  post about it on their sjw sub, while falsely accusing us of being &quot;racist.&quot;  The <a href="http://www.jta.org/1963/11/05/archive/five-jews-arrested-for-painting-swastikas-on-israel-consulate">classic</a> Jewish girl <a href="http://www.jta.org/2007/11/06/news-opinion/jewish-student-behind-some-dorm-swastikas">painting</a> swastikas on her <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/01/northampton_police_2_girls_to.html">Synagogue</a>, while claiming <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/9019394/Jewish-man-arrested-after-posting-swastikas-on-doors.html">nonsense</a> racist <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/mean-girls-paint-swastikas-leave-poop-at-foes-northridge-home-jon-lovitz-to-the-rescue-2387744">attacks</a>.  (Note that each of the links provided are for separate, but IDENTICAL &quot;attacks.&quot;  This is a reflection of EXACTLY how its done with the <em>FALSE</em> claims of racism against <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> here.)</p>

<p>Tired and busted <em>EXPOSED</em> tactics they continually overuse.  We can see right through it.  We saw them yet again use this same method to try and shut down the <a href="/r/engineering">/r/engineering</a> 9/11 physics <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/521gdt/15th_anniversary_of_911_megathread/">discussion</a> of the critical failures that all destroy the &quot;official&quot; account [pure fiction] of that staged attack on America.  Sending out their shill army to pretend to be &quot;truther&quot; using the same busted and fully exposed tactics to try and shut down intelligent discussion of the event.</p>

<p>(*the yalmuka comment was NOT stated in a derogatory or racist manner, and was ONLY used to drive home the point of the extremely blatant source and affiliation of these liars and attackers).</p>
