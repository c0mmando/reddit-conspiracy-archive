       Jews control
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       all the media in America, and have done so for decades. They have
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       absolute control. What we see happening in the election illustrates this point. The Jewish owners, producers, directors, writers, and actors want Hillary to win and Trump to lose. So the media is completely against Trump, apart from a few right-wing outlets on radio and the Internet. The bias is so strong and so obvious, it is painful to watch it.

       When was the last time you heard a story critical of the Holocaust, or of Jewish power in America, on a major US network? Never, right? When was the last time you saw a Hollywood movie that was critical of Jews? Never, right?

       Yawn still propagating the mystery 'Jews'. Those 'Jews' are clearly Luciferians. Most 'Jews' are treated like slaves just like us. Hence why in Israel they're forcing the orthodox Jews to accept those LGBT parades going through Tel Aviv etc. They're Satanist's and the sooner you all stop denying the religious side to this the better.

       The wealthy are the problem, and for certain, a significant fraction of the ownership class are Jewish. The problem with the Jews is that the Jewish wealthy have used to religion and nationalism to coerce the lower class Jews to support their criminality. Thus, you have armies of poorer Jews, living in mom's basement, dutifully policing social media attempting to cover up Israel's latest crime.

       We do that already... google "quantitative easing".
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the fed prints as much money as it wants and no one can audit them. This is how we "recovered" (but not at all) from 2008, we just hyperinflate(print way more money) our way out of recession....the problem is that it snowballs when poor people (most of this country) can no longer afford inflated prices...and then we get a real crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, our GDP is 80% consumer products, and 70% of our employees are in the service industry...that means we have no real economy, no manufacturing or tech base to fall back on....the only reason our house of cards economy still stands is because during Vietnam, Nixon switched us off the gold standard onto the petrodollar. This means that now, the value of the dollar is linked to how much oil is traded globally in US dollars. Once oil stops being traded in usd, our economy will collapse overnight, because our consumer economy is 70% reliant on Americans having enough money to buy stupid shit they don't need...when that goes away, basically everyone loses their jobs so fast your head will spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our fed can print unlimited money now because foreign countries are forced to buy our debt...theyre only forced to because right now us dollar is the "global reserve currency" for oil trade. Both Saddam and Gaddafi tried to push the middle east to start trading in euros/dinars within months of their respective countries being invaded...that's also why we keep supporting Saudi Arabia, paying for their army despite their clear evil and open funding of terrorism---they control OPEC, so they control what the reserve currency is.

       No, you can't just print new money. Look at it this way; if you had one dollar, and that one dollar represented all the money in the world, you would be rich. You could have everything because you are the only person with money. Now I come along and say well that's not fair and I print my own one dollar bill. Now my dollar bill devalues your dollar bill by 50%, and we would share the wealth. And that folks is why you can't just print more money, it just makes the money you have worthless.

       But they're constantly printing new money.  I understand how an extra dollar devalues the sole dollar and how additional billions continue to devalue my ten dollar savings. The answer is..... we pay the taxes to cover the INTEREST on the money the government keeps BORROWING from the Fed.   Uncle Sam prints it, hands it over to the Fed for "bonds" and they loan it back to us at interest. The taxes we pay are interest payments.

       Interesting video. That might explain the consistently Pro-Israeli coverage. BUT the fact that the owners are commonly of Jewish decent is not significant otherwise imo. The bigger and more significant commonality...is the fact that the owners are all members of the 1%. So naturally most of the media pushes narratives that benefit the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are my thoughts. But I want data to back it up though. For ex are these 6 corporations all owned by big banks??...Who are the stockholders?? If anybody has a good link with info on that please share.

       People who attribute these things to "Jews" are terribly misguided. It's just like calling all Muslims terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro Israel slant is motivated by Zionism, most Zionists are American Christians, not even Jews. Almost 40% of American Jews don't even support the current direction of israel, especially in regards to Palestine and have nothing to do with "the cabal" of ultra-wealthy industrialists, who happen to profit greatly from Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real power players here are simply people who happen to benefit from the conflict being created by "the Jewish state" in the middle east. Additionally, very religious Jews know that it is expressly prohibited by law (in both the Torah and Talmud) to attempt to create a "Jewish state". Judaism is not an ethnic grouping, it is an abstract ideal that is supposed to be confined internally within a Jew, not externally as an exclusive land for people to populate... using that justification along cultural lines is exactly what hitler did to justify the holocaust.
Establishment of israel was the work of very wealthy leaders from England/us/France (via edicts like the Balfour agreement) to establish western influence in the middle east. They (industrialists) also intentionally drew new borders (sykes piquot agreement) in the middle east that grouped together historical adversaries). A great example of this is Iran vs iraq. People in Iran are historically homogeneous and have not invaded any nation since 1750s (besides defending themselves against Iraq). Iraq was artificially constructed to bring together Sunni and Shia factions who would never get along in a million years. It's no coincidence that Iraq and Saudi Arabia hold by far the most oil in the middle east, and we single-handedly installed the evil Wahhabi king ibn saud and gave him an army in order to control OPEC. In addition to drawing fake borders, these industrialists fund puppet dictators through coups (Iran) and empower warlords (Afghanistan--90% of world heroin supply) to keep drugs and oil flowing out of the middle east and guns flowing in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the capstone of this agenda, securing western influence in the region
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't Jews that are doing this, it is a group of extremely wealthy bankers and resource barons who know that they can exploit Zionism for two goals:
 1) justify western hegemony in the middle east via the destabilization of resource-rich nations, and empowering Israel to eventually control the area now known as Iraq/syria 
 2) control the opinion of American Christians who overwhelmingly believe in the Zionist agenda(I.e establishment of the Jewish homeland in Jerusalem to bring about a launchpad for the second coming of their savior)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why organizations like AIPAC control our foreign policy in the middle east---its not Jews, but rather people running corporations who understand that the value of their product and even the dollar itself is totally tied to continuing global oil trade in US Dollars (that's why we have the petrodollar instead of the gold standard--thanks Nixon).
      </p>
      <p>
       These same people (many of whom happen to be "Jewish") control the media, the defense industry, the oil industry, and many other industries. Permeant establishment of israel is vital to their plan of a one-world-government and a single world currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this has almost nothing to do with Jews. Just as"Islam" is used a rationale to extend the war on terror and domestic surveillance, Jews/holocaust are being used to justify all that was explained above, but they are not the driving force behind any of it...if it weren't Jews and Muslims it would be communism/socialism vs capitalist democracy (as it was during Vietnam era)...
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        very religious Jews know that it is expressly prohibited by law (in both the Torah and Talmud) to attempt to create a "Jewish state".

      <p>
       If we're going to come at this from religious perspectives. The Bible say's it will be created in one day. Now considering this was written around 3000 years ago this would be highly odd. Since countries did not come into existence like that back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 66:7-8
“Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son. Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is arguably an one of the msot amazing prophesy's I've seen from the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Ezekiel 4:3-6, the prophet said the Jews, who had lost control of their homeland, would be punished for 430 years. This prophecy, according to Bible scholar Grant Jeffrey, pinpointed the 1948 rebirth of Israel. Here’s a summary of Jeffrey’s theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezekiel said the Jews were to be punished for 430 years because they had turned away from God. As part of the punishment, the Jews lost control of their homeland to Babylon. Many Jews were taken as captives to Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Babylon was later conquered by Cyrus in 539 BC. Cyrus allowed the Jews to leave Babylon and to return to their homeland. But, only a small number returned. The return had taken place sometime around 536 BC, about 70 years after Judah lost independence to Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because most of the exiles chose to stay in pagan Babylon rather than return to the Holy Land, the remaining 360 years of their punishment was multiplied by 7. The reason is explained in Bible’s book of Leviticus. (Leviticus 26:18, Leviticus 26:21, Leviticus 26:24 and Leviticus 26:28). In Leviticus, it says that if the people did not repent while being punished, the punishment would be multiplied by 7. And, by staying in pagan Babylon, most exiles were refusing to repent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you take the remaining 360 years of punishment and multiply by 7, you get 2,520 years. But, Jeffrey says those years are based on an ancient 360-day lunar calendar. If those years are adjusted to the modern solar calendar, the result is 2,484 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, there were exactly 2,484 years from 536 BC to 1948, which is the year that Israel regained independence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let their be no illusions. That's where Jews get the Talmud from, the Babylonian captive period. Hence why that book is so fricking evil.

       The Securities and Exchange Commission has a search engine, called EDGAR, on their site for required filings by publicly owned corporations.
       <br/>
       Ownership info can be found in these filings
       <br/>
       Here's the link to it

       Looking this up I just noticed something interesting. Several years ago, when I did a search on Haliburton, BP , and KBR, it brought up all of their filings. Just now,when I tried to do so, all I got for those companies was a filings not found message. Looks like they have locked down that info.
       <br/>
       I wonder why?

       Sometimes I see something that makes some compelling arguments and then, for no apparent reason,  they start talking about jews. That bugs me because to me it invalidates the arguments when you are just trying to attack a race or religion.

       Totally agree. That's why I only say PERHAPS that's an explanation for Pro-Isreali coverage (but the Military Industrial Complex may be explanation enough.) But ya the religion or ethnicity is really not significant. It's just distraction from real issues. Like say wealth inequality...
