        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone, i dont know where else to post this but hey.</p>

<p>I dont expect you guys to agree with me here and i will <del>probably</del> most likely be labeled as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;... but just hear me out.</p>

<p>I chose this quote because im pretty upset at how the world is turning out. Im only 15, so my views on the current state of the world will seem pretty naive to alot of you (that read this).</p>

<p>Anyway, im sure some of you have heard of the &quot;NWO&quot; BUT WAIT WAIT! dont leave yet! I have my own view of the &quot;NWO&quot;. No, not some reptillian elite, that are supposedly &quot;blood related&quot; currently running the world. I mean, that is pretty out there but i have a <em>logical</em> theory.</p>

<p>Ok, to start things off; i&#39;d like to say that the &quot;control&quot; part is partially true (IMO). How? Here&#39;s where my 15 y.o idealogy comes into play.</p>

<p>Ever heard of a corporate government? Or a Corporatocracy?  Basically its where the bankers control your government. They tell your &quot;president&quot; or &quot;prime minister&quot; what to do. <strong>&quot;You can&#39;t control the grid from within the grid&quot;</strong> ~ Quote from the movie Now you see me 2.</p>

<p>That last quote is what fuelled this ideology of mine. As a president/PM of a country, you cant control other countries.. you heck you cant even control what people of your country do! they&#39;ll still steal, kill, rape etc. But when you&#39;re a banker, or a wealthy, powerful [Elite] you have the resources to get people to do what you want. <em>How?</em> you might ask? Well carry on to pt 2!</p>

<p><strong><em>MONEY</em></strong>. It&#39;s being used as a tool. A tool to control us, and guess what? <strong><em>ITS WORKING!</em></strong> if you dont have money in todays society, you wont go anywhere. You are literally, <strong>Worthless.</strong> which is what&#39;s bothering me. I think they are buying off our politicians, and if our politicians refuse or disobey the orders, the elite would have them killed. When you&#39;re that rich you could literally give some lowlife a gun, tell them to &quot;assassinate&quot; this person and they&#39;ll pay you [x] amount of money <strong>AND</strong> make sure you get away with it somehow (bribing judges whatsoever).</p>

<p>These politicians that speak out or refuse this elite agenda are seen as heros in my eyes. Because they are the <strong>good men</strong> in this world that try to expose this dirty agenda. Sad thing is, its not just one country its several countries. They wont buy off just your politicians, they&#39;ll buy off the media too. Again, with alot of money you can get people to say/do/get <strong><em>whatever you want</em></strong>. Im not exaggerating that last point either.</p>

<p>Lastly i&#39;d like to point out hollywood. No, they aren&#39;t the bad guys in my eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. They are masters of predictive programming and getting subliminal messages across. So many conspiracy theorists are quick to jump and say &quot;the illuminati are trying to point out what they&#39;re going to do through movies!&quot; Yes.. but no. If you were an elite group of people, trying to take over the world why would you leak your plans? you&#39;re asking for someone to foil them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So then why are they hinting at these &quot;plans&quot; through subliminal messages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another good question. IMO i think its because they have no choice but to do what the elite tell them. But hollywood wants outs. So they&#39;re leaking them very carefully.</p>

<p>Thats enough from me, i&#39;d like to hear your thoughts in the comments pls.</p>

<p>They implement Bezmenov&#39;s demoralization. They continue Bernay&#39;s degradation of society. All the normalization of perversion sold as progressivism is championed by that cult of freaks and degenerates.</p>

<p>All of your heroes and idols are always shown to be sick. Holly Wood is not entertainment, it&#39;s soul sapping indoctrination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you&#39;re now up to speed, good job 15 y.o. Now, i recommend you search up where the money is coming from, the rabbit hole it leads you to will be a true eye-opener. Don&#39;t trust Hollywood too much though young 15 y.o. People like <em>cough cough</em>- The CF (Clinton Foundation)- <em>cough cough</em> own that. I started getting suspicious after the &#39;08 market crash when I myself was a young teen and I new shit would go down ever since. Money is strong but so are media outlets, dissect EVERYTHING. I recomend if you wana know how the big boys play watch wolf on wallstreet or the big short, you&#39;re prolly not old enough to open up a retirement plan to realize first hand how we got fucked over. There&#39;s definitely more to all the damage this economy&#39;s going through. And IMO, start looking at candidates of 2016 and trace that back to where this society is today. Rn I&#39;m subscribing to the fact that the CF owns basically everything under the sun. Feel free to help spread the truth on this situation cause with election coming soon I&#39;m sure all of our sphinct&#39;s are very taught rn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re 15 ill save you a lot right here. Everything taught in school is untrue if you work to find an optimal truth. The earth is flat so ignore all the science bullshit you hear. People like Dr. Sebi know the right diet to cure any illness in the world. I&#39;ll tell ya it&#39;s not like he knows magic food, it&#39;s that he knows what food is poisonous to humans. Our bodies are just very good so we can eat almost anything, it does not mean we are meant to. That&#39;s why people become sick. Look up the Vaxxed documentary. I hope you are seeing how this is all control. Don&#39;t get mad at your parents because they have no idea I grew up the same way you did, our generation is going to be the one that breaks the chains. We are slaves because they have rigged everything. There are tough times ahead for you and I. The system all of it is a lie everything you are taught. Banks create money out of thin air and then charge us interest on it when they lend it to us. The only reason that we need a loan in the first place is because less than 100 years ago they hoarded all the money so that we would need to go to them for a loan. I hope this is some good insights for a 15 year old. </p>

<p>Edit: The good people are powerless. One day enough people will be educated that we can change it, and it will be soon. They are controlling everything from what we read, to what we hear, to even what is posted on forums like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol the proof is immaculate watch like two flat earth documentaries. If you think the earth is flat and look at the sphere earth it won&#39;t make sense anymore for a few reasons.
If the earth was round and you were in an air plane you would have to look down to see the earth. That is not the case.
If you look at the sun when it is setting you can clearly see it is not setting. It is falling out of view.
I don&#39;t care what anyone has to say to oppose it because any clear mind can see that any argument against it is illusion based.
Create a belief and all the facts proving it right will follow. That&#39;s what has happened.</p>

<p>I am not a shill but you probably are. To oppose an opinion that is entirely possible is beyond ignorant. Look up documentaries there are so many flaws only a dumb ass puts all their eggs into the sphere earth basket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you haven&#39;t provided any sources.  you told me to watch a documentary.  that isn&#39;t a credible source of evidence for anything.  </p>

<p>all the evidence i have gathered proves that our planet is spherical, just like every other large mass in the universe.  the sun sets because we rotate on an axis, and we can see the planet all around us because it is very big.  we would eventually have to look straight down to see earth when we get far enough away from it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe stars are what you think they are. I don&#39;t think other planets exist. The sun is merely 4k kilometers away just like the moon. Until you break those dumb ass space beliefs up you&#39;ll never be able to conceive the flat earth. Also you are wrong there is not a single instance of people being high enough to have to look down. Just as usual sphere earthers bringing up facts that are literally untrue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay and what do you have to say to all the people who have time after time proven the earth is flat? lol it&#39;s like, I have 1000 paid people who all claim that bananas are pink. I don&#39;t care if you show me a yellow one I know 1000 people who know and make money to study the bananas. Those 1000 people can all shove their opinions up their ass, money can make people do crazy things, like maybe over look the studies they are doing because 99% of people believe exactly what they&#39;re publishing. We all know NASA is a fat sham and that Masons run the show up there and cover their tracks. You think the trip before they made it to the moon that the space ship blew up on accident and killed everyone inside? Nah they wanted anyone who knew anything about staging it to shut up and they let their corrupt bastards like Neil Armstrong fake the shit. If you even continue to battle me in argument you are a shill because I would say I have murdered you at this point.</p>
