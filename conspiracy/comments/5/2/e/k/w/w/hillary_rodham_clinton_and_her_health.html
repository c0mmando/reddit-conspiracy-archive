       My little rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Hillary collapsed at the 9/11 event.....
      </p>
      <p>
       If she were healthy, it would have been a simple matter of holding a press conference with Hillary front and center along with one or more medical doctors that are familiar with her health history. An hour later, the whole issue would be put to rest. If she were healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are in fact health issues that would threaten her candidacy, then their strategy would be to do some or all of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Take attention away from it by attacking anyone bringing it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Try to deflect the question onto Trump who himself is nearly the same age.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Accuse those questioning her health by calling them names such as conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Limit her exposure to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Control the press as much as possible on this and other issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Refuse to provide any evidence of her health.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Refuse to admit any health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's campaigns behavior points to there being some serious issues with her health. And that was before she collapsed on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her collapse at the 9/11 event and their response appears to completely destroy their credibility on the issue of her health. Firstly the video where she collapses is devastating. Not so much due to the collapse itself, but their crazy efforts to hide what was going on when her handlers surrounded her while she was being dragged into the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the frosting on that cake was the subsequent various claims from her campaign team where first she was a bit overheated. Then overheated and dehydrated, then allergies, then pneumonia. Which is it, people? Get your story straight. This gives no one any comfort about her health. It only muddies the water and makes us more suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the real nail in the coffin, was her apparently a few hours later allegedly walking out of Chelsea's apartment, looking absolutely chipper, with a big smile on her face, skipping along and waving to everyone. Really? Seriously? At the best of times, she walks carefully, often with help to get over or down small stairs or even a curb. The contrast between the two images is startling. Which makes one wonder if they tried to use a body double, a doppelganger.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have made so much more sense if Hillary would have made an appearance in public in front of a bunch of microphones and reporters. She would have walked carefully but confidently  to the microphones and spoke to the people and said that - yes, she had a problem earlier in the day but now is feeling better and is going to take a couple of days to get back up to speed and she thanks everybody for the good wishes, etc. That along with her doctor speaking truthfully and plainly to the people, and giving a credible diagnosis and prognosis would have gone very far to 1, let everyone know that she is okay, and 2, probably would have gotten a lot of people to feel for her, and want to see her get better, you know, some good will.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been all kinds of instances where a candidate for an office had some kind of illness or injury and they were honest with their constituents and they still got elected. Some even were not able to actually campaign, and they still won.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary's health problems were not of a nature that would knock her out of the race, any illness could have actually boosted her support. People tend to want to help an underdog going thru a rough patch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it is impossible to conclude that Hillary does not have a campaign threatening health problem. And that her and her campaign are lying their asses off.

       Back out of debates where she'd be exposed.

      <p>
       Back out of press events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back out of interviews where she looks like an absolute moron (like saying she heard FBI Director Comey state she
       <strong>
        didn't
       </strong>
       do anything wrong when in fact that's exactly what he said and they played the video of him saying it during the interview).
