       "Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, can happen at any stage of Parkinson disease. Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include: difficulty swallowing certain foods or liquids, coughing or throat clearing during or after eating/drinking, and feeling as if food is getting stuck.  As the disease progresses, swallowing can become severely compromised and food/liquid can get into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in PD."

       Its kind of jacked up too because she could, in reality, have early parkinsons and not yet know.  My uncle had weird illness symptoms and these types of episodes for 2 years before he was diagnosed.  She could literally be in early stages parkinsons and just chalking it up to campaign stress and age.

       i agree with you there. The best analogy i have gotten was that we are asking Joe The Plumber's Wife to come fix the plumbing because by proxy or osmosis she knows plumbing and gee golly willikers, we need a woman running us into the ground.

       it would be more like if Joe the plumbers wife also had decades of plumbing experience. you might not agree with her politics but to say she's literally just a random wife of a past politician with no experience whatsoever is the reason people don't take her critics seriously

       Also, i wouldn't count her time as first lady as any political experience. so since 2001 (surprise) she was the governor of NY, the the SOS. Since 2001, she was over the state the tower's fell in, although she is from Arkansas. We've been through multiple "hot wars", had Benghazi, a dead Libyan leader, a housing crisis (2008),  and financial disaster, highest vet post war suicide since Vietnam, and many more things that she is directly related or responsible too. 2001-2013 is 12 years that is her political career without Bill carrying the load, and there is fuckall to show for it, fuckall

       But
       <em>
        everyone else
       </em>
       knows? She's not in denial.  I don't know why everyone is waiting for the mainstream media to confirm what we can all see with our own eyes.  She can't get thru a moment in public without coughing, the whole world saw her spit a large piece of food into her water glass last week as she was gagging, and yesterday she looked like Michael J. Fox as they were tossing her into a van.  People need to stop being retarded and deferring to the media to think for them, and start trusting themselves.

       I agree, but I wasn't voting for her anyway.  I didn't need this to convince me she's unfit for the office.  Problem is her supporters, like Trumps, cling to her no matter how much evidence seems obvious to everyone else that they shouldn't be president.

       The body shuts down in a predictable process.   Takes about 7-8 years generally, she started failing about 5 years ago.  Like it or not her body has decided its over.  Her doctors aren't working at fixing whats wrong with her its all palliative care.  You don't have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

       Yes, but by the time it causes AP of any sort the disease is so far along that the patient is basically bed-ridden.  There may be issues, but Parkenson's is NOT the reason she's got pneumonia.  In fact, the green globs she coughed up into the glass of water pretty clearly indicate a bacterial infection of the lungs, probably Mycoplasma, aka. Walking Pneumonia.  It is rarely serious.  However, given this is the case, it's not that surprising that she;d overheat, since she would have been running a fever from the infection.
