<p><a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?swallowing-and-parkinson-disease">https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?swallowing-and-parkinson-disease</a></p>

<p>&quot;Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, can happen at any stage of Parkinson disease. Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include: difficulty swallowing certain foods or liquids, coughing or throat clearing during or after eating/drinking, and feeling as if food is getting stuck.  As the disease progresses, swallowing can become severely compromised and food/liquid can get into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in PD.&quot;</p>

My uncle had weird illness symptoms and these types of episodes for 2 years before he was diagnosed.

    <div class="md"><p>Also, i wouldn&#39;t count her time as first lady as any political experience. so since 2001 (surprise) she was the governor of NY, the the SOS. Since 2001, she was over the state the tower&#39;s fell in, although she is from Arkansas. We&#39;ve been through multiple &quot;hot wars&quot;, had Benghazi, a dead Libyan leader, a housing crisis (2008),  and financial disaster, highest vet post war suicide since Vietnam, and many more things that she is directly related or responsible too. 2001-2013 is 12 years that is her political career without Bill carrying the load, and there is fuckall to show for it, fuckall</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But <em>everyone else</em> knows? She&#39;s not in denial.  I don&#39;t know why everyone is waiting for the mainstream media to confirm what we can all see with our own eyes.  She can&#39;t get thru a moment in public without coughing, the whole world saw her spit a large piece of food into her water glass last week as she was gagging, and yesterday she looked like Michael J. Fox as they were tossing her into a van.  People need to stop being retarded and deferring to the media to think for them, and start trusting themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but by the time it causes AP of any sort the disease is so far along that the patient is basically bed-ridden.  There may be issues, but Parkenson&#39;s is NOT the reason she&#39;s got pneumonia.  In fact, the green globs she coughed up into the glass of water pretty clearly indicate a bacterial infection of the lungs, probably Mycoplasma, aka. Walking Pneumonia.  It is rarely serious.  However, given this is the case, it&#39;s not that surprising that she;d overheat, since she would have been running a fever from the infection.</p>
