<p>On top of that, she goes from being dragged into a van to hugging small kids for photo ops in a matter if hours, and her big black handler isn&#39;t anywhere to be seen. All because of pneumonia? </p>

<p>This entire thing reeks, and we are all being lied to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>probably not a dummy but this time i rewatched the video to see if that looks like a possibility and 1 thing that&#39;s interesting is her head doesn&#39;t appear to <em>flop</em> (forward or backward). her whole body does fall forward but her head keeps a pretty stable angle with her body (as much as i could tell from the partially blocked video view). that does look pretty weird, head doesn&#39;t flop around much for someone fainting, falling <em>or</em> seizing.</p>

<p>is there no video with her walking to that spot with all her people and waiting for the van?</p>

<p>edit: it might be my mind playing tricks on me but now every time i go and watch the video again it looks more and more like a dummy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a still pic of her walking towards the pickup location, presumably about 5 min before that event.  Have not seen any video. At this point, &quot;unknown&quot; is the best answer.</p>

<p>Her head is definitely weird. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dummy, just weird.  Her hair looks fake to me, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it is a double, it was a double the entire day.</p>

<p>She looks like shit the all day.</p>

<p>Not sure of her height, but she looks tiny standing next to Chuck Schumer and di Blasio.</p>

<p>She is literally being handled by her handlers walking out.</p>

<p>Handlers who totally broke protocol. When have you ever seen a first lady waiting on the curb for a ride?</p>

<p>Why the weird sunglasses all day? If she was aiming at spin control, she wouldn&#39;t have worn them coming out to say she was fine. She was obviously not fine.</p>

<p>Blocking off the sidewalk, cute little girl. Such an stage.</p>

<p>The shoe thing is weird. Not here shoes, footage of her leaving ground zero show her wearing black shoes, no leopard print.</p>

<p>Odd reverse angle footage out there.</p>

<p>Seems like they backed out of a plan at the last minute.</p>

<p>When was the last time we saw her? Full facial? </p>

<p>Maybe she is dead (Sitting up there beside Margaret Thatcher).</p>
