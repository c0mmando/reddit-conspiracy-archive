<p>He got more qualified people to lay out a believable plan, knowing he would never get enough votes by just being inflammatory and &quot;different&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe you should be an expert in EVERYTHING to be considered. I think you should be a qualified expert in <em>at least one major field, that suits the platform you&#39;re campaigning on</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect an expert in law to be an expert on the military, or economics, or anything else. But you should be a well rounded, respectable person who as you said, is also able to surround him or her self with the right people. If we&#39;re comfortable electing a guy that doesnt know what hes doing because hes good at hiring people who do... I just don&#39;t see the point. He&#39;s a middleman at that point. </p>

<p>inb4 derp everyone has advisors: of course. there is not enough tim in a day to know everything and think of all angles. I just want someone who would at least be a qualified advisor under a different president. </p>

<p>If you want to trust the guy with multiple bankruptcies with your business that&#39;s fine. You can&#39;t win them all, and he&#39;s won some of them. But it doesn&#39;t inspire confidence in voting for his economic recovery plans to me, and i&#39;d wager, most people. He will run it in to the ground and make off with 10 figures, and I wont be surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a President isn&#39;t in control of the decisions that directly affect the military, economy and foreign policy? They don&#39;t have veto power? I would say that Clinton, Obama Bush1 and Reagan all seemed extremely well versed in economics, politics, law, history, foreign policy, etc, even if they really were just puppets. Lets get a believable puppet, at least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, I was flagged too (I can&#39;t post or vote on any discussion). It was back in early May, and all I wrote was (as I can remember): </p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully Donald can work with my candidate of choice, Bernie Sanders, as they both appear to be anti-establishment.&quot;  </p>

<p>And baam! Account Flagged. What&#39;s funny is that months later Donald said during his victory speech at becoming the Republican nominee that his campaign welcomes all Bernie Sanders supporters. </p>

<p>Yeah, but nope. With that type of attitude from supporters like those from the subreddit &quot;The_Donald&quot;, I don&#39;t want to give my support to them at all. I&#39;d rather vote with my conscience and go with Jill Stein. Nothing against Donald Trump, but I have many issues with his base supporters, who I feel I wouldn&#39;t get along in real life (based on their thoughts towards certain people or groups or ideology). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what an ironic word to spell incorrectly...</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how many people assume I have never heard him speak, and haven&#39;t looked in to anything about him, and don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. It really is. </p>

<p>Apparently I misspoke, but I figured many here would understand my meaning. He has laid out plans and policies. It was a mistake to say he hasn&#39;t. I&#39;m saying those aren&#39;t his thoughts or ideas, that he has a staff of people that handle the actual work, and that he merely follows the script. He is just the mascot. I really underestimated the number of Trump supporters around here, which is fine. I was looking for this discussion. But all I&#39;m getting is &quot;YES HE DID SO RELEASE PLANS RETARD GOOGLE IT&quot;, which is entirely beside the point. I&#39;m saying he won&#39;t talk in detail about it WITH HIS OWN FACE. In person, he speaks at a 5th grade level and incited bigotry instead of going in to detail about the things he paid other people to be on top of. </p>

<p>My concern here is less that he is a puppet, and more that he is campaigning on grounds he has little concept of, and it&#39;ll mean nothing to him if he should win. He will forget the things people agreed with when electing him, and will literally throw away the script. Then, it&#39;s welcome to the Trump show, what does he have in store for himself now. </p>

<p>I will NEVER use hyperbole in a post again. I honestly regret it lol</p>

<p>There are literally people paid to write pro clinton/anti trump posts on reddit and other message boards/forums.

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose I didn&#39;t consider that Anti-Trump = Pro-Clinton to everyone. </p>

<p>I was honestly for Clinton about a year ago. I thought, &quot;Hell, Bill presided over one of the best economic periods in our history, it might be nice to get him involved again even if Hillary seems like a psychopath&quot; but between the mishandling of confidential information, the lying about it, the blatant &quot;laws dont apply to me&quot; narrative that I can&#39;t avoid, her health, the body doubles, the hacked DNC emails...</p>

<p>Now it just seems too fixed. I&#39;ve found myself thinking some times that Trump works for Clinton because she wouldn&#39;t win against anyone else. He almost seems like someone who is trying to sabotage his campaign and surprised when everything he tries gets him more support... I mean Trump donated to the Clintons! But thats easily written off: he needed favors. What would get him more favors than this? When it comes down to it, I dont see Trumps motive. He&#39;s too successful in private industries, and as egocentric as he is, i still think he too smart to do all of this for a title. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Certainly some Trump moments that are endearing, but its not as if the guy isn&#39;t intelligent and charismatic. He know what to say and how to say it, which is how we found ourself discussing his candidacy. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a long con of any kind, but he knew he may run eventually. I mean he looked like he was on the campaign trail on the Oprah show like 20+ years ago. </p>

<p>I at least can respect some of his sentiments here. He seems anti-establishment. He seems unashamedly greedy, but could be our first president to be so rich he could tell lobbyist to suck his dick. </p>

<p>I agree that our media has an agenda and that he is at odds with it. I agree that he shows less risk in being totally corrupt and bending the government to his will simply because he can do that to the private industry. I think his narcissism could be a benefit to the public; he wants to be seen like a JFK, not a GWB. I think his lack of political interest up until until now is a good thing, but his lack of political experience is a bad thing.</p>

<p>I still think he is woefully under qualified in things like law, world economics, military matters...I know some of what he says is only to take over the &quot;nascar&quot; vote as i like to call it, but I can admit that if he can put together the right team and trust them, he may effectively reduce corruption and moneys power in politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never tried this hard to like Trump. I&#39;m still not voting, but I dislike him less. </p>
