       He got more qualified people to lay out a believable plan, knowing he would never get enough votes by just being inflammatory and "different"
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he promised jobs and favors to staffers to make him look like an actual contender, and didn't even pay them. And won't discuss details verbally.

       Just to be clear: I'm not saying that his plans will all happen or were even written by him etc. Staying on topic, i'm just saying that claims such as;

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        his refusal to lay out a single detail about literally any of his policies or plans

       sounds like he is trying to hire experts in their field and employ them? how is this a bad thing? i'd rather have experts in economics handling economics than a politician enforcing rules/laws according to their donors.

       Why can't we elect an expert....we are electing someone to make our decisions, and he needs to hire someone to make his?

       im not saying advisors are a bad thing. theyre necessary. but you should probably be a qualified expert yourself before running.

       so what you're saying is that we should elect a person that is an EXPERT in every field? that sounds perfect. but here in the real world where someone like that doesnt exist, i think i'd prefer someone who is an expert at hiring experts.

       Don't put words in my mouth to support your point. I'll discuss it, if you aren't going to try to make me argue against myself here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe you should be an expert in EVERYTHING to be considered. I think you should be a qualified expert in
       <em>
        at least one major field, that suits the platform you're campaigning on
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect an expert in law to be an expert on the military, or economics, or anything else. But you should be a well rounded, respectable person who as you said, is also able to surround him or her self with the right people. If we're comfortable electing a guy that doesnt know what hes doing because hes good at hiring people who do... I just don't see the point. He's a middleman at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       inb4 derp everyone has advisors: of course. there is not enough tim in a day to know everything and think of all angles. I just want someone who would at least be a qualified advisor under a different president.

       He has 500 or so companies that are successful. Does that not make him an expert at hiring experts? Being able to recognize others strengths and utilizing them is a better character trait than pretending to be the expert in front of the cameras like most politicians.

       Whatever force finally decides to invade and win over the support of like-minded civillians. Our population has been very carefully raised to conform to the way things work here, and I don't see them rising or even cooperating. If they tried, right under Uncle Sams nose, it would be quickly taken care of.

       Even though I don't think it'll matter very much I'm going to vote for Trump because he is anti PC, anti globalist and He wants to bring good jobs back instead of just raising the wage of shitty jobs to 15$ an hour which will just create more problems and we will end up with even less jobs.

       Leftism is not the answer and never will be. If you're more worried about Trump than you are Clinton you are misguided at best.

       I'm sorry but those are basic bitch and retarded criticisms.  Anyone who honestly thinks Trump's business bankruptcies are valid points against him doesn't understand business.  The rest of your comment is ad hominem and an untrue statement about none of his policies being laid out. They are all specifically detailed on his website, his tax plan and the plan to pay for the wall for example.

       "They are all specifically detailed on his website, his tax plan and the plan to pay for the wall for example." Did he write that? Did he actually verbally detail anything besides "We're gonna make Mexico pay for it"?
      </p>

       He's paying like minded advisors to think for him, and legitimize his candidacy. Now, thats not in itself unusual at all, but it should be more alarming.

       If you want to trust the guy with multiple bankruptcies with your business that's fine. You can't win them all, and he's won some of them. But it doesn't inspire confidence in voting for his economic recovery plans to me, and i'd wager, most people. He will run it in to the ground and make off with 10 figures, and I wont be surprised.

       So a President isn't in control of the decisions that directly affect the military, economy and foreign policy? They don't have veto power? I would say that Clinton, Obama Bush1 and Reagan all seemed extremely well versed in economics, politics, law, history, foreign policy, etc, even if they really were just puppets. Lets get a believable puppet, at least...

       It's funny, I was flagged too (I can't post or vote on any discussion). It was back in early May, and all I wrote was (as I can remember):
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hopefully Donald can work with my candidate of choice, Bernie Sanders, as they both appear to be anti-establishment."
      </p>
      <p>
       And baam! Account Flagged. What's funny is that months later Donald said during his victory speech at becoming the Republican nominee that his campaign welcomes all Bernie Sanders supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, but nope. With that type of attitude from supporters like those from the subreddit "The_Donald", I don't want to give my support to them at all. I'd rather vote with my conscience and go with Jill Stein. Nothing against Donald Trump, but I have many issues with his base supporters, who I feel I wouldn't get along in real life (based on their thoughts towards certain people or groups or ideology).

       what an ironic word to spell incorrectly...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting how many people assume I have never heard him speak, and haven't looked in to anything about him, and don't know what I'm talking about. It really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently I misspoke, but I figured many here would understand my meaning. He has laid out plans and policies. It was a mistake to say he hasn't. I'm saying those aren't his thoughts or ideas, that he has a staff of people that handle the actual work, and that he merely follows the script. He is just the mascot. I really underestimated the number of Trump supporters around here, which is fine. I was looking for this discussion. But all I'm getting is "YES HE DID SO RELEASE PLANS RETARD GOOGLE IT", which is entirely beside the point. I'm saying he won't talk in detail about it WITH HIS OWN FACE. In person, he speaks at a 5th grade level and incited bigotry instead of going in to detail about the things he paid other people to be on top of.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern here is less that he is a puppet, and more that he is campaigning on grounds he has little concept of, and it'll mean nothing to him if he should win. He will forget the things people agreed with when electing him, and will literally throw away the script. Then, it's welcome to the Trump show, what does he have in store for himself now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will NEVER use hyperbole in a post again. I honestly regret it lol

       Reddit has been a safe space for leftists for a long time. Same with facebook and twitter. Its pretty much shit but it can still be entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally people paid to write pro clinton/anti trump posts on reddit and other message boards/forums. If you go into any pro (whatever) subreddit and come off like you're trolling/shilling you're going to get banned. especially in ones experiencing the influx of paid posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really be talking with leftists about this, they are the ones trying to censor and cleanse everything. I can't stand the ultra religious bonehead conservatives either but they don't have too much power these days especially online.

       I suppose I didn't consider that Anti-Trump = Pro-Clinton to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was honestly for Clinton about a year ago. I thought, "Hell, Bill presided over one of the best economic periods in our history, it might be nice to get him involved again even if Hillary seems like a psychopath" but between the mishandling of confidential information, the lying about it, the blatant "laws dont apply to me" narrative that I can't avoid, her health, the body doubles, the hacked DNC emails...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it just seems too fixed. I've found myself thinking some times that Trump works for Clinton because she wouldn't win against anyone else. He almost seems like someone who is trying to sabotage his campaign and surprised when everything he tries gets him more support... I mean Trump donated to the Clintons! But thats easily written off: he needed favors. What would get him more favors than this? When it comes down to it, I dont see Trumps motive. He's too successful in private industries, and as egocentric as he is, i still think he too smart to do all of this for a title.

       Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly some Trump moments that are endearing, but its not as if the guy isn't intelligent and charismatic. He know what to say and how to say it, which is how we found ourself discussing his candidacy. I'm not saying it's a long con of any kind, but he knew he may run eventually. I mean he looked like he was on the campaign trail on the Oprah show like 20+ years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I at least can respect some of his sentiments here. He seems anti-establishment. He seems unashamedly greedy, but could be our first president to be so rich he could tell lobbyist to suck his dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that our media has an agenda and that he is at odds with it. I agree that he shows less risk in being totally corrupt and bending the government to his will simply because he can do that to the private industry. I think his narcissism could be a benefit to the public; he wants to be seen like a JFK, not a GWB. I think his lack of political interest up until until now is a good thing, but his lack of political experience is a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think he is woefully under qualified in things like law, world economics, military matters...I know some of what he says is only to take over the "nascar" vote as i like to call it, but I can admit that if he can put together the right team and trust them, he may effectively reduce corruption and moneys power in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never tried this hard to like Trump. I'm still not voting, but I dislike him less.
