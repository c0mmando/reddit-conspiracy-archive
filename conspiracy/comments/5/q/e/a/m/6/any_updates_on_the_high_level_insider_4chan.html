What if he is a physicist/ gov whistleblower who fears for his life and is trying to find a way to wake some people?  Or he found a better way to market his knowledge?  Or he decided space elevator anon wasn&#39;t cutting it, and he needed to reveal some more about himself.  Or hes a fraud - idk.  Interesting reads, regardless</p>

<p>OP, let&#39;s suppose you are right and that they &quot;globalists&quot; are working in our best interests.
Why would they force the economy into sluggish growth, massive pollution, and so on, priming the pump for blowback instead of building a space elevator that can unite mankind reaching for the stars while delivering 20%+ GDP growth?
Because the conspiracy is sinister. There is no other explanation. So you need to delve deeper into what is really going on.</p>

<p>When we build the space elevator we will get rid of free floating satellites. Orbital rings can be built at any altitude and any inclination, so we&#39;d just hook payloads to the ring structures wherever we want them and let them hang in place rather than orbit. </p>

<p>After the first orbital ring elevator (around $450B), successive rings cost only about $1-2B a piece.</p>

<p>It takes about 10 sequential rings to reach geosynchronous altitude if you are using kevlar as your elevator material between rings, so we&#39;d want at least 10 rings.</p>

<p>If you to be able to move anywhere on Earth quickly, we might eventually want something like 100 east-west rings and 100 north-south rings.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to travel from Los Angeles to Sydney, then you just go up an elevator in LA, traverse the ring system in space, and back down an elevator in Sydney. All of this is essentially free because you recover your climbing energy in LA on the descent in Sydney and similarly recover your acceleration around the Earth in the deceleration phase.</p>

<p>At a comfy 1g of acceleration, the ride up an elevator to 300km orbital ring height takes around 5 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/space%20elevator/">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/space%20elevator/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original design for a space elevator came from Tesla and we call it the orbital ring space elevator concept now. Arthur C Clarke was also working off the Tesla template and described an orbital ring style elevator.</p>

<p>This is completely different than what you normally conceive when you think space elevator. People are familiar with the idea of a counterweight in space attached by a ~40,000 km cable. Something that works like spinning in circles with a yoyo. Unfortunately you need nonexistent materials for this design: carbon nanotubes or something similar.</p>

<p>However, we can get around this by changing the design. The orbital ring elevator only has to be about 300 km high - just high enough to get out of any significant atmospheric drag.</p>

<p>Imagine a ring of material circling around Earth at ~300km altitude. Now what we can do is put an elevator on either side of the Earth like pic related. Each elevator uses superconducting magnets to deflect the ring of material downward somewhat. That produces an equal and opposite reaction, or lifting force, which can hold an elevator up.</p>

<p>It works on the same principle as you getting pushed back a little bit by firing a gun. In this case, the top of the elevator is essentially continuously firing material &quot;down&quot; in order to push itself up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth thinking about that this original design, put forth by Tesla and popularized by Clarke, is hardly even present in the public psyche. Take that as an indiction of how extensive and pervasive the brainwashing in the media is - mainstream, &quot;alternative,&quot; or otherwise. </p>

<p>Q: ... if the United States had $5 trillion worth of electricity pouring out of the sky, wouldn&#39;t that pretty much crash the value of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Ultimately, we would like to drive the price of everything down to zero. That is to say, we&#39;d like to live in a post-scarcity society where you can have what you want.</p>

<p>Collapsing the price of input commodities is among the greatest achievements that mankind can strive towards. It means you in turn collapse the prices of food, housing, health care, cars, whatever. This is where we want to go.</p>

<p>Q: Do you have any idea how difficult it would be to sign up the whole world to receive all of their energy costs from the United States? We wouldn&#39;t even have time to enjoy any benefit, because of World War III. Petroleum is one fourth of Russia&#39;s GDP. Their export earnings from oil and gas are 14% of their GDP. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be as casual as you are about eliminating that industry and buying all of their energy from us at an arbitrary price we set. Not to mention other countries who rely much more on energy resources. This is exactly the kind of stuff that starts wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: The US already does this in effect - it is called the petrodollar regime. We force the world to trade energy supplies in dollars, propping up the value of the dollar, which we in turn use to effectively skim a cut off of every transaction for free.</p>

<p>The present circumstances of world geopolitics in other words is that the US is committing highway robbery by force.</p>

<p>The only real geopolitical shift we are talking about is one of mutually improved circumstances, i.e., energy is cheaper and more abundant for us all. The usury class and the degenerate politicians who depend upon economic hardship to suppress and distract the masses would be in serious trouble, but no one else really. </p>

<p>Q: i&#39;ve seen you in other threads. is this copypasta your own work? want to make sure you know what you&#39;re talking about and not just control c/v&#39;ing everything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Whether it is or not, you&#39;d not be able to tell based on me telling you so. One of the first principles of anonymous boards is that you should judge by the merits of what is said, not the identity of the sayer. With that in mind, you might as well go ahead and ask what you wanted to ask and see what kind of response you get. </p>
