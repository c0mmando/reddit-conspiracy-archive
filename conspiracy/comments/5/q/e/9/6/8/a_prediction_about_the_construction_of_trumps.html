        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I imagine that a lot of people remember the controversy surrounding the Mena airfield in Arkansas. During the Clinton administration it was used as a CIA front to smuggle cocaine into the United States. Pretty crazy, right? So we know that the US government is bringing cocaine into the states and monetizing it probably as a favor to someone in Mexico or South America. What the US gets out of it I could only speculate. Most likely funding military action that would bring about political advantage for our government. </p>

<p>Now, presumably, that money needs to be brought back. Maybe not. Perhaps instead of funding a guerilla military off the books through the monetization of narcotics on US soil Trump just wants to send American troops directly. To cut out the middle man, so to speak.</p>

<p>If he begins construction of a border wall it is not going to happen silently. Think back to the construction of the Great Wall of China. Sweet Jesus and Jango Fett was that a bloody 200 year debacle. Trump is literally proposing a Great Wall of America. This will alienate current financial interests. Granted, they have other methods of getting things across the border should they decide to but this will be a decent bite out of their mobility.</p>

<p>If this wall is constructed I predict there will be a war on the border between Mexican guerillas and, initially, civilian construction workers. Kind of one sided, right? So now private and public contractors are no longer going home to their wives and children and, to wit, we see a public outcry the likes of which has never been seen. The National Guard is brought in to defend the construction zone and to press further south into Hispanic states to fink out these, what will inevitably be labeled, terrorists. Thus the War on Terror is brought home. It lands on our doorstep with the ancients lords of battle and death crying for us to open the door and with resounding approval we turn the handle. Thus America begins the genocide of another non white race that has already been demonized in the media. </p>

<p>Sounds far fetched? Let&#39;s not forget, post 9/11, the Bushes and the Cheneys and other select members of American royalty cashed in enormously through investment in a firm called the Carlyle Group. They happened to already be shareholders is one of the world&#39;s largest firearm distributors; a distributor that supplies the world&#39;s largest military. America became embroiled in war in the Middle East and has been for 16 years now. That landed a few dollars and dimes in some choice pockets.</p>

<p>Now this is just a prediction. I see it as a possible outcome. </p>

<p>&quot;There will be a payment, it will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form, and what I&#39;m doing is good for the United States. It&#39;s also gonna be good for Mexico; we want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico.&quot; This is a quote from Donald Trump from an interview in which he says that Mexico will repay us for construction. After the taxpayer foots the bill. It feels like classic doublethink and doublespeak.</p>

<p>I could be wrong. He could be more or less telling the truth. Maybe a truth shaded by some ridiculous backroom under-the-table agreement. If what we have seen of his administration thus far is indicative of his regular tactics I am going to guess that no matter what happens, if this wall is built, the American people will lose.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope I&#39;m just paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it.  If it goes that route...most likely the protests that we have already been seeing would get more and more outrageous until the government finally decided it was sick of conflict on their soil at which point martial law would become a thing.  Habeus corpus would be suspended, US troops would be deployed on domestic soil.  Basically the National Guard would roam the land like dinosaurs with automatic weapons.</p>

<p>Highly doubtful though.</p>

<p>The American People have been losing for decades. But to be fair, though the wall MAY improve things slightly for the American people, it certainly isn&#39;t the answer to all our problems, and as you suggested, could become more trouble than its worth. But guess we will just have to wait and see....i still have serious doubt that it will be constructed, nevermind completed.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No wall would be the best but Mr. Trump seems to be pretty set on it.  It seems a ridiculous idea.  It will divide the people even further.  Maybe that&#39;s the idea; maybe the idea is to build the wall peacefully only to have such an enormous, pivotal issue divide the people directly down the center.  The rage that some would feel over this faced against the smug sense of satisfaction from the other side would create a donnybrook or two.  Maybe destabilization of Mexico isn&#39;t the plan.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in America are now, and always have been divided on one issue or another.     </p>

<p>As for the wall, living in a SW state, I can honestly say that it should be and that i want it built and heavily patrolled. Illegal immigration is a very serious problem, whether people want to admit it or not. As for Americans who don&#39;t want it built, they are free to go to the other side of it if they want, but tbh, MEXICO would probably not want them.    </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mexico is and has been destabilized for decades. It is literally controlled by the cartels. Its citizens have very little means, or apparently will, to defend themselves, and its politicians make American Politicians look like boyscouts.    </p>

<p>Again, if the wall is built, it won&#39;t solve all our problems, but it certainly will help with illegal immigration. At least while it is patrolled and maintained.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i won&#39;t pretend to know his true motives, but one would have to be blind, or have complete faith in the mainstream media, to not realize that a vast majority of Americans, especially in the sw, want it built and patrolled. At the very least, he would be gaining some massive browning points with the majority of voters.       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mexico would adore our immigrants      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of &quot;Americans&quot; who don&#39;t want the wall built are 1st and 2nd generation Americans who are only Americans because their family ILLEGALLY came to the US, and leftist SJW&#39;s. No country, and especially not Mexico would adore these people....Americans can barley tolerate them, and there are few cultures on earth that are as tolerant as Americans. And honestly, Mexico has been harsher with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAu1K8Vyfo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Notalemming">their immigration laws</a> than we have.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I only see opportunity for political shenanigans.     </p>

<p>While its true that the opportunity for political shenanigans is there, a real border protection plan that includes a wall and patrol is a very real opportunity to combat a very real problem. But again, I&#39;m not gonna hold my breath that the thing will even get built.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a northerner I can&#39;t really argue the point from a practical perspective.  I have lived in Oklahoma and spent a week in Arizona looking at schools once.  There is a definitely a large Hispanic population.  Maybe instead of focusing on keeping people out we should focus on making these people citizens of the US therefore creating tax revenue to bolster an already burgeoning tax deficit created by their presence.  I am not saying give up US and Mexican sovereignty and adopt the Amero as our currency and unfortunately I don&#39;t have a better solution to the issue.  Not that my opinion on politics matters that much as a non-voter.  I just don&#39;t see building this wall with a price tag in the twentyish billion range and making the American tax payer foot the bill while saying we will maybe one day probably convince maybe Mexico or somebody they know to pay us back.  All the while we really should be concerned about possible events that will be shaping the future largely of the south west and the rest of America as well that will happen as a result of its construction.</p>

<p>The problem is that they( and by they i mean most) don&#39;t want to assimilate. They don&#39;t learn the language, they send most of their cash money wages to mexico. They don&#39;t play by the rules while they are here, they cost the taxpayer millions of dollars a year in healthcare and education, not even mentioning the cost of the crimes they commit while here. And the simple fact that they cheated to get here while many many honest hard working immigrants are waiting in line to get in. These people are selfish parasites that don&#39;t give a shit about America, only what America can give them. I mean FFS, i have seen these people, 1st/2nd generation &quot;citizens&quot;, and current illegals, skip work to go to a march where they hold up Mexican flags and scream viva la raza, and tell fairy tails about how america stole the sw from mexico. I have witnessed these people scam the healthcare system out of millions of dollars and then complain that they are racially profiled by police. Again, THEY means most, but they don&#39;t belong here, and quite frankly, don&#39;t deserve to be here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a northerner I can&#39;t really argue the point from a practical perspective.  I have lived in Oklahoma and spent a week in Arizona looking at schools once.  There is a definitely a large Hispanic population.  Maybe instead of focusing on keeping people out we should focus on making these people citizens of the US therefore creating tax revenue to bolster an already burgeoning tax deficit created by their presence.  I am not saying give up US and Mexican sovereignty and adopt the Amero as our currency and unfortunately I don&#39;t have a better solution to the issue.  Not that my opinion on politics matters that much as a non-voter.  I just don&#39;t see building this wall with a price tag in the twentyish billion range and making the American tax payer foot the bill while saying we will maybe one day probably convince maybe Mexico or somebody they know to pay us back.  All the while we really should be concerned about possible events that will be shaping the future largely of the south west and the rest of America as well that will happen as a result of its construction.</p>
