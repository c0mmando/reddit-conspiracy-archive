<p>This meme needs to die. Obama&#39;s immigration ban wasn&#39;t known about by the public until after the fact, whereas Trump&#39;s administration has been very loud about his. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t bullshit, because you completely misunderstand the purpose of the statement. It isn&#39;t going &quot;Shut up! You didn&#39;t care then!&quot;. It&#39;s pointing out that this isn&#39;t some new &quot;racist, xenophobic anti-Islamic&quot; policy that was just pulled out of Trump&#39;s ass. This isn&#39;t the first time something like this has been done before, but it wasn&#39;t even a big enough story for the news media to cover, then...but it matters now because suddenly it&#39;s discriminatory? But the same media that is riling up everyone didn&#39;t give a shit when it was done by a President who they liked. </p>

<p>And being that the public know about this NOW (which is ANOTHER purpose of this refrain that must not die), they should maybe put a halt on the xenophobia and racism claims? </p>

<p>They won&#39;t though. Because at the center of this, it has nothing to do with the actual policy itself. The media has had this &quot;xenophobic islamophobic Muslim ban&quot; script on deck for a year now. They&#39;ve fed it to the people that hate Trump (and will do so no matter what) and those people have digested it and are now shitting it back out. </p>

<p>These same people probably think that Trump arbitrarily chose the 7 countries that are temporarily barred entry (and did so because of business ties to others!). He didn&#39;t arbitrarily choose them. He didn&#39;t choose them at all, in fact. Again, that was the Obama administration&#39;s DHS. </p>

<p>So no, repeating this is not bullshit, because it is meant to educate people that are otherwise uneducated. The &quot;uninformed circlejerk&quot; that OP alluded to in the title.  </p>

<p>Nailed it.</p>

<p>Obama = good guy, which you can clearly tell because he&#39;s a black man in office, so <em>everything</em> he does is something that a good guy would do.</p>

<p>Trump = bad guy, which you can clearly tell because he&#39;s old and white and rich and in office, so <em>everything</em> he does is something that a bad guy would do.</p>

<p>When the media has control over shaping how people think, they can instill these base-level assertions about public figures in the minds of the public, enhanced by pairing them with an appeal to identity.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m a progressive kinda guy, so I voted for the first black President&quot; =&gt; Obama can do no wrong, because he&#39;s black and it&#39;s awesome that there&#39;s a black guy leading the country; if he did something majorly bad, it would conflict with my identity based around progressive ideals.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m a progressive kinda guy, so I voted against this rich straight white Republican sexist misogynistic transphobic Islamophobic homophobic white nationalist Super Hitler&quot; =&gt; Trump can do no right, because if he did, it would conflict with my identity based around progressive ideals.</p>

<p>Once you see the pattern behind the brainwashing, it all seems so fucking stupid, but that&#39;s just human brains for you I guess. Evolution did not prepare us for this always-connected global society we find ourselves in today. We&#39;re just doing the best we can.</p>

<p>They were louder than the right. The right criticized whatever Obama was doing, even if that meant them flip flopping over and over again. The few (but they were there) protests against actions in Syria, Libya, and Yemen were all leftist groups.

<p>No, it is nothing new at all. People are routinely detained, handcuffed, thrown into rooms, and questioned for hours. For no other reason then they are not US citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>our govt, as is the case of all govts, can and does routinely, rescind visas of anyone at any time for any reason or no reason at all. even bei g a diplomat offers no protection...you can be ordered to leave on christmas for the sheer capriousness of the president...but perhaps a month is too long to rbe expected to emember....</p>

<p>our govt, as is the case of all govts, can and does routinely restrict entrance to foriegn passport holders from any country in the world, for any reason or no reason at all at any time it so chooses.</p>

<p>these descisions can be and are routinely made by lowly TSA passport checkers on a daily basis. they can detain you without recouse, and if you cannot afford to return to your home country or to another country immediately can transfer you to the closest ICE detention center were you will ve treated non-different from any other illegal alien. if you do not speak english, just like any other ICE detainee, you will be denied an interpretter for your arraignment, and it can take months to even get before a judge. your best hope us that yoyr embassy or co sult will work overtime on your behalf to get you home.  </p>

<p>that you had a visa or a valid passport is completely irrelevant, you stay here at the govt&#39;s pleasure, just as is the case with all countries. in fact, the passport of an american citizen can be canceled at anytime, without recourse, even if it means you will be stuck in russia indefinitely.</p>

<p>people see other people hauled out of line or walked away from the booth all the time and say nothing. </p>

<p>people from targetted countries have been routinely forced to wait in special lines/areas as a group solely at the facist descretion of the TSA personal, who only have to say the people seemed suspicious.</p>

<p>we have had visa/passport ethnic profiling as a matter of course since 2003. regardless of where you are comi g from or where your passport is from, if you look muslim, you have a much higher chance of being detained (this happens to french allgerians and british muslims all the time).</p>

<p>the problem with trump&#39;s executive order is not so much who it targets, which are actually already targetted by existing laws, it is because it took effect immediately and did not take into account people in transit. the injunction was warranted in this case. </p>

<p>in 2015 obama signed the law restricted entrance to people from trump&#39;s unseemly seven, and no one cared. in fact, to know which countries trump was reffering to you had to pull up the law, which he referencec in the order. the press knew this because they knew tge names of the seven cou tries. tbey kept that tid bit to themselves.</p>

<p>i was asked about this order yesterday because I&#39;m a lawyer and be ause one summer in law school i worked assisting detainees in the miami ICE center.</p>

<p>my respi se was &quot;not acceptable.&quot; i was even accussed of not knowi g how to differentiate real executive orders and US codes from fake ones, because if what i said was true then CNN, MSNBC, and WAPO are lying. when i said &quot;if the shoe firs,&quot; i was yelled at over and over again with &quot;then who do you trust? wjo do you trust? you trust nobody.&quot; my respo se that i trust myself was dismissed out of hand.</p>

<p>just as fyis--we have always had a policy for accepting christain refugees over everyone else. all refugees must have american sponsor families in order to be released. famliies can be and are broken up when released (as an aside, ive never seen any one i know volunteer to house refugees, and when i suggested they do so now, since tney are so upset, they all said they could be against trump, but that didnt mean they had to help refugees. usually only evangelical, missionary church&#39;s sponsor refuges, looking for converts). here in south, FL no one has really recovered from the marianus boat lifts where castro, in a grand joke, sent us everyone from his prisons.</p>

<p>disclaimer: i did not vote for trump and i resent being put in the position of defending him on the basis of reality and inconvenient facts. i also have always leaned towards more open and welcoming refugee laws. however, i am opposed to black labor amd h1b visas because they lead to exploitation, and supress wages and workers rights for all. i comp,etely oposse ICE detention centers.</p>

<p>Correct, various governments of <a href="https://archive.fo/3Pqd2">Australia</a> do their fair share of that, putting aside for a moment other immigration issues as an example from just one country.</p>

<p>The group hysteria is just another means for people to hop on the bandwagon and virtue signal their dislike of US President Donald J. Trump (regarding the lack of same outrage when Obama enacted similar policies previously).</p>

<p>Things would be different in the Middle East if we saw similar public concerns regarding immigration policies of Israel, yet note the thunderous silence by comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they detain people with perfectly valid credentials all the time then why are people suddenly outraged about that aspect of it?</p>

<p>&quot;it&#39;s not often they detain people with perfectly valid entry credentials because the president suddenly issued a blanket ban.&quot;</p>

<p>The president&#39;s blanket ban is not something I personally agree with, but that is not the aspect that the media is focusing on. They are acting like people are being suddenly detained and that it is something that has not been regularly occurring for the last decade.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t just call that dishonest, I would call it blatantly misleading the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did the president order her to be detained?</p>

<p>The US is a large country with many, many people passing through its borders each day. The sheer volume means that there are always going to be a lot of individual cases where people are detained. Usually with good reason, but sometimes without, as in the case of your grandmother.</p>

<p>However, these detentions are generally unconnected. They happen for all sorts of different reasons. Today something different happened. The president signed an order which instantly nullified the right of entry for a large number of people. </p>

<p>This kind of behavior freaks people out because it is an indiscriminate, blanket ban. People see that and start thinking, what if my family are the next on the list?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we have plenty of people protesting a lot of things, and there will be more. I don&#39;t disagree with you but then which one do we pick first? Who do we focus on? I think the issues you&#39;re talking about are obviously atrocities and war crimes and hopefully we can get on that subject too. The military industrial complex has been doing this for over 50 years, it&#39;s a huge deal. It&#39;s amazing the things people can get used to and accept as &quot;normal&quot; when we aren&#39;t told all of the details and governments tell the people en masse who the &quot;enemy&quot; is. 
Also, I think you&#39;re oversimplifying the comment about a 90 day screening process. When you add this situation to the growing list of things happening in the last few weeks, more and more people are getting angry, and this is just the start. Protestors are gaining confidence in numbers and are going to do everything they can to be heard, so that they can affect change.</p>

<p>You are basically saying, oh don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s normal, just be detained.</p>

<p>Even though you are missing a lot that&#39;s going on with how this all happened.  You&#39;re simply accepting it up the ass.  It&#39;s somewhat pathetic.</p>

<p>You also seem to believe comparing it to Obama is the same, it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You also seem to think it is fucking a circlejerk/propaganda, which yet again is insane.  These are people who shouldn&#39;t have been detained.</p>

<p>I mean it isn&#39;t a sob story.  This is literally because of Trump.  Yet people are acting like nothing is wrong and that it&#39;s all good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted above also but as an outsider just trying to get clarification.</p>

<p>Are/were people from the 7 countries being denied entry - no negotiation; OR</p>

<p>Are/were people from the 7 countries being detained upon entry, vetted then in most cases being granted entry?; OR</p>

<p>Something in between, e.g. All being detained for questioning then most being denied entry?</p>

<p>If it is the latter two then I can understand why this is being posted in r/conspiracy because the situation is being grossly misrepresented by the media if that is the case. And even more so if after detainment most people are being let into the country</p>

<p>I read what I thought was a copy of the EO though and it said 90 day entry ban, so doesn&#39;t entry ban mean entry ban, complete denial of entry?</p>

<p>Really appreciate it if someone can clarify and even better if they can cite sources. Thanks.</p>
