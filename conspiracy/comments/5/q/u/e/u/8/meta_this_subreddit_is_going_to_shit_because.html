       To first address people who don't support Trump and think they're a victim. If you constantly browse subreddits like r/politics or r/enoughtrumpspam it's easy to see how you could be so conditioned to an anti-trump climate that this subreddit feels like r/the_donald to you. However, this is not the case. This is probably one of the least biased subs because conspiracies are usually fairly bipartisan. The only real case of bias here would be the Russia dossier being tagged with "unverified allegations", but is that really too big of a deal? The dossier was pushed by MSM to make you think it was true and it was such a big thing that people being goaded into accepting it as true could be fairly detrimental to discussion. The tag was correct too, the allegations were indeed unverified. Lately I have lost count of how many threads I see at the top of the front page with something like "Why is this not being discussed?" in the title and top comments like "This will never reach the top" or "This subreddit is just a Trump circlejerk". If you're really being censored and oppressed on this subreddit then don't waste your scarce opportunities to discuss the theories you like with generic circlejerky comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to any Trump supporters who feel victimised, not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill. Although this subreddit has been fairly right leaning recently due to the Democrat government and WikiLeaks, the Russia allegations are a fairly sound theory regardless of credibility. If people want to discuss them here they should be able too. On the same note, a person disagreeing with you about things like Pizzagate doesn’t make them a shill. They may be trying to find out more or trying to find a hole in your theory. Either way can lead to more good discussion which could change either of your viewpoints. Jumping to a shill accusation just ruins and derails threads.
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       Also, as pointed out by people in the comments, generic Trump news with no conspiracy surrounding it doesn't really fit here so don't post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally to everyone regardless. Stop with the personal attacks, it's getting old. This subreddit isn't some ideological battle ground; it's a place to discuss conspiracies. Don’t attack theories you don’t like either. The whole point of this subreddit is that you should be able to post anything you like and expect a reasonable discussion about it, be it Russia, Pizzagate or a Nazi city under Antarctica. Calling a conspiracy crazy is a fairly moot point and accomplishes less than nothing. Some of us come here for interesting theories rather than credible ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, before you stalk through my account, yes I am a Trump supporter who has posted on r/the_donald. That has nothing to do with the points I am trying to make.

       And even if you don't constantly browse those subs, it still comes across that way. Fact is people are sick of seeing pro Trump shit posted here, most of which has no conspiracy surrounding it, so they speak up about it. It has nothing to do with 'victimhood'.

       It should be solely about conspiracies, that's it's purpose. If you want a 'smarter talk forum' start a sub for it, or what's likely, there already is one that fulfills that purpose.

       I nominally support Trump and I agree. People are just posting news here now. And while I'm not the conspiracy police, and don't particularly mind, I completely understand why others are upset by it. We have an entire sub committed to that content, and that should suffice.

       It's pretty much all the authors unsubstantiated opinion about how he feels about trump and things surrounding him. Trying to paint trump as anti-establishment when his cabinet is mostly the people he would be fighting against if that was the case. Claiming things like his assessment shows trump is battling the deep state without supporting that statement.

       I view it as an opinion piece not something that needs to be fully sourced and such. I think it focuses less on Trump himself and more on the perception of Trump and the way his election, as well as things like Brexit, haven't been entirely conventional.

      <p>
       Which is core to the authors points are completely lacking in details that back them up for example. Author could have easily posted this assessment for us all to see. Someone else said it perfectly imo, this reads more like fan fiction than a fact based opinion piece.

       You're regarding Trump himself as the anti-establishment "Trump insurgency", which, as you've pointed out, is debatable. I see the "Trump insurgency" talked about by the author more as Trump's supporters who have been widely accepted as anti-establishment since the beginning, even if they're wrong about Trump himself being anti-establishment.

       I've seen a lot of people claim that the mods tagged that post unfairly and "this was the first time they tagged a post." These people are either liars or not regulars of this subreddit. If you go through the archive or
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , you will see all kinds of posts being tagged with "misleading" and many other things.

       This was the first one I clicked. It happens to be from 2014. Sure enough, there was a tagged post:

       The post wasn't tagged misleading. It was tagged unverified. That is the tag that has never been used, if I remember correctly. And the post was also removed by the mods, which I never see happen.

       If you search far enough, I'm sure you'll come accross a post tagged "unverified." However, even if you cannot locate one, that doesn't suggest that there is anything wrong with tagging a post with a specific word for the first time. They tag posts with all kinds of words and have been for a very long time.

       People had issue with that tag being used because almost everything in this sub is unverified. If you removed every post with unverified information, there would be no more posts here.

       What was the title? They have a post on the front page today tagged "proof?" because the title claimed there was proof when there wasn't any.

       The pizzagate shills go ad hominem off the bat usually. They are usually easy to spot. I've had decent discussions with real humans that were skeptical and it is totally different.

      <p>
       That said the shills outnumber the humans at least 10:1.
