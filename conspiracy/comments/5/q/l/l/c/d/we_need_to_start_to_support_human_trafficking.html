       I don't personally have many resources but lately I've felt that if I can help someone then maybe I'll get rid of some of this karma. I don't know much about charities and how to find a good one that isn't just a front for a bunch of criminals but maybe this is something this sub could start working on. We can't all help out on investigating this abuse but we sure could raise awareness of the issue. Maybe there are some charities and such that this sub would consider giving it's support to.

       Not at all. There's an army of paid shill fighting you-know-what gate. The sick thing is they're at Eglin Air Force Base. Thankfully, they're all going to be arrested for treason in the near future.

       I've personally busted one and connected them to Eglin. They went WAY beyond what they were supposed to be doing (which itself was a violation of their oath to uphold the Constitution).

       A purge is coming, with arrests, courts martial, etc. There's gonna be death penalty cases. I don't know if we'll hear about it on public channels.

       I don't know for sure that I understand you references ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you claiming that the "favorite child food"-gate is being actively hidden by US Air Force personnel stationed at Eglin AFB?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, If that is actually the case, I think we are on different paths of reality and facts.   Yours is not related to Issac Newtons or Albert Einsteins.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing to accept that a small cadre of high powered people may easily work together to commit crimes ... no stretch there
       <strong>
        at all
       </strong>
       ... however, to claim that
       <em>
        A)
       </em>
       a large number of very public people are pedophiles is beyond the pale of reasonable.
       <em>
        B)
       </em>
       that rank-and-file US Citizens working in the Military would support actions for such crimes ... is again, even farther beyond the pale of reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen some specific details of suspicion directed at INDIVIDUALS working alone or in VERY small groups who I would be quite un-surprised to learn are committing such crimes.  That does not extrapolate to large groups, other people, random citizens, etc.  THAT is the leap of the diluted fanatic.

       You already know Eglin AFB shills the boards heavily, you already know they did so before being authorized by statute, and you know that they shill against Trump, which is treason.

       As for Elgin AFB, I only went TDY there, but I don't recall meeting anyone who would consider treason as a feasible job description.

       I'm not sure how sympathetic or not this sub is. In general this sub is a better place for this idea because at the very least there is some actual grasp of the problem. I think we're getting to the point where PG is coming into acceptance, fewer shills etc. We are coming to the point where there is an atmosphere of acceptance of the issue, where the issue remains too hot for mainstream subs. 
Too many hostiles out there. But this isn't necessarily just to do some good, it's probably something we can do to push back against the elites generally.

       Honestly, I don't think the "elites" are the main problem of trafficking.  Most such victims are used for sex, so think of the numbers of escort clients ... they are perhaps above average wealth, but they are a FAR cry from "Elite".
      </p>
      <p>
       Other categories, such as domestic house workers, etc, are in the same category.  I don't want to fan irrationality, but Maid Brigade uses a lot of illegal immigrant labor ... a small fraction of that could, possibly, be trafficked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, to, isn't all illegal immigration "trafficking" simply by definition?

       George Webb's (Pulitzer Prize winning?) series on youtube points the finger at DynCorp for major human trafficking. Dyncorp is the CIA. Human trafficking is 2nd only to drug trafficking in terms of revenue. Follow the money.

       Nobody is under any obligation to regularly check in with 4chan conspiracy nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a prime example of people making up fake news to fit their narrative. They wanted a man to be dead and to have blood on podesta/Clinton hands. There was no reported crime, no missing persons report but whatever right? Shit now days even if you do VIDEO interviews people will say it's cgi and not really you if that's what fits their conspiracy theory.

       It isn't a 4chan thing, it is just sort of a human being thing.  It is why people worried for Julian after internet cutoff, it is why people worried for Eric Braverman when he missed his embassy appointment.  People were dying, like Seth Rich and the guy that served papers to DNC, so it isn't that anyone wanted him dead.  It is that they were looking out.

       I have known two people who were trafficked underage, the people responsible were affiliated with motorcycle enthusiasts.  This isn't like your internet "investigations". Mess with those people you end up dead. The only solution is for law enforcement to shut them down, since most of you seem to think they are "in on it" I see no chance this sub will help. Most charities are focused on rehabilitation of victims rather than stopping problem. It's good work but it's not exactly preventative. I have outlined before why law enforcement is not doing a good job on this, until people demand they act it will never stop.

       In the city I live in, there's something of a known ring working out of a handful of motels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to REALLY get angry about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the local unified police department know about it, but have been refusing to really investigate it.  Their argument being any number of things, but the most common one centering around the fact that this is a sanctuary city, and the people involved in it are probably illegals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say ALL law enforcement are turning a blind eye.  One major private armed security firm (one trained in counter-terrorism, if that tells you anything) has been working to actively try to bring this down, forcing the police to actually take notice and do their jobs.  Even our local transit police have stepped in, even though technically they don't have jurisdiction.  All the while the mayor keeps saying that it's racisim on the part of the private security guys for targeting these scum.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know it's a bad day when private security is doing more to protect and serve, than the people who actually take the oath to do so.

       A21 campaign is national.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for something you can participate in you can google "human trafficking awareness (your city,state).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been working with mine locally for several years now and they seem to do a lot of good. From writing letters to legislation to informing law enforcement on what to look for and how the charity can help with rehabilitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest things they do that I love is going to middle schools to raise awareness. A lot of testimonies from victims seem to say the same thing. They still went to school and were perceived to be taken care of. But they didn't know what they were going through wasn't normal. They didn't know there were adults that weren't part of their handlers sick masquerade. I have spoken to some teachers personally who actually had victims come to them after a lesson to say "this is happening, can you help".

       I know that as of 2004 all military are trained to combat human trafficking.  For my career I had to recertificy every year.  I wish they would make the info generally available.

       I've personally busted one and connected them to Eglin. They went WAY beyond what they were supposed to be doing (which itself was a violation of their oath to uphold the Constitution).

       A purge is coming, with arrests, courts martial, etc. There's gonna be death penalty cases. I don't know if we'll hear about it on public channels.
