       I didn't read any of the article or know any details when I got up at 4am back then. Just posted my initial thoughts. haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got nothing against Trump, at least he's operating differently than how everybody before him was the same, almost. I just posted my thoughts how his behavior seems to get more people mad at him, than if he would be the same like others before him. My thoughts were, wouldn't be surprised if some disgruntled party, because of his actions tries to go at him. He seems to have a fair amount of parties ticked off at him. Who knows though, maybe that's part of some kind of plan like to have a reason like why Kennedy was taken out. He's not even a couple weeks in yet too. What if he gets someone who runs a third world country, who has power, pissed off at him. That's how wars start.

       This is going to sound awful but have you thought about the CIA? Trump met them last week and said he would have their back and maybe this is their way of helping him gain public support for his immigration ban in return for Trump letting them continue with their shady business. It sounds twisted but it would not surprise me.

Watch for that later. I don't know.. his stuff seems to get those types of foreign religious people mad at him more than how others would not do things and just leave them be. Would seem like how he'd be more of a target now than otherwise. What do you think?

       I'm from Québec. This Mosque had been target of hatred for many years now (pigs head incident, graffiti on walls). The two suspects have been arrested, they are local university students.

       "He might as well put another wall up north now" I really hope you are kidding, do you not know how fucking big the Canada-US border is??? Some border stations have recently removed border patrol agents and are instead opting for camera only observation.
      </p>

       "More than half this country is immigrants and everybody gets along" I mean that's just a really uninformed statement. There is lots of resentment against refugees and immigrants in Canada also.

       Yeah.. had just woke up at 4am, read that and posted knee-jerk conspiracy minded thoughts. They'd always say things like that about these mass shootings, how the guys were CIA mind controlled manchurian candidates, or something. haha. Just thought I'd post my idea of hey, does this look like that, and see what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you but when I go out out there, as a caucasian, I'm a minority so it's way more than half when I go to the supermarket. I look around, I'm the only white guy. Who's working all the jobs, well when somebody in a "visible minority" position gets the job of who does the hiring, you don't see any more white people working there, now do you. Probably just live in one of their neighborhoods. However, go downtown, where the white people work in the high rises, same thing. The minority rate is over half, probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that terrorist act was just some disgruntled white guys. Why all of a sudden now though. They'd be mad because more immigrants would be coming in after Trump shuts them out. What's different than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       We got a totally open door and they keep letting them in even though we can't find jobs. Years ago you'd see taxis lined up and all these guys from India driving them. Even they couldn't get jobs anymore doing that, years ago now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whoever it was that did the terrorist act was disgruntled about something. Well them doing that isn't going to fix the flood of immigration even though nobody's got jobs anymore. Thats why it may seem fishy. One of us who's disgruntled, taking only a few out won't fix the problem. They would know that. It's like taking out a few of a herd, not going to do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       These conspiracy guys talk about how these mass shootings are for whatever reasons they create afterwards. Well, what would this one do if it was by them. Who gets mad by it, probably those muslims, who were already fouled up. Now they'd start doing the things Trump thinks they do. There's no proof Trump is involved at all, obviously. But just thought of hey, I've heard whenever there's these mass shootings the conspiracy guys are like.. oh it's the government. Well, in this instance, if it's them.. what's the purpose it would cause. WHY.

       Just like the 'attacks' that happened after Trump's win that were found to be done by anti-Trump folks - you should ask yourself, who actually benefits from these attacks?

       Alexandre Bissonnette, a Quebec citizen, is the only current suspect. Confirmation upcoming but this guy, who fled the scene, is the only suspect now-- the previously-mentioned second suspect, a Muslim of Moroccan descent, is actually just a witness and survivor of the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this event was first reported, a fake Reuters twitter account claimed the shooters were two known far-right white nationalists, since debunked. In retaliation, unverified "we heard this on Canadian police radio" accounts claimed the shooters had Muslim names and were Syrian refugees just admitted to Canada last week, a notion spread through (BIG SURPRISE) the_donald and other Alt-Right havens-- this has also been debunked.

       The MSM are connecting other stories by displaying them before another story is coming in and people indirectly are programmed that these stories are related. At first look the thought police news look innocent and really 'reporting' and a normal, casual daily person who is on mainstream spectrum just cannot spot the brainwashing in there.

       I was doing the dishes, looking out the window. There's a Quik-E-Mart next door, eh.. Had a laugh.. this redneck pulls up in a truck with a snowmobile in the back with the tailgate down because the box is too short. I pictured filming him walking out like some wildlife video. "Footage of the rare caucasian endangered species still left in the wild". It is a bit like that 2006 movie Idiocracy. Who's still making kids.. well pretty much only the immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kept doing the dishes and thinking.. this terrorist act.. it's not gonna be some disgruntled white guy. That'd be like taking one out of a herd.. does nothing to fix the problem. They know that would do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I was thinking.. who's the disgruntled white guy who hates muslims and would probably love seeing a few of them get shot. Well, that'd be Trump. lol. Wouldn't be surprised if him and Aryan race buddies who run the world would sit around chuckling about that event last night. Ask yourself WHO and then WHY.

       It DOES sound like a possible false flag, but remember that it's ON muslims- not BY muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the mosque has had swastikas graffittied on it in the past few months (where have we heard that before), in addition to other targetted "hate speech".  So they installed video cameras... Wonder if any of that footage will be made available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the one guy they're calling a suspect:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [He] has right-wing political ideas, pro-Israel, anti-immigration. I had many debates with him about Trump. He was obviously pro-Trump.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with anti-immigrant and other right-wing beliefs, he also made anti-women’s rights remarks
       </p>
       <p>
        About 17 minutes after the first call of shots fired at the mosque, Alexandre Bissonnette, called 911 to police he felt guilty about what he had done, La Presse reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mohamed Khadir, the second man taken into custody at the scene, is also a student at the university. It is not known if he knew Bissonnette, or why he was arrested.

       The corporation of Canada has realized that it's human asset pool is dwindling due to the systematic attack on the family unit by liberal entities and thus will risk the insecurity and possible death of its resources in order to expand. This will also aid in dividing the voting pool in order to assure the bipartisan, large government and the confusion required to maximize profits. - Justin Trudeau
