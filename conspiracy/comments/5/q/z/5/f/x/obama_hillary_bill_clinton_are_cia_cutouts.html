       I proved to you earlier that Hillary, Obama, and Google are CIA, and it's extremely easy to do. Bill must be also, how else could a C student at Yale go to oxford, as rhodes scholar, rape a girl there and still become president with is bent ____.  There is also a famous, clearly staged picture of JFK shaking hands to (preplanned future president) Bill Clinton at age 16, wearing an American Legion Boys event shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Clinton--iirc--never served in the military, and was in fact a draft dodger.  Yet all the red hatted AL veteran masons have saluted him over the years with a tear in their eye as they forfeited their money to ensure that their hobo-gangster-cum-elect would have a victory in the polls.  Bill was also a DeMolay kid, and continues to be a demolay senior, another masonic org.  BOth are in the CFR and about 5 other international secrecy orgs only elites can go.  Funny how a poor kid from Arkansas growing up in a shack with domestic abuse can go so so far, seems likely right?  To go from dixie mafia funding to drug dealing to brownstoning in arkansas, to strings of murders all over the place, to countless intrigues, to president, to scandal to countless secret massacres across the world, to child sex trafficking and blackmail....all the way up to chain to billionairehood, because a bunch of rich idiots think their words have something of great value.
      </p>
      <p>
       When really 'greatness' has always been defined by bodycounts, from ancient rome to the mongols to caesar to now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama or I should say Barry Soetoro is self explanatory.  What president do you know has aliases?  We'll find out Trump was right all along with his birth certificate, but we know in fact his mom was cia, and that he worked for a cia affiliate in his law school years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is also self explanatory.  They must have ripped open her soul and inserted choronzon333 in her at an early age, then they put her with Bill and it was love at first psych.  Then he fed her his blood and swore a blood oath to her that she should fulfill his dreams and he would do the same.  This last one is a story, of course, but I bet the truth is not far off.  We are going to find Hillary is also a high level kabbalist / witch of some sort.  Because her rise has been nothing if not magical and black.

       Webb believes China and Russia have copies of Huma's emails.   And I agree with him in saying, if Trump has those and doesn't release them things will only be worse if released by China or Russia.  But either way it will be a big fall in the US either way.  Organ and Child sex trafficking along with satanic cult abuse... pretty heavy stuff.

       All good talking points.  There's a lot of stuff and on George Webbs vids that may be tough to wrap our heads around without doing actually investigating ourselves.  But between wikileaks and pizzagate and the incessant pushback without addressing any content I'm going to side more with the free-thought researchers.
