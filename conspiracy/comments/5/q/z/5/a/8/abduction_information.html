       So recently i shared a story where I experienced memory loss on 3 different occasions last year. One of them was for 17hrs and one of the times i had a scratch on my arm. Someone kinda freaked me out now and I would like to get more information if someone has any knowledge on this. Like is there something I should keep an eye on? Am i in danger? Should I move out of my new house?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Come on guys, where are the alien/ghost/whatever people at?? Should I get the hell out of this place??

       I moved to a new area and house last year. Its a pretty secluded area where I now live. Last year i had those 3 instances where I can't remember my day. I remember coming home and then waking up. The first time i was missing 17hrs, the other 2 around 12hrs. Second time i had a scratch on my arm, no blood, just a red line and burning sensation. I also sometimes experience a weird feeling were my heart starts beating fast and I really feel someone is in my room watching me. I never experienced any of this before moving here, which is 1 year ago. What does it mean? Should I get out of here asap??

       Its a residential area but kinda secluded, not many people or buildings. I'm christian but i'm not really very religious, just being honest, fair never hurt people and stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the only similar experience was when i was really young that there was one year in which i felt similar heartbeats and I thought i was seeing shadows approach me at nights in my room. I would then start crying/yelling and at one point it got so bad that my parents took me to the hospital, in which they diagnosed that i have too much energy. This I can't really tell what happened as i now don't even remember what exactly i was seeing.

       I should preface, I'm spiritual and not religious, but this hits close to home for me, and I'd love to help, if I can..

      <p>
       Okay, good. Now, have you had any changes in your habits/intake/behavior? Drinking more? Contemplating faith more? Partaking in other drugs? Pissing off spirits in one way or another, or maybe longing to try to connect with the spirits (loved on passing). These are pretty important questions, and they are personal.. So, I completely understand if you don't want to answer.. If not, think about it.

       Ok. And, what I meant was meddling in/with the spirit world? Do you have positive or negative energy flowing? I know these may seem abstract or odd questions, but I'm just seeing if you are inviting positive or evil spirits in. I believe in forest folklore. Most of the time evil spirits need a "welcome", while good spirits/energy do not, they help you.. while the "evil" are more mischievous and nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in aliens, and have had similar abduction experiences in my life. I've boiled it down to forest folklore, after doing much research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, you may be being visited by a good or nefarious spirit. If it's good, embrace it, if it's evil, you need to find out why it's there, in the first place..
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense?

       Dude you're freaking me out! What do you mean spirits? I'm positive, I almost never think negative and i can say I'm a good person. I don't want to hurt or take advantage of people and if someone needs help I give help. I haven't lost someone recently that was really close to me. No depression. And last year it was a really good year for me as for my personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you mean by spirits? Like a ghost or something like that? And if i did get scratched from that why would someone want to scratch me? And why so many hours?

       I don't mean to freak you out, but it's a natural response when talking about these things. Energy exists all around us, both positive and negative. There are forces, we humans have no understanding/comprehension of. They effect us, and sometimes "make contact", for reasons we do not truly or will ever know.. I'm not talking in religious sense of things, but spiritual. Energy cannot be created, nor destroyed. It's transferred. This is the premise of "ghosts". But, that holds a negative connotation...
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be a target of either one. A scratch is not necessarily a sign of "evil". It could be a good spirit letting you know, it's made contact. Now, I don't know why you would lose so much time. The most time I've lost was about an ~hour, and was spit back into real time... Had a few of those experiences..
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are being sincere, there is something you really need to address in your life. I saw some of your edits, and you may need to think long and hard about this. There is always a reason. I asked for evil spirits to come into me, to prove they existed. Fuck all, that was a trippy and scary few months, until I banished them...
      </p>
      <p>
       That changed me, and learned to never meddle in things I don't truly understand..

       There is your answer. You asked, and welcomed something in. IMO, it's not aliens or extraterrestrials, but spirits that have been with humans for millions of years. Yes, you heard me. I think humans have been here for millions of years in various stages of intelligence. There is always a reset, ie, the Great Deluge...

       Yes but believing and wanting to know the truth is not something that i picked up last year. And if you think that aliens don't exist then what is it? I mean I don't really understand about spirits and stuff like that. My thoughts are more like beings exist outside this planet and we're visited by them. More like short/tall greys, reptilians etc... So if my thoughts are going that way then what did i get?

       You're giving me a whole new thing than i was expecting. And by no means I wasn't asking to see something bad. Based on your beliefs and point of viewing things is this something bad? Should i just drop the argument of asking to see an alien? Can you point me to what you're talking about so i can research it? So basically stop thinking about this stuff and if this is really something paranormal or whatever that I should not be messing with it would stop?

       I wouldn't say it's good or bad, because I don't know. Personally, what I would do is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Before going to bed, while laying down say, and before dosing off say: "Thank you Creator, for showing me. I no longer wish to be convinced or contacted at this time, and now understand the message you've sent me".
      </p>
      <p>
       May sounds corny, may not work, but that is what I would do. Like I said, I've had similar experiences. I invited "evil" spirits in to prove to me their is a Creator, and that these things exists (very dark time in my life). I learned, then banished them through acceptance and humility..
      </p>

       I really thank you for your advice. It was definitely something that I wasn't expecting and something outside my viewpoint. I do kinda see your perspective though. I wasn't trying to get something bad out of this, and based on my current beliefs i was expecting something more physical closer to a human understanding. I will do just what you advised me to do, not sure if I would be willing to close my eyes today and go to sleep but eventually when that time comes I would think what you said. There are definitely some unexplained things that happened to me during my lifetime and to this day I can't explain them. I do know that someone/something saved my life once and till this day I still see things in my mind that provide great value to my life. I will research the things you told my because its not that far from what  I currently believe and you seem knowledgeable on what you're talking about. I know you probably don't what to remember the bad period of your life you mentioned but I wouldn't mind at all learning what happened to you. Nevertheless thank you, you really did calm me down a bit, or at least gave me some food for thought. Thanks!

       You're truly welcome, and I'm glad I could help a little. Like I said, I'm not religious, more spiritual and believe in intelligent Creation. Could be one Creator or a group, I have no idea, no one truly does. If you had to "label" me, I'd probably be a mix of pagan/folk and deist.

       I know the feeling. I've had two near death situations, and something always brought me back. Which is why, my beliefs are what they are today..

       It's cool, I've come to terms. Basically, I had a major loss in my life, was depressed, drank quite heavily, questioned my faith, and asked for proof. Boy, did I ever get some... I don't want to say that "god" showed me "hell", but something happened. The universe gave me exactly what I asked for, and after that I figuratively died, and grew into the dude you are talking to now. There is a lot more to it (probably could write a book), but that is a gist. No longer Catholic and actually feel at peace with nature and life... Hard to explain.. Was materialistic, now live above the Arctic Circle with very little, but happy as a pig in shit :)

       Also not sure if your near death experience is the same as mine but while sober i see random things in my head, like a movie kind of thing, sometimes they come true and sometimes don't (or maybe do but I forget the vision by then). That specific time i saw something really out off my knowledge, I didn't even think it was a possibility, but it showed me what to do to prevent it and 5 minutes later it played exactly the way I saw it and I did exactly what i saw doing and it saved my life. I never told anyone that i see things in my head but hey r/conspiracy can handle it 😁

       Sounds familiar. Have you ever looked into being an empath or psychic abilities? Many people who have had near death experiences have these traits. Not all, but many do.. For one reason or another....

       I'm usually ~5-15 thoughts ahead of other people when talking to them, and have a photographic memory. I remember damn near every. Stone drunk or not, if it happens to me, it registers. Also, I have gut feelings, that go far being gut feelings, and reach the core of my being..

       No I haven't. But I've always been this way. At first I wasn't really paying attention, I thought everyone is like that, but with time i started noticing that is not normal. I tried to explain it with logic but then when I noticed that some were not even close to my knowledge and I couldn't have known it before it just wasn't logical to see it, I then started paying more attention. I'm a very paranoid person usually because of it, I've been seeing something really bad coming for humans for a long time now, and I kinda prepared myself for it in a way. I hope it never happens but I now feel even more strongly than it's coming. Or maybe I'm really paranoid and I'm losing my mind. I don't know, as I said I can't explain it and maybe its just human knowledge making connections and because I'm very visual i see them in my mind. I just don't know yet, I'm still debunking it!

       I think I (and you) may have just found another fellow empath :). You're not alone, mate, and I don't think you're losing your mind. There are quite a few of us here, as well.

       I'm truly grateful for this conversation.. Welcome! One of us! Although, we get written off quite a bit here and generally, by people. From what you said, I 100% relate...

       I know what you mean. This is why I never told anyone. I tried to fish people to see how they would react if I were to say anything but I know they'll lock me up in a mental hospital if I say it. The last couple years I see some friends being more prepared to listen but I literally had to prove my sanity first so they now see me more like a teacher kinda of thing. I gave them couple predictions in the past and I acted on them so they believed me when they played out. Most were by making money through some pretty unique ways but that's what most people care about this day so I used that to verify my sanity and credibility. I do read a lot and my knowledge helps but sometimes it feels like I'm told what to do and what the outcome would be and I just have to do it. So far it worked, and I have a bank account to prove it in a way if people want to challenge me 😁

       I'd say don't be in any huge rush to.  It's not geographically based.  What's happening to you is likely based upon

       There's a possibility you might be being contacted by an extraterrestrial or extradimensional entity (sometimes one can be both, however).  Of course it's also possible that it's all prosaic and there's a much more terrestrial reason for it all.

       It can happen for many reasons.  Sometimes it genealogical - one or both of your parents had contact experiences, so you're next in line.  Other times it just appears to be a "luck of the draw" sort of thing that we humans can't entirely discern.

       Yep.  Sometimes it happens like that.  Granted, this most definitely doesn’t necessarily happen with
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       who asks, of course, but there have indeed been various cases where contact occurs in a rather similar manner.

       I’m not sure that the intention on every occasion of ET contact (if really even on any occasion) is to “freak you out”.  It seems that a similar analogy might involve animal behaviorists doing conservation testing on, say, a herd of Impala.  While the testing they do is ultimately designed to
       <em>
        save
       </em>
       the herd, the individuals that they temporarily capture and tag I’m sure end up being completely and entirely traumatized from being shot with a tranquilizer, unable to move, having various strange creatures standing above them poking around on them, and then waking up with a strange tag on their ear.

      <p>
       Energy and personal intent, believe it or not, is important - especially on the more subtle and multidimensional wavelengths that some more advanced identities are said to function in.  Once we begin to be able to communicate better in other non-physical dimensions, we can exert our intentions there better and communicate with others that exist there more effectively than we do now.

       You're giving me a whole new thing than i was expecting. And by no means I wasn't asking to see something bad. Based on your beliefs and point of viewing things is this something bad? Should i just drop the argument of asking to see an alien? Can you point me to what you're talking about so i can research it? So basically stop thinking about this stuff and if this is really something paranormal or whatever that I should not be messing with it would stop?

       Have you talked to a doctor about this? Not trying to be a dick, but memory loss can be a serious health issue and ruling out something medical would be a good step to figuring out if it is something paranormal.
