I have never heard any discussion about the human trafficking problem besides the onslaught of stories that people here are totally desensitized to. <strong>I am interested to see if anyone in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has any conspiracy theories about the trafficking here in Houston</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://abc13.com/1723146/">http://abc13.com/1723146/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The 21-year-old sex trafficking victim told authorities she was kidnapped in Ohio and brought to Houston specifically for prostitution during the Super Bowl. A rape counselor said the woman has mental impairment and suffers from seizures. Authorities believe that&#39;s why the pimp abandoned her downtown, where she was victimized by yet another attacker.&quot;</p>

<p>Morons like you need to stop throwing around the phrase YOU&#39;RE RACIST when they have their SJW meter triggered.  I was pointing out an awkward statistic, an observation, that nobody in this thread has refuted. Have you even listened to any hip hop?  Why is being a pimp glorified so much?

<p>And no I haven&#39;t seen the indoctrination you&#39;re referring to but I don&#39;t live in the USA. Also see my comment above as you appear to have been indoctrinated yourself to refer to a class of people by the color of their skin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in America, black people call themselves black and if you call them brown, they will disagree with you, and prob&#39;ly laugh in your face. No, there are no literally black humans, it is how the African race is labeled. Ppl come in all shades of brown but racism has made it much more divisive by calling light brown ppl white and so forth. Brown ppl are the Hispanic, ME types. No, skin color does not define a &#39;class of ppl.&#39;  I don&#39;t know where you get that from. I have black family members that I am very protective of bec I see disproportionate crimes and negative views attached to the black race while other lighter browns get a free pass for same or worse behaviors. That was my point and I stand by it. </p>

<p>Does it matter? What would you suggest anyone do with this information? Shall we gather up all the black men in Houston and politely ask them if they are pimps? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be like you (it&#39;s still there in my comment history) and then I realized that even my mild racism was racist. Sure you can call back to some real examples to make it seem less racist, but if you even begin to understand the ridiculous strides both sides of politics have gone through to keep black people in poverty you would realize that ganster culture, bad spending habits, and other black stereotypes are symptoms, not causes. Hell even black leaders are racist and oppressive to black communities. We give them shit schools, shit areas, shit jobs, and treat them like shit, then when they rage back we go &quot;see, this is why you can&#39;t have nice things&quot; and say other stupid shit like pull yourself up from your bootstraps etc...</p>

<p>Black people that come up in white areas don&#39;t seem to have the issues that black people that come up in the black ghettos do. Except for being called out on not being &quot;black enough&quot; which is something you can witness a variation of in poor white communities (oh college boy huh, you think you&#39;re better than me) as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Super Bowl and human trafficking, I&#39;ve always felt disgusted about this. There is no better opportunity to identify the people involved in this and instead of a bust, it&#39;s just a free for all. The Super Bowl should donate for a task force and air commercials about how to identify possible trafficked humans, instead of wearing pink sometimes. Instead, right, we get Gaga to distract us from the fact that the reason there are so many trafficked humans is because Bob and Andy from down the street are getting their rocks off on a boys weekend for the Super Bowl. This is everyone&#39;s problem and it&#39;s everywhere and we are so distracted. It&#39;s so upsetting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Super Bowl is the most profitable day of the year for sex trafficking, and sex workers are brought into the U.S. solely for that day. It makes sense, though. Most people attending the Super Bowl are wealthy enough to afford tickets, spend the weekend in a different city, are somewhat incognito, and probably drunk a majority of the time. It&#39;s the perfect setting to sell some sex. </p>
