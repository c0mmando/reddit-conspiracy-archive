       I am very concerned about my home city. I have never heard any discussion about the human trafficking problem besides the onslaught of stories that people here are totally desensitized to.

        I am interested to see if anyone in

         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        has any conspiracy theories about the trafficking here in Houston

       "The 21-year-old sex trafficking victim told authorities she was kidnapped in Ohio and brought to Houston specifically for prostitution during the Super Bowl. A rape counselor said the woman has mental impairment and suffers from seizures. Authorities believe that's why the pimp abandoned her downtown, where she was victimized by yet another attacker."

       . Oh am I now?  What if I told I was actually brown? Would I still be a racist then?  Because I am actually of African descent myself. Awkward eh?

       Morons like you need to stop throwing around the phrase YOU'RE RACIST when they have their SJW meter triggered.  I was pointing out an awkward statistic, an observation, that nobody in this thread has refuted. Have you even listened to any hip hop?  Why is being a pimp glorified so much? I hardly see any glory in this business.

       I'll give you some advice friend and I hope you actually think about it. Stop referring to ANY people as BLACK. Notice I didn't do that in any of my comments? Have you ever met a human being that was black before?  I haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no I haven't seen the indoctrination you're referring to but I don't live in the USA. Also see my comment above as you appear to have been indoctrinated yourself to refer to a class of people by the color of their skin.

       Well, in America, black people call themselves black and if you call them brown, they will disagree with you, and prob'ly laugh in your face. No, there are no literally black humans, it is how the African race is labeled. Ppl come in all shades of brown but racism has made it much more divisive by calling light brown ppl white and so forth. Brown ppl are the Hispanic, ME types. No, skin color does not define a 'class of ppl.'  I don't know where you get that from. I have black family members that I am very protective of bec I see disproportionate crimes and negative views attached to the black race while other lighter browns get a free pass for same or worse behaviors. That was my point and I stand by it.

       Sure if it gives people more info on how to call out or stop this. I don't know how much there really is to discuss.. many people would think of a black person when you say "pimp" it's not a radical idea

        Are we allowed to discuss that the pimps behind this business are almost exclusively Of African descent? Or will that be too awkward?

       Does it matter? What would you suggest anyone do with this information? Shall we gather up all the black men in Houston and politely ask them if they are pimps?

       Black people commit more crimes, black people have less opportunities. It's a vicious cycle and you aren't some observant genius for being the person who points it out.

       I used to be like you (it's still there in my comment history) and then I realized that even my mild racism was racist. Sure you can call back to some real examples to make it seem less racist, but if you even begin to understand the ridiculous strides both sides of politics have gone through to keep black people in poverty you would realize that ganster culture, bad spending habits, and other black stereotypes are symptoms, not causes. Hell even black leaders are racist and oppressive to black communities. We give them shit schools, shit areas, shit jobs, and treat them like shit, then when they rage back we go "see, this is why you can't have nice things" and say other stupid shit like pull yourself up from your bootstraps etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people that come up in white areas don't seem to have the issues that black people that come up in the black ghettos do. Except for being called out on not being "black enough" which is something you can witness a variation of in poor white communities (oh college boy huh, you think you're better than me) as well.

       The Super Bowl and human trafficking, I've always felt disgusted about this. There is no better opportunity to identify the people involved in this and instead of a bust, it's just a free for all. The Super Bowl should donate for a task force and air commercials about how to identify possible trafficked humans, instead of wearing pink sometimes. Instead, right, we get Gaga to distract us from the fact that the reason there are so many trafficked humans is because Bob and Andy from down the street are getting their rocks off on a boys weekend for the Super Bowl. This is everyone's problem and it's everywhere and we are so distracted. It's so upsetting.

       The Super Bowl is the most profitable day of the year for sex trafficking, and sex workers are brought into the U.S. solely for that day. It makes sense, though. Most people attending the Super Bowl are wealthy enough to afford tickets, spend the weekend in a different city, are somewhat incognito, and probably drunk a majority of the time. It's the perfect setting to sell some sex.

       I have lived in Houston for the majority of my life and it seems as Houston grows it gets worse.
The human trafficking here is really bad and cps doesn't help with the problem.
So many kids and people go missing here :/
