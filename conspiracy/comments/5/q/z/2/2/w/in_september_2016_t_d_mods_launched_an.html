       In September 2016, t_d mods launched an organization dedicated to propagandizing America with funding by Oculus/Facebook almost-billionaire Palmer Luckey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The announcement of the organization included this bit of bragging:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the MSM, now itâ€™s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not."
      </p>
      <p>
       The announcement had hundreds of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the talk about CTR I thought it was worth acknowledging the organized shilling openly taking place in our own backyard.
      </p>

       T_D shillery did absolutely conquer reddit and the CTR. Astro-turfing, brigading, memeing, concern trolling (I don't support Trump but Hilary's health/emails...) - you name it they did it. Still are. Shame they had to come to conspiracy. Can't even critisize trump (or Russia) here without being downvoted. It use to be just the JIDF that would waltz in here anytime there was a 'zionist conspiracy' post, even the Trump shillery pissed them off enough to leave.

       As a long time conspiracy theroist and Trump I can understand the appeal of Trump amongst the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has touched on things like vaccines,the new world order,and the climate change hoax.All of these have been staples of the community for years.He has also made enemies of the very people many theroist believe to be the secret rulers of the world(illumanati)the cia ,the pope,the failing legacy media etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a conspiracy theroist himself,I bet he has even browsed this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike CTR or JIDF (we do a thread about known shill organisations)the shilling/shitposting is not an organised effort,more.I think the two communities are users are intertwined with each other .
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here for conspiracy disscusion,it just so happens that the new President is creating much fodder for community,War with deep state,roger stone poisoning etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like the way anti trump sentiment is quashed in here but I think this is down to suspicion of CTR shills,once you know that a paid army of shills is spreading anti trump propaganda it's hard to take any thing anti at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when a legitimate anti trump story comes up,like the Russian agent that was murderd(front page a couple of days ago) it is brigades by CTR and makes any real discussion difficult.This is sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all this is a very interesting time to be a conspiracy theroist,new conspiracies that will be discussed for years to come are being made know,the enemy has revealed itself,the second meme war is about to begin,I say enjoy it best we can and take it all in,this is history.

       When this was announced on the Donald it went like a ton of bricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The community rightfully decided this would undermine our shitposting.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm aware they scrapped the idea or at least disassociated it from the Donald.

       I think it was the idea of the Breitbart editor and black cock seeker Milo Yanopilos.
