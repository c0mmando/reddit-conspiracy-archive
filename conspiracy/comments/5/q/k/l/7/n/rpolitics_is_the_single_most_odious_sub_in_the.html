    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a proponent of not having some diversity, I live in fucking Manhattan. That said, the facts bear out that communities do better the less diverse they are. Countless studies have shown that often times the less diverse an area the more neighbors trust each other, the less crime there is, people have more faith in family and real relationships, etc. Every other race is allowed to have strong in group preferences, that gets praised, but if white people have strong in group preferences they are hateful bigots.

<p>No one says that except you people. Strawman.</p>

<p>Another Strawman. No one (that matters) criticizes America for being &quot;too white.&quot; That&#39;s what <em>you</em> hear when they say that institutional prejudices exist, and should be civilly discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, seriously. This is my point right here. Even in this hacksaw edited clip removing all context and only highlighting the most incendiary quotes, it&#39;s still clear that she&#39;s literally saying &quot;there are prejudices that exist. Let&#39;s talk about them, and actually listen to those that are affected.&quot;  She&#39;s not saying kill all whites she&#39;s saying hey listen to the grievances instead of immediately shutting them down. Are you really against that? Really? Listening? </p>

<p>I mean, isn&#39;t that what you want with your man problems? Like about how women win most child custody cases just because they&#39;re women? And how fewer cases of women on man sexually assaulted get prosecuted? Do you not see that these are the same issues? The people with the grievances are being dismissed outright and talked down at. </p>

<p>You want an example of the prejudices I described? Look up  <em>Texas v Inclusive Communities Project</em> it&#39;s a pretty perfect example. What I&#39;m talking about isn&#39;t someone calling someone else a fag, it&#39;s more insidious and untargeted than that. It didn&#39;t even have a &quot;smoking gun&quot; or even a guilty party. It&#39;s deep seeded, subliminal and much more impactful on a socio-economic scale, and it&#39;s repercussions last decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like all the anti-Trump people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist in me gets suspicious. On one hand I assume there is a diverse array of opinion in this sub.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I see a targeted campaign against this sub in other subs. I&#39;ve seen reddit censoring (&quot;filtering&quot;) Trump supporters. Plus most of the posts I see upvoted in threads in this sub recently are anti-Trump. How can this be a pro-Trump sub if I constantly see a bunch of people complaining about Trump supporters?</p>

<p>The weird thing is they are complaining about a problem they created. All dissenters we&#39;re smeared as ignorant bigots and nazis. And that shut down the debate. It&#39;s hard to have a debate if the instant response is always someone calling out a non-malicious/obvious generalisation as being literally Hitler. </p>

<p>All this talk of fascism and yet I&#39;m seeing most of the fascist behaviour from the Left (P.S. I&#39;ve only ever voted Left btw). </p>

<p>Weird timing considering this sub is the only place I see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns&amp;amp;t=1s">George Webb</a> (a Youtube wormhole worth every minute) posted regularly. I see people complaining every-time Clinton get&#39;s bought up even though the Clinton&#39;s are like every conspiracy theorists wet dream. There is no statute of limitations on her crimes just because she lost the election.</p>

<p>I like debate. I&#39;m prepared to accept Trump is a shady guy and not so clean himself. But he has only just got into political office. Until he topples a regime, loots a dictators horde and engages in disaster capitalism I&#39;m willing to give him a break.</p>

<p>The only reason why you don&#39;t see users attacking each other on there is because if anyone says anything <em>resembling</em> a dissenting opinion, they get instantly banned. The mods even go in other people&#39;s comment history and see if they made comments that go against their narrative on other subreddits, and ban users based on that as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s nothing. Just today I was on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (for a lol or two) and I came across a comment thread where the majority was ganging up on Trump for getting rid of obamacare. </p>

<p>Which in itself is a fair beef. It&#39;s contentious. I&#39;m an understanding person. I get it.</p>

<p>Someone claimed and was upvoted and agreed with for saying something along the lines of  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>*DJT is going to get rid of Obamacare. Therefor, Anyone who voted for DJT HATES disabled people, and therefor they do not have any conscience, they are irredeemable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is a popular idea there! But that&#39;s not the worst part. This pragmatic dude who&#39;s probably a trump supporter comes in and real cool says something like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alright, guys, I get that it&#39;s controversial... but  come on, this is a ridiculous point. My sister&#39;s child is mentally handicapped and she voted for trump. So she doesn&#39;t have any conscience? You guys know that&#39;s not right </p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND THEY GO ON TO TELL HIM THAT HIM AND HIS SISTER DO NOT TRULY CARE ABOUT THEIR DISABLED <strong>CHILD</strong> FAMILY MEMBER!!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on the internet a long fucking time. Rarely am I disgusted... I&#39;ve seen most of it. But damn. These people were serious. Here this guy is, a trump supporter, but so be it. He&#39;s being nice and just trying to bridge the gap a little bit.... And that&#39;s where the discussion went. I could. not. believe. it. </p>

<p>I know a ton of leftists. Please don&#39;t read this and think I&#39;m holding it against all liberals. just those specific people in that thread. </p>

<p>You must have missed it then, because it was all over reddit when it happened. But here&#39;s reddit chief executive Steve Huffman to provide some context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman told Redditors that the change was not entirely attributable to r/The_Donald and that Reddit had been “working on this change for a while.” But “I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment,” he added in a town hall post on Reddit on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>“We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years — ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else,” his post said. “This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it.”</p>

<p>Do you know what an ad hominem is? I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending in the least, I&#39;m just curious if you don&#39;t see how making a statement about me rather than the claim is the very definition of an ad hominem. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your only evidence is &quot;reddit higher up&quot; said so, (nothing technical or factual)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gave you a direct quote from a named chief executive of Reddit. What &quot;technical or factual&quot; evidence would satisfy you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you just believe everything everyone on your side says without asking questions? Thanks for proving my point about being objective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you have no evidence or anything to back up your claims, aside from continuing to question my objectivity? Because if you don&#39;t, this ridiculous conversation is over.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know what to say. I donated the max to the Sanders campaign and will continue to support him to the end. How could this happen? This was good over evil and the villain won. I&#39;ve been crying for 2 hours straight and my wife&#39;s kids thought someone died. I told them someone did... America. Drumpf will never be my president. I am part of the resistance. Drumpf must be defeated, by any means necessary. I will rally behind Bernie and donate the max as soon as I am financially able. I urge everyone on this site to support the resistance against Drumpf, and oppose him at every turn. If you support Drumpf in any capacity you were never a true Sanders supporter, you were a wolf in sheeps clothing, and we shall never let you back when the revolution finally raises. </p>

<p>But why? It is indistinguishable from the hysterical comments that are top posts there every day. </p>

I&#39;d argue T_D is the worst current sub, but I find it odd you&#39;re claiming politics is the most odious sub in the history of Reddit when <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> existed, <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was atrocious, and <a href="/r/spacedicks">/r/spacedicks</a> still exists(and was booming before it got quarantined).</p>

<p>Who gives a shit? How is this a conspiracy? Trump&#39;s billions of dollars are safe and sound, no ones going to cause him any harm, he&#39;s a big boy and can stand up for himself if needed. Why is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> flooded with posts bitching about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> all the time?

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has been an absolute shitheap since Hillary announced she was in the election, and hired CTR to have shillposts put all over the internet. Since then that sub has essentially become a more militantly stupid version of <a href="/r/HillaryClinton">/r/HillaryClinton</a>. Anything, and I mean anything whether it&#39;s true or false, that is anti-Trump gets vote spammed to the top. Anything even the slightest bit anti-liberal or the like gets downvote spammed out of sight. The mods are openly biased, and ban Trump supporters for the slightest infraction, while many of the subscribers in the sub flagrantly break the rules simply with their accounts (according ot their &quot;no novelty accounts/trolling&quot;) rule, or with incivility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub is astro turfed for sure. But I find that people are <strong>dying</strong> for someone to come in and make logical 100% unbiased statements on issues. I know it sounds crazy but there are so many lurkers there that are afraid to speak out (just like in real life) their support of trump. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t stop fighting the good fight, just remember to be more constructive than using accusations.</p>

<p>Providing a 100% true post about why they are wrong and overreacting is more powerful to the actual real people who lurk and rarely comment. Most shit posts are glazed over now-a-days because the left hasn&#39;t had a funny joke about trump in months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am convinced the entirety of Reddit has been compromised by shills and stubborn idiots. </p>

<p>The wild conclusions people are jumping to and the complete lack of critial thinking scares the shit out of me. If these are not paid posters then have people truly become so blind??</p>

<p>For example i read a comment earlier about the author of a dossier (detailing Trumps connections to Putin) had &#39;gone into hiding&#39; (apparently, without any actual proof of that actually happening) and therefore the dossier is 100% fact and can not be disputed.. because why would he go into hiding if it wasn&#39;t true?</p>

<p>This was followed by a brigade of retarded comments further jumping to wack conclusions all based on an assumption. It makes me facepalm so fucking hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like all the anti-Trump people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist in me gets suspicious. On one hand I assume there is a diverse array of opinion in this sub.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I see a targeted campaign against this sub in other subs. I&#39;ve seen reddit censoring (&quot;filtering&quot;) Trump supporters. Plus most of the posts I see upvoted in threads in this sub recently are anti-Trump. How can this be a pro-Trump sub if I constantly see a bunch of people complaining about Trump supporters?</p>

<p>The weird thing is they are complaining about a problem they created. All dissenters we&#39;re smeared as ignorant bigots and nazis. And that shut down the debate. It&#39;s hard to have a debate if the instant response is always someone calling out a non-malicious/obvious generalisation as being literally Hitler. </p>

<p>All this talk of fascism and yet I&#39;m seeing most of the fascist behaviour from the Left (P.S. I&#39;ve only ever voted Left btw). </p>

<p>Weird timing considering this sub is the only place I see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns&amp;amp;t=1s">George Webb</a> (a Youtube wormhole worth every minute) posted regularly. I see people complaining every-time Clinton get&#39;s bought up even though the Clinton&#39;s are like every conspiracy theorists wet dream. There is no statute of limitations on her crimes just because she lost the election.</p>

<p>I like debate. I&#39;m prepared to accept Trump is a shady guy and not so clean himself. But he has only just got into political office. Until he topples a regime, loots a dictators horde and engages in disaster capitalism I&#39;m willing to give him a break.</p>
