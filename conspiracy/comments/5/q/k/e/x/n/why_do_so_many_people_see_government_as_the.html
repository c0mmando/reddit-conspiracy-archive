    <div class="md"><p>It really doesn&#39;t matter what kind of people get in government, power always corrupts. Unless they actually had personal interest in their own people. For example a monarchy has to keep his people happy as his term is until death, unlike a politician who&#39;s there for a couple years, where he can wreak havoc and set policies without facing the consequences, or leaving before he&#39;s blamed for them. I recommend checking out &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed&quot;, it&#39;s a good book. Written by an anarcho-capitalist who argues the case for monarchy. </p>

We can still have short term spokesman but we have to forge the future by creating and voting on policies as a giant group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concentration of power to the few is determined by what? Popularity? The election says otherwise.. So what power is it that is controlled by the few? The power they have tramples the will of the people, but in reality, it&#39;s that same thing that the people desire for themselves. And in pursuit of that thing, that grants you more power when amassed, some people will care little for the consequences of their actions.. </p>

<p>Since man emerged and formed the earliest of communities, value has been assigned. To people, to places, and to objects. The person who amasses the most value, is the most valuable. Value can be subjective, yes, but in some of its forms it&#39;s quite absolute.. So who, what, and where, is that value, today..? If &quot;power&quot; is in control of the few, what is the power..?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s talking about a form of democracy that doesn&#39;t involve (or only involve) representatives of counties, districts, and states. Rather than elected congressmen and legislators (a small group in comparison to, the population, which is supposedly the group that &quot;controls&quot; the fate of our country and legislation). This theoretical form of government the op is talking about would literally have the citizens collectively settling on how to operate the country themselves, rather than relying on individually elected representatives to decide for a much larger group of people, how thing&#39;s should be operated.</p>

<p>I think a branch of government that&#39;s represented by the country as a whole would be interesting in that the true consensus of the majority can impose it&#39;s will into the balance of power of the current branches of government. Maybe this branch of government of the masses should have more power than the existing 3, so the people could very rightly control the course of the government. </p>

<p>Smart phone apps, the internet, these could both be used to connect citizenry in a way where mass voting could indeed be aggregated and settled in a relatively timely fashion. </p>

<p>Obviously there are problems with this in reality, but when confronted the solutions may not be impossible, but they would be a stretch.</p>

<p>The government should atleast be held by the balls, by the people they claim to represent and protect. Transparency and corruption do not go hand in hand to say the least..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally, someone said it. All the corruption in the world stars from the Elite, followed by the Governments and most Politicians. I guess a Government COULD work, if the people who are in charge care about the average person instead of their own benefit. Unfortunately, we&#39;ve given power and control to people who abuse it instead of use it to help. I just can&#39;t understand why we let them do what they do. If you want riots, we riot. The average human is more important than you think, Because without us, the average person, the system fails. Maybe that&#39;s what they are trying to do with Technology. They want to be so advanced that HUMANS are no longer needed, so they exterminate us and create a new world, a limited world that they can easily contain and control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at my link; over 250 million dead by democide in the 20th century alone (not counting soldiers who die in warfare).</p>

<p>Still Indon&#39;t fundamentally disagree with you. At the summit of power, the private sector, public sector, and organized crime all converge. Large multinational corporations are enabled by the State, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare">welfare</a>, enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a>, preferential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy">borrowing rates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_diplomacy">favorable foreign</a> policy, etc. etc.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s wrong to oppose big business and big government - they are one and the same. In a fascist state the means of production are controlled by oligarchs friends (bribing) the politicians; in a trotskist state the means of production are controlled by oligarchs that work for the government. The two are collectivist systems that aren&#39;t congruent with individual liberty.</p>

<p>The left and the right should unite, as all people, of all backgrounds, colours, and creeds, against the imperial power structure trying to dominate us all.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, lets me answer it for you, because government has thing to sell and these &quot;angels&quot; who most of them want to do good are demons who most of them even when they want to do good, the ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS!

    <div class="md"><p>Easy, nobody learns problem solving anymore, so everybody looks for someone else to solve problems for them. It starts when you are very young. I look back on past me now wondering how I could be so dumb when I know I&#39;m not. How did it get like that? Was I always like that from day one, born to look for others to solve my problems? It&#39;s really hard to pinpoint. Technically I am always and have always been in control of me, but what happens at a young age that convinces us to give the control away? Was it parents? School? Tv?</p>

<p>The easiest people to blame are parents, but can you blame them? They sacrifice any life they have at all just to give you a <em>chance</em> to make something of yourself. Decades of their life is what it costs, because their parents were selfish too. They think &quot;I&#39;m an adult now, freedom! But I want kids too. But wow this takes so much effort you little leeches, ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>But you only have a certain window of time to have kids right, so how long do you wait? How soon is too soon? How late is too late? Have them or don&#39;t?</p>

<p>How did so many people end up so selfish that they can&#39;t give proper attention to their kids? How much is too much? How much is not enough?</p>

<p>Kids are so fucking hard, holy shit. It takes half of your focus and energy to give them what they need when they are young.</p>

<p>And that is where the current society comes in. The destruction of family, the core unit. Spread everyone out, tempt people with material wealth, glorify the material wealth, put people to work to get it, offer them advances as credit to get it sooner, charge interest and offer a minimum monthly payment that ends up costing your more in interest than you borrowed. Too tired to do anything at the end of your paid slave shift working for who the fuck really knows selling or making god knows what, so you buy a big comfy couch to sit in and pay for some cable and internet to entertain yourself with. Too tired to cook, so you eat whatever is frozen and easy or get fast food on the way home, because you have only a little bit of time left to yourself at the end of the day and don&#39;t want to spend anymore time than you have to on not relaxing to have energy for your next shift. But wait! That food you eat has almost ZERO nutritional value at all, so you don&#39;t even realize your body is on a countdown to destruction. Not felling good? Go to the doctor with that health insurance we charge you for so you can spend more of the money we barely give you on medicine that takes care of your body for you! Giving all of your energy to the job you don&#39;t even believe in, for what? Oh yeah, that money that pays for all that shit you thought you wanted. Worst part is, by the time you finally realize it&#39;s not what you wanted, it&#39;s too late. Moment you stop, they trash your credit. It&#39;s just credit, you say, but have you been out in the world lately? They got everyone convinced that credit history defines you as a person. Try renting an apartment or buying a house with bad credit. I&#39;ll give you some advice, you can&#39;t. Did you burn that bridge with your momma before you stormed out the house? Hope not, or your ass is homeless! Nobody wants to hire a homeless person, so how are you going to eat and stay alive with no money, no job, no shelter, and no food? You let someone else take care of your health for you, so guess who has a weak, frail body now?</p>

<p>You are disposable. The rat race doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you. It is designed for you to die the moment you stop participating.</p>

<p>Be honest with yourself, are you on the hampster wheel right now? If you are, then you best make like an Olympic gymnast and start practicing your dismount. Make good with your families people. Once you have done that, make good with others.</p>

<p>Be real with yourself and stop lying. If you frequent this forum, you should already know what the deal is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A society in anarchy would be an ugly picture.  You really don&#39;t want true survival of the fittest, as most of us would not be fit enough to survive.</p>

<p>Contaminated water, unreliable food/shelter/energy sources, vigilante justice, crazy cults, lack of education; these are all things you need an organized government to guard against.</p>

<p>Instead of eliminating government, we should be pushing for appropriate government reforms to favor the majority and not the wealthy elite.  Things such as making lobbying illegal and eliminating fundraising altogether for candidates for public office would be a step in the right direction.  Hiring an army of auditors to make government spending completely transparent would also help.  Also, finding a way to dismantle the stranglehold the military industrial complex has on the American economy, without destroying our military, is crucial to prying power away from those wealthy elite who only have capitalist interests at heart (certainly quite difficult to do).  Not to mention breaking up big banks and destroying the Federal Reserve., etc....</p>

<p>Without government, life is pretty grim.  Keeping people in power honest is almost impossible, but society with no government degrades us to nothing more than murderous, wild beasts.</p>

<p>Most people calling for &quot;less government&quot; or &quot;no government&quot; are ignorant to what that actually looks like and the fact that they are posting such ideas on the internet instead of living off the grid somewhere is a strong indicator that they probably wouldn&#39;t be able to adapt when society turned into something out of a Mad Max film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A government is designed with the intention that the people in it will act in the best interests of the people being governed. Corruption enters into it when people bring to the table either a profit agenda or a religious agenda corrupting what should be an ethical political exercise. Both were planned for in the American republic centuries ago (balancing branches of government and the separation of church and state) but has been overwhelmed by corruption - which is the problem, not the government.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you fail to understand is that corporations have overthrown the US government. They literally write the laws. This system has been in place since the early 80s and has led to the complete deregulation of corporate malfeasance; the busting of American unions; &quot;free trade&quot; deals that has destroyed American manufacturing; and the destruction of the environment and the middle class.</p>

<p>The left wing pillars that once held up this society and made it into a great country has been whittled away to toothpicks. For you to think that destroying whats left of these pillars is going to curtail corporate power is delusional. Do you think corporations are just going to dissolve without &quot;big government&quot;? No, they will operate even more brazenly and abolish any regulation placed on them including whats left of safety, environmental and work regulations. We would be reduced to third world slavery conditions where children work for under a dollar a day.</p>

<p>What we need to do is take back OUR government. Not abolish it and let corporations run wild.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The real difficulty is with the vast wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous who represent or control capital. Hundreds of laws of Congress and the state legislatures are in the interest of these men and against the interests of workingmen. These need to be exposed and repealed. All laws on corporations, on taxation, on trusts, wills, descent, and the like, need examination and extensive change. This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations. — How is this?&quot; -Ruther B. Hayes 1888</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly someone with a voice needs tell people why what they&#39;re doing is retarded, and how to properly hold the government accountable.. I find intelligent sensible people with a voice that matters lacking in quantity, someone like tulsi seems like a step in the right direction, but we need a voice to blow the lid off everything, and bring to light the corruption and reality that eludes the common person.. Kanye came close recently imo, but it wasn&#39;t direct and communicated in a way that can be processed by the masses.. But can you imagine if someone like kanye or obama or trump just owning up to everything and putting out there, raw for everyone to discover? </p>

<p>The corruption will never stop until it becomes an issue of everyones attention, not just the few who are aware of it.. But besides that re-hauling priorities in education to keep people from being complete idiots and actually learn how to form an original opinion, how to ask questions, and think like a rational person, that would be another step in the right direction.. I learned all of this in highschool, from my favorite teacher who was completely open about his status as a mason. He provided us with the schools of real critical thought and and the language of rhetoric.. People think america has become a fascist government by electing trump in 2017? Seriously? The admission of the 50th state of the union was literally the toppling of a peaceful monarchy, by plantation and business owners... In order for problems to be confronted by the masses, they first need to be aware of what the REAL problems are, who is and isn&#39;t with them, truely</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lBecause, to not have a government would be anarchy, and since there are no living or historical examples of a stable anarchic society, people assume that the abolition of government would not effect a permanent solution. Another, potentially worse state would inevitably arise. Thus, one&#39;s only other option is to assume that we must have a government, and if it is corrupt, or if it is failing in some area, it just needs to be <em>improved</em>.</p>

<p>Personally, I would, if I could, live in an anarchic society, but I just can&#39;t see how such a community could possibly organize well enough to defend itself against foreign invasion, and we know what kind of world it is we live in.</p>

<p>So, you can see how it&#39;s possible to twist it in your mind that whatever problem the government is causing, they make the assumption that even the government would be good in every way if it were just set up so, and so it can remain blameless, albeit somewhat deficient and in need of <em>progress</em> to fix it. </p>

<p>And there you have it :)</p>
