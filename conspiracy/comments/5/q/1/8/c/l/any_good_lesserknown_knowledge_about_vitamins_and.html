       Right, but as someone who has a lot of symptoms of what's likely some kind of deficiency (no energy, literally falling asleep in traffic, mood swings, digestive problems, the list goes on) I'd like to know what most people tend toward when it comes to deficiency.

       the general idea seems to be that we need to be properly nourished for our bodies to heal itself and when it cant things like cancer and other chronic diseases happen more frequently. Our corn. wheat, soy, meat, sugar, and alcohol diet doesn't give us enough vitamins for us to operate corretly and just like anything you dont maintain properly, it starts to break down and thats where chronic diseases comes from.

       Couple of things. Look up Codex Alimentarius. It's like a rule book to control food internationally in a non-binding 'standards' type approach. Only they can link it in with trade deals or aid perhaps and make it legally binding. It's headed by the major corporations of course and one of their targets is supplement manufacturers. They want you sick and dependent on pharma or to control supplements as if they are drugs. They attack them by saying their standards aren't high enough, and only drug co's can be trusted etc. They took down the biggest supplement manufacturer in Australia many years ago, around the time of AUSTFA, bit after maybe ~2006?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not going to provide any links, that's just based on my memory of researching it over 10 years ago.

       What i've always heard is don't waste your money unless directed by your doctor for a specific deficiency. Most of the vitamin supplement dosage is not absorbed and urinated out. Also, many nutrients and micronutrients work in conjunction with one another so it's not always simply take more of this vitamin and you'll be healed. A well rounded diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and meat will give you more than enough nutrients your body needs.

       My understanding is that they can also cause renal troubles. Kidney stones maybe? Definitely not something to mess around with unless you definitely need to take the supplement for medical reasons as advised by a doctor.

       One of the people commenting knows someone who personally got kidney stones from taking unnecessary supplements. Don't be an idiot.

       Or if you want to, I guess, go for it. You're the dumbass who'll have renal problems. That'll sure show that fearmonger on the Internet who told you that a medical professional knows medicine better than random assholes on Reddit!

       I'm not saying you're wrong, because I don't know enough about it, but just a "fyi", you can easily OD on over-the-counter vitamins and supplements so be wary of what you're ingesting.

       Why would you wanna teach about vitamins in medical school? Why would medical doctors, who studied MEDICINE and practice MEDICINE, and are heavily funded by PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, why would they go and look into vitamins as a form of treatment?
      </p>
      <p>
       The pharmaceutical companies aren't going to advocate vitamins. That's not going to work out well for their billion dollar industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be dumb to expect doctors, who largely have "pill for an ill" mentality(see how easy it is to get ADHD, depression, and anxiety meds), who don't know about therapeutic nutrition, and who works closely with pharmaceutical companies who are set to make money off of the doctor's decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it too far fetched for billion dollar pharmaceutical companies, who make more money from TREATING aliments instead of CURING them (look at the cost of medicine. they are fucking milking us), to infiltrate medical schools to prioritize the prescription of medicine to future doctors, and purposefully leave out things like orthomolecular medicine in teaching to secure and maximize their profits? Fuck no it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have orthomolecular medicine in an industry like that man. It is a dichotomy that cannot exist. If vitamins and nutrition are the key those companies will lose almost all of their money.

       I think the misconception is "natural" over "organic." I believe manufacturers can label a product as being "all-natural" versus organic. Unless the product is organic of course. But I hear ya, the same thing applies to the supplement industry.

       You'd be better off with water soluble vitamins rather than fat soluble, as they can build up in your body to toxic levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vitamin D and Magnesium are two examples. I think many people are vitamin D deficient, especially during winter. You can have a doctor order lab work to test your level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magnesium can act as a slight anxiolytic and sleep aid. But keep the dose on the low end at first to see how your stomach tolerates it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fish oil, not a vitamin, has several benefits and is worth looking into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vitamin B's are good. Chronic vitamin B12 deficiency can cause pernicious anemia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vitamin C is good, has some benefits. I don't think scurvy is a problem people worry about much though. And vitamin C is found in alot of foods anyway.

       The level of vitamin C that people ingest is wayyyyy to low. Also, at a certain level of vitamin C, your body expels it by inducing diarrhea. So you need to ingest fat soluble vitamin C. Google/YouTube that for more info. (Cats are able to produce vitamin C in their bodies and they make up to 2.5g, considering their body weight, the human body should ingest much more then the recommended 60mg a day!!!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people take way to little Iodine. People should test iodine amounts on themselves and slowly build up till they see negative effects. Some people may need up to 12mg a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists screwed up the decimal point when talking about daily level of vitamin D and many orders of magnitude greater is required. But when taking Vitamin D, vitamin A is also needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When trying to heal a wound, higher levels of Zinc helps speed up healing. Also if you are experiencing hair loss or hair thinning, you should take Zinc. Taking zinc AND magnesium (ZMA) before bed, helps facilitate proper sleep (deep sleep) and release of hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to drink more water, but also ingest minerals which are lost when sweating.

       Hope this helps.

       20+ years of research and self experimentation, seeing what works and what doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various youtube channels, and sometimes google search adventures that started from a comment someone made in a reddit post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome, hope it's helpful.  If I had to choose just ONE, I'd say go with the fat soluble vitamin C. It's called Liposomal Vitamin C. Good short video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYllFDBD-Z4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYllFDBD-Z4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd recommend buying it from a reputable company before you try making it your self and dosing (mega dosing) for just a few weeks. Both, mixing regular Vitamin C and Liposomal Vitamin C.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even take in Vitamin C through an IV bag setup (I have my aunt who is fighting cancer getting IV Vitamin C and the doctor is seeing positive results).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong.
