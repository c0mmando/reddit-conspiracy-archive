       After reading the Corbett AMA on the cashless biometrics experiment on India, I have been thinking.  What will it take for the Western world to truly say enough is enough and put its collective foot down?  When will come that tipping point?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ban on physical currency will truly mean a death knell on freedom and mobility, especially once a biometric system for buying and selling is universally implemented.  It means every single purchase you make online or in stores, every meal you eat, every hotel you check into, every plane ticket you buy, every movie you watch, every book you read will be filed away and catalogued into your personal dossier which will be open to unlimited monitoring by the governments you live under.  It means complete control by the bankers over your livelihood and personal liberties, and yes, even over your personal pursuit of happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course TPTB will market such a system as advantageous for security and convenience reasons, and a large chunk of the population will eat this up and eagerly sign away even more personal liberty.  One of the most cunning things they did to achieve such willing acquiescence from the public was the way they marketed smartphones to the public.   Basically TPTB sat down and thought of a way around the public's natural aversion to (backdoor) Orwellian surveillance by framing the public's opinion of these devices for themselves.  Tech gurus, Apple fanboys and shiny gadget enthusiasts everywhere advocated smartphones as a revolutionary new technology (which admittedly they were), and they became a consumer obsession in the blink of an eye. Concurrently came apps, increasingly high resolution cameras and voice-activated devices, GPS and regularly scheduled automatic updates and there you have it, we've all got our own personal tracking devices that
       <em>
        we willingly subscribed to and now cannot live without.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Cashless society is the next thing on the list and it will be pushed in the same way we saw smartphones pushed, in a gradual and insidious fashion until we no longer have other options.  We already see the advent of the chipped credit card and biometric screening in airports.  We also see the rise of Fitbits and "Health" and other screening apps.  This is gradually leading to full on demonetization which means TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE CONTROL by the banks over every single citizen.  So when does the public finally wise up and STOP this acquiescent enslavement by which we willingly sign away our personhood and livelihood to the "elites", like sheep lining up for the slaughterhouses? When do enough people say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH and gather collectively to take back control by rising against a corrupt and criminal system that is rigged against our favor?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have this power.  Together, we have far more power than we can imagine. When do we exercise it? Not just for us, but for our future generations?

       You are on the right track, friend. However, should an event of this magnitude transpire it shall be swift. Whether it be through a cashless society, or by debt cancelation and distribution of funds via something like N.E.S.A.R.A., the result will be fast. King Solomon was the richest man in the world in his time, making 666 talents of gold. The mark of the beast, then, involves gold and dear friends, do not take this mark. You have been warned.

       Idk, on one end I can see the scary aspect of losing sovereignty and being totally controlled under a tyrannical government. But on the other end I completely despise currency and what it has done to humanity...
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world I picture humans working together with the resources we have to thrive and succeed on this planet. But the reality is many humans are fucking stupid and racist or greedy and don't care about other humans. So obviously it won't work that simply.

       I see the money system as one of the most sinister control systems that exists but having physical money still allows some degree of freedom. If it all becomes only digital data, that the elites control, we would be fucked on another level.

       This is a trap we can't allow ourselves to fall into. In a cashless society, the government has total power over you. They can track everywhere you go, everything you buy or sell (sort of like in the Book of Revelation, now that I come to think of it, for the Mark of the Beast). Say good bye to freedom when you give up cash.

       Totally against a cashless society but let's not forget paper money is a real scam in and of itself that has gotten us to this point to begin with.
