       I was saying something recently about Jill Stein tweeting about the US funding Al Qaeda and people around me dismissed it as a conspiracy theory... so I brought up 9/11 just to gently rock the boat... and most of them agreed that at the very least the government knew about it and did nothing to stop it... My mind was just a wee bit blown that some "normals" had any inkling that the narrative on the TV wasn't what really happened.

       They had to take a cutscene out cause an aircraft flew into some NYC buildings in MGS2 and caused a bunch of destruction... it delayed the launch of the game by a bit.

       Or if you want something more up to date think about this bit of the plot from the wikipedia entry and compare it to the Trump presidency and the CTR shills.

       Most people I know still have there heads in the sand about it. Maybe because they haven't looked into it or it might just be because they don't want to believe their government (or some malevolent group other then al-Qaeda) could be capable of it.

       Did a ~ 1 hour presentation a couple years ago about, expected everyone to be like "lol fucking idiot tonfoil hat america hater", but I actually was able to get all but 1 member of my class on board with it. Around half of them thought it was already an inside job or they were complacent, and i was able to convince the other half.

       Obviously these are young kids, but I think the emotion-related cognitive dissonance is beginning to fade after 15 years, people are seeing that the outcome is not what they were led to believe, they want answers. Most people have probably never gone back and watched the videos again, or did their own research. They just dont think about it.

       I remember a couple years after the event , a close friend and I got into a HEATED discussion about 9/11. I tried to show him videos a make him see about building 7 ect. He was adamant the official story was the truth. It was so heated I lost him as a friend for awhile. I am pleased to see him post "bush did 9/11" memes all over his social media the last few years.

       There's not the negative backlash that their used to be when it gets brought up but people still aren't very receptive of it, in general. Though, where I'm at many more people question the mainstream narrative than used to.

       Literally everyone I know irl knows the US government did 9/11 and that all three skyscrapers were controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even obscure forums i regulatory post on regarding my hobbies and interests that are not mainstream have posts with nearly 100% of people in agreement that 9/11 was an
       <em>
        inside job
       </em>
       and those that had any sort of disagreement came around once you point out the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       On reddit though, you not only have
       <em>
        debunkers
       </em>
       that know the official story inside out and so have to know the obvious abnormalities with the official fairytale, the deviation from logic and reason, the discrepancy with the fundamental laws of nature, one has to take Edward Snowden at his word, the US government are using

       9/11 reached it's tipping point.  A lot of people can accept 9/11 being an inside job.  Next we got to get honest discussions going about our universe and energy and all that good stuff.

       Everyone that I know believes it was an inside job. My family thinks that the narrative should be questioned at every turn, the people in charge reinvestigated and jailed.
      </p>

       My friends however think the government is stupid, silly and that people need to learn how to let things go and move on. They're more concerned with partying and trying to impress other people that they don't even know what we really lost on that day.
