       I once read an interesting book that said that the "establishment" is so powerful and intelligent that they co-op and take over almost every revolutionary movement that challenges them, which is why you see people selling Che Guevara t-shirts even though Che Guevara was the biggest socialist ever. There is also a documented history of the establishment creating revolutionary movements to control the masses that they know would inevitably be disaffected and unhappy with the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American political movement known as the "left" was created in the early 20th century by the Wall Street banks so that they could control and understand the opposition. By funding and controlling left-wing media outlets, the Wall Street banks could guide the left, eliminate opinions that would actually hurt them, and make the poor masses feel like they had some hope so that they did not become violent anarchists that just started blowing shit up and killing people (which is what anarchists did in the late 19th century before the "left" came along to pacify them).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pretty clear that the establishment has co-opted the conspiracy movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy theory movement was an inevitable outgrowth of the internet. The internet is completely democratic and anybody can post anything and anybody can find anything. It has the potential to completely bypass the mainstream media and deliver information to people directly. At one point I believe that 33% of Americans believed that 9/11 was an inside job. Obviously, this made the establishment shit their pants. But the establishment quickly got to work in co-opting the conspiracy theory movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the establishment flooded the internet with alternate and contradicting conspiracy theories. Tons of people believe in conspiracy theories, but their conspiracy theories completely contradict each other. Black people believe there is a white supremacist conspiracy to keep black people slaves. White people believe there is a liberal conspiracy to eradicate white people and white culture. Religious people believe there is a conspiracy to destroy religion and a "war on Christmas." Secular people believe there is a conspiracy by religious people to turn America into a theocracy. Conservatives believe there is a conspiracy by liberals to turn America into a socialist slave labor camp, while liberals believe there is a conspiracy to turn America into a fascist police state designed to serve corporations. Etc... By providing all of these alternative conspiracy theories, the establishment has divided the people so they cannot unite, and more importantly, they have flooded the interent with so much information and misinformation nobody knows what's real or not. The establishment spread these ideas through a variety of methods, including paying trolls to post on internet message boards, tweaking the algorithms on search engines and sites like reddit to gives these ideas attention, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, the establishment makes these conspiracies look more "real" by paying outsized attention to small groups. The SJW movement is tiny, but the right-wing media gave it oversized attention so that now right-wingers think our freedom of speech is under attack by feminists with purple hair. The alt-right has less than 100,000 people (Richard Spencer has 39,000 twitter followers), but the left-wing media has blown the alt-right out of proportion so left-wingers think that America is on the verge of being taken over by Nazis. Etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the establishment created fake news. Fake news is an important step in controlling the conspiracy theory movement. If the internet is flooded with fake news, nobody will know what is real anymore, so anybody trying to prove anything will fail. When nothing is real, then everything is real, because people have to believe SOMETHING, so they just default to going to the sites that feed their emotions and cognitive biases. This is why liberals will absolutely not read anything from right-wing news sites and conservatives will absolutely not read anything from "MSM" news sites, even if they are reporting objective, verifiable facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the most incredible example of the establishment of co-opting the conspiracy movement is the conspiracy movement's support for the election of Donald Trump. Donald obviously ran as an anti-establishment maverick that was going to "drain the swamp," but it is clear to me that he is actually part of the "establishment." Fox News (which has more viewers than CNN and MSNBC combined) is totally in the tank for him, his cabinet is full of corporate and business executives, all of his appointees are regular Republicans, and from what we know he is in millions of dollars in debt to major banks which means he is actually more beholden to banks and corporations than regular politicians. The only way he diverges from regular Republicans is that he takes a much more right-wing position and hardline on certain things (like immigration), but the only reason regular Republicans did not take those positions was because they were afraid they wouldn't get elected. It's actually brilliant - the establishment knew they were hated and there was a strong "conspiracy" movement, so they co-opted it by secretly promoting an "anti-establishment" candidate that came right back to the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most glaring example of the establishment co-opting the conspiracy movement is watching Alex Jones and Infowars go completely in the tank for Trump. Now, I concede that maybe Alex Jones just like Trump and thinks he's a great candidate. Fine. But if you read Infowars objectively it really looks like a propaganda site for Trump and his ideology. Infowars even went on a campaign to get comedians fired for making fun of Trump's kids. What's even more incredible is that I have not seen anything on the Infowars website even mentioning the "alternative facts" thing. You would think that Alex Jones, the biggest conspiracy theorist of our time, a guy who predicts 1,000 conspiracies for every one that comes true and never came across a conspiracy theory he didn't promote, would be losing his mind over the "alternative facts" thing, which may be the most Orwellian thing our government has openly done in a long time. But nothing. Silence. I think it's clear that Alex Jones is in the tank for Trump and is probably getting paid by Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these major "conspiracy" websites, like Breitbart, Infowars, ZeroHedge follow a suspiciously similar line. Trump = good, Hilary = the devil, Obama = a doofus, Russia = good, Putin = a great leader, China = bad, Islam = bad. Is this a coincidence or a coordinated effort?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you even look at this sub, most of the stories are somehow pro-Trump and pro-his ideology (anti Hilary, anti "globalism," anti-SJWs) and the top comments follow this pattern too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do y'all think? The story I've told here is pretty bleak because it seems to imply that resistance is futile because no matter what type of resistance you create, the establishment will co-opt it. I don't know what the answer is to that.

       well part of what the establishment does is that it defines every group by their worst members so conservative = white supremacist, liberal = SJW, person that cares about the poor = Marxist, person that wants free markets = corporate shill, person that wants gun control = fascist, etc... It's divide and conquer.

       You focused a lot on the presidency and not the big picture manipulation of the "conspiracy theory people"... I don't think people that believe Breitbart and Infowars identify as conspiracy theorists... I think they just think that is the "real news".

       By adding fake shit to it so it can no longer credibly call itself truth seeking. that's why the establishment pays Alex Jones and David Icke to spread absolutely ridiculous conspiracy theories that are obviously wrong, to discredit the movement as a whole. also by flooding the market with contradictory conspiracy theories it's hard to tell what is the truth anymore.

       Icke is ridiculous, which is why he's the second most prominent conspiracy theorist guy (with Alex Jones being #1). The establishment wants to control the conspiracy community, and they do it by promoting ridiculous people to the top of it.

       I think that's fair... but I was talking more about his points about society being manipulated by one group appearing to be two opposing sides. And how this tactic is used over and over to keep people divided. Some people can't get past the reptilians, but he's been right about many things.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a lot of wisdom on spiritual matters as well, specifically regarding the emphasis we put on our physical identities, and bodies, which is used as another tool of division, when we are all actually spiritual beings connected more than we think.

       The trails left by planes look exactly like clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words the 'chemtrail' conspiracy is to distract from the electric nature of clouds. After all, airplanes produce clouds (through static electricity) then maybe clouds themselves are just electrified air etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the kind of reasoning/thinking which the chemtrail conspiracy is designed prevent. They want us to say 'OMG they're spraying us with evil chemicals' instead of 'OMG why do planes create clouds?'.

       The virus HIV does not cause AIDS, HIV (like all viruses) is a result of disease, not the cause. Even by the admission of scientists, viruses are only produced by diseased cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viruses and bacteria both come from a precursor known as the microzyma or somatid. When the body reaches a state of poor health, the some microzymas change form into 'pathogenic bacteria' and begin recycling the bad tissue, this process is what doctors call 'disease'.

       Viruses appear to be some form of communication mechanism within the body, they transport genetic information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of sending 'conspiracy theorists' towards the research of people like Antoine Bechamps and EC Rosenow (scientists who debunked germ theory), they are sent down the road of 'evil CIA manufactured HIV'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also done to distract from the poisonous/fatal AZT drugs that are used to 'treat' AIDS patients.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to note that protecting germ theory is very important for the establishment. If germ theory is destroyed, not only does the basis of vaccination collapse, but it also sheds a negative light on genetics science, since the experiment used to prove that DNA was an inheritance molecule, used bacteria.

       That is hard to believe, considering HIV was much more deadly before that anti-HIV drugs were ever invented, and people survive for a long time with HIV now that HAART exists.

       Planes create cloud because they fly by harvesting the electric energy of the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane draws electricity towards it and thus concentrates the electrified air into a clustered mass, aka a cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germ theory is the long debunked idea of disease like polio and smallpox being caused by microbes in the air. They are now trying to push this hoax to the limits, by claiming that cancer and even obesity (!) are caused by viruses...
      </p>
      <p>
       Bechamps and Rosenow both lived, but they were ignored in favour of Pasteur.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't really 'medicate' diet in the way that you can medicate 'evil microbes', so the more profitable route was to go along with Pasteur's germ theory instead of Bechamps' environment theory.

       I've noticed this too, but there is an odd silence on the issue. It seems like in this Orwellian world, all opposition has been brainwashed into thinking serving the interests of the elite is revolutionary. Why is no one talking about Trump critically on here? Look at what he's doing on climate change and the EPA for example. This is a coup of the US government by big business if I ever saw one. But there's complete silence on even this sub. I swear the oil industry has brainwashed the mainstream opposition through means like Trump and infowars into thinking that global warming is a chinese hoax or something, like that's the conspiracy, not disinfo propaganda contradicting scientific findings implanted into the public sphere by big oil...don't people think about how strangely convenient this would be to the most powerful corporations in the world with the most to lose if people decide to stop destroying the earth. Capitalism as a system right now depends on the people being blind to the dying state of the planet. There's so many powers desperately trying to keep the status quo in place.

Tons of people believe in conspiracy theories, but their conspiracy theories completely contradict each other. Black people believe there is a white supremacist conspiracy to keep black people slaves. White people believe there is a liberal conspiracy to eradicate white people and white culture. Religious people believe there is a conspiracy to destroy religion and a "war on Christmas." Secular people believe there is a conspiracy by religious people to turn America into a theocracy. Conservatives believe there is a conspiracy by liberals to turn America into a socialist slave labor camp, while liberals believe there is a conspiracy to turn America into a fascist police state designed to serve corporations. Etc... By providing all of these alternative conspiracy theories, the establishment has divided the people so they cannot unite, and more importantly, they have flooded the interent with so much information and misinformation nobody knows what's real or not. The establishment spread these ideas through a variety of methods, including paying trolls to post on internet message boards, tweaking the algorithms on search engines and sites like reddit to gives these ideas attention, etc...
