        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Much of Donald Trumps appeal is that he is an anti-establishment candidate. An &quot;Outsider&quot;, his own man. Not signed on to the global agenda of the establishment. </p>

<p>They often cite the Mainstream media&#39;s campaign to demonize him during his presidential bid, as a testament to his independent qualities. Yes, the media did attack Trump. They attacked his personality, his character, his hair, they painted him as a womanizer, they deemed him a racist, he was constantly discussed and talked about 24/7 on talk shows, SNL, Facebook, you name it. </p>

<p>What I think some people fail to realize are two big things:</p>

<p>1: This was done intentionally. Trump has a very big role in the upcoming plans for the global agenda. The establishment knew they had to really sell him as an outsider, therefore, they would have to have the media attack and demonize him to add credibility to his character. The establishment knows most of us don&#39;t trust the media anymore, however, they are very intelligent. They know how to expand and contract and adjust to these changes, so they used the media as a way to legitimize Trumps anti-establishment appeal. </p>

<p>Now, does anybody remember a guy by the name of Ron Paul? He ran for president in 1988, 2008, and perhaps most notoriously in 2012. </p>

<p>He held positions of TRUE conservatism, smaller government, reducing the power the federal government has, and allowing the people to have their civil liberties back.  He was against the federal reserve banking system, and essentially is the archetype for leading the fight for an audit of the federal reserve (something Trump has piggybacked on, that RON PAUL is the true proprietor and champion of).</p>

<p><strong>Ron Paul&#39;s Consistency</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ron Paul confirms existence of FEMA camps</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ron Paul admits Bilderberg Group collides to control world</strong>
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=plo-1rLZ3Jo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=plo-1rLZ3Jo</a></p>

<p>He advocated for the ending of the drug war, term limits for congressmen. He on several occasions has confirmed the existence of a New World Order in the making, the use of fractional reserve central banking to &quot;enslave&quot; populations into debt, and woke up millions of Americans and showed them the true nature of their corrupt government. </p>

<p><strong>Not only that, but he was ideologically pure and consistent for his entire time as a congressman. He got a fucking media blackout. That is how they deal with REAL outsiders.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kFNwkcVDBw4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kFNwkcVDBw4</a></p>

<p>Ron Paul was a TRUE anti establishment candidate. Donald Trump is just being <strong>presented</strong> to us as an anti establishment candidate, and the media&#39;s reverse psychology played a huge role in this. </p>

<p>Ron Pail was deal with in a much different way by the media. The media, as we know, plays a HUGE role in determining who the &quot;frontrunner&quot; of the election is. Essentially, whoever they provide the most coverage to, whoever is discussed the most and gets the most attention, will be catapulted Into the nomination. Even though the media was dogging on Trump, and creating this racial and sexist narrative about him, there was a purpose behind this, and it was free publicity for him! He was an instant star. Nobody who is &quot;anti establishment&quot; gets that much coverage. </p>

<p>With Ron Paul, they <strong>BURIED</strong> him. They said he was &quot;unelectable&quot; constantly. He was omitted from polls and conversations on talk shows and the news. He was presented as an illegitimate and unelectable candidate, and he was provided VERY little coverage. <strong>THIS IS HOW REAL OUTSIDERS ARE DEALT WITH</strong></p>

<p>If you want to still support the notion that Trump is somehow anti establishment, that&#39;s your right. However, be open to the possibility that he was just another  carefully selected puppet. I believe DT will ultimately be used as a catalyst for the upcoming social and economic unrest and fallout that is being orchestrated by TPTB. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Street cred for Trump? </p>

<p>It does sound plausible. Even more so when you consider the kind of people he&#39;s surrounded by.</p>

<p>No source for this but I&#39;ve heard there are several people from Goldman Sachs, Exxon guy is new Secretary of State and plenty of freshly retired Generals.</p>

<p>I was thinking how Trump was actually an independent candidate who disguised himself as a Republican. But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the one running the show.</p>

<p>Pence is the far more experienced man in terms of politicking. Perhaps he will be to Trump what Cheney was to Bush Jr? </p>

<p>Finally, <em>real</em> outsiders never make it all the way to the top. Not Ron Paul and not Ross Perot. So it makes a certain amount of sense that Trump must fit in with someone&#39;s agenda... otherwise he&#39;d never have gotten elected in the first place.</p>

Im not so sure a candidate can win the presidency without claiming to be a part of one of the 2 dinestys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure.  W was a grade-A moron.  Cheney and his gang likely did control him.</p>

<p>Trump is a different beast.  His ego is so Yuge, I honestly think he&#39;d rather be suicided than let anyone believe, even for a microsecond, that he wasn&#39;t the one running the show.  Now, egos like that can be manipulated, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s happening.  But I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s a simple puppet.  He is much, much tougher to control.  Hope I&#39;m right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here to say in much much better words you kinda got something out that has bothered me for sometime now. I always felt it odd the media prop up of Trump how they couldn&#39;t give him enough time, at first I chalked it up to CTR him being the perfect &quot;fall guy&quot; but it is important to compare his treatment to other &quot;outsiders&quot; such as Paul.</p>

<p>Good job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, OP, thank you. Here is one very clear example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last July, Comey came out and stated, in substance, &quot;Clinton is corrupt but we won&#39;t be pursuing her&quot;. This happened right after the Bill/Loretta airplane encounter.</p>

<p>On the same holiday week-end, the State propaganda accused Donald Trump of being an &quot;antisemite&quot;. As proof, they bombarded the American public with a poster that bore the face of Clinton, and read &quot;Most Corrupt Candidate Ever&quot;. On the first day they showed the poster with a six-pointed star, on the second day with a circle after Trump had changed it and said it was a sheriff&#39;s star.
Now, who in his right mind could think Donald Trump is judeophobic? Not even a morbidly obese, testicle-severed bathroom militant. Even the deepest-living algae wouldn’t buy it. Trump explained it away with the sheriff star, and the public forgot all about it (the propaganda thereafter stopped saying he was &quot;antisemitic&quot;). But the slogan of Clinton as the most corrupt candidate ever was effectively imprinted. The rest of the campaign basically served as confirmation bias for that July 4/5 blitz.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. Hillary Clinton is a war criminal and a child trafficker. She should be expediently hanged. But I believe she played her the role in the campaign, knowingly or otherwise. That of a scarecrow. The caricature of a House of Card-esque hypocrite. For every super-hero needs his super-villain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Sanders and Ron Paul are different enough in many respects, but it was clear throughout this campaign season that Sanders wasn&#39;t getting the same treatment as the &quot;real&quot; candidates, and not much better/worse than Stein or Johnson. He couldn&#39;t be shut down as completely as Ron Paul was, but he also A) wasn&#39;t voicing many of the same concerns as Paul, and B) had the benefit of a more widespread social media than Paul had.</p>

<p>bernie&#39;s schtick is very effect, give a rousing speech against a terrible bill then vote for it anyway with a meally mouthed, there was good provision hidden in the pile of evil provisions, excuse. </p>

<p>his vote for the jim crow act of 1994 that he has defended ad infinitum based on the inclusion of two insignificant, symbolic provisions, and his refusal to acknowledge that on the whole he was complicit in creating the prison industrial complex and the parimilitary police depts, sums him up in a nutshell...sigh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the difference is huge--bernie has always fallen in line in the end, and he is firmly behind our interventionist, imperial foriegn policy. he extols his iraq war vote, because it is basically the only time he has voted against the grain. he conveniently leaves out that he supported every air strike and sanction of iraq in the 1990s that resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 iraqi children. he supports drone strikes, he supports the kill list, he supports arming SA and providing them logistical support, which means he implicitly supports the genocide of the yemeni people.</p>

<p>ron paul&#39;s mirror is his comrade dennis kucinich. the only division in american governance and alignment is those south of the x-axis of the political compass, and those north of it.</p>

<p>paul and kucinich and stein are below, bernie and clinton, and trump are above. the anti-statists, pro-self determenation, pro-privacy, anti-&quot;law and order&quot; southerns are the only thing that really frightens the establishment, and the only ones that are truly anti-establishment.</p>

<p>trump is doubling down on the upper-right, facist quadrant of the political compass policies and goals of the establishment, on the compass he is right there with clinton and obama. the shit I&#39;ve taken for &quot;supporting&quot; him by saying that his inability to keep the shit our govt does out of polite conversation is a good thing, because it is out in the open, and sunshine is the best disinfectant,  is getting tiresome however...the absurdity of an anarchist being called a facist would be funny if it weren&#39;t so pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or the establishment miscalculated, thought that Trump was a buffoon that would easily crash against Clinton, if not in the primaries, and by the time they took him seriously, he was already the republican candidate.</p>

<p>The Podesta leaks revealed that the brains behind the establishment are not brilliant geniuses. Some of them are dumb, they make mistakes, they miscalculate, they are arrogant, they are so used to getting their way that they underestimate their opponents and overestimate their strength. They lie so much to themselves and each other that they cannot fathom and understand the ground sentiment (see Brexit).</p>

<p>And i think the power structure at the top is more complicated than the simplistic idea that &#39;oh the establishment insiders are one monolithic entity in charge and in control of everything!&#39;.</p>

<p>Dan Carlin just released a new Hardcore History about the rise of nuclear weapons through the Cuban missle crisis. It does a really good job of setting up the gravity of world politics at that time. My guess is that, that stress and memories of the world wars set the stage for a group of powerful people to come together and do whatever it takes so they were never in that situation again. </p>

<p>Most deep state conspiracy theories seem to start with Kennedy&#39;s assassination, George Webb&#39;s current series about Braverman and Haiti included.</p>

<p>This would be a separate group or overlapping group from the central bank or high finance conspiracies.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they may believe that the ring of missile defense systems around Russia has neutralized the threat (and maybe it has, what the hell do I know :} ) and they can ramp up tensions again to convince the people to go along with the military budget.</p>

<p>3rd option, the group split. Original group developed means and methods (Brownstone blackmail garbage) to ensure at any classic war cost that nuclear war never happens again. Modern splinter group takes the knowledge of these operations and creates global crime syndicate as discussed in Webb&#39;s series. They would also be the ones pushing towards war with Russia to increase the budget that they siphon off of.</p>

<p>Same here.  At some point you just start arguing conspiracies all the way down, with less and less evidence (and common sense) the deeper you go.  </p>

<p>So the globalist powers that be threw all their media and political weight against a candidate that was clearly running as an anti-globalist, but that was all just a ruse.  They knew that he&#39;d win (barely) despite all this and in doing so everyone would be fooled into thinking that he&#39;s not a globalist.</p>

<p>So now their true puppet is in power and he&#39;s doing things like backing out of globalist trade deals and the UN...Is that part of an even deeper conspiracy?  Is that going to make the knife in the back that much sweeter when Trump finally dissolves America and hands control over to the UN?  </p>

<p>Or, they could have just focused on getting Hillary elected and everything would have continued to progress towards their goals without any speed bumps.  Just dump your resources and time into getting your agenda done, don&#39;t waste them propping up fake opposition for no reason.  </p>

<p>TPTB are smart, but they are probably a lot more reactionary and less monolithic than people are assuming.  I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say they probably didn&#39;t plan on Trump getting elected, but now that he is, they&#39;re going to try and stack the deck in response.  </p>

They say his mistakes will ruin him.</p>

<p>It should ALSO be noted that Trump has always been good at playing the media for attention and this is something Ron Paul absolutely does not do well.</p>

<p>The media attacked Trump because he was coming off like an idiot and thought they could paint him like an idiotic racist, it&#39;s just they failed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I feel like the OP is missing out on one key point: the Clinton Campaign worried about Trump because he has charisma. If Trump was like Ron Paul and didn&#39;t touch into the people&#39;s thoughts as he did, then I think he would have been laughed off as a joke. </p>

<p>To me, it makes more sense that, assuming Trump <em>is</em> a part of an elite establishment, there would be different &quot;factions.&quot; The Clinton, Obama, etc.&#39;s would try to enforce their &quot;political correctness&quot; agenda against the opposing side and see if it would achieve their side&#39;s election win. These elites are just as fallible as humans can be- because that&#39;s what they are (...assumingly).</p>

To think that they always work together for the greater good of the Cabal, at the expense of their own personal power, is laughable.

<p>I think it&#39;s funny how OP and the like come up with all these elaborate theories, when we have <em>emails confirming</em> exactly what you say is the case.</p>

<p>They pushed Trump because they thought he was going to fold easily, and it backfired in a major way.</p>

<p>People have <em>such</em> short memories. I remember that TPP was NEVER MENTIONED before Trump started interjecting it into debates and such. He <em>forced</em> Hitlery&#39;s public position on it. </p>

<p>The idea that globalists spent 10+ years negotiating their secret corporate-sovereignty agreement for the express purpose of having it shot down is ridiculous.</p>

<p>As is the idea that people like Soros et al spent $300 million propping up Jeb! just for him to get completely <em>REKT</em> with zero effort by Trump.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Just now on the frontage is a document showing how the Hillary campaign helped propel Trump and Cruz to stardom in order to ostracize the Republicans. This backfired but I doubt it was a conspiracy as it made sense then and most of us can understand their reasoning; almost nobody predicted Trump would win. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump shat all over the Fed and asked for an audit and accused them of playing political games.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump reverses every main point on the globalist agenda including a return to nationalism and a withdrawal from the UN. How much more anti-establishment can u get? </p></li>
<li><p>Trump is in favor of devolving many issues like abortion to the states.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump spoke highly of Ron Paul.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is proposing a constitutionalism supreme court judge who will strongly uphold all amendments from being too openly interpreted. This means the basic freedoms that made America great will be safe.</p></li>

If this is the case, he beat the establishment. I think there is actually a difference between Paul and Trump. Whether he did it on purpose, or can&#39;t control himself, Trumps behavior is what gained him the attention. Every potential president usually gets made fun of for hair or big ears or something. But Trump was so vocal about his ideas, and he wasn&#39;t afraid of it. He was basically worth it to the news. They didn&#39;t mind sharing because who would have thought he&#39;d win. </p>

<p>I think his personality and the way he went about his ideas was what could have made him outshine other conservatives. Looking back I feel like past &quot;losers&quot; seem like they already are losing. Trump was playing to win and you could tell. So if his election isn&#39;t part of a grand plan it&#39;s pretty cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point. I also have thought about this often.  What they did to Ron Paul was an outrage and also very effective...they may have rigged some of the polls and changed the primary rules as well to prevent him winning as well as shutting him out from media and never speaking in positives about him.  His rallies were exponentially bigger than every other candidate. Its hard to believe that the poll numbers were accurate knowing the turnout he was getting compared to everybody else.</p>

<p>I think there is something to the pied piper strategy by Clinton as stated in the DNC leaks...(another example of Hillary acting as a terrorist, willing to saddle the country with who she thought was the worst candidate in order to increase her odds of winning... hopefully it will work out better for us, but her intentions are important). The media seemed to be giving Trump a lot of attention especially showing clips of him bullying the other candidates and we also know how much the MSM was on Hillary&#39;s side because of the emails. So it could easily have been planned that way too put her up against someone they thought couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t win.</p>

<p>Another thought I&#39;ve had is that maybe Trump&#39;s policies and ideas are more palatable for those in power. Maybe his foreign policy. He is a huge supporter of Israel, something you need to be to advance in politics at the current time.  The pro-israel lobby is strong and powerful in this country.  He </p>

<p>If they treated Trump like they did Ron paul Trump would have eaten them alive!</p>

<p>Ron do not have the communication skill for asymmetric  media warfare. I like the guy But Trump is a much superior communicator. That is why they are losing there collective shit over him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you ignore someone like Donald Trump, he makes his appeal and his brand on being outspoken and controversial, basically he is the Howard Stern or  Kim Kardashian of the last election. A champion on social media and someone who LIVES to ruffle the feathers and intimidate people. I don&#39;t think Trump would let them get away with it. </p>

<p>On top of that, consider that Hillary and the Establishment WANTED Trump because they were under the assumption the American people wouldn&#39;t have the gall nor be informed enough to call out Hillary on her bullshit and being a straight puppet for TPTB. Trump said the things that the American people knew to be right and they took that que and voted him in. The Establishment took a gamble and lost their bet just like they did in 2008. </p>

<p>Think about this.Perot did very well in 1992 as an independent self funded candidate.There are many similarities between Perots run and Trumps.Both ran on an anti-NAFTA policy but since Trump ran 25 years after Perot the American worker could see the damage caused by such policies and get behind Trump more than they did Perot.</p>

<p>Trump, himself, said that during the campaign, he would wake up, turn on the news, see that they weren&#39;t talking about him, send a controversial set of tweets, and he&#39;d be all over the news for the rest of the day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to agree with that establishment isn&#39;t just black and white. It&#39;s still a group of people who meet together though. For example you see all them meeting together at The Bilderberg meeting. What they talk about is a mystery. The media is controlled though to some extent. They allowed trump to be the voice of the people who are republican, because he wasn&#39;t politically correct and they ate that shit up. Trumps purpose is to divide us and if your apart of LGBQT+-!? or what ever other fucking letter they put on it, to feel like our voice isn&#39;t being heard. Same as if you are black. It causing a divide, when it should be the seen as the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. They want to divide us so that we fight back based on our attributes and what we define ourselves as. The problem is just class warfare. Trump is making everyone segregate them selves, when we should be doing completely the opposite. Forget you dumb political party you associate your selves with. When you vote for either Trump or Hilary you will get exactly 4 more years of war, Federal Reserve still intact, and the rich not paying any or little taxes.</p>

<p>The amount of butt hurt and emotion I&#39;m seeing from other black people about Trump is disgusting... It&#39;s seriously pathetic. Black people in November were acting like we were going to get taken in the middle of the night by men with guns as soon as Trump got into office.</p>

<p>I&#39;d watch out for more police shootings now that Trump is in office. Especially now that he tweeted about sending Feds into Chi-raq. </p>

<p>If that goes down BLM and other idiot blacks will make it out as the President &quot;invading&quot; black neighborhoods or a war on blacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strong theory, although I would argue you give the media to much credit and fail to blame the RNC. The RNC would have/probably did give Ron Paul the same treatment that the DNC gave to Bernie.</p>

<p>Our media is collectively stupid. Its about selling ad space and generating web traffic, etc. They don&#39;t care what the story is as long as it sells. Trump played the media, they gave him excessive coverage. Yes a lot of it was negative, but that didn&#39;t matter to Trump. He just wanted people talking about him. That is the reality showman in him. </p>

<p>Most of the blame lies with the establishment. I can tell you nothing unites the RNC and DNC quite like a strong third party candidate. I live in MN and voted for Jesse Ventura. I regret that vote, he was a clown. But I do remember dems and repubs uniting to make Jesse look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t vote in November, but I still think he was the better choice than Clinton.  The real election was during the primaries.  Sanders, though he may have just been controlled opposition from the beginning anyway, should&#39;ve mollywhopped Clinton in those primaries.  That&#39;s when I forever lost faith in everything establishment.  </p>

They never showed polls which were obviously inaccurate, right?
Even now, people are calling him illegitimate, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real reason that Ron Paul and Sanders getting the shaft is because they try to take on the TPTB head on. Of course they are gonna get shit on faster than light.</p>

<p>Trump doing something different. He mask his own brilliance with his ego and stupidity. This making his &quot;dumb billionare&quot; persona stand out, and making the TPTB have no idea how truly hard to kill he is.</p>

<p>Of course, this not just fool the TPTB, but making him completely unreadable. Volitile and unpredictable, a perfect trait for the destroyer. And Trump is that guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is probably plotting against them since 1995 (his remark about Epstein basically is a subtle blackmail). He hint about running since 2005 (he said something like he is not running for now, but will run in the future if he wants to). </p>

<p>I think he really did want to run in 2008, but Epstein trying to rat him out to the cabal so he throw him under the bus and kick him out, waiting to strike again. This election is his strike chance tho. And he played perfectly, backstabbing the entire cabal who has zero thinking that behind the egoistic dumbass act, is a true evil genuis, even tho the hint is there. </p>

<p>Now u are thinking that the cabal is an all-powerful organization that couldnt been take down in anyway normally. But that was basically fear-mongering thinking. They dont know all the variables, so they are trying their best to scare the people who knows about them to think they know it all. It basically just that, an entity that is only undefeatable when u think they are. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying that Trump was for the people, never was. His ego makes him wants to have it all, and the cabal takedown is just that: to get their power and wealth. His appointment basically is the new cabal starting to form. That&#39;s why the police state was usher much more: it was for the full control. The cabal, when getting knocked out of that position, will try their best to regain that position, through the old puppet that still inside (the CIA, the congress). This also explain why Trump using so much EO so fast: he want to bypass them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>truth.</p>

<p>and i supported him in the primary--however i knew his actual voting record was no better than fienstien&#39;s. chris hedges et al warned from the day he announced he was a sheep dog, but i chose to discount it, because he seemed so unlikely to do any better than kucinich.</p>

<p>bernie&#39;s schtick is very effect, give a rousing speech against a terrible bill then vote for it anyway with a meally mouthed, there was good provision hidden in the pile of evil provisions, excuse. </p>

<p>his vote for the jim crow act of 1994 that he has defended ad infinitum based on the inclusion of two insignificant, symbolic provisions, and his refusal to acknowledge that on the whole he was complicit in creating the prison industrial complex and the parimilitary police depts, sums him up in a nutshell...sigh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the difference is huge--bernie has always fallen in line in the end, and he is firmly behind our interventionist, imperial foriegn policy. he extols his iraq war vote, because it is basically the only time he has voted against the grain. he conveniently leaves out that he supported every air strike and sanction of iraq in the 1990s that resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 iraqi children. he supports drone strikes, he supports the kill list, he supports arming SA and providing them logistical support, which means he implicitly supports the genocide of the yemeni people.</p>

<p>ron paul&#39;s mirror is his comrade dennis kucinich. the only division in american governance and alignment is those south of the x-axis of the political compass, and those north of it.</p>

<p>paul and kucinich and stein are below, bernie and clinton, and trump are above. the anti-statists, pro-self determenation, pro-privacy, anti-&quot;law and order&quot; southerns are the only thing that really frightens the establishment, and the only ones that are truly anti-establishment.</p>

<p>trump is doubling down on the upper-right, facist quadrant of the political compass policies and goals of the establishment, on the compass he is right there with clinton and obama. the shit I&#39;ve taken for &quot;supporting&quot; him by saying that his inability to keep the shit our govt does out of polite conversation is a good thing, because it is out in the open, and sunshine is the best disinfectant,  is getting tiresome however...the absurdity of an anarchist being called a facist would be funny if it weren&#39;t so pathetic.</p>

<p>sigh... </p>
