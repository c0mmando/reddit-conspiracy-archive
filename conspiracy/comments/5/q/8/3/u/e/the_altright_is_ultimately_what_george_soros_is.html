        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After reading thousands upon thousands of comments over these past weeks on various social media outlets, I believe that what George Soros is really funding is hatred <em>from</em> the alt-right.</p>

<p>It is simple. </p>

<p>He can hire 100 or so rioters and instigators at each major protest, and those are the people the camera watches.</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t funding the left, he&#39;s destroying it intentionally.</p>

<p>Never in my life have I heard from so many people that they want other Americans killed for their beliefs.</p>

<p>I just watched a video of some protesters in Oregon being arrested (rightfully so), and the comment section is packed FULL of people saying that the police should have been <em>more violent</em>.</p>

<p>This is becoming acceptable..</p>

<p>Even rational comments condemning the protesters, but warning of this dangerous mentality, are met with &quot;It&#39;ll be your turn next, snowflake&quot; or similar comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorta opposite from my perspective. </p>

<p>Trump supporters and the right are happy. They won. He&#39;s in. There&#39;s hope for the future. But for some time leading up to this, we have seen many violent attacks against the right with many organized protests and disruptions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Soros is the only player pulling strings here though and there is definitely inciteful propaganda in response to the left&#39;s rage. Ultimately we&#39;re seeing divide and conquer techniques applied to everyone in an organized fashion.</p>

<p>By the way the phrase alt-right is interesting, wouldn&#39;t the New Right be a more fitting description of that movement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting view point. I&#39;ve seen this expressed a lot on 4chan in all the pol communities. The sudden appearance of professional made memes and a forced agenda of extreme hate instead of their original message of just wanting to feel okay for being who they are. </p>

<p>I wondered if the screams of being subverted were that it was an artificial fight that noone was a part of. However a key fundmental of that is jew hate and soros. Perhaps he is going out in flames to usher in the new power structure? Is he cooping the rothchilds? </p>

<p>But it is more likely it is both sides wanting to keep the public busy worrying about fighting with each other than worrying about the government who controls them. Instigation of hate is what he likes perhaps he is bringing upon his downfall for his kid or something. But that doesn&#39;t sound like their m.o. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m referring to their desire to see the left destroyed, regardless of how it is done, constitutional or not. When I see comment after comment, the vocal majority, saying, &quot;Those punks deserved worse&quot;, &quot;Those cops should have beat their asses&quot;, etc... talking about a bunch of peaceful, yet stupid people, being arrested.</p>

<p>They were arrested safely. That&#39;s the constitutional job of our officers.. not to beat them down or kill them in the streets, as all these people are begging for.</p>
