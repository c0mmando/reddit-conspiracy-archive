<li>Dulles brothers came up with the <em>ordo ab chao</em> strategy</li>
<li>Color revolutions are where you have a small group act as provocateurs to create movements and use them as human shields</li>
<li>It&#39;s a slippery slope when you choose gangsters as your friends</li>
<li>Dulles&#39; relative was the archbishop of the Catholic church. The CIA has been using clergy as cover.  They are very thin on the religion part and heavy on the arms part.  Some of it is surveillance and harassment.</li>
<li>CFR plans it either way.  (((in the 90s))) If Bill Clinton wins, Hillary becomes the shadow secretary of State, if George Bush wins he&#39;s going to be continuing the CIA operations</li>
<li>We&#39;re going to be dealing with the pattern in Mexico for 30-40 yrs</li>
<li>15,000 organs taken from Syrian CHidren in 6 yrs</li>
<li>It&#39;s the White Helmets at night, not the ones in the day; the ones with long beards at night</li>
<li>The (haitian microsharking) kidney selling has been happening in India to pay for their original sewing machine since 1974</li>
<li>Here is what it has turned into (like Dante&#39;s inferno), Turkish organ harvesting</li>
<li>Where have we seen this before?  Marc Rich in Lebanon</li>
<li>You need the Spirit cooking stuff as &quot;furniture for the mind&quot; to be comfortable with this stuff...otherwise you can&#39;t do it.  There&#39;s no more Israel survival at stake any more.  So you need these silly rituals to justify doing it.</li>
<li>Judge Sullivan missed the original hack emails--that&#39;s pretty obvious</li>
<li>Erik Larson, <em>&quot;Devil in the White City&quot;</em> book about abductions, sex rings around events</li>

<li>Changing the name to &quot;Braverman Found?&quot;</li>
<li>Braverman is going to work for Eric Schmidt to work for the Google foundation<sup><sup><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/01/18/ex-clinton-foundation-ceo-to-head-eric-schmidt.html">[]</a></sup></sup></li>
<li>I&#39;ve just wondering if the Google Foundation is now the Clinton Foundation, and if all those players leaving the Clinton Global Initiative are just moving to the west coast.</li>
<li>This is the hamlet story, trying to find the braver-man inside of you, when do you say to the CIA, &quot;you need to stop it&quot;</li>
<li>There was Kennedy who said he was going to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces</li>
<li>Then there was Frank Church and he died of cancer at the age of 57</li>
<li>There was a third guy, Steve Jobs, because it&#39;s fundamental to the Eric Schmidt story</li>
<li>Now that we&#39;ve connected Braverman to IHRC to USAID to Haiti, so tightly in this series, it&#39;s really going to become &quot;Braverman Found.  Who killed Monica Petersen&quot;</li>
<li>When Braverman finally comes out for an interview, I&#39;ll change the question mark to a period or drop it altogether.</li>
<li>1974 Frank Church commmittee put an end to the all this activity, which caused all the activity not to stop but to submerge into an underground crime network.</li>
<li>I&#39;d rather have military bases again in the US and have an above-board defense budget, because it would get rid of these Michael Morrells, these Richard the III&#39;s and their chicanery</li>
<li>Hillary deleted two terrabytes of email from her time as the shadow secretary of state [her husband being POTUS] from 1993-2001</li>
<li>The Lael Brainard 3 classified documents are the gladio programs and the now 6.7T missing from DOD budget.</li>
<li>Cynthia McKinney recap, she fingers Dyncorp and DOD</li>
<li>You will find that Eric Schmidt is a NOC</li>
<li>Brownstone being run in Palo Alto in the mid 90s</li>
<li>Brownstones are like a mcdonalds franchise.  They install it like a turnkey system. Science and technology division of the CIA puts in the cameras and lights</li>
<li>They send a NOC into companies when the company&#39;s technology is taking off because they want to control the technology.</li>
<li>George says he was close to this &quot;I was at Sun (microsystems)&quot; I used to work for Eric Schmidt</li>
<li>George shows PRISM timeline for bulk collection.  Microsoft then Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, Youtube, Skype, AOL, Apple...etc</li>
<li>{{It makes sense because Google became orwellian suddenly around 2010}}</li>
<li>They gave Jobs cancer as a warning, he didn&#39;t get it, so they finally did him in.</li>
<li>Mentions CIA heart attack gun; &quot;they can cause any kind of cancer&quot;</li>
<li>Alex Jones and Steve Piezcniek are trying to get gun porn on FB to get you riled up, and to get you on the terrorism watchlist {{to justify breaking into your computer}}</li>
<li>The terrorism watchlist they won&#39;t give the number for anymore, it is probably around 2M</li>
<li>The reason for these hacks (Cyber attacks) is the disruption campaign, to get more dirt on US government employees in order to blackmail them into being controlled.  It&#39;s not the &#39;bad guys&#39; the rapists, terrorists and murderers, it&#39;s &#39;bad guys like me&#39;--people who are speaking out against these programs.  They are targetting dissidents.</li>
<li>Integrated Archive Solutions, Amy Rao, all this dirt will be there.</li>
<li>McCabe openly admitted to taking over the FBI with JTTF and his bribes</li>
<li>&quot;They put a slide build into this slide&quot; -- so they must like this slide {{They = someone who has been hacking his laptop, he mentioned last video; &#39;build&#39; is &#39;transition&#39;}}</li>
<li>1000 peacekeepers are defending the hospital in the middle of nowhere</li>
<li>Braverman is a metaphor; he had a chance to come forward in this series and he blew it</li>
<li>Monica Petersen is the real hero</li>

<li>It would be a good time before starting the new job, to go to Haiti and make a final report on his Haiti Relief Fund he started 7 yrs ago.</li>
<li>George is talking to the attorney for the elected leader and she&#39;s the one saying the toppling &quot;relief&quot; is an international disgrace</li>
<li>There is a 400 Acre tunnel in Haiti we don&#39;t know anything about</li>
<li>AK47s with the Peacekeepers--they are soldiers</li>
<li>There were disappearances when cholera broke out, in an area that doesn&#39;t make sense</li>
<li>The kids were put in bodybags and the parents were not allowed to see them</li>
<li>This reminded George of drug trafficking in Vietnam.  They put heroin into the body cavities of soldiers and shipped them back to the US.  The whistleblower was killed</li>
<li>The Nepalese dyncorp police are at the hospital (un peacekeepers)</li>
<li>In Syria they are harvesting organs of kids, again Dyncorp</li>
<li>Petersen goes to investigate, she ends up dead.  Her master thesis cannot be found.</li>
<li><strong><em>It&#39;s the total weight of the evidence.</em></strong>  Suspicious reported activity, murders, shady developments, microloansharking, Clinton, Yunus and Carlos Slim being involved, etc.</li>
<li>The middle of Haiti is being walled off as a giant prison.</li>
<li>The <em>agent problem</em>, when money is handed off, how do you now it was spent properly?  Well you have to go and investigate and double check</li>
<li>The 200 agents that McCabe bargained for with the Quid Pro Quo was to go to Iraq not to go to Haiti</li>
<li>Preet Bhahara is still {{masturbating}}} to his own Time magazine vanity shot instead of doing his actual job.</li>
<li>This whole crew has the opportunity to fix this Haiti problem now.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3j1EKA2fU">[<strong>Day 88 pt1</strong>]</a> -- &quot;Braverman Haiti and Me&quot; -- in the tradition of &quot;Roger and Me&quot;

<ul>
<li>George wants Braverman to come with him to Haiti to investigate where money was spent and how ineffectively</li>
<li>George asserts Osprey Global is operating in Haiti as well as Libya/Syria</li>
<li>CIA economic spies (NOCs) are needed to first ascertain where the most valuable targets are before you bring in the military</li>
<li>Robert Rubin is at the center of this.  When you want to fund operations like Dyncorp, you get all your friends in pharma or tech industries to funnel research projects through them.  And some of that money is funnelled covertly as a cover for Dyncorp or Osprey Global.</li>
<li>That is why Hillary destroyed the 2TB of files. It was records of these covers and covert ops.</li>
<li>DOD is why the US can&#39;t balance it&#39;s books</li>
<li>Time to be aware that you shouldn&#39;t let your kids go anywhere around the Super Bowl</li>
<li>Fred Eshelman, head of PPD, he does clinical trials for one of Hillarys&#39; big clients (Adventis?), 50M a year.  David Grange retires as CEO of PPD.  What is a retired general doing as ceo of a clinical trial company?  You need a population that you need to test your vaccine on.  You&#39;re going to find Duke Medical school in Haiti; and you&#39;ll see forced vaccination programs in Haiti.</li>
<li>George thinks the deaths are related to these clinical trials.  That the kids in body bags are shipped back to Duke Medical to see how the vaccine did.</li>
<li><strong>Satanic stuff is always a cover---people are going to get mad at me for saying this.</strong></li>
<li>The vaccine programs and testing is going to make dead bodies so you have to have an explanation to people and they are more willing to accept satanic explanations</li>
<li>It&#39;s all part of a spying ring: Dyncorp is going to be economic spying, military planning and policing</li>

<li>George had a long conversation with Sy Hersh.  He said he relies on inside sources</li>
<li>Hersh says George is more like Peter Dale Scott {{quite a compliment}}</li>
<li>George talks about his homing in on the truth from his 80% fact, 20% working theory and the feedback from it, some of them are breadcrumbs from people in the IC and the FBI</li>
<li>George believes Haiti will be partitioned into 3 parts and they will organize a coup using Dominican Republicans.  Why did D.R. push people out of the country and into Haiti</li>
<li>Bill Swing US Haiti Ambassador, OIM, is &#39;doctor death&#39;, he&#39;s known for creating migrations.  Responsible for 6M Dead in the Congo over a precious metal</li>
<li>Compares to Dulles brothers run covert coup</li>
<li>Holly Grange manages the port of Norfolk now--it would be a great place to ship arms from.</li>
<li>Drumheller and Sudan-- you take their resources and then you call it a civil war</li>
<li>I&#39;m not trying to go after Steve Feinberg, but G4S in 50 citations is called the chaos company -- wherever they go they create chaos</li>
<li>(((Robert Rubin))) is the guy who did all the money laundering for the Arkansas Develpment fund, for the (((OTPOR))) operations in Europe, and he did the coverup for the bailout for Citibank</li>
<li>&quot;Haiti has been the test lab for the pharmaceutical industry&quot;</li>
<li>George goes into specifics about his speculations on Haiti, esp. in the South</li>
<li>Keep sending George citations and sources</li>
<li>George suggests using Trello collaboratively.  Each slide becomes a card in trello.</li>
<li>Compares these little cabals and their operations as &#39;little movies&#39;, at a glance easy to prove</li>
<li>If you want to stop another coup, organ trafficking, release at least the metadata of the 650k emails</li>
<li>This 5 yr thing (((FBI says they need 5 yrs to process))) is getting more laughable by the day</li>
<li>We have probable cause.  This is not a fishing expedition.  Robert Boyce NYC detective has told us crimes have been committed</li>

<li>Because you have Kerry on the hook now for Iran-hostage and Nuclear negotiations on gmail as well</li>
<li>&quot;Always the big move to cover the small move&quot;</li>
<li>I&#39;m wondering if this is the cover to get the reporters away from the White House.</li>
<li>Look back at the conflict points in history, and that&#39;s where it will be again, because the military planners look into this and replay; patterns repeat themselves</li>
<li>Military divides countries and then takes the half that has the resources, and keeps the other half disrupted</li>
<li>Kagame in Rwanda took armies to slice the Congo in half and then they took the part with the mines</li>

<li>Until Braverman responds we&#39;re just going to do storyboards</li>
<li>Late breaking news, I believe the District Attorney in the southern district of NY Preet Bhahara, working with the State Attorney General has submitted papers to give blanket amnesty to everyone in the Clinton Foundation to the president&#39;s desk and it has been signed.</li>
<li>Lucas Lundin--a mining guy worth 20B--pledges 100M to Clinton Foundation gets Kagame to cut Congo in half to take the forced uranium labor mines</li>
<li>Heart of Darkness is based on this following story</li>
<li>It&#39;s about realizing things are really this evil, as you go further down the river</li>
<li>Sub-saharan Africa is Joe Wilson&#39;s economic spying domain, he located the mines for Congo</li>
<li>Madame Curie discovered radium here and that launches the nuclear age</li>
<li>65% pitchblende is what is found in this mine, more rich uranium than anywhere else in the world, most mines in the US is 1%</li>
<li>This is why these people are tracking this.  It&#39;s raw resource in WMDs.</li>
<li><strong><em>Joe Wilson brought in Lucas Lundin and Kagame and genocided ~6M people in order to get our nuclear weapon resources; he&#39;s now responsible for the 1994 genocide, but the first and second congo war under Clinton</em></strong></li>
<li>Lucas Lundin is friends with Carl Bildt, who was the guy George Soros recommended to take over Albania; Soros is going to call on Bildt--friends with Bryzinski--to do the DynCorp thing</li>
<li>George recaps the Cemex &#39;cement laundering&#39; strategy and slush fund</li>
<li>&quot;<em>Mirebalais</em> [, Haiti] is where it&#39;s al going to happen&quot; {{wut}}</li>
<li>I just wanted to show visually.  In 3 minutes I put together this slide in India with Iran, Pakistan, India: <em>this gives you of the politics of India in 5 seconds than you would get in 20 years of watching CNN.</em>  (((George shows at 10:00 the two alternative pipelines from Iran to India: one that goes through Pakistan, the other circumvents Pakistan by going through the Gulf of Oman, with an Indian pipeline into the heartland along the Indian border of Pakistan)))</li>
<li><strong><em>George is going to be talking with Cynthia McKinney about Bangladesh!</em></strong></li>
<li>Trafficking is kind of like reverse-slavery; they show the pictures of the kids, test drive them at little St. James and the ones that are picked are sent to Africa.</li>
<li>Follow Jeffrey&#39;s plane</li>

<li>All of this is Henry Kissinger all this time</li>
<li>Hillary Clinton was working for Kissinger back in 1974 while on the Watergate committee as a spy, making photocopies for Kissinger&#39;s lawyers</li>
<li>Mena Airport was the Iran Contra funnel, you&#39;re going to find it&#39;s Henry Kissinger again.</li>
<li>All these people are chess pieces on Henry Kissinger&#39;s chessboard</li>
<li>Bryzinski is one of Kissingers economic spies in the Carter administration</li>
<li>With the Clintons and Bushes this goes all the way back to 1974</li>
<li>It goes back to Nixon having a falling out with Kissinger, that&#39;s why he got rid of him with Watergate</li>
<li>These topple operations simply repeat</li>
<li>&quot;I&#39;ve been incremental to prepare you for this&quot;  -- &quot;I&#39;ve been very Israeli in my attitude&quot; {{Wut..?}}</li>
<li>Let&#39;s talk about the evidence</li>
<li>School Joseph Korbell -- survivors from the holocaust so is Marc Rich; ashkenazi jews ended up populating Israel so all these means and motives came from that.</li>
<li>CIA HQ in denver, the Denver school Corbell International School</li>
<li>You don&#39;t teach people seminars on torture unless the students are going into CIA training environment</li>
<li>This is a CIA police force, it&#39;s like farming.  They look at the target population like cattle, to be herded.</li>
<li>When you want to put in a pipeline, you rusle the cattle you take the kids and harvest the adults.  This has been inculcated into this &quot;Dyncorp thinking&quot;</li>
<li>The <em>&quot;pizzagate&quot;</em> art is about organ harvesting (see cake shaped like a person)</li>
<li>Orphanages where people are killed</li>
<li>Podesta Office Art depicts heart dissection &quot;spirit cooking&quot; emails show art heart removal Podest, &quot;Pam&quot; email talks about collecting for heart and kidney transplant from Pam.  That&#39;s David Fleischaker, Sec of Energy in OK.  He knew Kissinger back in DC.  Fleischaker&#39;s offical company slogan is &quot;Rape Pillage Plunder&quot;.  Go through the emails and it will be a who&#39;s-who of kissinger&#39;s friends.</li>
<li>Podesta brothers are the debt collectors -- they are doing the harvest</li>
<li>Haiti is the kidnapping capital of the world, even before the earthquake (in 2010); UN was doing the kidnapping</li>
<li>You are going to see that there are a lot of illegitimate hospitals in Haiti doing the kidney removals to pay for their sewing machines and to pay their microloansharking cell loans</li>
<li>USAID money, put in microloansharking programs.  Port au prince area will have the kidney removals</li>
<li>It&#39;s going to be Dyncorp running a forced labor mining in the gold mining (George will provide evidence later)</li>
<li>Minustah, means UN in haitain creole, most disbursements are to Dyncorp activities only .6% going to Haitian organizations</li>
<li>Bill Swing uses migration as an army and create all these movements of resources.  He did this in the Congo, 6M people died.</li>
<li>Another Giustra partner and Clinton donor Lukas Lundin pledges 100M</li>
<li>They are gonna cut Haiti in half and recognize both government, like they did Congo and Libya; Kagame was the guy</li>
<li>They did this get at the open strip mine of uranium</li>
<li>Gold is what its going to be in Haiti</li>
<li>Sex trafficking are going to be going the other way, to Africa</li>
<li>It&#39;s all financed by Dyncorp; they ran the same operation in Europe</li>
<li>Males are used for their organs, females for breeding  {{I don&#39;t understand why though}}</li>
<li>Some are disappointed because Trump recognized Hillary at the inauguration--&quot;the fix is in&quot;</li>
<li>There is the world court if Gowdy and Chaffetz can&#39;t move forward</li>
<li>There is also the court of public opinion</li>
<li>Wall off &#39;concerns&#39;, make it about drugs first and make arrests.  Trying to get your arms around this is too much.</li>
<li>How to proceed: We need the 650k emails, send 200 agents to Haiti right away</li>

    <div class="md"><p>constellations change as cultures change......BUT they have a essence....a quality that that is durable.  the signs of the zodiac are IMPOSED on the constellations....which actually ARE groups of stars which are all bigger and brighter than our sun. as the solar axis  moves from one sign to the next the qualities of the signs change and some of their rulerships do also......but stars remain.  with the progression of the winter solstice point we see change in the nature of political power and in the nature of war.  note that the 1st world war started when the winter solstice point LEFT Sagittarius.  by the end of our century it will have move into Scorpio........there&#39;ll be no spirit cooking then! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ty for this but i meant more in terms of  winter solstice transit and would the same be true for the summer solstice transits? </p>

<p>also that this makes sense to me is it more like a spiraling return so different points get hit within the constellations each year or for periods of years so epochs are measured or something &lt;- do i even know what i am trying to say?</p>
