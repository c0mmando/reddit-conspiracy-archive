Articles I read on one hand have me worried about him pushing the pipeline and ruining working class lives by Repealing the ACA.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I look at T_D and I read that every move proves he&#39;s a genius, like enacting a 20 percent import tariff on Mexican products to make them indirectly pay for the border wall. </p>

<p>So I come to conspiracy to try and find some element of truth but I just can&#39;t tell right now. Are we moving into Hitler Land or not??</p>

<p>What word exactly? He said it would be difficult to keep Carrier and Carrier said they&#39;d keep the factory open due to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool, I was wrong on devos, ill admit that. Again, you can do whatever math you want, but trump isnt doing what he said hed do in regards to carrier. they still have production jobs going to mexico. </p>

<p>also not sure where you even got the 900 from, trump said 1100 and the real number of jobs saved was 730. </p>

<p>if youre going to do math, you should also take out the money lost on taxes from the 550 that were still laid off as well as the tax loss from the production plant still going to mexico. but you wont do that im guessing.</p>

<p>Carrier was going to leave. He said what the consequences of leaving were going to be, for Carrier, et al.</p>

<p>He&#39;s beginning to enact those consequences, for Carrier, et al. But he also did more than he promised, he got Carrier to keep their factory and almost 1000 jobs in the US. </p>

Watch what all the players are doing, including media, the subs, and Donald.  Make your own call.  This sub has a lot of intelligent people combing through his deeds, looking for evil.  If it is there, we will see it.  As of now, the neutral people seem to be content-to-happy.</p>

<p>Making Mexico pay for the wall isn&#39;t being an asshole. They will benefit from the wall as well. It will kill the illegal drug and human smuggling cartels.</p>
