       It is too bad that environmental issues have become so politicized as to be meaningless. It is really hard to tell if the EPA is a legitimate org just doing its best to make sure that our environment remains pure, and is just persecuted by Big Oil and the like, or if it was co-opted by the same influences that drive stuff like the crazy org that runs that anti-whaling boat team. I still think whaling is gross and needlessly destructive btw, it is just those people are lunatics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to believe anymore. I used to work with the EPA though, and from my side it seemed very bureaucratic, but not necessarily politicized . Bear in mind, the way I worked with them wasn't in any area approaching controversy.

       The combination of an over-regulating EPA + cheap foreign trade with countries with poor regulation makes it an absolutely deadly combination for the world, so those who care for the environment should push for more goods to be made in America with reasonable standards rather than in China with god-knows-what, because it pollutes the same Earth we all live on. I think a lot of people don't take this into consideration, particularly because when you also factor in the additional transportation pollution, it's a really bad deal for all of us. In a very counter-intuitive way, it is WAY better to cut regulations so you can make stuff at home as long as you are polluting equal or less than the competitors. If the goods you want are very toxic to make, like steel and semiconductors (hence not economical to make in USA due to EPA in part) then it is not logical to make it uneconomic at home and then exploit from another country.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah the more we can do to stop using supertankers and container ships constantly, that is literally FREE pollution off the table. Even if it's not helping the environment, at least you're not doing MORE damage to the Earth overall by making it somewhere else with looser regulations and extra transportation.

       Don't worry, though. The "jobs" are not going back to the US as long as it retains its stranglehold on reserve currency and petrodollar statuses. But once it lets go of these 2, it means that the US citizens would finally be "competitive", because the US will go through hyperinflation when every country dumps the Federal Reserve Dollar.

       "If  The President is really serious about stimulating economic growth he must get control over the EPA bureaucracy, which is operating as a job-killing machine. The EPA is infecting the business environment with a plague of new regulations and is compounding its affliction on the economy by denying permits for job-creating projects," said Tom Borelli, Ph.D., director of the National Center's Free Enterprise Project.

       Why would anyone trust this corporate stooge? He's been in the pocket of corporations since the late 80s. The only reason he dislikes regulation is because he's being paid by the people being regulated. I can't believe people in this subreddit fall for this shit.

       Strong Opinion? I stated what I thought about this letter. That is not strong opinion, it's an opinion. Also, how do you know what I have read and haven't read? You don't, so before you go throwing accusations you might want to think about what you are trying to say before saying it. 
I understand the importance of the EPA, when they function properly. I also understand the EPA has mass corruption as do many other agencies.

       I disagree with your removal  of my post. I made a general statement, not a personal attack.

       My comment was "Don't waste your time arguing with CTR."

      <p>
       Which is advise that every user on this sub should take. Anyone saying "I disagree"  without making any claims or citing any sources is most likely just trying to start shit and is not adding anything to the discussion. Therefore those users are most likely CTR shills.

       Your comment suggested that another user in that thread, was a CTR shill, which violates rule 10.

      <p>
       I understand that you think this user is a shill, but accusing other users that you don't agree with of being a shill simply serves to drag down the level of discourse to an irredeemable low.

       We had hints this would happen before he was elected, judging his comments, his actions, his hires, his cabinet, the Dakota pipeline and other executive decisions, this is absolutely the executive branch forcing this. Just look at how he is demonizing the press and it becomes obvious.

       Well you acted flabbergasted that anyone could stick up for the press in any situation. Do you really trust the government over the press? Do you really think the press lies all the time? We need them both. Alone neither can be trusted. Your comment 100% reads like you are only believing one outcome with no room for detail or nuance.

       Given the behavior of the press and our government,  anyone that just blindly trust the lies they spew is naive. I do my own research and draw my own conclusions. I have plenty of room for details and nuances. And I do not trust anyone that lies. Both the press &amp; the government lie, so I really have a hard time believing either one.

       I agree that anyone that blindly believes them is naive. And this is exactly why we make no progress because i called you out on an all or nothing statement and you come back at me with, "well since you think the opposite of me, you're wrong". Nowhere did I say I trusted the press 100%. My entire point was there is gray and nuance and you can't just make blanket statements. You then pretended like I was making a blanket statement just because I was pushing back. Stop being so defensive man.

Please tell me more about myself and my problems. You must have some crystal ball or maybe you are a witch. 
I understand the importance of the EPA and I also understand there is a lot of corruption within the agency. Can we not just wait to see how it shakes out before everyone starts going bonkers?

       What you and other trump fans are so slow to see or completely ignore are the tell tale signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps has already broke the emoluments clause by not putting his investments into a blind trust. He is able to profit off his decisions and regulate against his enemies. This is a first for ANY us president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has not disclosed his tax returns. Not illegal but every president before him has agreed to this out of transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has assigned probably the worst cabinet in history. Most of the people he has assigned have ZERO experience in their department.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is attacking the first amendment by only allowing his brand of news out of the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wants to put a 20% tarrif on imported goods from mexico. If you have no idea how disaterous this is then you never heard of this
       <a href="http://capitalism.org/free-trade/what-was-the-end-result-of-the-smoot-hawley-tariff-act">
        http://capitalism.org/free-trade/what-was-the-end-result-of-the-smoot-hawley-tariff-act
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You also wouldn't understand how badly every state would be affected by such a ridiculous tarrif.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wall would also not only be a huge economic pitfall but would destroy the local environment in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads us to trump silencing the EPA. Some here believe they are corrupt but really they are a mostly independent agency. Here is a describing quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., regional offices for each of the agency's ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality Congress determines a regulation, the EPA provides the data to back up the regulation, then continues testing to ensure guidelines are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would trump want to stop the EPA? If he wanted to fight corruption he would attack the Congress for passing the corrupt laws not the governing body that reviews them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is silencing his opposition, he has done it with the Cia, the media and now on an agency who sole duty is to protect its citizens and it's environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you believe that any of the above things are untrue, please provide me with sources. If you agree with any of these points that I have made then you are close to understanding  that trump is nowhere close to qualified to be leader of the free world.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the above are signs of a regime that has no interest in its people, land or freedom. And before I am done let me drop this little gem on you
      </p>
      <p>
       No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary. I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers--I welcome it. This Administration intends to be candid about its errors; for as a wise man once said: "An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it." We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors; and we expect you to point them out when we miss them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without debate, without criticism, no Administration and no country can succeed--and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian lawmaker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. And that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment-- the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution- -not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply "give the public what it wants"--but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate and sometimes even anger public opinion.

       Let me say this. I am not a super Trump fan. I think there are concerns with his administration picks and with his financial ties. However, he is the president so we have to deal with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the EPA, I think there is much work to be done with that agency. Putting a halt on things for however brief will allow them to assess the main concerns. It is evident by the links I posted this has been an issue for sometime now. So, my original comment on this "pants on fire" anonymous letter still stands. People are so riled up right now, everything has become a pants on fire situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I have read today, they are looking to return control of the EPA to the states. They are not shutting down the EPA, they just halted parts that have already been accused of going against the rule set forth by congress with regards to communications to the public.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2016/03/09/epa-remains-a-paragon-of-government-waste-fraud-and-abuse/?client=safari">
        this goes into that issue
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to fight, I promise. But I'm also not here to join the crowd of pants on fire. I hope this explains my position a little better. If I was rude previously, I apologize, that was not my intention. It seems not freaking out pisses people off these days, and honestly it's wearing my patience thin.

       Where was the EPA when Flint was being poisoned?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had the authority and information to take decisive action on the lead contamination of Flint's drinking water in June of 2015 -- seven months before it acted, a federal watchdog said Thursday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Office of Inspector General for the EPA said the agency should have issued an emergency order to protect Flint residents from the contaminated water. The EPA didn't issue such an order until Jan. 21 of this year.

       While it's cute that you think that rivers and wind currents stop at state lines, pollution is not a local problem and can not be reasonably addressed by local policy. Any pollution control you implement is you spending more money to protect someone else's interests.

       I agree with this sarcastic comment. The amount of people in here lately thinking the government always has our best interests at heart  is truly baffling. The govt. has demonstrated over and over that they only have their own existence in mind. They'd short-dick every cannibal in the Congo to keep their cushy, make-work jobs.

       So give them MORE money and power, not less. Seriously, defunding the EPA solves nothing until you have a concrete plan to replace it, and any replacement would necessarily have to just be the EPA all over again.

       There is a republican tactic created by Newt Gingrich which is to defund government agencies that provide human services. Once these agencies can no longer provide their functions because of lack of funding the Republicans can use this as evidence of government incompetence and argue for tax cuts to the rich (because their tax money is going to worthless programs that dont work, funny innit?)

       Well, 15k employees over 50 states means just 300 per state assuming equal distribution.  When you start spreading them through different counties, it is diluted even more.  Not to say they would have a base in each county, but just for illustration.

       In my statement, I blamed dumb guys who were contracted-out. The only reason contracting jobs are increasingly popular, is that much responsibility is shifted toward workers who do not give a damn. The EPA, and many other important agencies, chose to make money more important than the safety of millions of humans and animals.

       Agencies dont make money, they are given a budget every year and have to spend that budget. Employees are paid a government salary, nobody gets to keep the leftover budget, it just disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agencies hire contractors when their budgets are too small to hire full time employees.

       Again, if their budget hadnt been slashed they could have provided more oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose you live in a small town and the main road is full of potholes because the roads budget was slashed. Suppose this happened after a millionaire, who lives out in the county and doesnt even use the town roads, went and complained to the mayor because his taxes were high. Do you then wish that they slash the roads budget even more?

       FEMA responds to natural disasters, not the EPA. If you wanna criticize the government, at least learn how it works.

       And here are some more facts about the EPA budget:

       I posted a similar question not too long ago, but more broad: what are hundreds of thousands (million+?) US Department of Whatever employees actually doing on a daily basis?  Paperwork?  Meetings?  Email?  I suspect a LOT of these employees have been sitting on their asses their entire 20-30 year "career" doing absolutely nothing of importance.

       By hurting the environment through business interest rights, it also infringed upon the rights of others in the community. How? The right to a healthy and safe, secure environment.

       In some cases that may be true, yet they are also directly responsible for negotiating and participating in the cleaning up of Onondaga Lake one of the nation's worst. Unfortunately during storm periods Syracuse dumps raw sewage into it even today in 2017. Guess they can relax about that fact now.

       Last I checked, oil companies like those repped by Rex Tillerson ACTUALLY abuse individuls by threatening landowners who don't want a pipeline or fracking operation on their land and obtaining undeserved easements that force the landowners to accept the corporations using their land for profit and eventually poisoning their water.

       Do you know of equally damning instances from long ago? I'm wanting to put the blame on a bunch of non-skilled workers to dig a giant hole in the side of an abandoned mine, known to be filled with highly toxic water. I'd like to think that real Engineers, working for the EPA, would not have made the same mistake.

       All EPA employees should send as much info as possible to wikileaks. Any agency affected should start compiling information to be disseminated to wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think wikileaks should also not be the only game in town, and other whistleblower sites should emerge if possible.

       Given that it's a government agency, I'm guessing that this would make them look worse and more wasteful than they're already perceived to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media and public have already bought into their narrative. The only "whistles" to be blown would be that they are not being truthful about something.

       Yeah Yeah, blame someone else for your own incompetence, not the first time I've seen that tactic. In fact that's government SOP, they make you resign because if they fire you, they start asking questions, and it always leads to the superiors. But enough government incompetence and graft. They already cleaned out the state department, now these impotent fucks are next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good riddance I say. They had their chance to do something good, but like any bureaucracy it became drunk with its own power, and ultimately became little more than an agency that harasses normal people while letting huge corporations kill bees and other wanton acts of pollution with zero reprecussions.

       Don't know about everybody else but I've noticed a lack of planes spraying over my house since friday.  Before that nearly everyday was heavy heavy plane traffic with tons of cloud seeding especially the past few months.  Plane after plane would fly over my property in front of the suns path through the sky turning empty blue sky into grey smudge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the EPA was running the chem trails  to block the sun maybe it got shut down with this administration.  I have to imagine the operating costs of that much air traffic is incredibly high.  And I am not seeing planes on the same path that are not spraying making me believe they were running military planes not passenger.  Heres a pic from election day

       Come to think of it I haven't had to turn my vehicle to circulating air internally lately. It's been kind of nice. Most days the trails are so prevalent that I prefer to keep the outside air out, and I am always looking for them because I love it when I can roll my windows down. Not joking. I'm pretty sure I have seen some since Friday though.

       The EPA is
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       a respectable agency! They protect corporate interests and simply set the standards for how much the corporations can poison us. The EPA does not protect us, they have shitty environmental standards, they don't do proper enforcement, and they cover up scandals more than they stand up for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is more patriotic than to be critical of your government. I'm skeptical of the multiple EPA-worshipping posts I've seen on this sub lately.

       So is the end game here to shut down most aspects of the government and its agencies to cause the federal government to implode and/or burn to the ground? Let the government infrastructure fall by the wayside/be neglected and make Americans uneducated, sick, desperate, and poor? At a certain point, people will be desperate for something more.  Americans might even flee into the loving embrace of Mother Russia under Putin's stern, fatherly guidance.

       I could be wrong but Flint, MI still has undrinkable water and I'm curious why they can't fix that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also something I'm curious about, why is it when there is an oil spill the EPA cleans it up, the oil company/transport company pay a fine which is tax deductable and business continues. That reeks of a conspiracy to me more than them being shut down. It smells like double dipping.

       I'm really not sure what the story is here.   Scott Pruitt hasn't been confirmed yet.   The EPA is basically without a leader right now because the Senate Democrats are purposefully dragging out the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the new leader is going to drastically change the agencies goals and mission - for the better most certainly.    So its no surprise that the employees have been told to cease and desist.   Whats troubling is that so many of them are whining to social media about.    I guess that makes "who to terminate" pretty easy though.    Guaranteed there is a social media clause in their employee handbooks that makes this an easy thing to do.

       I agree with what the EPA is supposed to stand for, but don't agree with a lot of the things the EPA actually does.  It's frustrating to speak on these things just to be met with an empty, self-righteous "but don't you care about the environment?!"  If we can't criticize the failures of an organization just because their mission statement is agreeable, or a person just because their words sound nice, how are we supposed to call for solutions and improvements? The same corporations the EPA is supposed to regulate control the EPA, so it's not going to fix itself from the inside.

       Disdain for the EPA is not disdain for the environment. It's really a pet-peeve of mine when people think one means the other.

       I understand that you think this user is a shill, but accusing other users that you don't agree with of being a shill simply serves to drag down the level of discourse to an irredeemable low.
