<p>*&quot;We don&#39;t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more &quot;Pied Piper&quot; candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren&#39;t limited to:</p>

<p>• Ted Cruz</p>

<p>• Donald Trump</p>

<p>• Ben Carson</p>

<p>We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to them seriously. [sic, though the word &quot;take&quot; seems clearly implied between &quot;to&quot; and &quot;them&quot;]</p>

<p>As for Rand Paul, he is one of a group of candidates the Dems need to take down&quot;*</p>

<p>*&quot;more will need to be done on certain candidates to undermine their credibility among our coalition (communities of color, millennials, women) and independent voters. In this regard, the goal here would be to show that they are just the same as every other GOP candidate: extremely conservative on these issues....</p>

<p>• Rand Paul -- What to undermine: the idea he is a &quot;different&quot; kind of Republican; his stance on the military and his appeal to millennials and communities of color.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent observation. But bear in mind, at the time that was written Trump looked like the most ridiculous improbability on the ticket. There wasn&#39;t any information on what Trump would actually do as a politician. So, be careful in making the comparison that Rand Paul is <em>the only</em> enemy of the establishment, or is more of an enemy than Trump. It is just that at that time he was seen as the most threatening.</p>

<p>Good to know though, Rand is probably one of the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And Rand represented a movement that Ron started.  They were afraid of that movement continuing.  In one sense, I agree with you &quot;there wasn&#39;t any information on what Trump would actually do&quot;, but I think that might only be true from our point-of-view.  It&#39;s very possible that people behind the scenes knew his platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they knew about his platform. But, that is a far cry from knowing he would actually try to do the stuff in his platform. Put yourself in their shoes, they are lifelong politicians. They would have been positive that Trump was as full of shit as the rest of them, and that they could disregard most of what he was saying he would do as typical political pandering.</p>

<p>Build a wall and make them pay for it seemed like a ridiculous idea even a week ago, but here we are lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be totally missing the point and using mental gymnastics to reaffirm a world view. They PROPPED him up, that&#39;s why he won. Do you REALLY think politics, and ALL of the organizations involved have saturday morning cartoon tier ability to go about achieving what they want? Have you ever even heard of black propaganda? The Zionists have made it abundantly clear that you cannot be president if you are not one. The entire election process is controlled - both candidates agreed to a script in every debate as ACORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ON PREESIDENTIAL DEBATES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have people here ever read the Pied Piper story, because it really seems that a lot of you are misunderstanding what it was about.</p>

<p>In the Pied Piper story, the Pied Piper is paid to get rats out of the city and then the mayor stiffs him on the bill, so in revenge, he leads all of the children in the city away and ransoms them back for twice what he was to be paid for the rats. Or he kills them or something. Depends on which version of the story you read. Anyway, that part doesn&#39;t matter. The point is that he gathered a following and took them with him.  That is the only way &quot;Pied Piper&quot; makes sense here.  You wouldn&#39;t use that term for propping up a weak candidate you can beat, because it has nothing to do with the story.</p>

<p>That is what the Democrats wanted. Trump (or Cruz, or Carson) were to be propped up, gather a following, then lose to Jeb! with the hope that that following would sit out the general due to butthurtedness. They were relatively successful with Cruz and #nevertrump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &quot;pied piper&quot; is someone offering strong yet delusive enticements. </p>

<p>In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats. (According to some versions of the story, the promised sum was 1000 guilders.) The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all but one drowned.</p>

<p>Despite the piper&#39;s success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to a sum of 50 guilders) even going so far as to hint that he brought the rats himself in an extortion attempt. The piper left the town angrily, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul&#39;s day, while the Hamelinites were in church, the piper returned dressed in green like a hunter playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town&#39;s children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave and were never seen again. </p>

<p>The DNC&#39;s plan was to use Trump to lure extremist Republicans and uneducated voters to the voting booths during the primary, then to lead the Republican party as whole to the river to drown during the general election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  They never thought that Cruz, Trump, or Carson had a shot.  The GOP and the big money donors were behind Jeb!.  Remember, the email was sent in April of 2015.  Trump hadn&#39;t even announced his candidacy officially, and Bush was the front runner at that point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again;  They wanted exactly what happened with Cruz.  A lot of his supporters turned #nevertrump and sat out the election or voted 3rd party.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wanted to prop him up early on, but they didn&#39;t want him to win the primary.  People go on and on about the &quot;$2 billion free airtime&quot; but completely ignore that most of it was negative.  It&#39;s like they weren&#39;t even paying attention during the primaries.  The coverage of Trump, once he actually started climbing in the polls quickly turned to &quot;Trump is a joke and he can&#39;t win and he&#39;s Hitler and he&#39;s probably going to drop out before the primary and...&quot;  I don&#39;t see how any of what the Democrat aligned media did, after the very early stages of the campaign, could be construed as trying to help Trump win.  It looks like the same smear campaign Democrats use against every Republican.  Ridicule, demonize, and delegitimize.  We can even see the tactic they planned to use against Rand Paul being used against Trump now.  Claim that he&#39;s not an outsider, and is and always has been part of the establishment.  But anyone paying attention knows that is not true.  The GOPe hated Trump and tried every dirty trick they could think of to keep him from winning.</p>

<p>The truth is that the leaders of the Democratic party see themselves as masters of political gamesmanship, but Trump and a bunch internet trolls just came in and embarrassed them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is weird thought that they just didn&#39;t take Trump serious and that ended up working. Ran didn&#39;t really have much controversy or anything did he? I don&#39;t remember much bad or good press. Of course any kind of press is good. Unless you&#39;re Gary Johnson.</p>
