<p>We need to discuss everything that has been happening.</p>

<p>I agree Hillary did some shady business. No doubt about it. She should of been held accountable, her and everyone else involved. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not entirely sold on pizzagate. I agree those E-mails are weird. Also why is a pizza owner meeting with top brass policticians. But I need to see a little more evidence before I jump on. But if you believe it that&#39;s cool,  cause it&#39;s def plausible.</p>

<p>But what about all the allegations to trump and Russia. I&#39;m surprised by the lack of investigation here in this sub. It&#39;s kinda just assumed this is bullshit. I don&#39;t understand why when the FBI and CIA are both investigating ties.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is we need some neutrality here and also some respect from one another.</p>

<p>And we need to investigate everything.</p>

<p>I am. I hold stances from a variety of parties. Abortion is a choice. Gender is a choice. Guns are great tools. Healthcare should be free for all. Hillary should be in prison. Snowden, Manning and all the other leakers are patriots. We shouldn&#39;t be meddling in the middle east. 911 is suspicious. Torture is ineffective and a violation of human rights. Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S. are terrorist states. Capitalism is out of control. Drugs should be legalized. We need a universal basic income. Men are marginalized by the courts. Mental illness is under recognized, poorly treated, and its victims are continuously abused by our society. Illegal immigration is a cancer on countries. </p>

<p>Are there any parties i haven&#39;t offended or supported?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of us know that the attacks on Trump in the mainstream media are motivated ideologically, and have no basis in reality.
