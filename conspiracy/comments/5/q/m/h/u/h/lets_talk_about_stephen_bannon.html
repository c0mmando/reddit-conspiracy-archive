        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s fair to say this guy has attained a bunch of influence. Considering that he managed to stabilize the Trump campaign by providing a script and a retreat from improv, his direction of the film version of Clinton Cash and the Trump campaign ads which bear his signatures, plus the notions that statements including the inaugural address and Trump&#39;s actual executive orders have been produced either solely by him or under his distinct influence, Bannon emerges as the second most powerful figure in DC. His resume and history of allegations, as well as his running of Breitbart (indicating a very clear connection between a rising press vehicle and the actual government of the US, ala RT)...it seems insane to not view him as a very influential force, not merely with Breitbart readers and Tea Party enthusiasts but with the most powerful person and country in the world. Bannon is an ideologue and propagandist of the highest order, now Chief Strategist of the US gov.  </p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p>What are Bannon&#39;s objectives? Speeches given at Tea Party-leaning conferences have referred to the perceived failures of the social safety net infrastructure and the dangers of the &quot;welfare state,&quot; the need to maintain otherwise undefined &quot;Judeo-Christian values,&quot; and the notion that men who already have wealth and community influence/control should see more benefit from public policy, should have more power and representation, should not be shamed for simply being successful, etc. </p>

<p>Why did Bannon choose to call Breitbart &quot;a platform for the Alt-Right&quot; when extant white separatists/Neo-Nazis/open fascists were already using the moniker for their own movements? Why has the bulk of online debate come from sites like The Daily Stormer and Red Ice Radio, claiming they are the true Alt-Right while Breitbart exists as a watered-down &quot;Alt Light?&quot; Is Bannon an oblivious fool to not consider how such a concept might be viewed? Does he view the Alt Right as useful idiots who happen to be on the same side of many debates, or does he personally subscribe to their ideals and their vision for America?  </p>

<p>What does Bannon mean when he says he wants to &quot;smash the state?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a Leninist.&quot; Considering the use of high quality propaganda and the demonization campaigns of all opposition, as well as his skills with political rhetoric, the influence is apparent. Beyond that, Lenin knew that a full revolution would only be possible when every aspect of the previous state was destroyed and utterly replaced with the new system, and took numerous invasive and devious steps to achieve this, including enlisting criminal enterprises and the most radical factions of his time because they all served his ultimate cause, all ends justified all means. </p>

<p>It is my assertion that Bannon aims to totally dismantle the social safety net and any government assistance (aside from that bestowed to already thriving and powerful industry titans), continue a campaign of casting liberalism and so called cultural marxism as a national anti-patriotic threat, continue labeling all critical media as &quot;the opposition,&quot; and pushing for the adoption of a full US police and surveillance state under the guise of &quot;national security.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, but we should take some time to objectively look at our apparent allies of the moment as well. I think Trump is more or less what he appears to be. But we should be highly critical of anyone that has a great deal of influence over him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People keep talking about &quot;how does he have all this time to do all these terrible things?&quot; Well, as we all know, George Soros is a shape shifting lizard man from Planet X which is closers to the Earth than the moon, but is invisible and does not respond to the laws of gravity. This is established. But have you ever seen how fast a cold blooded reptilian creature can move while exposed to the sun? That is how George Soros is able to play these convoluted gambits that would put even the chaos god, Tzeentch, to same.</p>
