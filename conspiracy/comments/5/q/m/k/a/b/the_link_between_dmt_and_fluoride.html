        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was reading this thread: 
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qi92p/fbi_documents_weve_been_visited_by_beings_from/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qi92p/fbi_documents_weve_been_visited_by_beings_from/</a>
and a bunch of people are like &quot;Just try DMT and see the beings for yourself lol&quot;</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard of DMT, so I looked it up, and came to this Vice article: 
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dmt-you-cannot-imagine-a-stranger-drug-or-a-stranger-experience-365">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dmt-you-cannot-imagine-a-stranger-drug-or-a-stranger-experience-365</a>
(If you don&#39;t know about DMT, I&#39;d recommend reading it, since the rest of this post will probably not make much sense to you if you don&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Near the end, the author (who has smoked DMT many times before) of a book on DMT had a theory: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pineal gland—which is &quot;unique in its solitary status in the brain,&quot; in that all the other parts of the brain are paired—may be where DMT is produced in the human body: &quot;The most general hypothesis is that the pineal gland produces psychedelic amounts of DMT at extraordinary times in our lives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also brings up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pineal gland of older life forms, like lizards, is called &quot;the &#39;third&#39; eye&quot; and has a lens, cornea, and retina. As life evolved, the pineal moved deeper into the brain. Finally: &quot;The human pineal gland is not actually part of the brain. Rather, it develops from specialized tissues in the roof of the fetal mouth. From there it migrates to the center of the brain, where it seems to have the best seat in the house.&quot;
and
&quot;The pineal gland &quot;becomes visible in the developing fetus&quot; at 49 days, The Tibetan Book of the Dead &quot;teaches that it takes forty-nine days for the soul of the recently dead to &#39;reincarnate,&#39;&quot; and forty-nine days, Strassman wrote, is &quot;nearly exactly the moment in which one can clearly see the first indication of male or female gender.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I made the connection.</p>

<p>Since humans have two eyes, we have stereoscopic vision and depth perception, we can see in 3 dimensions. The pineal gland is sometimes called the &quot;third eye&quot;, so what if this DMT-secreting gland is an eye to the 4th dimension, where the beings are? Taking DMT could send this gland into overdrive, creating a window to another dimension. This would explain why DMT users all have similar experiences; its not a trip, it&#39;s a window. The chemical of DMT is also linked to dreaming, which brings up the topics of lucid dreaming and astral projection. </p>

<p>Alright, so here&#39;s the theory: The government is putting fluoride into the water in an attempt to stop us from being aware of the 4th dimension, for some reason.
I know, that even sounds a little out there to me (and I&#39;m writing it!), but just think about it. At a minimum, it gives a motive for the government putting fluoride into the water.</p>

<p>In Summary: FBI&#39;s inter-dimensional being paper described things similar to the effects of DMT, which is produced in the pineal gland, the area of the brain called &quot;the third eye&quot;. We know that the pineal gland is calcified by fluoride, which is put into the water by the government for seemingly no reason.</p>

<p>A few things about this post: 
1. This idea may already be on this subreddit, but I haven&#39;t heard of it until now. 
2. I didn&#39;t cite anything about the pineal gland and fluoride, because I think that they&#39;re pretty generally accepted by the people that frequent this subreddit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I missed something or I could be completely wrong, I&#39;m just spitballing here.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was literally having this conversation today and I fully agree. They stifle our pineal gland in order to maintain dominance over us. Getting in touch with your deities in the way of DMT might be a way to reach self enlightenment, or at the very least, a way to be more at peace with your self. They don&#39;t want this. They want turmoil, so they stifle our ability or desire to get in touch with our selves thru meditation or dmt trips. We would be able to visit the 4d astral plane and either, combat them in their astral form which might make it easier to rebel in the 3d world also, or at least give us the confidence to again believe in our own abilities. There are things you can do to begin to de-calcify your pineal gland, some mild, some extreme. From what few things I&#39;ve done, it does seem to help and I almost literally feel like I&#39;m at a higher vibrational energy after doing some of the &#39;exercises&#39; or whatever. I know I sound crazy. I don&#39;t care anymore. Sorry for the rant, tired and can&#39;t sleep before work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more of a way to say &quot;beings that inhabit a higher dimension of space&quot; which could loosely fit the definition of deities for some people. I would prefer to think of them as elements of the universe that play just as important a role as us, but are perhaps a more evolved form of life in the universe, either made of matter like us, or a manifestation of energy, which is basically just matter moving really really fast. Moreover I think that the universe itself it equivalent with divinity so while these organisms are dieties, so are we and so is everything else in the universe; as it&#39;s all part of an infinity. This is just my personal belief though, you&#39;re free to interpret it however you want. I personally have never used DMT or any psychadelic, but I&#39;m excited to do so in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bit of a nitpicky detail but phi/pi/e are constants, not variables, that give our universe it&#39;s properties. But aside from that you&#39;re right! I like to sometimes think about what the universe would be like if Pi were different or if the speed of light was twice as fast. It makes me think that maybe there&#39;s a continuum of universes where these constants are different (as some of them are irrational numbers, it would need to be an infinite continuum). I mean, shit, scientists have yet to figure out what the <em>shape</em> of our universe is. If you haven&#39;t already, you should check out <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>, there&#39;s a lot of interesting information and speculation about the nature of space and time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, given my predilection for Freudian slips, how about think about this...what if those supposed constants are actually variables?  I mean, we DON&#39;T know what the values are for them, until we discover them.  What if those values change upon discovery?  Think the double-slit experiment.  However, as a hard counter to that argument, maybe that is why some drawings/paintings/etc. are considered more beautiful than others, because they adhere to those constants more closely than others.  Like Mondrian&#39;s golden ratio works (my mother&#39;s got one in her dining room...not an original by any means).  I&#39;m not in any way denigrating free-form art or jazz or anything like that, but sacred geometry type art simply has broader appeal because it is instantly recognizable and speaks to everyone.  But the more you stray away from it, the more varied peoples&#39; tastes become.  Personally, maybe BOTH sides of the argument can be true.  I don&#39;t discount anything in this day and age.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you&#39;re absolutely right. I have a quantum physics book (like a laymans guide to quantum physics, it&#39;s very broad) that describes the superposition principle and how it could technically apply to anything in the universe that is unobserved. To answer the age old question: if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Until it is observed it is in a superposition of the state of standing and the state of falling. Once it is observed it collapses the wavefunction into one of the two states. Put simply, the answer is no. It doesn&#39;t make a sound from the standpoint of quantum mechanics. </p>

<p>Although I would argue that The constants are in fact constant, at least in this universe because they are the same even before we discover them. Pi was always 3.1416... before it was proven to be the ratio of the diameter to the circumference. But I could be wrong, I&#39;m with you on not discounting anything. I like to live in a world where anything is possible, and it&#39;s important to remain open minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I was not aware of that idea of superposition.  Maybe God can hear the tree in the forest even though no one else does.  But in the physical realm, the answer is probably no.  Simple cause and effect does dictate that if a tree does fall in a forest, it should make a sound when it strikes the ground.  It is very possible though, that it does not hit the ground at all, but gets cushioned when falling and is nearly silent.  If sound is just vibration, though, maybe even the smallest of noises has a ripple effect and thus is &quot;heard&quot;, just maybe not with conventional &quot;ears&quot;.  It&#39;s just like saying &quot;yes, no, maybe so&quot;.  Yes is a one, no is a zero, maybe so is the superposition (observer effect and all that).  So the tree has two states, standing and falling, but the real answer is just &quot;maybe so&quot;.  Trees DO fall in forests with no one around all the time, and I would tend toward thinking that they do make a sound intuitively, but that doesn&#39;t make it so.  </p>

<p>And I do agree on constants.  I am a tutor, and I recently talked to a student of mine about Pythagorean triplets.  Most students know 3,4,5, and on a website someone posted the thought experiment of why it isn&#39;t 1,2,3.  Because math doesn&#39;t work that way, obviously.  But perhaps less obvious is that the triplet 1,2, 5<sup>1/2</sup> implies that even though we can measure the hypotenuse, we cannot exactly know its value, and must estimate.  If we had infinitely small calipers, we could measure it, but otherwise it is an approximation.  And the implications of irrational numbers pervades every part of physics.  I&#39;m not well read in physics, but maybe that lends credence to the holographic universe, because what we see and experience is but an approximation of the true reality of things.  I feel like I am preaching to the choir, but it&#39;s still fun to think about.  </p>

Humans have sooooo much potential but we&#39;re put into a system that intoxicates all of our true instincts.</p>

<p>I think it ties in with spirituality and karma but also meats/cheeses have these excess fats that curdle in our brains vs pure veggies/grains that are mostly water &amp; what not, so there&#39;s a science behind it too. I haven&#39;t eaten meat in six months and my mind and body feel so much better in many different ways.</p>

<p>The mild ones were like tapping the back of your head in certain spots for example. The extreme would be like bathing in fluoride free water regularly.</p>

However, I did it as a part of meditation and overall felt good, happy, <em>aligned?</em>, and calm afterwards I&#39;d say. At the time I wasn&#39;t regularly meditating, but I had before so it wasn&#39;t entirely new at all. I&#39;m aware I have nothing to prove it with or anything, but I do feel like I felt a different sensation after having tried the few things I did to de-calcify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DMT is a very heavy psychological drug. Way more powerful than shrooms and acid. There&#39;s a great(idk if it&#39;s still on Netflix) but it&#39;s about DMT and explains a lot about it. </p>

<p>I would say the only way to unlock DMTs true potential is to make a tea and being in a very spiritual place. Doing DMT was never meant to be done in doors or in the city but rather in a place that&#39;s open, where you can just think and be enlightened. A lot of people that have psychological problems in their lives claim to be free from their problems afterwards. Your mind has to be open to the point any idea, good or bad, is an idea and an enlightenment of the mind. This is why so much stuff produces radiation, and if it&#39;s not synthetic it&#39;s bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only imagine how good DMT can be. Even psilocybin is amazing. It ripped me out of a decade long depression I was in, in my 20s. There really should be places in every city where you can trip balls under the guidance of a shaman or something. But I assume big pharma wouldn&#39;t allow that because their SSRI&#39;s would see a major decline in sales. We the people really need to lobby for this type of thing. It would be for the betterment of mankind. Could you imagine a world where every single person had a profound psychedelic experience at just the right moment in their life? It just might be a different world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are places like this. The documentary i talked about that talks about DMT says how there is a place in south america up in the mountains that do this. Honestly if you have the room sweat lodge would be great too. The thing with bedroom trips is theyre not &quot;enlightening&quot; idk at least to me. Doing psychedelics in a bedroom is way different than doing it on a hike up a mountain where your peak is at the top of the mountain. I fortunately live somewhere like this and its wonderful every once and awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re acting like they are the same compounds and will have the same end result and exactly the same profiles when consumed, this is not the case. Sodium fluoride is denser. Potassium also reacts violently with water so would most likely turn back into F- quicker than sodium fluoride. This is also why sodium fluoride is safer than potassium fluoride at higher doses, but you&#39;ll never find that much potassium fluoride naturally. I am not sure, but I would assume that would mean sodium fluoride has a longer time to slowly react and cause calcification/remineralization and why it is actually less toxic, because it reacts slower. </p>

<p>And yeah, but you aren&#39;t going to eat Villiaumite. I&#39;ve never heard of it in food stuff or water naturally, only potassium fluoride is universally found in those things, as far as I know.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my trip report after the first time I smoked it. </p>

<p>After months of research, and sitting on 250mgs for three months I finally decided I was going to take the plunge. I&#39;m in my 30&#39;s and have had decent experience with psychedelics (LSD, 2CB, 2CI, 4-ACO-DMT, Shrooms), and have always had a deep respect for DMT. I knew I would only do it when I was ready, and that time had come.</p>

<p>I prepared 50mgs and sat in a comfortable chair in my living room. I had Pretty Lights (a standard for tripping for me) on in the background, and my wife sitting across from me to observe/trip sit.</p>

<p>After the first hit the room started to look funny, like the plastic wrap filter in photoshop. After the second hit the room was covered with a transparent veil made up of rotating diamonds. In each diamond it was like I could see into the controlled chaos behind reality. As the smoke from the second hit passed over my lips the smoke contrails turned into ever expanding fractals as the plasticky smelling smoke filled the room. I had tunnel vision at this point and thought to myself &quot;one more hit&quot;. I put it to my lips and got all the last of it, this was the last thing I remember while I was still in my body.</p>

<p>I felt pulled sideways, as I was blasted out of my body I turned around and could see myself taking the last hit. It was clear as day; it was me, in my clothes, in my living room. I could see myself from a third person view. At the time I was too confused and being pulled away to fast to comprehend what was happing at the time, but now thinking about it later it was a very powerful experience.</p>

<p>As I was racing through space/time; with fractals all around, ever growing and shrinking, I had an extreme feeling of déjà vu. I had been here before, I had seen this before, I had felt this before. It all felt so familiar, it felt like being welcomed home. Speaking of the feeling... Wow.</p>

<p>I could no longer feel my body. I could not feel myself breathing. More than that, I didn&#39;t even remember what my body and breathing was supposed to feel like. It was gone, complete disassociation. I felt like pure energy, I felt like love. I felt an incredible vibration through everything I was. It was like I could feel all of the electrons and protons that were in my &quot;body&quot; spinning at almost the speed of light. It was all I felt, all I was... A vibration. It felt amazing.</p>

<p>After the tunnel of fractals I slowed down and caught a glimspe into what looked like the machine behind reality. It was millions and billions of interlocking gears all spinning at impossible speeds. This only lasted a short while before i moved into a scene that looked like this: <a href="http://imgur.com/CyDSm">http://imgur.com/CyDSm</a> (or this is at least the best representation I could find online). </p>

<p>Everything was moving, growing, and splitting all to the music I had on. It was impossibly complex.
At this point I realized; these weren&#39;t just visuals, I was there. It really felt like I was there. The visuals had a presence. There was a voice in my head that was there for a while now telling me &quot;everything will be ok, just observe, you are safe&quot;. I felt like I was being watched. It felt slightly ominous, but not bad.
I realized that the visuals were not just colors and patterns, the visuals were an entity and it was trying to communicate with me. At first I felt like it was laughing AT me, but somehow understood that it was just happy to see me. It was with that thought I started to come down.</p>

<p>My eyes slowly opened looking at the cieling. It was made up of spinning transparent triangles, red dots, and purple line. I still felt the body vibration but it lessened as every moment passed. I couldn&#39;t move for a minute or so, just sat there getting used to being in my body again. It was like I forgot how to lift my arms or legs for a second. I got up, hugged my wife and told her about my experience. I was happy to be home.</p>

<p>Time was non existent while I was there. It is very hard to estimate as time didn&#39;t exist there. When I woke up here it felt like I had lost time, kind of like waking up from anesthesia. It felt like a second, but it had been 7 minutes.
It was less &quot;difficult&quot; than I expected it to be. It was overwhelmingly positive, and I had no anxiety. I am really excited to do it again, but want to give it some time to fully integrate my experience</p>

<p>TL;DR Definitely did some drugs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically what the guy commented, but even that description doesn&#39;t really do it justice.  Everything he said is in &#39;analogy-form&#39; so that it makes sense in text.</p>

<p>I think it was McKenna who said something along the lines of &quot;The DMT flash is the volume of what sex is the surface area to&quot;.  That +  it feels related to dreams/dreaming and there is a component of &quot;aliens&quot; if you will mixed in it.  All of that in 5-10 minutes which feels like a few hours.   I don&#39;t really like getting into the description though because it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; to capture it in verbal/text form.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: smoke dmt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;d have to compare &quot;awakeness&quot; between similar populations though - and you&#39;d need to figure out some kind of metric...which is probably a very difficult task. What I mean is that populations wouldn&#39;t necessarily manifest as third eye, aura-seeing gurus, but it could manifest in smaller ways.</p>

<p>Here, I found this interesting graph:</p>

<p><a href="http://religionnews.com/2014/01/27/great-decline-religion-united-states-one-graph/">http://religionnews.com/2014/01/27/great-decline-religion-united-states-one-graph/</a></p>

<p>It shows a decline in the &quot;Religiousity Index&quot; in the USA starting in the mid-1950&#39;s. And guess when fluoridation became official policy in the States? 1951.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t proof by any means, but it is an interesting correlation, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take me as arguing. This is just interesting to me.</p>

<p>Btw, about DMT - yes, I know what you mean quite well. ;)</p>

<p>As for the tones. Notice the mandalas with them? Another theory of mine is that the mandalas and the chants that guide their creation are road maps to the other dimensions. I also think some of them are what I call hippie traps.</p>

<p>Hard to say for sure,though. There&#39;s so much dis/misinformation out there that it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s bullshit and what isn&#39;t anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you may be able to see some interesting things on DMT, ultimately its effects are limited in time and the after effects will linger afterwards, resulting in an overall decrease in vitality. So using it once or twice as a gateway to expanded perception and consciousness may be fine but ultimately you have to do the hard work of hours of meditation, eating healthily, exercising regularly, etc to really change your consciousness on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>Its important to remember living in the matrix that the &quot;alternative&quot; option presented to you is also usually part of the psyop - the purpose of which is to keep you docile and remove your ability to think critically so that you cannot see the forces controlling you. This current wave of &quot;DMT is the answer!&quot; is the exact same trick they played on the hippies with LSD 40 years ago. As you can see with the current state of affairs it was highly effective.</p>
