<p>The number one comment has only 3 total comments in his entire history, Worldnews, altright, and that comment.</p>

<p>First response to that is &quot;TheLiberalLover&quot; who bought <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5n8z88/megathread_intelligence_report_claims_russia_has/dc9muzv/">shares that Trump will be impeached</a>.

<p>They all speak the exact same way - that hyper arrogant, transparently manipulative attempt to control &quot;objective&quot; discussion. </p>

<p>People who are interested in conspiracies don&#39;t spend so much time demanding that other people see something as a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Partisan hacks that want their political viewpoint to dominate the entire site, however, do spend a lot of time claiming that their narrative is the <em>true</em> conspiracy and thus anyone who disagrees must be a Donald or Russian shill. </p>

They&#39;ve (MSM) has gotten quite cocky and aren&#39;t even trying to cover it up anymore and the amount of people buying it is appalling.

<p>Conde Nast doesn&#39;t want the same thing for reddit that you want. It is a privately held company with a specific agenda.  If you  think that&#39;s ever going to change, you need more red-pilling than you are going to get here.</p>

<p>Did you see r.politics the day after the election? It was back to what I remember. Debate, people actually being able to call things out, multiple viewpoints all mixing together (rather) peacefully, no huge downvote gang-ups...It was honestly pretty great.</p>

<p>For like... A day.</p>

<p>I understand that reddit leans left. So do I, but with a huge skidmark of cynicism. That is currently <em>beyond</em> absent in r.politics; once again. It honestly looks manufactured. </p>

<p>R.politics is supposed to be a mixed bag. T_D is an intentional Trump circle-jerk. Which is fine. This sub is a horse of a different color. The shit stirring during this election has caused a lot of crossover with T_D crowd because the DNC and Clinton gave us a lot of shit to work with honestly. A lot of us don&#39;t like Clinton because there are a ludicrous amount of sketchy things to look into.</p>

<p>But. This Newspeak from the MSM (fake news etc)? The constant barrage of anti-trump on every sub besides this one and T_D (PissGate was the ONLY time I&#39;ve seen this sub hit the FP)? The militant push back against PedoGate from said MSM?  At least PedoGate grew naturally. PissGate reeks of astroturfing (fake grassroots).</p>

<p>This post has gone on too long. But my point is; the core of this sub is totally still here. We question everything and form our own conclusion. Brigading this sub is only going to stir the shit-pot. We are going to wonder why it happened and dig in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% right. It should be r/t_d vs r/lib or r/Hillary. R/pol is given a huge bump by being a default that by name should be about <em>all</em> politics. Which it was before this election. Reddit allows them to benefit as a default because it is their narrative and they don&#39;t care.  </p>

<p>To any of us who have been here for a long time, it is completely obvious. When t_d started coming here it was because of all the leaks by Seth rich and the overwhelming flood of corruption coming out of the left. Anything worth mentioning conspiracy wise about Trump was absolutely entertained here and discussed.  </p>

<p>Now there is a clear agenda by the r/pol crowd to try and flood this sub with misdirection and not any actual conspiracies. It&#39;s just whining. And it does nothing but show that Brock is ineffective without the collusion of the reddit admins. </p>

Look at the front page on any given day here and you can see the bias.

<p>great -- i&#39;ve vaporized dmt while peaking on ayahuasca,  [intramuscularly] injected it with ketamine and 2C-B mixed in to the shot, vaporized it while peaking on lsd, vaporized it in combination with salvinorin-a enhanced salvia divinorum leaf and methamphetamine immediately after an intramuscular injection of ketamine, et cetera</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be fine with that if the sub didn&#39;t completely suppress discussion on the trump dossier. A foreign government colluding with a candidate and his staff to get him elected in exchange for ownership rights in a state-owned oil company? Russians having leverage over our new president and having the &quot;strong-man&quot; president be screwing with all of our allies except for Russia who he has decided to remove sanctions on for no stated reason. </p>

<p>On top of that the former KGB general who helped put together the dossier was found murdered in his car. Why does this sub not care about that? Even if not proven yet it is prime conspiracy material! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dossier that was confirmed fake. That Obama questioned. That was 100% manufactured bullshit. The only thing that dossier did and was supposed to do was further divide the people and to discredit pizza gate.</p>

<p>There is so much evidence that you have to just not look at to accept there isn&#39;t something fishy going on that demands an investigation. It was NEVER debunked, NEVER investigated, and while MSM and online &#39;shills&#39;, whether they be real shills or just ignorant, continue to push this narrative that nothing is going on that there is no need to look into anything.</p>

<p>James Alefantis&#39; Instagram profile picture is a sculpture of Antinous the child lover of Emperor Hadrian.</p>

<p>Alefantis isn&#39;t just some random guy who owns a pizza shop, he is one of the &#39;50 most powerful people in Washington DC.&#39;</p>

<p>Besta Pizza from across the street had a known pedophile symbol in its logo which was removed when pizzagate broke. This same symbol appears in one of the Sex Stains music videos where the entire song is joking about pedophilia. This band happens to be a regular at Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong is specifically mentioned many times throughout the leaked emails.</p>

<p>After known child trafficker, Laura Silsby, was caught and arrested for child trafficking in Haiti. Hillary Clinton personally went to solve the matter and none of the people involved ended up serving any substantial amount of time.</p>

<p>The &#39;crazy shooter&#39; that went to investigate Comet Ping Pong some businesses saying there wasn&#39;t a shooting others saying there was. Somehow managed to shoot Comet Ping Pongs only computer and put a bullet right through the hard-drive. </p>

<p>The &#39;investigation&#39; that debunked pizzagate and any potential ties to comet ping pong never happened.</p>

<p>This is just scratching the surface. There is so much substantial evidence that there needs to be a formal investigation. If Donald Trump is involved then fine, give me some evidence. The only thing I&#39;ve heard is that he is also involved with Epstein, but it&#39;s basically impossible to verify these claims. However, perhaps a formal investigation could be done and we could find out who is involved and who isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I hope that all of this is a lie and none of it is real; however, there have been cases of things like this happening all over the world all throughout history and I would like for an investigation that proves with out a doubt that our government is not involved in these kinds of acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I would say that I&#39;m not threatened by it at all. However, I do find myself mildly disappointed when I open a post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> only to find that the comments section is merely a bunch of people accusing a seemingly invisible, or barely represented, enemy of holding them back from discussing the topic. It seems, to me, that they are more interested in a back and forth war against partisanship than actually discussing the subject matter.</p>

<p>I once found the comments sections here to be very engaging with people discussing conspiracy theories, rather than just accusing each other of bias on each theory that arises, while taking little to no time to actually advance the discussion on the theory itself.</p>

<p>I disagree. I think you should revisit this conversation from the beginning. Please feel free to enlighten me on how you drew such a conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The subject matter itself is irrelevant to /conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subject matter of conspiracy theories is irrelevant to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t follow that logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t need another sub being infected with American partisan conspiracies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well then we should seek equally to discourage the sub of being overrun with either pro or anti Trump bias. When a conspiracy theory involving Trump is suggested, perhaps neither &quot;No it can&#39;t be true, it&#39;s Trump&quot; or &quot;Well this will get downvoted because everyone here is a Trump shill&quot; (which, by the way, gets massively upvoted and posted over and over again) is not the way to achieve this. Instead, the way to achieve it is to talk about something you just said is irrelevant, the actual subject matter of the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at my comment history. I am a Liberal in my outlook on life and I don&#39;t particularly care for Trump and his policies. And yet I feel comfortable on r/conspiracy. I feel that as long as we remain sceptical about everything that comes from msm and politicians we are being true to the sprit of this sub. </p>

<p>And yes, there are blatantly partisan political posts (both ways), but it seems less than a couple of weeks ago already. Also, not responding to these types of posts are the quickest way to make them go away. </p>

<p>If a post reaches r/all front page, and we briefly appear on the radar, then we should expect a circle jerk from politics or t_d to appear. Yes, that happens, but let them have their pigeon debate and strut off. No worries, no skin off my nose if they want to continue to believe in the integrity of whatever passes for &quot;real news&quot; these days. </p>

<p>Maybe a few will read further and start looking into things. For the rest...who the fuck cares?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually been here for a while as a lurker. Only commenting cause I believe it to be hypocritical to not consider this big picture (current president lying about past associations and current influences) when the third highest post this month was laughing about CNN getting the title of least trusted network. Because that&#39;s totally bigger picture right? Tobacco companies lying about e-cigarettes so that the surgeon general can make an extra $500k is totally big picture but the possibility of the current president of the United States having unethical ties to Russia and using foreign influence in the United States isnt. Thanks for informing me that the sub I&#39;ve been lurking for the last 2 years is nothing but a bunch of child hypocrites who can&#39;t stand opposing views.</p>

<p>You act as if those things aren&#39;t discussed amongst people regularly in their own time. It sounds like you&#39;re in your first year of philosophy in college and followed that up with your first shroom trip. That stuff is great and it really helps to bring things into perspective but what you&#39;re suggesting is that I idol these people or that these other people idol them. That isnt true at all people are trying to find answers to serious questions that affect real people.</p>

<p>By all means continue your journey but don&#39;t tell people this stuff doesn&#39;t matter when it has real affect on peoples lives.</p>

<p>PS: I would suggest truffles for your next trip, brings a lot into perspective, especially the importance of your surroundings.</p>

<p>Theory; CTR was running hard until CGI started closing offices. The money is running out so US shills might be out of work.</p>

<p>Those funding the shilling have had to downsize and off shore the work (welcome to IT support in North America). Shilling is now provided by bodies in India manning old CTR accounts or using newly purchased ones. Vote manipulation is also off shore.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed all of the suspicious activity lately has been occuring when the US is asleep and India wide awake. Shilling is also possible from Europe too I supposed as there is some cheap IT labor to be found there in the midnight hours also.</p>

<p>Quick commentary. I think you guys are nuts for believing in pizzagate, but outright dissmissing Trump having Russia ties. Its like you guys cling on the most absurd ideas, but when an actual conspiracy that is plain is day comes around, you all turn into the most conservative skeptics. Weird bunch you are. </p>

<p>There is not a single shred of connection between Peterson and the Clintons, but a third party claiming she criticized the Clinton Foundation. So it&#39;s not even proven that she disliked the Clinton Foundation, but even if she did, so do millions of other people. </p>

<p>Seth Rich was a DNC staffer that was murdered.  Every other connection was conection completely whole cloth. </p>

<p>Millions of people have Clinton connections if you&#39;re gonna make the claim that a connection is as little as someone claiming they wrote about the Clintons on facebook.  Out of millions some will die. This is called math. </p>

<p>You make all those ridiculous connections yet you completely dismiss the murder of a KGB agent you leaked info on Trump. Again, you are crazy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an old saying &#39;round these parts..</p>

<p><em>&quot;Get outta here with yer fancy logic!&quot;</em> </p>

<p>I really wish it weren&#39;t true, but alas, a majority of this sub only browses and posts to further self-indoctrinate themselves with ideas that the sky is falling, the economy will crash and WW3 will kick off any day now.  Kay, seriously, I&#39;ve been hearing this since I started looking into &#39;conspiracy&#39; back in &#39;08.  In 2009 it was being shouted from the rooftops that martial law is coming any day now, and that the supposed FEMA camps will be opening their doors.  8 years later and we&#39;re still hearing the same bullshit and <em>nothing has fucking happened</em> except the pot of water feels a bit warmer now.</p>

<p>These are the kinds of ideas that are making this sub look foolish - repeating the same fucking parrot phrases over and over and over.  There are actual quality posts and people here - George Webb is looking through only facts, not any speculation, and has presented a very, <em>very</em> informative series of videos digging into the corruption of the DNC, etc.  There was a post recently where someone found financial ties between Putin and Trump - real conspiracy.</p>

<p>TL;dr - the signal-to-noise here is absolutely terrible so you have to sift to find the good shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that even if Trump did business with Russia, or was friends with Putin, it would still be a distraction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saudi Arabia&#39;s participation in financing 911 <a href="https://28pages.org/">was exposed</a> by a US congressional report recently declassified.</p></li>
<li><p>We know from Hillary Clinton herself that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.</p></li>

<li><p>With US weapons and support, Saudi Arabia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen">is prosecuting a vicious war</a> of aggression against its neighbor Yemen</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These obese savage wahhabi kinglets are &quot;our trusted friends and allies&quot;, and nobody criticizes them. </p>

<p>No, we&#39;re rather all about criticizing Russia, after having destabilized many of its neighbors, supported islamist insurgency in Chechnya, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7sJtv">circled them</a> with military installations. true there is a very strong historical imperialist/neocon russophobic current in the US. </p>

<p>You see, the hegemonists want to avoid at all costs the continental Berlin/Moscow/Beijing axis from forming (hence the recent destabilization of Ukraine, Europe being imposed to sanction Russia, etc.); such an Eurasian &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">world island</a>&quot; would undermine the influence of the Anglo-American maritime empire. Brzezinski explained it well in his book <em>The Grand Chessboard</em>. </p>

<p>Most of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet is based in Ukraine, and his been since the 18th century:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet</a></p>

<p>So, should Russia have been indifferent when the US pushed the overthrow of Ukrainian government? In what world are the naval facilities in Crimea not considered a valid strategic concern for Russia?</p>

<p>If the tables were turned, how would the US react? If it had a base in a neighboring country, like Mexico, and the Russians staged a coup in Mexico, would the US just roll with that? That&#39;s fine, keep the base? I hope you understand they would not, and in fact that&#39;s exactly why the US held the Guantanamo Naval Base despite the Cuban Revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically right now, <em>Donald Trump</em> is involved in a high profile <em>Political Conspiracy</em>. This means that you are going to find a large number of crossover between the conspiracy, politics and Trump subreddits.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that a lot of the <em>Trump is a Russian Agent</em> stuff is too speculative for the regular news and political forums, so it ends up here with the UFO sightings and Philadelphia Experiments.</p>

<p>Now, as I said this is pretty high profile. This means that a lot of people are interested in it. A lot more than the usual fringe theories* that are discussed here. From your perspective I guess it must look quite weird to see a sudden influx of people who do not share your outlook and try to challenge it, but think about it, it&#39;s a pretty natural thing. Like some athletics subreddit filling up with traffic when the Olympics are on.</p>

<p>Look at things from the other perspective. The Russian stuff, while speculative, has a lot of legs. Follow the money, look at who is being put in power and what they stand to gain from lifting sanctions. Imagine that you are thinking about these things and you come and post here. </p>

<p>The Russian stuff is flagged as unverified. Nothing else seems to be flagged as unverified. Not the cheese pizza = child porn stuff, not the reptiles control the monarchy stuff. There&#39;s a high scoring thread where a guy is blaming Obama for Trump not keeping the White House complaint-line open. Put yourself in their shoes and think about what this place looks like.</p>

<p>When I said <em>Look at things from the other perspective</em>.

They get here and they see all these threads on the front page discussing unverified subjects, but only the Trump-Russia thread is marked as &quot;unverified&quot;, and all these people are trying to shout them down and call them shills for trying to discuss it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? who are you to determine what people can to discuss or not? If there is evidence (which there is) then that post had every single right to be up and you as a user here have no right to tell those people they don&#39;t belong. They have every right to discuss what was in that article. Its not up to you to decide which conspiracies are worthy of discussing or not. </p>

<p>Also I ddin&#39;t see a single person in that thread talk about how that was the only real conspiracy on this sub. Many were just shocked that there were as many connections between Trump and Russia as I was. Especially considering that it sounds almost exactly like what happened with Seth Rich and people here love to talk about him as a savior but apparently even though these situations have a lot in common its nothing but a bunch of liberal propaganda perpetuated by r/politics. You know the exact same thing the liberals are saying the deal is with TD and Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Right, and then they&#39;re punished for breaking the rules. Unlike Politics, which has been brigading this sub with hyperpartisan whining for weeks. </p>

<p>As far as who I support, I love that you think your rhetorical kafkatrap (the fact that you deny being a Trump supporter proves you are one whether you admit it or not!!!) carries more weight than my actual post history.</p>

<p>You guys and your desperate need to control the narrative is exactly what led to Donald fucking Trump becoming president, and yet you&#39;re still blaming everyone else.</p>

<p>Sorry, but you don&#39;t have actual evidence of that. It could simply be that longtime subreddit lurkers, like me, are fed up with T_D users infiltrating this site and turning it into another pro-Trump cesspool.</p>

<li><p>July 22, 2016 - Wikileaks dumps the DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, helping hold down Clinton&#39;s favorability<a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/nypost_20160726_brxp-1_001.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;strip=all"> among an incensed left</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rocking-the-vote-the-effects-of-cyber-activity-on-the-u-s-election/">boosting Trump&#39;s RNC bump</a> while holding Clinton to her lowest polling of the cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>July 27, 2016 - Trump tells the press that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-crimea/493280/">he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia and &quot;jokingly&quot; instructs Russia to continue to hack Clinton &quot;if they&#39;re listening.&quot;</a> It would be his last press conference of the election.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, of course, we know that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hacking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.2431a5e9ccd1">was directed by Russia to help Trump win the election</a>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>What has the Trump team been up to since then?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Carter Page is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> He&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/europe/carter-page-donald-trump-moscow-russia.html">continued to visit Moscow</a> in spite of that investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>The man who most likely offered Page the deal to offer to Trump was found <a href="https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/tower-of-cards-part-1/">dead from gun shot wounds in the back of his car in Moscow in December.</a> The Russian state press has called his death a heart attack since the initial report (...in the back of his car, in an alley).</p></li>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">Paul Manafort, who left his official role as campaign chair last summer, is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> Manaffort reemerged after the election <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/30/torture-lobbyist-paul-manafort-still-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks.html">to advise Trump on cabinet positions...</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon-donald-trump.html">emerged as a dark horse candidate for Secretary of State shortly thereafter.</a> Tillerson has extensive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/12/15/trump-russia-exxon-tillerson/#662ae3e63a63">business ties to Russian oil and lobbied for a reduction in sanctions while at Exxon.</a> He has deep ties to the company that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/leak-rex-tillerson-director-bahamas-based-us-russian-oil-company">offered Carter Page the equity deal, along with his own $200M stock in Exxon that would benefit significantly from the lifting of sanctions, and has been awarded the Friend of Russia honor by Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Former military intelligence officer, and Trump&#39;s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Why-We-ll-Never-Know-What-We-Need-About-Trump-s-Most-Important-Adviser-Michael-Flynn">is under investigation for his communications with Russia following a December increase in sanctions by Pres. Obama.</a> The Trump team have defended those calls with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-must-come-cleanflynn-secret-russian-calls-547583">various conflicting explanations.</a> After getting kicked out of the Obama DIA for his insubordination and islamaphobia, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html?utm_term=.7bd3442c0278">Flynn - the veteran intelligence office, cozied up to Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally there is Trump advisor Roger Stone - a former <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960803,00.html">business partner to Paul Manafort</a> who cut his teeth in politics as one of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/?utm_term=.777ef7daf4dc">Nixon&#39;s  dirty trixsters.</a> Stone outed himself as a back-channel communicator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/trump-adviser-clinton-emails-wikileaks-roger-stone">between Wikileaks&#39;s Assagne and the Trump campaign</a> back in November. In his spare time before the election, Stone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim">led the charge to cement the election as rigged in case of a Clinton victory.</a> He is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html">under investigation by US intelligence</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>During the campaign many described <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-16/former-cia-chief-calls-trump-moscow-s-useful-idiot">Trump as a useful idiot of Russia</a>. His actions since then may determine that an underestimation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump is <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316463-conway-lifting-russian-sanctions-under-consideration">speaking with Putin soon regarding the lifting of sanctions.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Leaks, unsubstantiated though given the above hardly far fetched, have <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">identified Trump as a Russian asset cultivated over at least the last five years.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Allegations have emerged that Russia has both the carrot of the oil money and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443752/trump-kompromat-story-its-all-disturbing">the stick of kompromat - incriminating evidence used as blackmail - to encourage Trump&#39;s pro-Putin action.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Russia has arrested two high ranking Russian cyber intelligence officials for treason - <a href="http://wccftech.com/fsb-official-us-spy-russia/">potentially because of their role as US spies.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A third Russian hacker is currently in a US-Russian tug of war while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/us-russia-hacking-yevgeniy-nikulin-linkedin-dropbox">in jail in Prague, with a potential connection to the Huma Abedin</a> emails that were discovered in October and which may have tipped the election to Trump.</p></li>
<li><p>Russian officials are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-intercepts-capture-senior-russian-officials-celebrating-trump-win/2017/01/05/d7099406-d355-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.f6dff8a035e8">celebrating the election of Trump and are joyous over their efforts to elect him.</a></p></li>
<li><p>John McCain laments that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/john-mccain-says-us-has-no-strategy-to-deal-with-russian-cyber-warfare">we have no unified response to Russian cyber-intrusion, which he likened to an act of war.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re getting fucked, royally, by a Trump-Putin alliance that is out for oil money and the destruction of western democracies. That&#39;s potentially why <a href="http://realtimepolitics.com/2017/01/13/breaking-rep-john-storms-out-of-trump-intel-briefing-trump-not-a-legitimate-president/">John Lewis</a> and other Democratic law makers who left a recent intel briefing on the Russian interference called Trump &quot;illegitimate&quot; and part of a Russian conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t take this in a confrontational way,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No problem. Asking a question makes it obvious that you&#39;re not a shill. I only hate on shills, not actual forum members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What patterns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Voting on reddit generally follows patterns. There&#39;s a lot to this, but once you understand it, you can spot it in a second.</p>

<p>As far as comments go, generally the top post is set within an hour or two, and does not change. As the post gets going, upvotes flow through the comments from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Example: after one hour:</p>

<p>Top post +10
Second Post +8
Third post +6</p>

<p>Two hours:</p>

<p>Top post: +20
Second post: +15
Third post +10</p>

<p>Four hours, post takes off and hits all:
Top post: +200
Second post +160
Third post: +120</p>

<p>Post does great, gets massive exposure. 24 hours later:</p>

<p>Top post +5000
Second post +4000
Third post +3700.</p>

<p>So, when you see a post that is 8 hours old, top post is +100, but then a 2 hour old post suddenly passes it, something is up. The post had upvote-bots released.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also shown you how to karma whore, if you&#39;re interested. The fact that I have almost 15,000 karma in a month and I&#39;m barely spending any time karma whoring (most posts in conspiracy, none in default subs) should tell you that I know what I&#39;m doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was. Your post had a normal voting pattern. Contrast it with that of the other posts.</p>

<p>One other important pattern is that Karma generally goes down as the comments progress. So, top response will have 5000, response will have like 2500, next response 1200, etc.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a break in this pattern, it&#39;s a really good post, or manipulation.</p>

<p>they are not brigading here, and that assertion is frankly outlandish.</p>

<p>was there a post on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> saying &quot;hey everyone, go to this thread!&quot;</p>

<p>no?</p>

<p>guess what, that thread about the KGB dude hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, so tens of thousands of people saw it, and so it got a ton of commenters that aren&#39;t regular users of this sub.</p>

<p>it&#39;s really not that complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always get negative karma every time I post on Politics, many times while trying to make legitimate points. The most irritating thing about this is that even though I try to make a good point with evidence, because I get downvoted so much- and this only happens in r/politics- I get on that posting timer which doesn&#39;t allow me to post for x amount of time. That really irritates me.</p>

<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that nothing in r/politics is fair or reasonable, and every interaction with that sub and the people within that sub will likely be negative- but nothing is ever done about it at all on Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is definitely a highly-biased community.  I have tried to point this out a few times or at least hold a mirror up to the community and I get downvoted as well.  Guess that&#39;s just how things are.  The thing is, the_donald is pretty much the same way, just on the opposite side obviously.  The reason these subs feel so unfair is the nature of how reddit works.  It lends itself to &quot;circlejerk&quot; type of behavior.  Political beliefs aside, one side isn&#39;t any better than the other when it comes to &quot;fairness&quot; and dissenting viewpoints.  What I&#39;m trying to say is everyone is so overzealous in both of these subs, we really need to tone it down a notch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two communities overlap. There are moderate conservatives, middle aligned / independent registered, and converted liberals and democrats existing in The_Donald. It&#39;s not a giant Conservative circlejerk like outsiders believe (some of it is but there&#39;s a lot of hate for Career Politicians of both sides, with right leaning views).</p>

<p>When people can admit they&#39;ve been manipulated and lied to they slowly make their way over to The_Donald, the next step from there is here.</p>

<p>I imagine you&#39;ll find irony in my last statement just like the &quot;pot calling the kettle black&quot; remark you posted above. My point is that if you focus on the vocal minority of a sub that is really about pushing buttons on their perceived opposition, you&#39;re being incredibly dismissive of the moderate middle of the road types existing there because it&#39;s all they have here on reddit given their personal ideologies are silenced in any other sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s r/politics vocal minority being backed by CTR that caused The_Donald to manifest. People who wanted to be able to discuss a topic or have an opposing view without being shilled out the door and shouted down needed a place to go.</p>
