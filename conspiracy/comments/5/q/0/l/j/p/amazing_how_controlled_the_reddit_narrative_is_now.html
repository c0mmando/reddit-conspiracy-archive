       I've been a user for over five years and while its been changing during that time I would say that the site is now under complete control of hard line progressive left ideology. And I would say that this has happened in full in just the last few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy itself has and is changing a lot and not necessarily for the better. I long for the days when this sub was only 38,000 strong and constantly laughed at. Though I will say it seems to have become the only place many important news stories are talked about and the least likely sub to delete posts or ban users for views that don't fit the progressive agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I am spending less and less time here and will soon probably abandon it all together once conspiracy goes full tilt.

       Thats the point though. To get us to split. Are you surprised that all this super left dumb shit are taught at college and school? School is essentially media for kids. Conditioning and social behavior are learned, dont have to be good or bad but its taught.

       I went to college and I have never had a political position pushed on me. I suppose it depends on the material or the degree, but for STEM there is too much scientific/maths material to cover to have your mind conditioned on some policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also working the split right now by saying "super left dumb shit are taught at college". If we aknowledge this problem, the only solution is to not use charged words and focus on arguing our position with facts and less opinion.

       So, a friend of mine said to me that my political thoughts were dictated by my professor. Like every class has a political agenda. I told him I never noticed it in my art classes, math class, biology class. I'm sure they sneak something somewhere in those art classes ha. You comment remind me about that conversation.

       Well the problem with the flat earth thing is that it further poisons the well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are, for instance, hundreds of folks who call themselves "truthers, they preach that 9/11 was an inside job - that explosives were planted in advance (which is correct) but then they pull themselves completely under and go on a pro-flat earth rant in public, on Youtube and their thousands of subscribers get trapped into this pit of deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have flat earthers who say that there were no planes at all at 9/11 which is really a bridge too far because they really needed real planes/drones in the press to be able to sell the story of the buildings going down. If no planes at all then how would the US gov. explain the buildings coming down?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I personally feel the level of critical thinking among activists and rebels is reaching an all-time low and not only here in r/Conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blinded Trump flock is not adding any quality to the subreddit as well, as was to be expected of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you one more example. Ask any Trump fan what algorithm warfare is about and how far it has evolved and who is a part of that and if you're lucky 2 out of 10 will have serious replies. The other 8 have never even heard of the term or concept yet it has been sabotaging their lives for at least the past 15 years.

       What do flat earthers have to do with 9/11? Ask anyone about algorithm warfare and you'd clearly be surprised by who knows what it's about. Thanks for proving my point though. gotta tie it to something that has to do with Trump and a narrative. Flat earth = 9/11= trumpers and algorithm warfare...

       He was saying that people who believe in Flat Earth theories are making alot of the other conspiracies seem crazier than they are so it dilutes our credibility. He's also saying the Trump supporters do the same thing because they refuse to see Trump in any negative light so its actively diluting others and their own perceptions of the matter.

       What's your experience with space? Ever visited low earth orbit? Ever seen the ISS? Ever circumnavigated the globe? Ever led an expedition to Antarctica? Why does Venus appear to be tidally locked with the earth? Why does a $300 million space craft (juno) only have a 2 MP camera? Why hasn't it sent more pictures?

       I mean... pretty much every scientist agrees gravity exists, obviously it's still somewhat of a mystery, but there are mathematical constants for it that work in every physics equation, so we know it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mirage? I'm not sure if you are joking. If not, that's a very unrealistic and quite ridiculous lol. This happens for everything, all the time. Not just one object here or there...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you're not arguing that the Earth is flat, then what are we being lied to about? You are confusing me. Everything in space, if left to itself, without outside forces (besides gravity of course) forms a sphere. Look at fire and water for example.

       What? I never said anything except it works in every math equation we've pretty much come up with... and recently even found gravity waves. I mean, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       one of the 4 dominant forces... any scientist will tell you. You have the strong force, electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravitational force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why you won't just answer the question... you say you are not here claiming the Earth is flat, yet you seem offended and now are defending it, and deflecting the conversation. So what exactly are we being lied to about? I agree NASA is a gatekeeper and lie about many things, I don't even think we went to the moon in a rocket in the 60's. So what in the world are you talking about then?

       Gravity is acceleration, we don't know what causes it. We have a theory that it's mass but it can't be verified. It's much more logical to assign gravity as a side effect of electromagnetic interactions.

       Maybe flat earth is to get us thinking about space. To most of us earth may as well be flat, and the sky a big dome. Tell me when was the last time you studied the cosmos? I don't mean watch some bullshit on discovery channel, or some "documentary" geared towards the lowest common denominator.

       Anyone else notice how
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       had a brief respite from the manipulation immediately after Trump won the election? There were even posts mentioning how "normal" it seemed at that time. It was like the manipulators needed a few days to regroup and come up with another game plan. And now that Trump is in office they have gone 1000% full tilt trying discredit Trump and his administration by any means possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone has shown me how unbelievably and easily just about all of the current social media platforms are manipulated to an agenda.

       It definitely backfired on me.  I used to spend an hour+ every day on r/politics.  Yes, it was left-leaning, but it was still rational.  Then there was a
       <em>
        noticeable and immediate
       </em>
       shift in the tone and quality of the posts.  Now I only go there to downvote.  But it's not like I stopped consuming anti-Hillary news, I just found other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number of times I visited the_donald before the takeover?  Literally never.  Number of times afterwards? Nearly every day.  The result is that I've developed a much more sympathetic view toward President Trump and his supporters.  Would I say that I'm a supporter now?  I don't really know.  But I have much more of an open mind.

       No plans to make the source open. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please allow let me explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       My app is not built just to "work", but I put a lot of thought into the framework design, and engineering work into it. Making it open source would allow any dolt on the internet download the code, and build a competing product after implementing the server side.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one asks Whatsapp/Facebook/YouTube/etc to make their source open. And they won't let it be open source. Why? Same reason. A lot of work went into it. But why do people still continue to use them even after it is proven that they spy on their users? The very simple answer could be brand recognition, blind trust, or simply because the users don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I understand the concern that you do not trust me, that is something that I will have to earn. As it is, many US giants have been proven to be joined at the hip to the NSA under the Prism programme and are censoring people. People literally have nothing to lose by using my app.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could, please put yourself in my shoes. Would you personally put your life and career on the line, as I am doing, to provide a service, use all your knowledge and skills to create everything singlehandedly, and then post everything online for free?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, should this get popular enough (read: $$$), and after I'm done implementing all features and bug fixes, I might get a
       <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">
        Common Criteria
       </a>
       certification or equivalent, so that the 3rd parties can prove that I'm not spying and it's secure, etc. That is the most I'm willing to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, I put my life and career on the line to do this because it is my conviction to do this. However, I'm not generous enough to give away the entirety of my life's work, make it open source and get a crapload of competitors that use and modify my code without giving me a single cent.

       "Progessive" left?  Like Bernie Sanders left?  Do you really think that group is the one using shills and narrative control?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you mean "regressive left" - i.e. Hillary, the corporate Dems, the PC crowd correcting language, the trumps-a-russian crowd, the "we're the good guys because we support minorities when its politically useful" people, and the people with the keys to most media outlets (and most celebrity culture).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Progressive movement is not that.  It's for populist social-democrat policies that benefit the working class against the rich elite.  And frankly, it's what everyone with an internet connection and a brain should be.  Or - at least a populist conservative / libertarian / independent.  I really hope you're not equating the group with the media-controlling world-controlling Democrats.  That's Republican enemy-innoculation brainwashing, if so.

       I mean Hilary and company. I could have seen myself possibly voting for sanders though there are some major points I disagree with him on he was a breath of something new and genuine. Unlike the corruption and evil that follows the Clinton's around. And fuck the media fox, msnbc, cnn, all of it. I learned years ago to really find out what is going on in the world one has to follow the money so I stick to stories about what business and banking is up to as much as possible.

       Aye.  Which isn't to say a world government and free-trade sort of thing couldn't be good - if it actually was aimed at making common citizens better off.  But instead it seems to be used as a pillaging platform by major corporations / politically-connected folks.

       So you're gonna leave so the rest of us can deal with it? Our freedoms need to be fought  for, if you want reddit or r/conspiracy to go back to the way it was, fight the shills with logic and a level head. You can't change their minds, but you can lessen the impact they have by pointing out their lies and providing the truth. I personally don't care what some spineless shill thinks, but I will damn well try to make sure they're not poisoning the minds of the naive or ignorant. We're  all in this together.

       I mean the people in the media, and now that I've gone back to school at 34, the people in college telling me that I need to shut up, Im racist, and that I somehow have a golden ticket to everything. Yeah I used to make 100k a year in the oil field busting my ass in less than perfect conditions but now I work as an attendant at a gas station and go to school full time. I keep hearing it called 'identity politics' where it seems everyone wants to be some sort of victim. Why in the fuck do people think more government is any kind of answer? I haven't voted for a dem or repub since gore v busch in 2000 and have since voted third party whenever possible or simply split the ticket in state and national elections. Everybody on both sides sound like blubbering babies. But I will say this stands out on the left more so at the moment probably because of the election results but still. This country is so divided its not even funny. The Trump supporters aren't doing much to bridge the gap and the democrats don't seem to want a gap bridged so they can keep playing the victim. Its all sick and rather pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxism sounds great and all but you can't have liberty with equality. And equality for equality sake gives no one reason to improve themselves. Now if you agree that it would be better to have a few elite running the show and the rest of us under their servitude as equals than more power to you. Just let me move out first.

       I think you need to stop and ask what you mean by 'the left'. Democrats, like social democratic parties in Europe, abandoned the working class long ago and - happy with the grossest levels of inequality - represent nothing more than the cheerleaders of elite domination, and identity politics is the smokescreen they use to push economic interests out of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is precisely what I'm talking about when I say I can make little sense of the term "hardline progressive left ideology". Just because the right like to associate anything and everything liberal with the left in order to discredit any alternative to the 'winner takes all' agenda they're pushing, it doesn't mean you have to go along with it.

       agreed. Just learned Conde Naste is behind the site now. So its easy to understand how they manipulate things and probably have an entire floor of a building dedicated to people whose job it is to post stories they want and manipulate comments and rhetoric.

       I think this sub has become more balanced since the election, while the rest of reddit has been polarized, mostly against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the way reddit's
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , upvotes, visibility, participation, and culture interact, the site is incapable of supporting more than one polarized viewpoint without conflict that will inevitably result in a victory by numbers or a ban of either community's members from the other. Reddit's "half-separation" really isn't working out.

       progressive left? like bernie sanders has taken over reddit?
The corruption is corporate, and it's because the economical model of reddit is private ownership. We need a publicly owned utility that cannot be corrupted by covert corporate influence. How's that for progressive left ideology?

       No such thing, just like Communism and Capitalism are two sides of the same coin, just attacking from different directions. The "Progressive Left" is every bit as fraudulent as the "Corporate Right" just using different disguises to convince people to follow them, a public relations campaign if you will. Antony Sutton can explain...

       Agree completely, it's very sad.  You have to go deep into some of the more obscure places to get the good stuff now, defaults and popular subs are now straight-up cultural engineering/propaganda, nestled between native advertising.

       <a href="/r/politics">

       or
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       to see the blatant left leaning narrative being pushed. Not too long ago I took a look at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and literally the first 3 pages were all anti-trump, pro-big government nonsense. I'm not a Trump supporter, but it was very obvious what was going on. Even as we speak, the front page of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is almost entirely anti-trump.
