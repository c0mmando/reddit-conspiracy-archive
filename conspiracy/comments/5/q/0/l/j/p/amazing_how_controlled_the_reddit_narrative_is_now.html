And I would say that this has happened in full in just the last few months. </p>

<p>Conspiracy itself has and is changing a lot and not necessarily for the better. I long for the days when this sub was only 38,000 strong and constantly laughed at. Though I will say it seems to have become the only place many important news stories are talked about and the least likely sub to delete posts or ban users for views that don&#39;t fit the progressive agenda. </p>

<p>Honestly I am spending less and less time here and will soon probably abandon it all together once conspiracy goes full tilt.  </p>

<p>You are also working the split right now by saying &quot;super left dumb shit are taught at college&quot;. If we aknowledge this problem, the only solution is to not use charged words and focus on arguing our position with facts and less opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem with the flat earth thing is that it further poisons the well.</p>

<p>There are, for instance, hundreds of folks who call themselves &quot;truthers, they preach that 9/11 was an inside job - that explosives were planted in advance (which is correct) but then they pull themselves completely under and go on a pro-flat earth rant in public, on Youtube and their thousands of subscribers get trapped into this pit of deception.</p>

<p>This is only one example.</p>

<p>You also have flat earthers who say that there were no planes at all at 9/11 which is really a bridge too far because they really needed real planes/drones in the press to be able to sell the story of the buildings going down. If no planes at all then how would the US gov. explain the buildings coming down?</p>

<p>Anyway, I personally feel the level of critical thinking among activists and rebels is reaching an all-time low and not only here in r/Conspiracy.</p>

<p>The blinded Trump flock is not adding any quality to the subreddit as well, as was to be expected of course.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you one more example. Ask any Trump fan what algorithm warfare is about and how far it has evolved and who is a part of that and if you&#39;re lucky 2 out of 10 will have serious replies. The other 8 have never even heard of the term or concept yet it has been sabotaging their lives for at least the past 15 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean... pretty much every scientist agrees gravity exists, obviously it&#39;s still somewhat of a mystery, but there are mathematical constants for it that work in every physics equation, so we know it&#39;s real. </p>

<p>A mirage? I&#39;m not sure if you are joking. If not, that&#39;s a very unrealistic and quite ridiculous lol. This happens for everything, all the time. Not just one object here or there...</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re not arguing that the Earth is flat, then what are we being lied to about? You are confusing me. Everything in space, if left to itself, without outside forces (besides gravity of course) forms a sphere. Look at fire and water for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? I never said anything except it works in every math equation we&#39;ve pretty much come up with... and recently even found gravity waves. I mean, it <em>is</em> one of the 4 dominant forces... any scientist will tell you. You have the strong force, electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravitational force. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you won&#39;t just answer the question... you say you are not here claiming the Earth is flat, yet you seem offended and now are defending it, and deflecting the conversation. So what exactly are we being lied to about? I agree NASA is a gatekeeper and lie about many things, I don&#39;t even think we went to the moon in a rocket in the 60&#39;s. So what in the world are you talking about then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the earth is flat.... reading comprehension do you have it?</p>

<p>Gravity is acceleration, we don&#39;t know what causes it. We have a theory that it&#39;s mass but it can&#39;t be verified. It&#39;s much more logical to assign gravity as a side effect of electromagnetic interactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely backfired on me.  I used to spend an hour+ every day on r/politics.  Yes, it was left-leaning, but it was still rational.  Then there was a <em>noticeable and immediate</em> shift in the tone and quality of the posts.  Now I only go there to downvote.  But it&#39;s not like I stopped consuming anti-Hillary news, I just found other sources.  </p>

<p>Number of times I visited the_donald before the takeover?  Literally never.  Number of times afterwards? Nearly every day.  The result is that I&#39;ve developed a much more sympathetic view toward President Trump and his supporters.  Would I say that I&#39;m a supporter now?  I don&#39;t really know.  But I have much more of an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, ladies and gentlemen...</p>

<p>I will point out that I offer everyone an open forum to discuss general stuff <a href="https://authenticsecurecomputing.com/forum/1/1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Should you guys want to do &quot;investigative&quot; stuff and are worried about censorship (which may need to be done in the face of lawsuits from billionaires), you can use my feature rich P2P <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asc.mobilenode">app</a> with a discussion function. It is a private forum that is moderated by the OP.</p>

<p>All P2P communications, other than the IRC, are encrypted end to end and only the intended recipients would be able to decrypt it and no user information is stored server side. This helps everyone - I don&#39;t get sued or anything, and you guys are responsible for whatever you post and have your own private forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No plans to make the source open. Ever.</p>

<p>Please allow let me explain why.</p>

<p>My app is not built just to &quot;work&quot;, but I put a lot of thought into the framework design, and engineering work into it. Making it open source would allow any dolt on the internet download the code, and build a competing product after implementing the server side.</p>

<p>No one asks Whatsapp/Facebook/YouTube/etc to make their source open. And they won&#39;t let it be open source. Why? Same reason. A lot of work went into it. But why do people still continue to use them even after it is proven that they spy on their users? The very simple answer could be brand recognition, blind trust, or simply because the users don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>While I understand the concern that you do not trust me, that is something that I will have to earn. As it is, many US giants have been proven to be joined at the hip to the NSA under the Prism programme and are censoring people. People literally have nothing to lose by using my app.</p>

<p>If you could, please put yourself in my shoes. Would you personally put your life and career on the line, as I am doing, to provide a service, use all your knowledge and skills to create everything singlehandedly, and then post everything online for free?</p>

<p>However, should this get popular enough (read: $$$), and after I&#39;m done implementing all features and bug fixes, I might get a <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> certification or equivalent, so that the 3rd parties can prove that I&#39;m not spying and it&#39;s secure, etc. That is the most I&#39;m willing to go.</p>

<p>Remember, I put my life and career on the line to do this because it is my conviction to do this. However, I&#39;m not generous enough to give away the entirety of my life&#39;s work, make it open source and get a crapload of competitors that use and modify my code without giving me a single cent.</p>

<p>The Progressive movement is not that.  It&#39;s for populist social-democrat policies that benefit the working class against the rich elite.  And frankly, it&#39;s what everyone with an internet connection and a brain should be.  Or - at least a populist conservative / libertarian / independent.  I really hope you&#39;re not equating the group with the media-controlling world-controlling Democrats.  That&#39;s Republican enemy-innoculation brainwashing, if so.</p>

I haven&#39;t voted for a dem or repub since gore v busch in 2000 and have since voted third party whenever possible or simply split the ticket in state and national elections. Everybody on both sides sound like blubbering babies. But I will say this stands out on the left more so at the moment probably because of the election results but still. This country is so divided its not even funny. The Trump supporters aren&#39;t doing much to bridge the gap and the democrats don&#39;t seem to want a gap bridged so they can keep playing the victim. Its all sick and rather pathetic.</p>

<p>Marxism sounds great and all but you can&#39;t have liberty with equality. And equality for equality sake gives no one reason to improve themselves. Now if you agree that it would be better to have a few elite running the show and the rest of us under their servitude as equals than more power to you. Just let me move out first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to stop and ask what you mean by &#39;the left&#39;. Democrats, like social democratic parties in Europe, abandoned the working class long ago and - happy with the grossest levels of inequality - represent nothing more than the cheerleaders of elite domination, and identity politics is the smokescreen they use to push economic interests out of the picture. </p>

<p>This is precisely what I&#39;m talking about when I say I can make little sense of the term &quot;hardline progressive left ideology&quot;. Just because the right like to associate anything and everything liberal with the left in order to discredit any alternative to the &#39;winner takes all&#39; agenda they&#39;re pushing, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to go along with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this sub has become more balanced since the election, while the rest of reddit has been polarized, mostly against Trump. </p>

<p>I think the way reddit&#39;s <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, upvotes, visibility, participation, and culture interact, the site is incapable of supporting more than one polarized viewpoint without conflict that will inevitably result in a victory by numbers or a ban of either community&#39;s members from the other. Reddit&#39;s &quot;half-separation&quot; really isn&#39;t working out. </p>

The corruption is corporate, and it&#39;s because the economical model of reddit is private ownership. We need a publicly owned utility that cannot be corrupted by covert corporate influence. How&#39;s that for progressive left ideology?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No such thing, just like Communism and Capitalism are two sides of the same coin, just attacking from different directions. The &quot;Progressive Left&quot; is every bit as fraudulent as the &quot;Corporate Right&quot; just using different disguises to convince people to follow them, a public relations campaign if you will. Antony Sutton can explain...</p>
