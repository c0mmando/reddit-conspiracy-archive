Oh okay&quot;.  When will the people learn. The president isn&#39;t the shot caller, just a puppet. That&#39;s how it ALWAYS is (JFK is the exception, but let&#39;s not forget he started out as another puppet but changed his mind after finding out just how bad their agenda really is. He was killed very soon after). So if JFK was killed by trying to warn the people, then how the FUCK would Trump become president when he&#39;s openly against the same people who killed JFK?? It&#39;s pretty simple. The only reason it he is in office is because they want him in office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you putting words in my mouth? I never said that and was just as against the crimes they committed overseas as they are committing against our own people. Maybe I should&#39;ve clarified, I am not a Hillary supporter...she belongs in jail. Rationalize however you want, I&#39;m all for independence, but not when it comes at our own people&#39;s expense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that DJT got elected and is still alive tells me that he&#39;s just another puppet, place holder. If he was actually about what he campaigned about and giving the middle finger to the establishment he would&#39;ve been put 6 feet under a long long time ago. The last time a President was actually for the people and wanted to do something very beneficial for the people he got murdered just days before he was going to implement this Change. President Kennedy literally was in a fight with money, and it got him killed. You don&#39;t challenge people like this and get away with it. Trump is welfare scum compared to the real elite. I hope he really brings change, but I know better   </p>
