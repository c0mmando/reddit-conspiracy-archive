       Oh come on. You guys are brainwashed that Trump wants to harm you which is exactly what the elite Cabal wants. Give the man a chance. So much is happening, my head is already spinning. NASA just released all the scientific data. A bunch of people resigned from top positions because they knew they were dirty and that Trump would deal with them eventually. The swamp drained itself in the State Department but that is because Trump promised he would do it.

       I'm not arguing that point. I was noticing in the Manning posts, trumpers came in to defend a lot of dumb comments like CTR does. He is calling the people who helped elect him traitors while calling for an end to corruption while also trying to gag people and stop leakers from inside his own administration. It's a weird thing but you can see the people who can't digest each as their own and instead just prop Trump up. It's very similar to CTR. Just pointing out shillyness going on on all sides.

       Calling Manning a traitor is unfair and I hope Trump changes his stance on that. He was mistaken there. I will admit that but some of the Trump supporters are mistakenly agreeing with anything and everything he does. That is an error no matter who the president is but they are emotionally very invested and very desperate for change.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a big mess especially when people who don't agree with Trump are being mixed up with the real CTR slaves of Soros.

       I am in on Trump for the moment, but feel much more aligned with people on this sub and the pursuit of truth than any politician. This was a great topic, and I am glad we got an answer.

       Interesting stuff. I knew Trump had a CTR equivalent, didn't know what it was called though.

       So it looks like this group focuses on data collection, analytics and modeling. Basically intelligence. I'm not defending it because obviously it's fucked up that they have access to so much of our data, but I don't see how this compares to CTR, which is a massive brigade of paid shills spreading bullshit all over the internet.

       Funny that the Hillary supporters ignore the verified proof of CTR's existence, but can't provide any such proof of the supposedly ubiquitous "Trump/Russian (depending on the day, they switch nationality) 'shills'".

       You're joking, right? Trump didn't get a honeymoon stage. He was savagely attacked, and calls went out to impeach him, before he was even sworn into office.

       liberals attacked him and will attack him understandably as he has a r by his name but what if he does something that it's legit to criticize on like saying manning is a traitor.
