       Who? We don't know exactly who, that's the problem. We know where they are financing that terrorism though, and those are the countries that have been banned as per recommendation of most dangerous countries by the Department of Homeland Security.

       If we would have banned the Saudis from coming into our country before 911, then 911 wouldn't have happened. Most of the terrorists on 911 were from Saudi Arabia.

       I agree about SA not making the list knowing they fund terrorism, but what i find as odd is most of the people arguing this on facebook dont want any ban, from any country.. then argue as to why more should have been on this list,then call it a total ban of muslims.

       So, in 2015 Congress passed the (Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015)[
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text">
        https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text
       </a>
       ].  The law made revisions to the
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/01/21/obama-administration-rolls-out-new-visa-waiver-program-rules-in-wake-of-terror-attacks/?utm_term=.abef47cc661d">
        visa waiver program
       </a>
       , which is what allows people from certain countries to travel to the U.S. without applying for a visa -- i.e., someone from the UK does not need to apply for a travel visa to enter the U.S. for a short term stay. The law said that if nationals of 38 countries visited certain countries known to harbor terrorists, they would no longer be granted automatic waivers; they would have to apply for a visa to visit the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial countries were Iraq, Syria, Iran or Sudan, and in February 2016
       <a href="http://ogletree.com/shared-content/content/blog/2016/march/libya-somalia-and-yemen-added-to-the-visa-waiver-program-travel-restrictions-list">
        Libya, Somalia and Yemen
       </a>
       were added.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's Executive Order has nothing to do with that Act.  Instead, Trump's order is based on general authority granted in the  Immigration and Nationality Act, drawing on the White House's plenary authority to restrict immigration. They may have gotten the list from the one Obama used for the other purpose, but the Executive Order, in its own text, makes all the factual findings that allegedly support the order.  Trump could have very easily added countries to the executive order.

       Wait are saying that Obama, the Kenyan born Muslim, is responsible that Muslims from those countries can't enter the US anymore? So what did Trump actually do? Trying to prevent it?? Who is sitting in the White House? Trump or still Obama 😱

       SA is not an ally, they are merely part of an unholy alliance the USA has engaged in because of our alliance with Israel (Israel and SA are chummy).
F)  Saudi Arabia is at war with Yemen, trying to reinstall an ousted dictatorship.  They are killing civilians daily.

       You're not going to get me to argue that SA is a country ran by good people. I however think there is plenty of reasons not to piss them off diplomatically
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       when Trumps only been in office for 9 days. If he doesn't go after them sooner or later I will be upset, right now isn't the time to do it though in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about my f) point not being totally correct. There are no wars happening inside the country right now nor is it a war torn country is what I should have said.

       No, I am positive there is actually.  But guess what?  There is religious persecution ALL OVER developing countries.  I was under the impression that we were taking immigrants because their cities were destroyed by bombs, not because they are in an oppressed class in their country.

       First of all, I'm gonna need to see some proof that Saudi Arabia is responsible for 9/11. There's more proof that our own government was behind that.

      <p>
       Second, he's using the list of countries that Obama made in 2011... of course when Obama did it though the media and everyone is like "yeah!!! Obama is so great and so smart and a god."
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, what Obama did wasn't nearly as extreme as what trump has done, but you can't ignore the fact that a lot of people in those countries hate America with a passion and want nothing more than to destroy it. There are people in those countries that strap bombs on their chests and blow themselves up and other innocent people. That is insanity. Do you really want those people to have an open invitation to America?

       Well there is the fact that like 15/19 hijackers were Saudis, then there is the shit from the "missing 28 pages" which showed said Saudis had ties to the Saudi government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accept any of that as proof
       <em>

       Personally I find it highly unlikely it was one, or even two countries who were involved in the planning of 9-11. Most likely there was a coalition of nations...

       It's the exact same countries Obama had on the list. But good point. Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of terror and Islamic extremism.

       Right, a lot of morons in this thread.

       The answer is very simple. Because he
       <strong>
        can't
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       All he did with this executive order is enforce laws already passed into legislation under a visa waiver program by Congress under Obama, and guess what? Only 7 countries are on that list, and Saudi Arabia isn't one of them.

       Because Trump took the politically safe route with this ban. He only banned refugees from countries identified as high risk by the Obama Administration because he knew the protesty fucks would shout their usual 'tyranny, Nazi' claims.
