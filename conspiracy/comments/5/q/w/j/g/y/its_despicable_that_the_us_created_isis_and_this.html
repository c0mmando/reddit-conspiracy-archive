    <div class="md"><p>And then be devastated economically? No , you need to understand how economics work before you blab on about this shit. They have lots of oil that we depend on right? Destroy ties with them = big drops in oil. What happens after that? What trump wants to do is make it so america can live on its own. That is when saudi will get the boot. I agree, fuck saudi arabia and yes they should be on a list like this, but we are too dependent on them and it&#39;s very sad. I think he&#39;ll break ties with them if we have another way. Whether if its a renewable boom in the next few years or if we find other oil sources. Once that happens, Saudi is bye bye from our dependency. It&#39;s truly sad that it&#39;s how we have to get through these times, and I do hope he says something about them and doesn&#39;t turn out to be a saudi shill. We don&#39;t know right now though, so it&#39;s probably safe to say to not start spreading false narrative and to observe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think we will see a huge revolution in renewables starting this year and it&#39;ll only improve. We&#39;ve been put behind intentionally by the elite due to their conquest of money, it&#39;s only a matter of time when renewables become more wealthy than fossil fuels. It really sucks waiting. I agree though, I hope we destroy our longheld ties with Saudi Arabia and make america prosper itself with new innovations coming. Elon Musk being on trumps board is a huge thing, but people love to bash him due to his support of trump when I think he&#39;s going to be the one to ensure that we stay on track.</p>

NPR lulululul. Saudi Arabia ties will begin to diminish soon buddy, I can assure you that, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because trump is attempting to cause as much stability as he can whether you see that or not. You just really have to analyze his moves. He&#39;s going to build up america again so we don&#39;t have to pay a little more for gas. Don&#39;t you realize that right now isn&#39;t the time to go around and start breaking ties with countries that supply a lot of goods to us over a ban to control vetting a lot more and to make sure america is safe? Do you want more terrorist attacks? Why didn&#39;t Obama have the balls to deny Saudi Arabia? Because they are sadly too important to us right now and will be until we can support ourselves. We don&#39;t like them. That&#39;s obvious. The ties will end this year because we&#39;re going to experience a big technology/resources boom that will get us going economically.</p>

It would be nice if our government acknowledged responsibility for the turmoil over there, but that&#39;ll likely never happen. At the very least, I&#39;d like to see a change in our foreign policy to where we stop destabilizing countries and actually work to make the region more stable and peaceful.
