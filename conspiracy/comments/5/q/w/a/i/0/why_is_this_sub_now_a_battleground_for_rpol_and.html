And theyre just calling each other shills and liars. One side blatantly screaming that this sub is dead, while the other is screaming that CTRs campaign is active under a new name. Meanwhile they all have new accounts. They all are screaming disinformation and honestly its not that Conspiracy related. Its just a mindless brigading war under the blanket of a vague conspiracy attachment. </p>

Now days there are many people that think it&#39;s ok to worship and cheerlead politics and Trump is literally saving us from something. It&#39;s really bizarre honestly.

<p>This is not the old school conspiracy range-fire course any more. Some of us might wish we were back in the time when conspiracy was an interesting pastime, but nothing more than a way to vent our frustrations outside the &quot;normie&quot; box, because we all knew the media-globalist power structure would never allow a juicy conspiracy to trigger an actual explosive political issue.

    <div class="md"><p>Somewhat related but you might be interested in taking a look at Robert Mercer.</p>

<p>From the minimal info about him, he appears to be very pro-libertarian. If my initial theories are correct, he may have completed phase one of hijacking the GOP. From the looks of things, he might be doing this at all costs, even if it means to co-opt the socially conservative types in the GOP base in the short term.</p>

<p>PM me if you get a discussion going there. I don&#39;t sub to /libertarian but this topic interest me and I could contribute. Trying to figure out what his end-game is. Check out my previous posts on the subject.</p>

<p>Many subs I&#39;ve been in for 5+ years have banned me for disagreeing with the hive mind in the sub. </p>

<p>It sucks man. I&#39;ve had this account for 7 years. Its me. Its me on reddit. To be banned after all this time for basically nothing is a real kick in the nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they have figured out that there is a sort of knowledge filter here. For all the crazy alien stories and flat earthers, when big news breaks lately I come here first to read the comments and check out the sources. Probably sounds insane but it seems like I can read between the lines easier rather than going &quot;ok what does cnn say, now read fox news, now put them together. Now see who makes money off it.&quot;</p>

<p>I expect the CTR and the shill vs shill to only get worse.</p>

<p>I have been curious lately if anyone has wondered about the dead pacific tidal pools and if this whole Trump thing might be in part to keep the news from reporting on it... those videos are frightening and sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democratic party and their wealthy backers (Soros etc.) are spending millions of dollars on an Internet troll army.   </p>

<p>The Republicans are presumably spending some money on Internet persuasion as well, but not to the same extent.   They have a loyal Fox News audience and rely on things like opposition to abortion.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party is ruining the Internet for all things political.   I followed the election closely and it was plainly obvious when CTR flunkies were given new talking orders.   They appeared en masse on subs like SandersForPresident and later R/politics.   Again, they all spew the same talking points and they all have the same superior, snarky tone.   Ironically this ends up creating more resentment in their target audience, whom they are presumably trying to convince, unless the goal is simply to create the illusion of consensus.   </p>

<p>The Democrat troll army infests a certain sub reddit, takes it over completely, and starts heavily downvoting or even banning alternate viewpoints.   People no longer see the point in trying to engage in intelligent debate -- why debate someone who&#39;s literally being paid to argue with you? -- and seek non-corrupted communities.   </p>

<p>Then the next problem arises.  The trolls realize they&#39;re simply talking to one another, rather than the target audience, sort of like the communist party back in the 50&#39;s when the membership was made up almost entirely of informants from different intelligence agencies.   So the trolls seek out the new uncorrupted community and begin to corrupt it.   </p>

<p>The shithead David Brock should be considered a supreme villain for poisoning online discourse in this fashion.   Does anyone here really think &quot;Bidenbro&quot; was an organic meme?   It&#39;s pathetic.   </p>

<p>I should stress that it&#39;s not just the Democratic Party doing this.   It&#39;s the US government in general, it&#39;s corporations and their PR companies etc.   Probably about three quarters of the quasi-political posts on Reddit are astroturf.   </p>

<p>I have no idea what the solution is.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it boils down to this:</p>

<p>When most people talk about &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, they are almost always talking about &quot;fringe&quot; or at least &quot;non-mainstream&quot; theories about conspiracies between individuals and groups, behind the scenes. I know, I know, a lot of this is because the phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; has been tainted so the average person will think &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; -&gt; &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; -&gt; &quot;delusional ravings of crackpots with a loose grasp on reality.&quot;</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the thing... in the past year, but in the past few months especially, we&#39;ve seen conspiracy theories become mainstream. The legacy mainstream mass media has been pushing</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump is a puppet of Putin and/or Russia</li>
<li>Russia and/or Putin &quot;hacked the election&quot; (in favor of Trump)</li>
</ul>

<p>without a shred of fucking proof, which, before 2016, you would expect to find on lesser-known places online like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but definitely not on the nightly fucking news.</p>

<p>Yet here we are. We&#39;re being overloaded with information, all sorts of crazy things are being passed around and blindly accepted as fact, and when you ask ardent believers of this bullshit <em>why</em> they believe any of it is true, they can&#39;t tell you. They &quot;don&#39;t have the information on them right now&quot;, because they can&#39;t actually logically figure out <em>why</em> they&#39;re rioting in the streets; they just know that it&#39;s the Right Thing To Do.</p>

<p>And the conspiracies that people accept as fact keep getting shuffled around every couple of weeks or so, as &quot;new information comes to light&quot; through unnamed and unverifiable sources, thirdhand information, and media outlets citing media outlets citing media outlets citing some random guy on the Internet&#39;s blog.</p>

<p>Right now, Trump is Hitler, because of the immigration/refugee-related Executive Orders, and thus, everyone has conveniently forgotten that he&#39;s also supposed to be</p>

<ul>
<li>Putin&#39;s puppet</li>
<li>a Russian traitor</li>
<li>an illegitimate President, because

<ul>
<li>Russia hacked the election (whatever that even means)</li>
<li>he didn&#39;t win the Popular Vote and that should count for something, dammit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a sexist (he was a sexist a few days ago because of the abortion stuff but that&#39;s already pretty much out of our minds)</li>
<li>a homophobe/transphobe/bigot (Pence was supposed to have wanted to round all the LGBT people up and shock them until they&#39;re &quot;normal&quot;, remember? what happened to that?)</li>
<li>a stupid dumb moron who doesn&#39;t understand that man-made climate change/global warming is REAL, and we&#39;re going to die because of his arrogant ignorance of SCIENCE (which has been settled and is immutable)</li>
<li>an admitted woman-abuser

<ul>
<li>because of a ten-year-old offhand sound bite about consensual groping</li>
<li>btw what happened to those women who were trying to sue him for rape around the election? speaking of which...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a child molester (this one never gained enough traction to stick, because it was admittedly desperate as fucking hell, holy shit... I still honestly can&#39;t believe they tried to pull that one)</li>
</ul>

<p>...and probably others that I&#39;ve forgotten to mention.</p>

<p>Do you see what I&#39;m saying? I am NOT a rabidly pro-Trump supporter or anything, but it&#39;s hard to sit back and look at this shit and <em>not</em> see it for what it is: a deck of charges and accusations, each designed to evoke the maximum possible emotional response, which are shuffled and played (by the legacy mainstream mass media (and perpetuated by the inherently viral nature of social media)) against Trump as a reaction to literally every single action he takes.</p>

<p>So to get back to the topic at hand: if there&#39;s any grand conspiracy here, it seems to me that it&#39;s the legacy mainstream mass media that is indoctrinating the populace with emotionally-charged reactions to everything that our democratically-elected President says and does.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t actually know if Trump will be a good President or not; I like a lot of what he&#39;s done so far, but him putting this immigration/refugee stuff on the table today along with his plans for dealing with ISIS does legitimately scare me somewhat. Not because I think Trump is a stupid dumb idiot moron fartface who doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing—as a wise man once said, &quot;he knows <em>exactly</em> what he&#39;s doing.&quot; I just recognize the situation as being incredibly volatile all around, and the fact that half of the world interprets what&#39;s happening one way while the other half interprets what&#39;s happening in an entirely different way is not only making matters worse, but, in my opinion, THAT is the real news story of 2016/2017: the bifurcation of reality.</p>

<p>We now have two wholly opposite perceptions or interpretations of real, current world events, and billions of human beings are more or less coexisting with each other, despite having these wildly different interpretations of what is really going on.</p>

<p>That is why you perceive it as being a &quot;politics&quot; vs. &quot;the_donald&quot; debate, but, like most things in life, it&#39;s much more likely to be incredibly, incredibly gray than either black or white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so glad you mentioned the child molester thing. I agree with basically everything you said.  </p>

<p>At the climax of the wikileaks email dumps, the media somehow brought forth a new sexual assault victim almost every day. None of them had come out before, none of them could verify that something happened, and after he won the election, all talk of it disappeared completely. It&#39;s fucked up to accuse someone of lying about being sexually assaulted. It&#39;s even more fucked up to take advantage of that for political gain.  </p>

<p>Everyone has moved on like it never happened and it was only 3 months ago. Fucking crazy. How he managed to end up with the presidency after that kind of smear campaign still amazes me. They threw EVERYTHING at him. </p>

<p>I always thought the 9/11 hoax was ridiculous, and now I have a fully open mind to that, the moon landing, JFK (actually I always thought that was bullshit), and a ton of others. </p>

Also, and I say this as a Trump supporter, if Trump were to do something I would find really odious, with all the ridiculous accusations that the Corporate Media(tm) has been bombarding us with, I probably would never even know because at this point I figure every criticism is partisan nonsense.

    <div class="md"><p>Totally.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that in a couple of weeks, Trump signs some executive order or something, causing the military to round up all the LGBT people and minorities in the country into concentration camps, as many people on my Twitter feed seem to be legitimately afraid of.</p>

<p>How would I even know? What would people do to speak out against it—protest in the streets? From my everyman perspective, there&#39;s been so much random protesting over vaguely-defined issues going on, nearly constantly (apparently there was going to be some kind of Scientist March, in the name of Science (global warming/climate change presumably), but I think that got pushed back because of the immigration stuff)... when something ACTUALLY bad hypothetically happens, nobody will be able to tell, because they&#39;ll be numb to the emotional effect of protesting at that point.</p>

<p>If anything, a liberal progressive-type with a modicum of logical reasoning ability should quickly realize that this &quot;protest dilution&quot; is incredibly dangerous for them and their causes in the long run for this exact reason. &quot;Boy who cried wolf&quot; and all that.</p>

<h1>But this is just an incredible demonstration of how we&#39;ve been programmed to feel some strong emotion, immediately and instinctively act upon it, and tie our actions and feelings to our identity such that we refuse to back down from our entrenched views, lest it degrade the identity we&#39;ve built for ourselves.</h1>

<p>Much of my Twitter feed at the moment is enthusiastically and empathetically discussing how they are totally justified in any future Nazi-punching they may engage in. This is horrifying; fellow citizens are being dehumanized for their ideological differences to the point where they are encouraging violence upon each other.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert in history, but I am something of an expert in online interactions and how it shapes human behavior, and all I can say is... this really seems like the sort of thing that will result in civil war, or something similar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, #DrinkStarbucksToFightBigotry is <em>literally</em> a completely unironic trending topic on Twitter right now. Maybe I haven&#39;t looked deep enough and it&#39;s actually a /pol/ op or something, but on the surface it seems to be entirely legitimate, and this is one of the scariest things I&#39;ve seen in a long time. People are actually buying into corporate messaging crafted specifically to align with the legacy mainstream mass media propaganda. On one hand, I get it, right? Capitalism, do what you can to make more money for your shareholders, etc., but I mean... holy <em>shit</em>. Brands identifying with completely manufactured bullshit political causes, making appeal-to-identity plays in order to increase brand awareness and therefore sales? We live in a goddamn nightmare world, and almost everyone seems entirely oblivious to it.</p>

<p>Usually Starbucks waits until around Christmas for their manufactured controversial bullshit; I can&#39;t even remember what they tried to pull last year, and I&#39;m actually thankful for that (lol), but the year before, remember the whole &quot;controversy&quot; about how they served coffee in a red cup for the holidays, and allegedly some Christian groups thought it was satanic or some shit? COMPLETELY manufactured, I myself couldn&#39;t find any evidence of any actual Christians who were offended by it, and all of the Christians I know who were aware of it were posting on social media &quot;lol wow I mean I&#39;m Christian and I&#39;m not offended by it haha&quot;. PERFECT viral outrage marketing play, that everyone fell for, apparently, before forgetting about it entirely after the new year.</p>

<p>Now this shit is being used to empathize with the manipulated emotions of average citizens, causing them to not only double-down on their overemotional and incorrect misconceptions about the factual nature of reality, but also to increase their affinity with the Starbucks corporate brand.</p>

<p>Somehow, everyone has <em>zero</em> self-awareness about all of this—which goes to show you just how powerful the emotional manipulation truly is.</p>
