    <div class="md"><p>He should.</p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy ignored by the &quot;truth&quot; community revolves around<a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf"> this document</a>. Revealed in 1998, we are now about 18 years into a 20-year plan to make The West question science to the point that they do not know fact from falshood. The &quot;post-truth&quot; world we now live in was engineered by thinktanks like the Heritage Foundation in order to manipulate the populace into turning America into a theocracy... but it&#39;s not the theocracy you think. </p>

<p>I hate to say it, because it&#39;s been projected all over the place lately and I know that 95% of you will misunderstand me, but it&#39;s an actual Satanic cult. It has created an opposing version of Jesus who rewards those that break the Ten Commandments, punishes those that actually practice what Jesus preaches, and has a frightening number of adherents. These are people for whom Avarice, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, Wrath, and Pride are the laudable qualities of a Godly Man (apparently Slothfulness is the sole remianing Deadly Sin, so it&#39;s back to the coal mines for you). They preach that Greed is Good in their multi-million dollar megachurches while impoverishing the very people that Jesus told them to help. These people are rabidly against offending god with abortion but slather at the mouth when given the opportunity to kill their designated enemies at home and abroad. </p>

<p>Greed is good and war is great for business. America needs a good civil war. God wants you to kill liberals for America. The time is right for the Second Coming. Pence is positioned to be the Saviour to Trump&#39;s antichrist. Once all of Supply-Side Jesus&#39; enemies are dead it will be Heaven on Earth. Unless you&#39;re poor because fuck them.</p>

<p>People tend to think that there is a single monumental power behind everything when reality is more of a Venn diagram. Different factions with overlapping goals and methods that are sometimes adamently opposed to each other. It isn&#39;t the Clinton Foundation everyone needs to be looking into, it&#39;s the Clinton Foundation along with the Heritage Foundation and all the other &quot;thinktanks&quot; that are literal conspiracy factories existing solely to manipulate public opinion and change laws to push the country in their own chosen direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what else is brainwashing? Your knee-jerk reaction to anything regarding religion. It is exactly the same reaction most people have when they hear the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. Your brain shuts off before you even have a chance to think. If it were not for your indoctrination that everything to do with religion is fantasy, you would understand that I was talking about brainwashing the American population on a massive scale. </p>

<p>You are the 95% misunderstanding what I am saying, just throwing that baby out with the Biblical bathwater. Yahweh doesn&#39;t exist but religion does. People act upon the beliefs they have been indoctrinated with and the more they buy into the dogma the less they question the worldview. Dismissal of religion and mocking the religious as morons is dangerously myopic, even if it can be entertaining. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a truly religious person, you should be afraid that these people are trying to install a new God that resembles the God of the Bible in only the vaguest of ways. If you&#39;re atheist then you should be terrified that these people have been actively engaged in the suppression of the very scientific knowledge that an atheist worldview is based upon. Christianity is under attack in America but not by atheists. Atheists are under attack in America but not by Christians. America is under attack by fascist psychologists that know exactly which buttons to push in order to get the public to fall into line with their New World Order. </p>

<p>The ban is both stupid and sensible. Immigration and terrorism are not the highest priorities right now. Cleaning out and dismantling various agencies and foundations will be the key to real change in the US.</p>

<p>My greatest fear is that the administration gives us a few years &quot;good cop&quot; by engineering some type of <em>real</em> economic recovery, and quietly sweeps the CF and Dyncorp crimes under the rug. Trump <em>has</em> to know about these skeletons. Sunshine is always the best disinfectant in politics.</p>

He was ditched before the end of his first term and replaced with Malcolm Turnbull. Why? Because he was a cunt. Mal&#39;s a good cunt but Tony is just a cunt. The things that everyone so loathed about Tony&#39;s government are still there under Turnbull, they&#39;re just toned down a little. Mal gets away with it because he has the decency to use lube when he fucks Australia in the arse.</p>
