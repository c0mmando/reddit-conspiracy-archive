       "Earth is a realm, it is not a planet. It is not an object, therefore, it has no edge. Earth would be more easily defined as a system environment. Earth is also a machine, it is a Tesla coil. The sun and moon are powered wirelessly with the electromagnetic field (the Aether). This field also suspends the celestial spheres with electo-magnetic levitation. Electromag levitation disproves gravity because the only force you need to counter is the electromagnetic force, not gravity. The stars are attached to the firmament"

       Awesome Post! We need much more postings about the Incredible Superhuman known as Nikola Tesla. Besides being the smartest human ever in this realm, he was a kind and gentle soul. There are no planets. There never was. They are all Holographic Spheres similar to a Snow Globe. We are inside the Simulated Universe. Now, learn to once again be its master...

       Because flat earth is anti-scientific. It literally makes no sense and has been debunked so many times it isn't considered a sound conspiracy anymore.

       You're trying to tell me that on a conspiracy sub there is no mystery to who we are and where we are? Especially when our entire understanding is what a government agency has told us while independent scientist like Tesla say "hold up, don't listen to them"...FE is a great conspiracy discussion regardless of the Earth is flat or not. History and science is used to betray us, point blank period.

       Not semantics homie. Calling a theory "Flat Earth" when you want it to encompass far more than the name suggests just turns people away from the part of the discussion that actually makes sense. It would be like me trying to explain relativity to someone and calling the theory the "Pancakes Steal Your Socks" Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bit of an exaggeration, but I honestly hope you can see what I'm talking about. I want to promote healthy, rational discussion in this community and to those who aren't yet a part of it. Names like this just promote disinformation and a less-than-sane narrative for people who are being introduced to conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; Flat Earth theory is a very poor name if the pertinent content has nothing to do with the Earth being flat.

       There is just so much
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       science that disproves Flat Earth without even intending to. Geoscience, physics, astronomy, plate tectonics, the fact that we have volcanoes, oceans, time zones, and a plethora of other reasons all factor into why FE is a conspiracy that has been disproved without it even having to be actively fought against.

       I think we citizens haven't been allowed to study the moon enough for me to present a solid theory about it. I find the tidal lock fascinating, as well as how perfectly it lines up with our sun during eclipses. I also find it interesting that there has been so much effort to cover up information about the far side of the moon, as well as the blurring of pictures taken by Nasa. There's a lot there and I can consider many interesting theories but I'm not sticking by any of them until I have more proof.

       To you and your limited interaction with the cosmos, the earth might as well be flat, do you look up at the sky and study the motions of the stars, observe the alignments of the planets. Does any of it even matter to you? Do you have any personal connection with life beyond earth? Can your rotten meatsack even survive outside of our terrestrial bubble?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given how little you think about, and study space why does it matter if it is or isn't like mainstream science would have you believe?

       I'm actually mildly obsessed with the universe. I have a personal telescope, have read the works of a few great astronomers, and of all my friends am the only one who ever takes the time to look up and just take it all in. I do study the movements of heavenly bodies, try to point out which direction certain constellations should lie to my girlfriend, and more than you'd think. I don't know why you're being so hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may have a limited interaction with the universe, just as everyone else does, but don't for a second believe I don't think about it. You don't know me or what I do. The point of this is raising awareness to things that
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       need to be made aware of. Not some petty anti-scientific garbage theory that everything you've just listed discredits. Please take a step back and realize which conspiracies you're wasting your time with and those that need attention.

       Right but it's never replaced with a truth.  That's what is so fun about it and perfect for free thinkers. Like it's just getting us all to the table and saying "why do we know so little about our history and our planet"...I just don't get the reluctance to sit at the table,  that's all

       seriously though, think about what you're saying. just think about it. consider how many scientific theories exist that
       <em>

       flat earth. not the ones that discredit it. just the ones that
       <em>

       it. Find them and bring them to me, and if they're logically sound I promise you I'll consider the theory.

       What theory proves a round earth, or a torus earth, or a bubble earth or a hollow earth? There is no proof, there's evidence, there's a person's point of view. Ultimately it's your meat sensors that tell you what this world is, and all the sensors can do is send a signal. You make sense of that signal by comparing it to what you've already experienced. We all live in alternative realities, except each alternative reality creates it's own alternative facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earthers are a reactive neurosis of people that want to erradicate their reality of confinement. To them they want verification that their world isn't a flat plane with a dome, they want to break through their metaphorical firmament. Just as the bible is filled with metaphors that people interpret as solid reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       People's concepts amount to little more than a finger pointing to something. Just like you don't buy everything being sold, you don't have to look at what everyone is pointing at. You can agree that some people are pointing in the right direction, but don't lash out at people that point in another direction no matter how misguided it seems to you.

       I like this question a lot. What if you control it? Or me? Or all of us together. I try hard to remove myself from the skin and bones.  We all know we are more than skin and bones. There is something inside us all that represents us...I'll call it a soul,  you can call it whatever you'd like.  Point being is our soul bound to our skin and bones (our mind) or are we free to explore everything? Can our soul move through the 4th dimension? Have other souls already accomplished this? Or are we literally skin and bones and our soul was just a bunch of chemicals...
So many thoughts that come with your question

       The matrix projects almost all of reality for you. Lets say you walk out of one room to go enter another. You leave room 1. The Matrix then projects or renders that Holographic Image of the Hallway or Room 2 that you are going towards. They are Holographic Images and only exist when projected. The Matrix basically makes decisions for people with low conscious awareness. We forgot this was all an illusion and began to believe everything around us, and so called "matter" to be real, with an independent existence. In true reality Cause and Effect are illusions. But they appear very real here because the Matrix can only project in Linear Motion. we have become enslaved by a Computer Program. By raising the human vibrational level and level of consciousness one can then "Self Project" reality. Basically it is overriding the Matrix Program and literally Remote Influencing/Outpicturing your own reality.

       As long as you identify with a Physical Body and a Physical Dimension you have to address what you put into the Body/Avatar. Non Fluoride Water and a Vegetarian Diet cause significant increase in Vibratory Rate. Dense foods such as red meat are of a very low vibration and actually absorb the energy of "fear" from the slaughtered animal. I am not a doctor and not telling someone how to live but meats vibrate significantly lower and denser than spinach for example. Mediation and Relaxed Deep Thought are crucial. Visualize your expected coming events in the Minds Eye beforehand. The following takes enormous effort and I am not claiming I can do this on a regular basis. Doing any of this is exceptionately difficult: At a certain point you will want to start trying "Project" images in your Holographic Sphere (your perceived reality). Do you try to hit your hand with a hammer? Absolutely not. The rules of the Matrix still apply until you are in control, and in a way a "Master". Start small; roll a tennis ball on the floor. See which direction you want it to actually roll. You "see" this in your head while at the same time looking at it. The version you "see in your mind" is another reality. The objective is to overlap the desired direction or reality with the one being projected by the matrix. This is a "Dimensional Overlay". You are merging 2 realities together by thought until you are outpicturing the dominant projection. Wim Hof can jump in a lake of Polar Ice and be completely warm. He does this by controlling his entire body by thought. Yogi's and Tibetan Masters did the same. The only thing that actually exists is thought. Does that mean I can drop a chair on my foot? No. Of course not. As long as the matrix projects my reality the Laws of a Physics apply. Do some Yogis and Tibetan masters break the laws of physics from time to time. Yes

       Please understand that I am not a doctor. If you have medical conditions these may not be appropriate for you. Everything I write is for "Entertainment Purposes Only". Because I might be able to do something, do not assume you can go around changing realty. This takes intense practice and you always have to be safe. Nothing is more important than safety. That being said, I will send you some links later tonight.

       Gravity is descriptive, not explanatory. It only describes the effects of how objects in spacetime attract to each other, it doesn't explain the underlying effects themselves.

       Newton discovered how the solar system worked and his equations described how the force of gravity might be holding everything in orbit...but there was no physical object causing any of it. Only the math predicted the correct answers. So he knew the 'how' but not the 'why', and it stumped everyone for a few hundred years:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers. - Isaac Newton
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He is talking about gravity. Action at a distance. That one material body in space may have an effect on another with no material in between them. This was a great concern for scientists, because their only answer to the 'why' was that 'the math makes it happen'. This is of course an absurd answer, but it was all they had. Math is not a physical object. It's just the logic of quantity. Logic is abstract. Saying the math makes the planets stay in orbit is logically equivalent to saying angels make them move. Indeed some people (probably laypeople) did say things like that for a long time. To many, he was basically confirming the Aristotlean view that angels made the planets move. You might have called them "gravitational woo" theories. Eventually scientists got fed up with it, and a new physical model was invented.
      </p>
      <p>
       It began with Michael Faraday in the early 1800's with his description of electromagnetism as being caused by 'lines of force'. A line of force is nothing more than an imaginary line connecting an object that is creating a magnetic force to an object that is being affected by that force. He suggested that this line of force be considered 'physical', thereby connecting the actual physical objects in space
       <strong>
        as if
       </strong>
       there were some kind of invisible string between them. Later James Maxwell developed this idea further and refined it into a full fledged theory, which came to me known as field theory. Under this model there aren't really 'lines of force' but a 'sphere of influence' that is described by an equation or set of equations like the inverse square law and force per unit charge, and this sphere of influence is assumed to be a real physical object even though it cannot be directly measured like every other real physical object can be measured. At first a lot of people did not agree with the lines of force or field theory, because they understood that logically they are the equivalent of what Newtonian physics said, that 'the math makes things move'. Eventually though, since nobody had a better explanation, force fields were considered real physical objects by almost everyone. They were the best physical explanation that science had. So they stuck with it. They now believe in it.

       I have, and while it was convincing at the time, I believe that his sources on the inside, for whatever reason, gave him (some) false information. Compare the pictures of the ET he shares with
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/fark_okqyi-4il8cnabgii_we1qz14sc-jpg.9909/">
        this toy alien.
       </a>
       They look identical, and this has been used as evidence against him to discredit everything he discloses. I highly doubt the people working in Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) such as Area 51 (more accurately referred to as the Groom Lake facility or Nellus Air Force Base) are able to take and leak photographs of whatever stuff their working on without raising suspicion and risk losing their careers and being charged and perhaps executed for treason. However, I do feel that he does share some legitimate information about ETs, ET craft and whatnot in that interview, but the pictures of the ET are fake, or, the toys were based on actual ETs so as the two would be misconstrued in the event of that photos of them are leaked to the public (which seems like a less plausible explanation in my opinion).

       Yeah, it's a fascinating watch. I'd love for someone else to publicly share the results of the experiment he claims to have done in which he tapes two magnets together, same poles facing each other, and drops it from a tall building, and it falls slower than it should due to gravity. I asked a friend with a PhD in plasma physics, and he said that shouldn't happen. It's such a simple experiment to do too, and it would be definite proof of concept.

       A lot of people do not know that time is an extremely relative concept tied to our existence.  There has yet to be a universal standard for time because we only know it from being on planet Earth.  When you realize time is just a variable you will also realize that gravity and external cosmic forces can easily bend and change time into anything.

       Time doesnt exist.
Photons dont exist.
Electrons dont exist.
"Space" doesnt exist as a standalone constant, it is an effect.
Gravity isnt a standalone force.
Magnetism doesnt exist as a standalone force.
Aether DOES exist.
Aether is a medium in which electro-magnetism propates, same as air is a medium in which @sound" propates.
Light, gravity, magnetism are effects of electromagnetic force being propated in different quallitative states trough aether (such as water/ice/gas).
Electric current is not a current of electrons trough a medium as "carrier" of the negative charge. Negative charge is an oxymoron, a logical fallacy. Negative "charge" is a DISCHARGE. It is a release of charge, it is an opposite of a particle.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that regard, modern physics shot itself in the foot concluding that forces they were unable to find the causes for are standalone forces (magnetism, gravity). Tesla ridiculed Einsteins idea of particle physics, relativity, space-time grid and was a proponent of existence of aether.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is different in a piece of rock that was made from normal to magnetic? Its physical attributes are exactly the same as before it was made magnetic. You changed its qualitative attributes, as in, its effect on aether.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is light on the edges of the edges of the spectre so strong it will kill you? What is different in its quallitative attributes from normal light?

       I always wondered if the moon was further away, if we would have adapted differently to sleep schedules, and potentially live longer? If our body, through evolution, was used to sleeping once every 48hours instead of 24hours, might we live twice as long or am I retarded and having retarded thoughts?

       It emits its own light that cools instead of heats, that alone is very strange and shouldn't happen. Do your own experiments/look them up if you're lazy.

       And when he told you why, you were not satisified. All I'm saying is that it sounds like you need to look from within on this topic. It is not the job of another man to satisfy your curiosity. If his explaination for the dodgy nature of gravity does not suit you, dig deeper and present us with something to think about

       Do you have a better theory? Theres a ton of work being done trying to figure out exactly what gravity is. The idea that one of the properties of matter is that it bends spacetime, resulting in a gravitational effect, seems downright reasonable to me. The only real crux of the theory is that it doesn't hold up in the subatomic world, but nothing we experience in the macro seems to translate all that well to the micro, except maybe the electromagnetic force.

       Gravity isn't created, continued, or terminated anywhere. Gravity is the bending of the space-time manifold near heavy masses. Or rather the result of this bending. Some argue that the definition of mass itself is tied to how "something" with mass interacts with the space-time manifold.

       Sure it's created.  One example I can think of is when a star is born.  I guess black holes and supernovas had gravity before and after their existence.

       Well no it's centralized. The particles had the same total gravitational pull as a star or before as a gas cloud spread over billions of miles. It's just they all eventually came together and their pull became more focused.

       I could argue that the pull changed and was created due to a stronger distortion in space and time.  Gravitational pull is

        not a force.

       Ok fine if we're speaking in terms of relativity then gravity isn't a force but the total distorts in spacetime by the particles was the same when they were a gas cloud vs a star vs a black hole, and you can say the distortion centralized on one point. Again in simple terms the "pull" on distant objects would be the same.

       That's not scientifically correct understanding. Gravity isn't created when a star is born. Gravity is a field. It's a description of nature based on the distribution of this thing called mass. Except for the big bang, where we don't exactly know what happened or how to explain it within our current understanding, mass-energy is neither created nor destroyed. Stars being born is just mass being dense enough to kickstart thermonuclear reactions.

       And finally, a lot of this theory breaks down (or their approximations do not hold up) in the high energy, small length domain where quantum effects start to become non-negligible. I believe this is the greatest open question in physics now: reconciling this with quantum field theory as we know it.

       This is particularly important near the big bang because one hypothesizes that these two theories interacted heavily in ways we cannot explain presently.

       Why do galaxies rotate at much faster rates than we would infer from the light we receive? The current explanation is "dark matter" (ie GR works, its just that we cant see the hidden mass causing the observed velocities), and yet all of our attempts to find different candidates for dark matter have failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are heavenly bodies receding from our location at larger speeds the farther away they are from us? The current explanation is "dark energy" is causing spacetime itself to expand like the surface of an inflating balloon, but we have no idea what this dark energy is and our attempts to describe it using quantum theory have failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, we claim GR is the end all - be all of theories because it super accurately describes the motions of our satellites and the motions of planets around the sun, but wherever it fails we cover it up with ad-hoc "mysterious" particles and energy whose origin we cannot explain. We also conveniently ignore the fact that all attempts to unify it with our microscopic theory (the Standard Model) have failed.

       The most promising theory I have read about so far is Reciprocal System theory:

       This theory was developed by Dewey Larson back in the 50s. In the 70s he released a three volume set of books that goes into the theory in depth and he shows how to calculate the masses of all the fundamental particles, the massess of the elements, interatomic distances, deflection of light due to gravity, critical temperatures of various substances, and many other physical quantities all from first principles with no recourse to ad-hoc physical constants. These volumes are called

       The basic idea is that instead of having particles exist in spacetime, you just have motion, and space and time are reciprocal aspects of each other, creating motion. Linear motion is the photon, rotational motion creates the particles. Using these principles plus basic mathematics he accurately calculates a host of physical quantities, such as the masses of the particles. In the Standard Model these masses are measured and are part of the vast number of constants used to define the theory, and you see articles on wikipedia wondering what this mysterious theory that can explain the masses of the particles may be.

       I remember reading about Dewey Larson a number of years ago. I think Isaac Asimov said his theories were brilliant but a major flaw was the inability to explain the photoelectric effect.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As Asimov wrote (in Chemical &amp; Engineering News, July 29, 1963):
       </p>
       <p>
        "If no electrons exist within the atom, as Larson suggests, I do not see how the photoelectric effect can be explained. From this I conclude that however stimulating Larson’s book might be as an intellectual exercise, it need not be taken seriously as anything more than that."

       If he really said this then he sounds like he comes up with ideas without evidence. Posting a quote with no evidence is borderline worthless especially when you are claiming the earth isn't what it is (an extraordinary claim). Come here with some testable evidence for such a claim or it's worthless. Having a belief based on some guys quote is so fallacious.

       For sure. My understanding is that his use of energy was because he was able to pull energy from the vacuum.  I guess I put him and NASA in the same boat with that quote...If we were not being kept from so much we could probably all have an awesome discussion on these sort of possibilities....Or there would just be a singular truth.  Either way, it's not right how little we are kept in the loop

       100% with you on NASA. In fact I think NASA is used to make us feel more isolated, small, and hopeless. Tesla alluded to needing to rework how we deal with distance and NASA is saying "space is getting bigger, we are getting smaller, lets escape to Mars" it fits the overall narrative that we are small and hopeless and need tptb.

       I learned a few weeks back that most if not all of the NASA astronauts are members of the Freemason, the same is true for a lot of mainstream 'Fathers of Discovery' scientists like Isaac Newton and Galileo. Tesla chose to go against the grain which is why he is not as well known.

       This got me "Our senses enable us to perceive only a minute portion of the outside world. Our hearing extends to a small distance. Our sight is impeded by intervening bodies and shadows. To know each other we must reach beyond the sphere of our sense perceptions. We must transmit our intelligence, travel, transport the materials and transfer the energies necessary for our existence. Following this thought we now realize, forcibly enough to dispense with argument, that of all other conquests of man, without exception, that which is most desirable, which would be most helpful in the establishment of universal peaceful relations is — the complete ANNIHILATION OF DISTANCE" --------Admiral Bryd who explored Antarctica alluded (I believe) to the fact that the way we perceive distance is wrong.  Could this really be a conspiracy....Is it that important to make us feel small and that space is expanding and that we are becoming smaller and smaller in a place that is getting bigger and bigger...We are going to wrong way, is it an intentional play by TPTB?

       That quote sounds to me like teleportation.  If you make it as easy to travel to a far away place as it is to goto the bathroom, distance is annihilated.  Immediately our hearing is extended.  Sight not impeded.  Intelligence transmitted.  Thoughts?

       That's how I take Tesla's quote. I think Byrd's quote was much more literal. Either way I think Tesla believes it is possible to be anywhere at any time and it is only our understanding of nature that holds us back.  For me that's the conspiracy.  Do we know how to do this? Do we understand the world we live in? Are we not being told truths?

       He does allude to humans being able to communicate through devices that fit into our vest pocket. So he definitely seemed to understand certain aspects about the world we live on. But then at the same time he speaks of the firmament and energy from the vacuum. You could very well be right but I also think he saw possibilities beyond the internet

       That's a good way to look at it. Technology is integrating into the way humans operate at a stunning pace, I'm literally less intelligent when my phone is dead than when I can look stuff up on the fly. I don't doubt the potential for us to eventual transcend the "normal laws of physics", but I think it more likely that we'll find workarounds that make actual teleportation or other scifi type stuff seem impractical and of little benefit.

       Yeah, the hangup for me with physical teleportation is that a person is not just a person, a person is a collective of billions of molecules, all of which would need to by synced perfectly at origin and re-synced perfectly at destination. It seems cumbersome and dangerous, when the alternative is to efficiently send only the necessary information while not risking the physical body. It's kind of like the benefits of digital music vs analog, over time the physical media will degrade, while the digital is infinitely replicable.

       I took it as meaning "everything is one".  Literally that distance is an illusion, and we all occupy the same space at the same time.  This would jive with eastern thought as well as quantum mechanics, where objects at a distance can be entangled and adopt state synchronously regardless of distance, which is the concept of non-locality I believe.

       To the topic: I believe meditation, astral projection, and increasing personal frequency (love eliminating fear response) will allow better control of our pineal gland which possibly accesses the electromagnetic world.  If we are able to figure out how to harness the energy I like to believe what you are asking would be accomplished.

       Nostradamus predicted the event of the great genius figuring it out.  (Couldn't find a good source.  It's out there.)

       I've come across a YouTube video that I believe isn't faked about "the electric eel man".

       He supposedly uses chi energy and lit paper on fire with his hands by balancing his positive and negative energy (yin/yang, love/fear) in his gut chakra.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason my intuition ties all of this to holofractal (r/holofractal) theories about energy, Pythagorean geometry and the cosmos, the crazy magnet guy on YouTube breaking new ground about magnetism being energy acceleration.

       Is the earth a magnet?  Are we held?

       You know?  Not knowing and being curious is such a fun story.

       Somebody pure of outside toxins and influence could break new ground through meditation and manifestation. It would take knowledge of truth to not even have the wall of doubt built in the mind to overcome as most of us do.  In passing I've seen claims that he's (the great genius) out there in protection learning.  Can't find where.  I read too much.  Probably not even true.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of us are that person though, so we can't say what magic could exist in this realm.  Maybe through belief and practice like exercising it would actually happen because we change our reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw this study of people that imagined exercising intensely and got results.

       I do know that our minds are far more powerful than we know yet.

       Can you explain that a bit more? I made a mistake by doing it with friends who are uninterested in the type of things I am. I did see some weird geometric shapes coming through the floor, and one of my more mature friends said he felt a sense of total knowledge, but wasn't sure how it came about.

       Oh yeah meditating is all about raising your core frequency and letting your mind take a break.  Just focus on breathing deeply and only think in and out. In and out.  As thoughts come to you go back to in and out.  Eventually your body vibrates and you can do whatever you want.  Get deeper and deeper if you want.  Use your imagination and ask questions and listen to silence in your mind and feel the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up astral projection but also read into the dangers.

       There's more out there. Researching curiosities you have will unveil many synchronicities. :)

       Do you have any recommendations for legit Telsa podcasts, interviews, documentaries, any thing like that? I find it surprisingly difficult to find podcasts with researchers who actually have knowledge of the science behind Tesla's work. It seems wildly popular yet I cannot find a good source to explain it to a "layperson", for lack of a better word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to at least attempt to understand what Telsa knew without needing a PhD and $200k in college debt.

       It's up to you if you think this guy is legitimate but he offers a pretty easy to understand primer on pulling energy from the vacuum. Much like Tesla he claims energy is all around us and that we have a fundamental misunderstanding of our nature. As a bonus for this sub he delves into why he thinks tptb will not recognize this technology

       My growing theory is that people like Elon Musk &amp; Jeff Bezos who very publicly speak about world simulations, colonizing mars, private sector mass satellite deployment, and things like this are actually calling bluff of world governments &amp; TPTB -- in a sense blackmailing them -- as if to say "We know".  Even Elon's company name, seems to me a hat tip to Nikola Tesla for possibly having figured it out decades earlier.

       Not sure I agree, but in that trench of thought, a future mars colony [when no actual mars colony exists] with random drawings/drafts for people to go there  (dissidents?) could be an easy way to get rid of people. Or maybe it's just the makings of a bad sci-fi movie.

       There is no way they send anyone to Mars when they could just kill us. If there is any space research going on it is how to survive long enough to escape disaster on Earth. But I doubt that even. More than likely they are just fine-tuning spy satellites and space-based weapons.

       Not saying they would do that, but the perception and panic of "just kill us" Vs. "FREE HOME on MARS!" is sort of akin to secret service man with fake arms (nice!) Vs. secret service man openly sporting a locked &amp; loaded UZI, MP5, or whatever he's got under that badass man-cape.

       I read a story as a kid where dissidents were taken to a prison that through deduction the prisoners figured out was in a sattelite.  They figured it out by simple tests of physics to disprove they were not on a planet.  I think the crux of it was the simulated gravity had a different spin there than on earth,

       Musk knows.  The things he says he is working on we already know how to do imo. He either knows and is pressuring tptb or he knows and he's a patsy for tptb. Me personally I think that he is a patsy for tptv saying "If I'm working on this it doesn't yet exists". That way when the truth comes out about our world and energy they can say "oh yeah, we just figured this out"...either way, good call on Musk, there is more to his story

       I think he is saying Earth is energy and that we can plug into the Earth for our energy. The Earth is not just some rock aimlessly hurddling through space. Basically our fundamental understanding about where we are is fucked and because of this we do not use this world for its true purpose.

       People are more productive in a truthful world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever been in a position where a lie has been lifted and the truth revealed it sucks a bunch for a short amount of time. But after the truth is out there is a weight lifted off everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like perpetuating lies and obfuscating the truth runs counter to the interests of everyone, including TPTB or whoever. Chaos is not easily controlled.

       Every system will have pieces that slip through the cracks, and without a truthful foundation the system of control will inevitably fail.

       The best reasoning I have heard about why we are being kept in the dark revolves around finding our place in this world. If we no longer need coal and oil because of energy from the vacuum, tptb money dries up. If we find our planet is flat or hollow or has polar worm holes or any such whimisical component to it then we are not alone and we are much more significant than we were led to believe...in which case the entire world wakes up at once and tptb lose control instantly. We live in the prison they created for us,  if we are made aware of our prison and realize we are not locked up, we simply open the door and leave our prison. Truth will set you free...

       Earth is the singularity of a great torus field and is the pinnacle of creation as well as the only physical plane we have. Everything is connected to everything and is bound together in a great ocean of energy. Humans are sparks of a divine light. We have the best of both worlds, the mental faculties and thinking ability of angels (made in image of God) yet the earthly fleshly qualities of an animal.

       The stars are not an illusion, they are points of light created by cymatic vibrations. Everything is created in a vortex fashion (golden ration) and everything revolves around the earth. The earth is unique in that it is the center or heart (earth anagram) separated from the "outside" by a solid structure or firmament which allows physical bodies to exist. The universe is enclosed and energy is recirculated in what we could call the cosmic egg or bubble. Quantum entanglement proves this closed system since they can't explain how changing one thing affects something instantaneously faster than light at the opposite end of the universe, but fractal holographic model shows this perfectly. The second law of thermodynamics also shows that energy is never "lost" but simply changed, this energy is recycled in a constant motion in and around and back through the singularity at the center. The flower of life holds the key to this and this knowledge has been suppressed and ignored for millennia.

       For me I learned this kind of knowledge in pieces or layers that have been building for about 2-3 years now. It is like an onion built layer by layer until a fuller picture is formed. I came at this originally from a spiritual angle while learning about ancient cosmologies and these geometric patterns that is found literally everywhere. I would say just start reading about sacred geometry and holofractal universe model. Nassim Haramein has a beautiful working model of the fractal universe but he still holds onto mainstream cosmology model and I subscribe to the ancient models . Look up stars and cymatics and magnetism and energy vibration/frequency. It was a long journey for me but there's so much information out now it shouldn't be too hard. I would say the greatest thing to come out of my research is that humans are extremely special and of divine origin and importance and all the current theories and science want people to think the exact opposite which should tell of the depth of this agenda  it is true spiritual mental warfare.

       I'll check it out.  I'm definitely working under the premise that we are special and there is a conspiracy to make our world small and hopeless. "We are just a rock,  space is ever expanding,  just sit back and call it a day"...and yet we sit here and understand so little.  Why is the pursuit of truth not met with a greater earnest? Why isn't "where are we?" the greatest question of all

       Exactly, nothing to see here we are just a speck of dust don't worry about personal responsibility or how we treat others just love your one life to the full and it doesn't matter what we do, and by the way don't ask too many questions just keep watching tv. If the exact opposite is true does anyone believe these current powers that be would tell anyone? No way. The search for truth is the best thing anyone could ever do.

       Wow I fucking love discussing/reading about these types of ideas.

       That theory goes hand in hand with the work of Jacque Vallee.

       He maintains that the UFO phenomenon is an elaborate cover up by TPTB in order to distract us from the understanding that our solar system is the only one.

       Before reading your explanation I thought
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was too out there. But after reading your perspective it makes more sense!

       I've never heard of him I'll check it out. There's definitely something fishy about UFO and government involvement and cover up. Either they have all this advanced technology and haven't unveiled it to the public or there are beings working with the governments teaching the tech or both. There's no question we are inundated with space and alien movies and shows all over the place to make us believe all these things so somehow all these things are connected and not by accident in my opinion.

       In essence, these beings all originated on earth at some point in the past (or future?).

       I wonder then if people like Corey Goode, David Wolfpack and anybody else spreading the new age message is a part of this mission to lay the groundwork for future manipulation.

       By conceding to a spiritual aspect of reality, while withholding the fact that our solar system, or earth, is unique, they stand to maintain control over the idea that the human race is just another evolving species in a vast ocean of life and rob us of the fact that we are unique.

       It's not up to me to educate you on what these mean if you don't put forth any work to actually research any of these topics. This knowledge was recorded before words like scientific came into existence and stand the test of time. What I am talking about is the notion that matter came into existence and is sustained through a dynamic energy field that we are all inside. I am going against everything taught by modern science who won't acknowledge the existence of an aether or fluidity to all of this energy but instead form their physics models around dark matter and dark energy, terms meaning that they have no effing clue as to why particles are entangled and why we have consciousness. I know why we have these things and the unified theory of everything is and has been here the whole time.

       So basically, "matter exists". So far I agree. In terms of "dynamic energy field"... I agree that the observable universe is a massive open dynamic system. But that's also universally supported by contemporary physics.

      <p>
       Yes, you are. Modern science carefully describes new concepts. You just throw "Aether" in the mix without saying what you mean, and how it relates to concepts that are empirically supported.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly. That's called a
       <em>
        hypothesis
       </em>
       . Scientists observe things, and they conceptualize a model that may explain it. Then, they try to falsify this model. If they manage to falsify it, then it isn't true. As long as they don't, it's viable. I don't know much about dark matter/energy, but IIRC it's a theory from the 1930s attempting to explain gravity. Gravity still isn't well understood. That doesn't mean your 'notion' about 'Aether' is has any grounding in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current theories in theoretical physics are irrelevant. We were discussing your ideas.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (...) and why we have consciousness.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not what physics is trying to explain. That's philosophy of mind. I'd be interested in your explanation of consciousness though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I know why we have these things and the unified theory of everything is and has been here the whole time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then please, become a physicist. Physics isn't trying to push an agenda. Physics is trying to gain insight in the nature of the universe, and unexpected views are welcome as long as they're well argued.

       So before I get into how paranormal experiences like the one you've had can be related to holofractal, first I'll try and explain the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is a quantum gravity theory, that is it attempts to unify gravity with quantum physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been many people who have suggested that we perhaps live in a holographic universe - however we haven't had the physics or math to show how, until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the holographic you may be used to, in this case the word means holos (whole) graphic (image) - the whole picture (or information) is available at every point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not abstract - we are talking literally, in terms of quantum vacuum fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planck unit is a fundamental unit, the fundamental quanta of quantum mechanics, not defined by humans. It has a length, a mass, and a time - representing a wave fluctuation or oscillation
      </p>
      <p>
       You can think of this as the absolute smallest electromagnetic fluctuation or universe does, the smallest oscillation of light. It is extremely tiny and extremely energetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vacuum is supposed to be full of electromagnetism, i.e. the vacuum is expected to have a non-zero energy density - this is calculated by adding up all of the planck units that fit in a cubic centimeter of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       This yields a number so extraordinarily high that physicists dismiss it out-hand, the number is 1093 grams / cm3 - the planck density.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply how many planck units tile in a cm3.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Nassim changes a few things. First, he sphericalizes the units instead of using cubic-packing, he uses closest-packed spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then tried to yield the proton's mass from these units, simply by treating the proton is an agglomeration of spherical planck units - they are both spheres so you can divide the proton volume by the planck sphere volume and multiply by the planck mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do this, you yield the mass of the observable Universe, at 1055 grams. There is simply the mass-energy of all protons inside of a proton if you calculate how many planck units fit inside, each with the planck mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then used something called the holographic principle, which states the surface of a black hole can contain all of the information in the volume. Since the proton has this enormous amount of energy, he treated the proton as a micro-black hole, and divided the surface units by the volume units and multiplied by the planck mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he did this, he got the mass of a single proton, at 10-24 grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is telling us plainly that each protons mass-energy is represented holographically in every proton (i.e. all the information of 1080 protons is present in each individual proton), however only a tiny amount of the energy inside the volume is actually expressed locally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The implications of this are astounding. These planck units can act as a bit of information, a 1 or -1 - meaning that each proton has a unique configuration of bits that make it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       All protons are entangled, this is how the mass of all protons is present in every proton - an instantaneous holographic network.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that matter interacts with these holographic singularities, and time is the memory of these bit's previous states.

       Tesla was light years ahead. I thought I'd mention that for those interested, there exists a theoretical framework that could potentially explain all of tesla's work - the Reciprocal System theory. In this theory there are no particles, there is only motion - and that motion is that of space and time. Space is the reciprocal of time, and thus there exists 3 dimensions of time as well as 3 dimensions of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory has so far been used to correctly calculate from first principles (no "physical constants" used) the masses of all the fundamental particles, the masses of the elements, the interatomic distances of a variety of compounds, the critical temperatures of various substances, plancks constant, the gyromagnetic ratios of the leptons, and many other physical quantities. It reduces to the general relativistic equations of motion when describing planetary motions, and it calculates a similar deflection of light (but with an extra term not in the GR calculation, so this is something that would require an experiment to differentiate as current precision of measurements is not enough to differentiate the two theories). It also provides a conceptually appealing explanation for the wave - particle duality of light and small particles.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this theory gravity and electromagnetism are two sides of the same coin, and has the potential to explain the "antigravitic" devices that tesla purportedly developed. It needs more theoretical development, though - when Dewey Larson the author of the theory tried to publish it in journals at the time (back in the 70s) they all rejected it - mostly because it was such a complete departure from the rutherford atom, rendering it incomprehensible to physicists trained with such preconceptions.

       I think people have tried, its just they can never get funding. Example: these russian dudes tried to do a indiegogo crowdsourced campaign and failed

       I cant find any experimental tests of the design. I actually had a friend that was getting his PhD and was working on testing the wireless energy transmission. The thing is, I don't think they ever finished working on the project (he got too busy with his thesis project and just didnt have time). I'll have to ask him what came of it.

       It would be incredibly inefficient to send energy through the earth. Tesla was great with electricity but he wasn't a geologist. He didn't have the right idea of what the inner earth was like and based his calculations on that. I don't think even geologists at the time had the right idea either.

       They railroaded Tesla for being too smart. He figured out how to unravel the whole game in regards to religion and science that the church and governments have been lying to the people. If they had a heart attack gun back then I'm sure he would of had a massive one instead of dying in a hotel room alone.

       Similarly, Edward Leedskalnin, the guy who built the coral castle, also said that we dont fully understand gravity yet. He said a lot of things about electromagnetic energy that sounded similar to this and said that we only understood half of electromagnetic energy, the electric part.

       The only place I can find this quote attributed to Nikola Tesla is online forums where people are trying to push an agenda related to some alternate physical theory or another. It's almost as if there is a conspiracy among physics conspiracy theorists to lie about Tesla quotes and give themselves increased credibility.

       A lot of people do not know that time is an extremely relative concept tied to our existence.  There has yet to be a universal standard for time because we only know it from being on planet Earth.  When you realize time is just a variable you will also realize that gravity and external cosmic forces can easily bend and change time into anything.

       That's not scientifically correct understanding. Gravity isn't created when a star is born. Gravity is a field. It's a description of nature based on the distribution of this thing called mass. Except for the big bang, where we don't exactly know what happened or how to explain it within our current understanding, mass-energy is neither created nor destroyed. Stars being born is just mass being dense enough to kickstart thermonuclear reactions.

       As long as you identify with a Physical Body and a Physical Dimension you have to address what you put into the Body/Avatar. Non Fluoride Water and a Vegetarian Diet cause significant increase in Vibratory Rate. Dense foods such as red meat are of a very low vibration and actually absorb the energy of "fear" from the slaughtered animal. I am not a doctor and not telling someone how to live but meats vibrate significantly lower and denser than spinach for example. Mediation and Relaxed Deep Thought are crucial. Visualize your expected coming events in the Minds Eye beforehand. The following takes enormous effort and I am not claiming I can do this on a regular basis. Doing any of this is exceptionately difficult: At a certain point you will want to start trying "Project" images in your Holographic Sphere (your perceived reality). Do you try to hit your hand with a hammer? Absolutely not. The rules of the Matrix still apply until you are in control, and in a way a "Master". Start small; roll a tennis ball on the floor. See which direction you want it to actually roll. You "see" this in your head while at the same time looking at it. The version you "see in your mind" is another reality. The objective is to overlap the desired direction or reality with the one being projected by the matrix. This is a "Dimensional Overlay". You are merging 2 realities together by thought until you are outpicturing the dominant projection. Wim Hof can jump in a lake of Polar Ice and be completely warm. He does this by controlling his entire body by thought. Yogi's and Tibetan Masters did the same. The only thing that actually exists is thought. Does that mean I can drop a chair on my foot? No. Of course not. As long as the matrix projects my reality the Laws of a Physics apply. Do some Yogis and Tibetan masters break the laws of physics from time to time. Yes

       Time doesnt exist.
Photons dont exist.
Electrons dont exist.
"Space" doesnt exist as a standalone constant, it is an effect.
Gravity isnt a standalone force.
Magnetism doesnt exist as a standalone force.
Aether DOES exist.
Aether is a medium in which electro-magnetism propates, same as air is a medium in which @sound" propates.
Light, gravity, magnetism are effects of electromagnetic force being propated in different quallitative states trough aether (such as water/ice/gas).
Electric current is not a current of electrons trough a medium as "carrier" of the negative charge. Negative charge is an oxymoron, a logical fallacy. Negative "charge" is a DISCHARGE. It is a release of charge, it is an opposite of a particle.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that regard, modern physics shot itself in the foot concluding that forces they were unable to find the causes for are standalone forces (magnetism, gravity). Tesla ridiculed Einsteins idea of particle physics, relativity, space-time grid and was a proponent of existence of aether.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is different in a piece of rock that was made from normal to magnetic? Its physical attributes are exactly the same as before it was made magnetic. You changed its qualitative attributes, as in, its effect on aether.
