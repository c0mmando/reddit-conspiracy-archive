       Look at his promises and see how many came true.  Closing Gitmo was one of his first 100 days goals.

       Good pro was Manning clemency.
The debt being 19trillion is pretty awful.

       Also condemned Bush for holding prisoners without charge illegally. Got elected and made what doing so legal. Bombed 5 more countries than Bush, bailed out the banks, refused to charge high level bankers after the housing market collapse. Pro: Bailing out the auto industry turned out to be a really solid move.

       Pros:

      </p>
      <p>
       Cons:
* Didn't prosecute anyone for the systemic and proven bank mortgage / ratings / derivatives fraud
* Gave trillions to big banks and virtually nothing to home owners
* Supported failed QE monetary policies, which delayed &amp; exarcebated real problem

* Expanded Guantanamo instead closing it
* Was caught running guns to Mexican cartels
* Armed, funded and trained head chopping, cannibal jihadis (Al-Q/ISIS) through ME proxies
* Would have invaded Syria, if not for overwhelming internal opposition
* The associated conflicts have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people
* Obamacare was an exercise in delaying proper reform of the current corrupt healthcare system
* Doubled the debt
* Lied about recovery - economy still in shambles
* Supported TPP, the job killing, subversive fake trade deal
* Approved the funding and organization of the coup of a democratically elected leader in Ukraine
* Record number of military generals and officers resigned/purged under him
* Approved use of domestic false flag and other psychological operations against Americans
* Expanded surveillance and police state
* Largest ever crackdown on journalists and whistleblowers
* Purposefully didn't enforce existing immigration laws
* Spent $65,000 of taxpayer money flying hotdogs to a party

       Simple. He lied about Syria exactly the way Bush lied about Iraq. The Red Line was a setup, a false flag. War criminal. 400,000 Syrians dead already. This degree of evil will eventually blow back to the US population.
