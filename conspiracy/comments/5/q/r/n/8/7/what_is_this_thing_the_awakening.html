The waves combined with changes in the social control systems will basically empower each one of us to see the bullshit we&#39;ve willingly allowed ourselves to be subjected to, and realize the power we have through our collective consciousness.  Those that have controlled us, will lose their grips, and are losing them at this moment, and the Controllers/cabal will not be able to prevent us from  basically overpowering them with our minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. People like Dolores Cannon and many others have talked about how Earth will &quot;split&quot; into two new different realities. One Earth will evolve into a higher density and will take the people who are spiritually evolving. The other Earth will remain in 3rd density and will hold the people stuck at a lower vibration.</p>

<p>If your worldview is shaped by Newtonian physics, then something like this seems pretty preposterous. But the fact that numerous sources are reporting this individually is interesting. Personally, it&#39;s hard for me to completely accept it given that it&#39;s so far from what we understand about reality, but I also acknowledge our limited understanding and I&#39;m still willing to entertain the possibility. Regardless, I do feel that some sort of shift is coming soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason it&#39;s so hard to grasp and picture it in our minds is because we&#39;ve been brainwashed pseudoscience from day 1. We live at the singularity of a great energy compression decompression or heart (earth) like a torus field. We are literally connected to everything and all originate with the source but a higher dimension existence is extremely possible when viewing in as just higher vibrational consciousness. We will still have bodies but more perfect basically and at total bliss and unity with the entire universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need for a body (ego) once you go back to the godhead, inside the godhead what you were on earth will always remain as an idea in the godhead.  For example say we lose all our machines and go back to the stone age, we will re invent those machines because the idea will never go away.  We are machines with a soul that gives us free agency to be bad or good.  If we are bad then we become a  fallacy in the godhead.  The godhead is really just yourself. </p>

I&#39;ve read about the earth split, having to do with negative/positive polarity, service to self/service to others and that there will be a new earth with a higher frequency/vibration for the service to others, almost like a consciousness upgrade with more love and light.
I feel something is coming too, almost like an inner knowledge in a way. There has to be something going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You use terms that are literally found in the Bible as to what will happen. There will be a new heavens and new earth, the shift will happen violently and suddenly imo but we are for sure getting prepared for this with the new energies coming in. These are good healing energies we must learn to move with them and not in defiance trying to hold on to a dying world. Build up positivity and love and you will have a chance in this new world coming. </p>

I can feel these energies, and have noticed more people being open minded about everything, awaking to contemplate that reality isn&#39;t all what it seems. But also noticed a lot of people going the other way, turning to crime and violence, service to self over service to others. 
It almost feels like some sort of spiritual war going on. </p>

The physical shift will happen with destruction coming first as this world is reserved for fire. But just like a forest after a fire it clears the path for the new. It is a spiritual war and you just gotta have faith that the &quot;good&quot; guys can rescue us when it all goes down. </p>

<p>I think that also explains the appeal of primitive or frontier survival shows on TV lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of sounding like the crazy crockpot everyone tries to avoid at the family gathering; apparently there is a worldwide phenomena where a lot of people start noticing the number sequence 1111 and 111- this allegedly is the universe way of telling you to pay attention and that you are on the right path of the awakening. It is a paradigm shift in which we start employing our critical thought and start questioning the &#39;truths&#39; and &#39;facts&#39; served to us by the authorities, media, and people who benefit from these so called truths. We study, research, listen to alternative source, open our mind and make our own deduction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Awakening: When humans understand why they actually go to work or have to work or are required to work in order to live on this planet. </p>

<p>Right now most humans just accept that working for money is just the way it is in modern society, but the simple fact is - it isn&#39;t the only way to live a prosperous advanced life on earth.  We have been directed to pursue a certain set of goals to maintain an established method of resource delivery so that a certain group that actually control the world through societies and resource management can attain ultimate history and eventually a restoration of their rightful place in space-time. They live on a prison planet and we are their minions.  </p>

<p>The meaning of life is not found in the everyday living of it, rather, the meaning is and has been withheld from all mankind through an act of manipulation and secrecy. Currency used to enslave mankind and a small group of initiates purposefully, throughout multi-generational and imperialistic oppression have mastered all mankind so that only one-kind can finally rise up from the estrangement of eternal darkness and return to the Elohim, in full force, for the final return and reclamation of the throne. </p>

<p>The &quot;beast&quot; has been here for over 67 million years and the time is nigh. </p>

<p>This is the awakening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m going to tell you here is the real deal. The one and only secret. The hidden tale. The Black Knot. It is the reason for all secret societies on earth.  The reason for all covenants, religion and war.  </p>

<p>67 million years ago a sarcophagus hurled toward earth and smashed into the Yucatan peninsula. Imprisoned in that stone was a leader and its followers that dared to oppose a celestial council called Elohim.  This council exiled this entity  to a solar system that would hold it and its followers prisoner - the sun is the warden that keeps this thing inactive above ground.  Over the course of millions of years these creatures went through all manner of beings trying to cultivate a workforce that was both easily trainable and controllable, one that can perform their bidding whilst satisfying their own self worth. Needless to say, the human being has been grown into an imperfect, but suitable minion. Through blood manipulation thirteen bloodlines were cultivated to control the remaining peoples for all time with the promise of being with their masters all the way through tot he reclamation of the throne. Along the way great reward and favor would bestow their offspring - as long as the work maintained and the goal attained. </p>

<p>For millennia these bloodlines have been in control and have throttled the pace of human history toward the fulfillment of the promise/secret covenant. Nations have risen and fell based on this promise. Religions created to wind the masses away from the Awakening. </p>

<p>There is more, but this is Reddit and these are comment boards. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQET3FFnDUQ">Here is a quick video that explains more.</a> </p>
