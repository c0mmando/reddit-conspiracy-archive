       We should use these times in which a r/conspiracy post reaches the front page, specifically when it's something anti-trump (they love that shit) to post some of our "greatest hits" to the top, maybe even have a mod sticky them. Flat earth, lizard people, fluoride, demons, cabals, Rothschilds, Mkultra, anti-gravity, tesla, the fucking Beatles as a tavistock think tank creation to spark the counter-cultural revolution and then using Manson to end it.

       Are you in the northern hemisphere? I'm in the southern - Or at least, that's what the big bad government tells me.

      <p>
       If you're in the northern hemisphere then lets do an experiment. If the Earth is flat, the direction of 'up' will be the same for you and me. So take a photo of the nights sky, and i'll compare it to what my nights sky looks like.

       How come we can all see the moon even in the daytime?  If the Earth was truly round, wouldn't there be a point where some of us couldn't see it?  Have you ever been on a plane?  Ever seen any hint at a curve when you're in the air?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust your eyes.  And then see that all of NASA's finding can be debunked.  It's science fiction that they use to control the masses.  Elon Musk, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Buzz Aldrin, John Glenn, they're all frauds.  Think of how much money the people willingly fork over to these organizations like NASA and Space X.  These people are raking in BILLIONS of dollars a year essentially building giant bottle rockets that fall into the ocean!  And people eat this shit up.  The photoshopped fantasy world that NASA forks out.  Or the 'real' pictures of Mars that could easily be any desert.  Just ask yourself a few basic questions and you'll see it's all fake.  How come we have no real pictures of the Earth?  How come I've never seen any satellites in the sky if there's thousands of them?  And my favorite, how did NASA get live tv coverage from the moon in 1969?  That seems pretty advanced, considering I can hardly get wifi in my house sometimes.

       I'm sorry? I have no clue what you're talking about. I love all conspiracies. But if you have any doubt that certain topics aren't bringing in outside perspectives that are incongruent with the core fascination / belief in conspiracies, and that these perspectives are acting in a divisive manner, then you are being willfully ignorant.

       Yes. I'm not a dualist though - at least, I try to recognize any dualistic tendencies I may have. Keeping that mentality as a foundation has helped me dive deep down the rabbit hole as the world around amps up its dualism infused propaganda. Keep your head up.

       I'm on here because I like conspiracy theories.  Are you part of the Russian Troll Army?  I'm pretty sure one of their tactics is to discredit people first before they can get discredited.  Let's hear you say something horrible about Russia?  If you aren't really a Russian agent you should be free to say whatever you want.  If you are Russian agent I expect your superiors wouldn't like you badmouthing the motherland.

       That's like arguing 101. You don't have to be named Boris and from the motherland to try discrediting your opponent in an argument.

       And uhh fuck Russia in the goat ass? You don't seriously believe that we (OG r/conspiracy posters) are actually supportive of an oppressive regime, do you? You have to understand, many trump supporters have recently gotten redpilled with conspiracies and are learning from places like this. They are difficult and it makes this sub much more boring / pro-trump / divisive, but it's important that we (OG r/conspiracy posters) put up with them because it means more people seeing that the reality we've been involved in is a fabrication.

       How about this. I have a nice video if you have the time. Consider this an extension of the olive leaf. It is a video interview with a former KGB agent who explains how the Russians influenced / infiltrated the West through propaganda during the cold war. It might help give you some further insight into what's going on today.
