There&#39;s a post with a specific Iranian comment(The top comment) on the from page that proves my statement. the 1%, elite, whatever you want to call them are trying to take away that very tool even as I type this through various means. I&#39;m afraid of what they might resort to in order to distract the peoples. So many Americans, even in this sub, is drawn to the &quot;Russia is tryn tuh take er freedum!&quot; card.</p>

<p>Stop. Stop giving into the red devil propaganda that was created 40+ years ago. An open mind has gotten you so far, but cognitive dissonance will leave you astray. We all have a common evil, and the true identity of that evil I will not mention, for it exists beyond the average perceptions of reality for most. This evil uses illusion and distrust, blames and distorts against our fellow men and women. Humans aren&#39;t perfect, and they use this to their advantage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;ll argue you. Fear isn&#39;t real in the way we perceive it. If you run into a murderer with an axe you should be scared.</p>

<p>People today are not scared by that. Today people are scared about their exam on friday. People are scared about their child not being able to adapt to the world. People are scared their parents might get sick and die. People are scared their government might be fascist and looking for control in the worst way possible. People are scared of stupid things. People are scared of natural disasters.</p>

<p>Dumb shit to be scared of. The universe as a whole is a being and it watches out for all. Fuck fear it&#39;s pointless.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to get that beautiful girl you see because, you know, fear. </p>

<p>Fear isn&#39;t real, life is a game. People fear what they don&#39;t understand. I love fear because it means I&#39;ve got more to learn. Til then looks like I&#39;m ridin the clouds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a safeguard I know, but I am telling you. The elite use our emotions to manipulate us. To see the entire world unfold in front of your eyes simply follow everything and which emotions you feel towards it. If you do that you&#39;ll see it all, I am in the clouds, always.

    <div class="md"><p>There are more shills here than you think. Don&#39;t mistake them for regular people.</p>

<p>The &quot;elites&quot; are trapped by their own propaganda.</p>

<p>Their game of psychological warfare works great, so long as there is no real organized opposition and so long as your average person is not negatively impacted by it in their day to day life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, they are now facing a populace that has been negatively impacted (post 2008 economy) and an organized opposition (Trump faction of rival elites).</p>

<p>It would be extremely risky for them to get rid of the internet, because if they do, so many regular people will feel negatively impacted that it will be very easy for that energy to be directed against them.</p>

<p>It is also extremely risky for them to try another large scale false flag.</p>

<p>They have no good cards to play, only high risk ones. But given how desperate they seem to be, it doesn&#39;t seem out of the question that they may try something big, even if it only had a low chance of success.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is so true. They are putting themselves at a huge risk if they try something like 9/11. Their entire facade of lies could quickly come crumbling down, and they would be completely exposed. They would have to take their tactics to another level in order to get away with it, and something like Project Bluebeam or extraterrestrial contact would fit that bill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem&gt;Reaction&gt;Solution</p>

<p>If the goal of the world elites is one world government and the United States and its Constitution are in the way, then the way to tear them down is not to invade the United States, but it&#39;s to get Americans to tear down those institutions themselves. How? By getting them to want to secede from the Union, by getting them to want to re-write the Constitution. How do you do that? By demoralizing them, by manipulating them. The next decade will be about the &quot;Alt-Right&quot; tearing down everything built since WW2 by liberal democracies so that when the world falls apart and descends into WW3 the blame for it and the humanitarian crises that will arise can be blamed on the &quot;Alt-Right.&quot; The masses are doing <em>exactly</em> what they are supposed to do, they are dividing themselves and fighting rhetorical battles that mean nothing. </p>

<p>&quot;Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.&quot;</p>

<p>We will see a civil conflict and a World War, both of which will act as a cleansing fire that will clear the underbrush of the old world and the old ways of thinking to allow World Government to swoop in and fix all our problems. </p>
