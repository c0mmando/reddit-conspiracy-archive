    <div class="md"><p>Flat earthers are shills who are meant to tar everything that comes out of places like this with the crazy brush.</p>

<p>How could you believe anything from a place like that? I went on there and it was full of crazy people talking about how the earth is flat.</p>

<p>It is a positive sign though, because this tactic is not working very well. In fact it barely works at all, and it may be counter productive to their cause, because like all controlled opposition, they HAVE to acknowledge many facts that run counter to their goals in order to be perceived as genuine in a given community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it sounds fucked up when you realize &quot;the government that claims to be for the people uses our tax money to attack and subvert us with psychological warfare&quot;, but we know it&#39;s true, they admit they do it, the documents prove they&#39;re doing it, and much more ( on this site: /Blackout2015/comments/4ylml3/reddit_has_removed_their_blog_post_identifying )</p>

<p>Thankfully, something big has already been done, we just need to continue guiding Trump with our feedback in numbers if he does not deliver. But in my estimation, so far so good in terms of actions. Plus, with a media that hates him, everything is under the microscope and that&#39;s actually a good thing for us! They want desperately to show that he&#39;s a sellout, so it will just give Trump more resolve to implement policies that truly work for the people.</p>

<p>We just need to continue as normal speaking to our friends, family and people we meet on a day to day basis and give them an honest appraisal of the situation. The number one topic should be how bad the media is, if that bubble gets burst then everything is on the table.</p>

Nothing will change via working the system that we&#39;re all forced into and you know it, those scum and all of their children need to die (even your lovely trump). If you think there&#39;s any other kind of resolve I&#39;m sorry but you must be a fucking idiot. Especially if you think the current situation in the US is going to end up positive in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha I&#39;m not, I don&#39;t really have a fucking clue what&#39;s going on on this doomed planet but I know I have a more solid hypothesis than most. Trump isn&#39;t going to help you, you&#39;re a joker if you think that. Trump was obviously put there by the real cunts in charge you don&#39;t get his title without that being the case. </p>

<p>Fuck it enjoy feeling positive I wish I could see some positivity in all this shit, how can you not see? You literally can&#39;t avoid their symbolism it&#39;s in nearly every aspect of our lives. Evil is covertly running the planet and you think their just going to let him help you out in whatever insignificant way you&#39;re hoping for. You fucking fools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly. Now apply that to the rank and file of virtually every industry or interest group. There will often be memos or instructions saying &quot;you are expected to support...&quot; with the unsaid implication of consequences if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>You can bet a good percentage of the italian-pie-gate shills are people who are literally facing long prison sentences (at best) if that thing blows up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earthers are shills who are meant to tar everything that comes out of places like this with the crazy brush.</p>

<p>How could you believe anything from a place like that? I went on there and it was full of crazy people talking about how the earth is flat.</p>

<p>It is a positive sign though, because this tactic is not working very well. In fact it barely works at all, and it may be counter productive to their cause, because like all controlled opposition, they HAVE to acknowledge many facts that run counter to their goals in order to be perceived as genuine in a given community.</p>
