        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s look at the evidence. In 2014 a study was done showing that up to ~2.8 million non citizens could have voted in the 2008 election. <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/non-citizensvote/">http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/non-citizensvote/</a> Now remember that there are much more illegal immigrants in the U.S. than there were eight years ago. In California they have extremely loose voter ID laws, and you also do not need a drivers license or SSN to register to vote also. <a href="https://covr.sos.ca.gov/?language=en-US">https://covr.sos.ca.gov/?language=en-US</a> Outside of California Hillary lost by 1.7 million votes to Trump. Ask yourself how Hillary, in a state she did not need to campaign in at all, won the state by such an immense margin, even beating the total amount of votes Obama got in CA in 2008. </p>

<p>The government and mainstream media claim that voter fraud is not an issue at all in America, but a NY election commissioner admitted on hidden camera that voter fraud is a real problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDTcxIqqM0&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDTcxIqqM0&amp;t</a> James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s hidden camera video also shows Democratic operatives in pro-Hillary super PACs (that colluded with HRCs campaign) plainly stating plans to commit mass voter fraud, and to bus people around to vote as many times as possible in states with loose voter ID laws. </p>

<p>A temporary employee in Broward County, FL walked in on SOE officials filling out stacks and stacks of absentee ballots in a back room. She was fired the next day when she showed up to work. <a href="http://ijr.com/opinion/2016/11/261634-florida-voter-fraud-broward-county/">http://ijr.com/opinion/2016/11/261634-florida-voter-fraud-broward-county/</a> Sworn affidavit <a href="https://cdn2.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AffidavitRedacted.pdf">https://cdn2.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AffidavitRedacted.pdf</a> It was also reported that Hillary Clinton herself met with Broward County, FL Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes just weeks before the general election. <a href="https://archive.is/ujtYb">https://archive.is/ujtYb</a></p>

<p>More circumstantial evidence - Hillary and Kaine were known to have struggled greatly with rally attendance; <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wow-tim-kaine-holds-rally-30-people-show/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wow-tim-kaine-holds-rally-30-people-show/</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240170/Empty-seat-syndrome-Sparse-crowds-Hillary-New-Hampshire-Jeb-Nevada-Trump-s-audience-overflows-thousands.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240170/Empty-seat-syndrome-Sparse-crowds-Hillary-New-Hampshire-Jeb-Nevada-Trump-s-audience-overflows-thousands.html</a> <a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/how-this-weekends-bernie-sanders-iowa-rally-compared-to-hillary-clintons/">http://usuncut.com/politics/how-this-weekends-bernie-sanders-iowa-rally-compared-to-hillary-clintons/</a> <a href="https://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/media-caught-lying-about-the-crowd-size-of-hillary-clinton-rallys">https://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/media-caught-lying-about-the-crowd-size-of-hillary-clinton-rallys</a></p>

<p>They were even known to have cancelled scheduled rallies due to complete lack of interest <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/31/second-day-on-campaign-trail-and-clinton-kaine-cancel-cleveland-ohio-appearance/">https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/31/second-day-on-campaign-trail-and-clinton-kaine-cancel-cleveland-ohio-appearance/</a> and even two weeks from the election, Kaine couldn&#39;t fill high school <em>auxiliary</em> gymnasiums. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/tim-kaine-holds-ohio-rally-cant-even-fill-small-high-school-auxiliary-gym-video/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/tim-kaine-holds-ohio-rally-cant-even-fill-small-high-school-auxiliary-gym-video/</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Trump was filling out stadiums, sometimes leaving thousands outside due to capacity restrictions. <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dj1L0TNNHTg/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dj1L0TNNHTg/maxresdefault.jpg</a> <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwdKXTIXUAAFuwb.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwdKXTIXUAAFuwb.jpg</a> <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/trump-rally-north-carolina.jpg?w=640&amp;h=272">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/trump-rally-north-carolina.jpg?w=640&amp;h=272</a></p>

<p>All mainstream outlets peddled polling statistics that had been skewed by under polling republicans and independents and MSM also claimed a Hillary win was basically a sure thing. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cubs-have-a-smaller-chance-of-winning-than-trump-does/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cubs-have-a-smaller-chance-of-winning-than-trump-does/</a> <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/market-indicator-gives-trump-86-chance-winning-election">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/market-indicator-gives-trump-86-chance-winning-election</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-probability-clinton-winning_us_581d0399e4b0e80b02ca2498">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-probability-clinton-winning_us_581d0399e4b0e80b02ca2498</a> </p>

<p>Now ask yourself how someone who seemingly has support from every government agency, mainstream media outlet, sitting/former presidents, and a myriad of popular celebrities loses the election at all. My claim is that Hillary lost the election through the electoral college <strong>AND</strong> the popular vote and tried to steal the election through coordinated mass voter fraud, most of which came from illegal immigrants in California, a state that arguably has the loosest voter ID and registration laws, as well as voter suppression with a &#39;Trump is hopeless and melting down&#39; mainstream media narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did. Even in deep blue states which they were afraid they were going to lose, which of course they did (MI, WI, PA). In PA the state police raided the DNC offices of Philadelphia and surrounding offices for voter fraud investigations before the election, which may have prevented the election theft in states like PA and IN.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of a landslide it actually must have been for Trump, especially in rural counties across the country, to have overcome the election rigging in the cities, like Broward County, FL, and Wayne County MI. They did succeed in VA, NH and NV though. I suspect without election fraud, and judging by things like rally attendance, online and volunteer enthusiasm, and yard signage that Hillary Clinton got roughly 10-20% of the popular vote, and would only have won a handful of states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>two reasons:</p>

<p>election fraud is most successful in jurisdictions one is already supposed to win, it easier to do around like minded partisans.</p>

<p>election fraud is most successful where the state govt is the same party as the candidate trying to rig.</p>

<p>most fractional tallies and vote flips occur when the county numbers are fed to the SOS. this is why you have some counties in the country notorius for &quot;hanging&quot; (waiting until all other counties have reported to report). i live in one of the most infamous--broward cty fl, i&#39;d probably drop dead from shock if ever we didn&#39;t hang.</p>

<p>if i was clinton on nov 8, and it was clear i was going to lose in an electoral college landslide, and the pop vote was only a hair&#39;s breath apart, calling up LA county to flip the votes drastically to ensure a popular vote face-saver and potential back door win, is the 1st thing i&#39;d do. </p>

<p>no one will question the out come, it isn&#39;t a state that has the power to be decisive, it is a state perceived as having honest elections (no such thing), and the vote flip ratio would be known well before the polls closed.</p>

<p>people haven&#39;t lined up real people to vote fraudlently since tammney hall, why would they when all they need to do is just tweak a computer program these days (true since the 1980s and the first optical scanners).</p>

<p>both sides cheated.</p>

<p>take tgat to the bank.</p>

<p>the cheating is done by remotely, not by trying to round up a million people to actually go to the polls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, and I feel like this point has been made, why the fuck would she try to &quot;win&quot; the popular vote? Reminder here-she didn&#39;t lose in a landslide. It was really close, and she was the heavy favorite. Let&#39;s not drop that down the memory hole just yet. But why the popular vote?? She gets absolutely nothing out of it. The popular vote is a meaningless number. It&#39;s a booby prize. And she&#39;s going to risk everything by rigging the vote in a state she is already going to win in a landslide. With illegals somehow. Putting aside the complete irrationality of this, how exactly do millions of people vote illegally on election day? Each of them shows up at a polling place with a dead person or out of stater&#39;s information memorized and hopes nobody checks? Because if anyone checks they&#39;re all fucked, right? To win nothing they take that kind of insane risk? It makes no sense. </p>

<p>Voter Fraud - Hillary did not just lose electorally, she lost the popular vote also</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh, it&#39;s much worse than that.</p>

<p>not only did she lose the electoral AND the popular vote.  But <strong>she also lost the popular vote to Bernie Sanders during the Democratic™ primaries.</strong></p>

<h1>Bernie Sanders would have beat Trump™</h1>

<p>INDY 500 ANALOGY:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>33 Cars</p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s starting position was 33 - polling (literally) the least popular candidate in US history.</p></li>
<li><p>During the race, Trump&#39;s position improved to #15 -- mostly because Bush and the rest of the Republican part totally spun out.</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary took-out (sabotage, extortion, blackmail, murder, etc) the rest of the cars - including Bernie Sanders (who had &quot;pole position&quot; - polling the most popular POTUS candidate in US history)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the race came down to crooked Hillary™ vs. Donald (&quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;) Trump</p>

<p><strong>Personally, I blame cooked Hillary for stealing the election from Bernie Sanders.</strong></p>

The right to vote is there to make sure that you are able to vote for candidates that you believe in or at least somewhat agree with.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was not blanket red or anything. The state where I live, both party options were decent in almost all positions. Everyone I know personally who voted this way spent a good deal of time on research (which makes me so happy). </p>

<p>But many did it as a knee jerk reaction. People should ALWAYS do their research. It&#39;s absolutely worth your time, and you have a moral obligation to do so if you plan on voting. </p>

<p>But if the media had accurately reported the likelihood of either winning as opposed to just stating what they wanted to have happen, hoping that it would get some idiots who want to make sure they are on the winning side, results would have been different. It&#39;s crazy to think how much the media can influence an election.  </p>

<p>Now, knowing that, when you reread what you wrote, its almost impossible to take anything youve ever written seriously. Its too ridiculous. You claim only idiots fall for it. But trumps de facto spokesperson told trump people what it is and to believe the alternative facts. </p>

<p>And you claim she is liberal media and only idiots believe it. Im seriously shocked right now, this is like a really special type of stupid that needs to be cherished and appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf are you talking about? Muddying the waters on the issue?? </p>

<p>Registering to vote in CA is laughably easy- I live in CA and registered from my iPhone! </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a social or an ID nor a license to vote. All you need is the internet, an address to send your ballot and to checkmark the box saying you are a legal US citizen. Bam, you&#39;re done and a registered voter. I&#39;m sure people who illegally crossed the border to live in the US wouldn&#39;t also illegally vote. /s </p>

<p>Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe me, please know everything I&#39;ve said can be verified by going directly to the source. You can see for yourself - heck, fill out all the steps. This need to be seen because it&#39;s the truth: <a href="http://registertovote.ca.gov">http://registertovote.ca.gov</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/11/30/voter-fraud-california-republicans-online-registration/">http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/11/30/voter-fraud-california-republicans-online-registration/</a></p>

<p>Ahhh here&#39;s Breitbart with one of the world&#39;s most misleading headlines and articles, which includes the very telling </p>

<p>&quot;The California GOP has not produced evidence that any voter fraud actually took place through online registration in 2016.&quot; </p>

<p>It then takes swipes at how &quot;outdated&quot; (2012) CA&#39;s voting technology and database programs are, considering it is a tech-savy state (as if that&#39;s relevant at all). Then finishes with the idea that </p>

<p>&quot;The task of managing voter registration in California is complicated by the fact that the state is home to a high proportion of the nation’s illegal aliens, some of whom volunteered openly for the Hillary Clinton campaign to register others to vote.&quot;</p>

<p>So there&#39;s the proof everyone-- a series of partisan doubts and suspicions, not facts or data. Former Breitbart head honcho Bannon is now Chief Strategist, and I&#39;m sure he knows which ideas their base will respond to most strongly because his site has featured such ideas, without proof. He&#39;s a propagandist, which is why Trump is allowed to make these claims, fitting a long-running narrative. </p>
