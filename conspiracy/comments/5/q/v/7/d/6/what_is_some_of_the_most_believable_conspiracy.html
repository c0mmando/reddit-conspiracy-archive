    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one smoking gun in particular where the moon is concerned and its from NASA themselves. In their own files they listed the lower end operational temperatures of the lunar buggys battery as -50c but they themselves recorded the night time temperature -20c lower than that. So if that battery had been there all night then there is no way on this earth :) that the battery would be operational again, ever. So some info they&#39;ve given is very wrong. Yet we&#39;ve all seen that buggy driving on the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the crack epidemic thing 100%. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been my theory that LBJ was an unparalleled racist who designed the policies of the War on Povery to consolidate poor blacks into the inner cities with his housing projects.  Anyone who studied crime knows that crime is rampant anywhere Ther is consolidated, high density of people living in poverty.  He knew that there would be no real escape, and instead welfare and food stamps were created to keep those people dependent on the Democrat teat.  Crack introduced in the 80&#39;s to keep the in the system.  Race baiting in the 90&#39;s-00&#39;s, and identity politics today.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party has intentionally done this, and continues to do it to maintain a stranglehold on that voting block.  It&#39;s also why the dens are so illegal immigration friendly - they want more loyal subjects.  Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes so much sense. Although, I don&#39;t think LBJ should shoulder all the blame there. Penning certain groups in benefits a lot of these shady groups. The lower classes of all races are the foot soldiers in the endless wars, the continuously flowing inhabitants of the prison system, and the consumers and puppets in weapons of mass distraction, like sports and pop music. So this was likely bigger than LBJ. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s crisis actors, not in the sense that every national tragedy is fake but like the government does it to protect people who were involved or lost someone in it. I think that not everyone that went through a traumatic event would want to go on the news and relive the experience, and putting their face out there would make them a target for harassment too. So I think it would make sense for the government(or whoever) to hire an actor to pretend to be that person so the media could do a story about it without invading the victim&#39;s privacy. Although I&#39;d like to add I think Sandy Hook was fake, something was definitely not right with that. </p>
