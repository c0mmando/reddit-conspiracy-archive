       Yes, what Donald is doing is wrong and the fact that he's not including Saudia Arabia should concern people that even support action.  But after all the bloodshed in the Middle East, NOW the public and media go into a frenzy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the outrage with the rest of our Middle East policy?  Tulsi Gabbard just told the American people we are funding ISIS, Obama/Hillary destroyed Libya and Syria over oil/currency, Hillary took bribes from the Saudis while in government, Rupert Murdoch and Cheney are continuing to steal oil in Syria through their Genie Oil organization, Obama gave numerous executive orders over drone strikes, which killed many civilians, and the Bush cabal started this mess with Iraq and Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT JUST NOW WE'RE A FASCIST REGIME? I'M I MISSING SOMETHING?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm comparing all these actions because they all surround Middle East policy.

       Some did some didn't. Fox News basically cheerleaded the whole effort leading up to the war and the war itself.  Other media outlets eventually jumped on board in the early days when the war looked like it was going well, from the invasion of Baghdad to Bush's retarded landing on a carrier to celebrate. Hell, even most dems supported the war.  Anyone who questioned it in any way was labeled unpatriotic or a terrorist sympathizer. It was ridiculous. Even Bill O'Reilly today claims he was against the war and a critic which is a flat out lie. He was one of the biggest cheerleaders. It's hilarious how the media flip flops on stuff like this all the time or just flat out lies.

       Spoken like someone who remembers correctly.  That is exactly what happened.  If you questioned it at all, you were socially castrated, you would be relentlessly berated for even uttering a simple question, that didn't critisize the government, or the troops.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Support the troops, support the troops"  -  It was hell.  They chanted this over and over.  Dems, and Republicans.   I made the mistake of publicly questioning it, and it wasn't for a decade until people started coming around, and once they did.."I always said that."  It's rage inducing what mental gymnastics people use, and how forgetful they are.  Their are countless people I recall berating me over it, then they change their tune and state they've always held the current beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It truly is a nightmare how often people forget their own history.   I believe it comes down to them wanting to share the majority opinion, and they hold onto that opinion and won't let go.   It keeps them 'safe'.  Despicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't just the war either.  Remember telling people everything you do is being monitored online?   "You're crazy".

       It drives me up a wall.  I'm becoming psychotic in my opinion that we need to be wiped out.   Entirely.  The whole human race.  We just aren't worth it, it's one big popularity contest.

       It's because Trump is President. There is a calculated and united effort/front of the MSM and Correct The Record internet shills (Brock &amp; Co) attacking everyone from every angle how Trumps is literally Hitler because he's doing 'X' ....when you dig further, its shit that Obama was doing, but they won't do the research or plug their ears so they can continue fomenting.

       Good luck with that. It's the way of the pendulum, after 8 years of a spineless globalist sellout pc/sjw smooth talker, the momentum returns the other way to give us today's result. Same deal with Phillipines and Duterte, same deal with Putin after weak-ass Yeltsin and the USSR collapse...I think you see what I'm getting at, this is basic pattern that happens all throughout history, buckle up for the next 8 years, 'WEEEeeeeeeeeeee!'

       I wonder which sub you're here from, is it from r/politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub, since its inception, has always asked for proof and to question everything. So wherever the fuck your from, coming here, whatever is your agenda and what ever biases you are looking to have confirmed, will never happen here.

       So again, the simple question is this: Prove that I am apathetic as an actual fact.

       Yeah I know...I got it.....my initial true context is that to a very large degree, there's not much we can do about a lot of things so it's better off to sit back and watch it all go down.

       It would be nice to think we as a people, who have so many issues with the government (both the left and right), get together against that government.  But sadly, it will just be the people killing each other, or in this case, all the right wing nut jobs with 20 guns per family member will finally get the chance to mow down as many  democrats as possible.

       You do know, that Assange is indirectly saying, that Seth Rich leaked the info right? And he got killed by Hillary's henchmen for it, and Assange has a reward for info on his killer(s).

      <p>
       Assange's whole life, purpose, outlet depends completely on his leas being vetted and correct and he has a 100% track record. Its his M.O. to be truthful, this is simple logic.

       Like I said, Assange's business model is to be correct. Putting out even 1 thing that is propaganda undermines everything he stands for, so logic dictates that what he says is not Propaganda

       No. The evidence didn't come from the media... these are what independent investigations found

       Yes they did. Even in the debate Hillary mentioned them

        Assange's whole life, purpose, outlet depends completely on his leas being vetted and correct and he has a 100% track record. Its his M.O. to be truthful, this is simple logic.

      <p>
       It's simple logic that you just believe everything he says and don't question it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like I said, Assange's business model is to be correct. Putting out even 1 thing that is propaganda undermines everything he stands for, so logic dictates that what he says is not Propaganda
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What? Your argument is that it can't be propaganda because Assange would never lie? What? You can't be serious... and you actually think that a logical conclusion... wow...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No I'm not, I'm defending questioning everything. If anything, you are defending the MSM fake news narrative of 'Russian Hackers did it.'

      <p>
       Uhhh I never mentioned anything about the MSM... how could I possibly be defending them they weren't even mentioned? You are the one that is defending Russian propaganda

       I question everything, however, logic deduces that something which exists which has truth and a 100% correct track record as its sole modus operandi, would do everything it can to keep that going. Its very very simple equation. Its like needing water to live and making sure the water isn't poisoned or it will kill you

       He has a ton of imperatives to openly lie... he hates Clinton and has sworn to do anything to fight against her and has sworn to fight against the west. There is no reason to trust a single thing he says in regards to defending Russia. His business model has never been truth, it has always been anti west propaganda. Of course he would lie if it makes the west look bad.

       -- If it means Russia didn't do it, must be propaganda. If the US government says it, must be an independent investigation. Waste of time reading this exchange, albeit an entertaining one.

       That wasn't even remotely the only evidence I had... there is an extraordinarily long list of details that point to this conclusion. There are over 10 government agencies that agreed on this conclusion. Every single politician, including Trump, who has been briefed on the classified details agrees with the conclusion. There's literally not one piece of evidence suggesting this isn't true. There's a wide sweeping conspiracy of epic proportions that our country has never witnessed before and r/conspiracy is silent because the conclusions of the conspiracy are pro-west... truly embarrassing

       10 government agencies (lol). "every single politician". Do you ever go on r/conspiracy? That's not evidence, and if anything points more to it being politically motivated. You're really not seeing the bigger picture. Are you telling me you buy that "dossier"? You really believe that Trump is into "golden showers"? You probably still think Iraq has WMD's, jesus.

       That is absolutely evidence. Be suspicious but the fact that we have tons of circumstantial evidence that builds the case and then classified documents that have convinced everyone who saw it makes it pretty clear that this should be taken seriously. And good grief dude you just look at the dossier and assume it's all made up? Just cause? We already have aspects of it that have been confirmed and we know the sources are credible. We just saw Russia literally clean house in its intelligence department and top security officials with reports that it was related to leaks coming out from Russia. The evidence is pretty fucking clear. It's odd the length you would go to defend Russian propaganda... what a sad state r/conspiracy has come. It use to be full of critical thinkers that questioned everything. Now it's full of people that will just try to build a case against the west no matter how bad the evidence is.

       There isn't bipartisan agreement, that's the thing. The only people who think that, don't come here often. Intelligence Agencies don't get free passes, and politicians
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       don't-- they're all playing the political game. If you actually knew what it was like here before, you wouldn't have said that. You weren't just trying to provide a dissenting opinion, be honest. You're pushing an agenda. It's okay, we all do. But you're not turning heads by pushing out the mainstream narrative here. You don't want to exchange ideas, you want to push your own convictions on others. Your comment history is sketchy as hell as clearly paints a picture of the ideas you represent. This isn't the_donald, this isn't just a political sub-- it's a conspiracy sub. Like, honestly, you think because some politicians (r or d who gives a shit) look at "classified" material that somehow they'd never lie about that. You don't think there's a concerted effort to discredit trump, at all?

       If you actually knew what it was like here before, you would know that the emphasis was on critical thinking not absolute rejection of the west and it's establishment. You would know that suspicion of bad intelligence on WBDs was a widespread concern that isn't even remotely matched by the unanimous consensus on the issue of Russian hacks. You would know that criticisms of authority comes from evidence, not from suspicion in itself. All you have done is attacked an idea and it's evidence because a body you see as the establishment or antagonistic to your interests supported that idea. It'd be like saying evolution doesn't exist because the establishment supports it, and ignoring all the considerable evidence behind it.

       That's exactly what I was doing. The irony is that you aren't participating in critical thinking, be honest. You're pushing an agenda. It's blatantly obvious. In for forming conclusions based on evidence and criticizing those in power based on evidence. You're for criticizing those in power to push your anti-west, pro Russian agenda. I could just as well have said you were a shill (but I would not sink that low). The irony is that we actually have evidence and paper trails of Russian money spent on flooding American media with Russian propaganda. It's the biggest conspiracy of our generation. We have actual proof of Russian funded trolls on line. And yet it's you that declares I must be the shill... that I have an agenda... no. I have no agenda. I'm here for truth. It's clear that you have an agenda that is anti truth.

       Be honest dude. You're not hear for criticisms of logic or truth. You're here for your own agenda.

       Look. I get what you're saying. I'll try and meet you half way. To start, I'm not "pro-Russia" and I'm not "anti-west". I think the political establishment has for a long time been controlled by special interests. Agreed? Is it that hard to understand why I need more evidence then-- "they said so". I don't buy it anymore. I wish I could. Obviously, Russia spent money on flooding American media. Do you not think every country does that? Do you see the impact that Israel has on American politics? Practically every country in the world has a strong interest in American policy, and so do most corporations. Every Super-PAC is playing the same game. That's why the fact that they "influenced" our election just doesn't mean much for me. The troll thing sounds like a convenient excuse, too, but I'll admit I can't say they're probably not doing that. I've seen ridiculous fake news stories all over being posted on facebook, I know what they meant when that term came up. I do think that they were trying to use that as a blanket term to discredit views that didn't align with their own, but that's not the important part.

       I obviously think Russia is pursuing their own interests, and in modern history, that has conflicted at many times with our own interests, but I do think most of it was fueled by American military industrial-complex type ideas. The need an enemy to justify a ton of spending across multiple industries and sectors. Putin's not dumb, I'm sure they wanted Trump to win. I think we'd disagree on what exactly they did, and what influence that even had on the election. I think Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate, and I think the emails were leaked to Julian Assange without Russian involvement. I could be swayed on that, but I haven't seen the evidence. I'm not just taking you or them at their word.

       Do you have any sources or information that make you think Russia
       <em>

       with Trump to give him the election. Them using trolls and propoganda is nothing new, and it's not enough for me. I'm not being a dick anymore. Honestly thinking critically here.

       I only brought it up because you insinuated I was doing the same. You don't see any irony here? That you're more inclined to call someone out as a shill who defends a consensus in the MSM and establishment but when someone is defending Russian interests you hesitate about using the word troll...

       But in the context of everything else you said, with obvious reasons on Russia's part for manipulation, context where we can trace some level of coordination between Trumps campaign and Russia, context where even the available intelligence suggests a Russian source for the hacks, and where Russia cleans house after these leaks, you don't go "hey maybe there's some truth here?" In all that context, where you know that these classified intelligence briefings can't just go public and where we both know that it's certainly like that there are more details in those briefings that might convince if available, of course bipartisan consensus will be another piece to that puzzle that helps to form my decision. How can you say it doesn't, without making it clear that you have a very obvious anti west agenda. You can be skeptical, you can not believe what they say, but the context is damning. That's not saying even a portion of that Dossier is true. That's not saying because this consensus is true, that must mean I think there were WMDs (which was never a consensus). All it's saying is that the evidence is damning and I support further investigation to see if there is any evidence of direct coordination with Trump and Russia. The r/conspiracy I know would be diving deep into every single document related to this case. Debating every possible connection. Investigating a multinational conspiracy of corruption of the most powerful man in the world. But that's not what they're doing... I jump in with some modest dissent and get called a shill with an agenda... no one here wants to think critically about this, because they've been duped in the messaging that Trump is an anti establishment figure, rather than the corrupt billionaire who was part of the problem in the first place.

       Not a bad compilation of his ties to Russia, although a lot of them are pretty loose connections, and many of the Trump quotes could certainly be attributed to his reactionary tendencies, I'll give it to you that I've at least entertained ideas with
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       less evidence in the past. I'll entertain this one, there's some interesting stuff there, no doubt. These are difficult waters to navigate because the implications are so time-sensitive. This isn't a conspiracy like JFK, The Moon Landing, or even 9/11 because we aren't in the moment for those. We are in this moment right now. Some of the stuff in there seemed like cherry-picking after the fact stuff, but I agree its 100%
       <em>
        plausible
       </em>
       . Even still, I think Russia's hand is being over-stated, and at best they tipped the election, and not necessarily outright gave it to him. Without saying that I particularly
       <em>
        buy
       </em>
       that there was as much deliberate collusion and impact as that was implying, I will say I absolutely agree it's being overlooked, especially by r/conspiracy. Sorry for being a dick. For every 1 of you there's 10 assholes that have no idea what they're talking about that are pissed that their guy didn't win. I'm not even a Trump guy, but my pre-conceived biases have definitely led me to give him way too much benefit of the doubt. He's been very fortunate to be contrasted against Hillary this whole time.

       I completely agree that there is political relevance to this discussion that can bias the narrative in either direction. I never said we know there was foul play on Trumps end or that we know the dossier is true. Just saying the case is pretty astounding and that I would never discredit classified information just because it's not available for me to see. And that further I want this to be looked into more and get all the details. Thanks for being a reasonable individual band having a thoughtful discussion. But as you say Trumps been fortunate for being contrasted against Hillary I would say the reverse is true for Hillary where she got it far worse with Trump than she would have with any other candidate. The whole election devolved into ad hominems and conspiracy theories going both ways, and it's easy to see who could benefit from such an environment. I don't know how much attention her fainting spell would have got and talk about Parkinson's if the election hadn't devolved into that. But that's once again an example where it's hard to separate "climate trump created? Or climate Russian propaganda created?"
      </p>
      <p>
       As for providing a tipping point, I think you could say that about literally every issue. When an election is won by 80k votes, you can blame almost any one thing as the cause because technically it's true that that one factor could have changed 80k+ minds. The case is worse when compounded with all the baggage associated with Trumps win (Comey, Russia, fake news, xenophobia, racism, sexism) that you could argue the greatest contributing factors to this win were these non-policy factors that have no comparison to any modern election and that all leave a bad taste in the average Americans mouth.

       I don't think trump's response is wrong, it was all of the events that led to a situation where what he's doing is right that are completely fucked up. It's like getting mad at the maid for cleaning up after a party because she has to throw out the carpet.

       "In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American ... There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag ... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language ... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people."

       While I have sympathy for people of foreign birth in dire straits (Especially when the USA is the cause or reason for the increase of pain on a population), we do NOT have people who want to be AMERICANS coming here (YES, some do, but we are speaking to the OVERALL groups, not niches here).  They simply want to RECREATE their former homes HERE.  We are supposed to accept anyone and everyone without regard to available resources or impact on those born here.

       America SHOULD NOT be in the Empire business, it should NOT be involved in the politics of the Middle East (you know except that the BIG OIL Companies are some of the owners of the US Government), and we SHOULD NOT be the police force or nursemaid to the rest of the world.  Regardless of our role, in the past, our future SHOULD be focused on fixing the MANY issues in the US before we turn our attentions to the rest of the world.

       Indeed. Bravo! And I wonder when this paradigm got turned on its head. My grandfather's generation came here because they wanted to be American and, even though cultural assimilation was slow (largely due to the Americans already here), it occurred. That assimilation no longer takes place. Immigrants want to retain their cultural values, even where they conflict with "American". A prime example is the Women's March individual who wanted to establish, and extend, Sharia law.

       I completely agree that there is political relevance to this discussion that can bias the narrative in either direction. I never said we know there was foul play on Trumps end or that we know the dossier is true. Just saying the case is pretty astounding and that I would never discredit classified information just because it's not available for me to see. And that further I want this to be looked into more and get all the details. Thanks for being a reasonable individual band having a thoughtful discussion. But as you say Trumps been fortunate for being contrasted against Hillary I would say the reverse is true for Hillary where she got it far worse with Trump than she would have with any other candidate. The whole election devolved into ad hominems and conspiracy theories going both ways, and it's easy to see who could benefit from such an environment. I don't know how much attention her fainting spell would have got and talk about Parkinson's if the election hadn't devolved into that. But that's once again an example where it's hard to separate "climate trump created? Or climate Russian propaganda created?"

       As for providing a tipping point, I think you could say that about literally every issue. When an election is won by 80k votes, you can blame almost any one thing as the cause because technically it's true that that one factor could have changed 80k+ minds. The case is worse when compounded with all the baggage associated with Trumps win (Comey, Russia, fake news, xenophobia, racism, sexism) that you could argue the greatest contributing factors to this win were these non-policy factors that have no comparison to any modern election and that all leave a bad taste in the average Americans mouth.
