       That is still not proof of brigating. Brigating means that users are redirected intentionally from a sub to another. The post has hit
       <a href="/r/all">

       The top post on this sub right now thats telling everyone the sub id being brigaded by shills and to shut down discussion of the Russian spy and only focus on pizzagate is form a user with a 14 day old acount who posts almost exclusively on T_D. Kind of ironic. Also interesting that it is the #1 post while only having 50% upvoting.

       It was probably removed because that post, and the comments within that post were clearly an attempt to brigade this sub and discredit/distract from pizzagate. That fucking post went to #1 on r/conspiracy, r/all, r/politics and r/frontpage within 20 minutes of being posted. If that's not a brigade, then I don't know what is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention multiple sources have already debunked the pissgate bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your brigading elsewhere. It won't work here. We're smarter than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a word of advice; we will find you. All of you. All of you who are defending and helping these pedophiles and human traffickers. All of you who allow this sick shit to happen. All of you who actively try to discredit pizzagate. All of you who think it's okay that kids are being raped and murdered...

       to
       <a href="/r/all">

       within 20 minutes? i would love to know how did that happen too.

       also the post was not about pissgate, it was about a KGB agent that is linked to Trump's dossier file found dead. nobody was discussing about pissgate in the post.

       again, are there any rules preventing a conspiracy involving Trump to be discussed in

       AFAIK users were saying that in their opinion, there are more solid proof about Trump's ties to Russia than Pizzagate, and should be discussed on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as such. There were no intentions to disprove Pizzagate whatsoever as the main focus of the discussion was still on the KGB agent found dead, and the conspiracy around it.

       people are still discussing it on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , i'm pretty sure that there are people who still believe that it is possibly true. but the KGB post 100% got removed citing "
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       brigating", are we 100% sure that is true? i still don't see any actual proof being presented so far.

       lol r/conspiracy is a joke, about as unbiased as WikiLeaks at this point. no one can separate evidence and content from agenda, the only honest thing you can do is own up to your own biases. but this sub will never do that because it's fueled by manic, cowardly finger pointing.

       Only r/The_Donald is allowed to brigade the r/conspiracy subreddit...people should understand that by now. Anytime something anti-Trump gets voted to the top, it's clearly due to outside influences and deserves to be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't have people questioning their own beliefs around here. This subreddit, like r/politics and r/the_donald, needs to be an echo chamber to protect the fragile minds around here which are unable to even entertain the possible validity of different perspectives. Join the hive mind or go elsewhere!

       Pretty sure we all know... it's because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is the new
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They want a safe space where they can discuss cheese pizza with each other without anyone else interfering. The fact that it went to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       meant it got exposure to the "normies", who came in and started giving their own opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This greatly violated the safe space here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and they called it brigading, when, in fact, it was really just people with differing opinions coming in and participating.
