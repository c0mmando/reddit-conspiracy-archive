    <div class="md"><p>It was probably removed because that post, and the comments within that post were clearly an attempt to brigade this sub and discredit/distract from pizzagate. That fucking post went to #1 on r/conspiracy, r/all, r/politics and r/frontpage within 20 minutes of being posted. If that&#39;s not a brigade, then I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

<p>Not to mention multiple sources have already debunked the pissgate bullshit.</p>

<p>Take your brigading elsewhere. It won&#39;t work here. We&#39;re smarter than that. </p>

<p>Also, a word of advice; we will find you. All of you. All of you who are defending and helping these pedophiles and human traffickers. All of you who allow this sick shit to happen. All of you who actively try to discredit pizzagate. All of you who think it&#39;s okay that kids are being raped and murdered...</p>

<p>We. Will. Find. You. </p>

<p>Your day is coming. Are you prepared for the hell we will unleash on you?? </p>

<p>also the post was not about pissgate, it was about a KGB agent that is linked to Trump&#39;s dossier file found dead. nobody was discussing about pissgate in the post. </p>

<p>again, are there any rules preventing a conspiracy involving Trump to be discussed in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? </p>
