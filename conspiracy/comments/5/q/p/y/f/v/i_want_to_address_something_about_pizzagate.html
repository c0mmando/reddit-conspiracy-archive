       Honestly, nothing is more annoying than seeing Pizzagate threads get derailed by people attacking each other. If you don't like a Pizzagate thread, maybe you can just ignore it? This sub is literally about conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the love of God, PLEASE stop replying with the same attacks.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If Pizzagate is real why haven't we seen pictures of children being raped???
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Maybe because if Pizzagate is real, the victims wouldn't be allowed to see the light of day.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pizzagate is so dumb, it's just emails and Intagram pictures
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Well perhaps if you did more research, you would realize that there are a lot more connections being made.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We all know child trafficking exists moron! You really think CPP is raping children behind the cash register???
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No, we don't think that, we believe it's much bigger than that.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey guys, I like Pizza, and I am pedo???? See you guys are dumb
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Not even worth replying to
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Don't like Pizzagate threads? Then post your comments without attacking someone, or explore other threads. We've got plenty of threads here: Aliens, Antarctica, Obama, Trump, ISIS. Check out those threads! There's plenty of content for you here! When you attack threads, you just divide the subreddit even more, which is the last thing we need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find what interests you. Pizzagate interests me, and many others. So on that note, we're going to continue doing our armchair investigation, and if nothing results from it, oh well, it was 100% worth the investigation.

       In my experience, the best way to peg a shill vs a legit disagreement is whether or not they're willing to hold a civil conversation about the topic of choice. I'm completely fine with people not believing in any of my pet conspiracy theories, as long as we can talk about it without me getting insulted and berated the entire conversation.

       Decent point, but realize that many shills have gotten hip to your understanding of this mode of conversation, and some have as a result gotten to the point where they make attempts at refuting you in as cordial a manner as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is to say that just because someone doesn't argue with you and call you names, they may actually still be a shill.

       One indicator is if they continue attempting to argue (politely or not) after you've already refuted them.  If they don't acknowledge the points you've made and simply keep arguing the same trope after you've already successfully shot it down, then they may not be there to learn.

       Yeah, but it's not like that behavior isn't common with "normal" people in a discussion either though. Changing your opinion on a topic is not that common from my experience, and people routinely ignore points someone made just to "win" an online debate. People with an open mind to change their previously held believe is quite rare I think. Or maybe I'm just too used to too many shitty online arguments

       I'm not doubting that it's real, and debating shills is of no use for anyone. It's just that people calling other people "shills" is a new pet peeve of mine. I see it quite often these days, it's an easy way to not get into any discussion with people you don't agree with
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the ones employing the shills are to blame for all this, it's just natural that people have become very suspicious. But I also think it has become a trump card for anyone wanting to shut-down any discussion

       Some discussions aren't worth having, however.  Obviously not referring to this one, as we're still having it, but some individuals - even if they're not shills and are "honestly" disagreeing - are so obstinate in their thought process that attempting to show them a different perspective is not worth the effort.  The key, it seems, is to be able to differentiate which conversation is which and act accordingly.

       Your post was good.  Is just stressful getting that balance of no censorship while still having decorum.  We're on the same side.  Just downvote the crap, waste little time and energy on them, and move on.

       I point everyone, including shills, to voat.  They are the specialists and have all the infrastructure for it.  That is pizzagate central.

       Seems to be gaining traction as to why we give pizzagate the attention we do with limited facts while Trump dossier has limited facts and it doesn't get traction here.

       I don't think you can write this away as pedos protecting their lifestyle, as the rudeness comes pretty much from both sides. Unless you're suggesting that nerves have been struck on both sides?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have mostly followed this thing from a skeptical point of view, asking all the weird questions that turn up in my head, instead of just downing the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being, that if you start asking skeptical questions into this thing, that doesn't support the "official" pizzagate narrative, the story revolving around podesta and pizzaguy with the fbi-code spirals etc. - You will most likely be hit by the downvoting brigade, then probably get called either a shill or a pedo-supporter, and have absolutely nothing resembling any answer to your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which in turn makes questions turn up in my head once again - either something is up with the pushing of this thing, or perhaps things
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       look like a conspiracy when you start to look at it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have since more or less quit the discussion - could that be the whole point of pizzagate, to kill off any
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       discussion about human trafficking, by turning this thing into a huge mud slinging argument between to sides?

       So we, people that do not believe pizzagate is legit are not allowed to attempt to discuss it in those threads? Where would we, then? Create our own threads? By your very own standards, then pizzagaters wouldn't be able to comment in our threads.

       Calling it dumb may be an attack, sure. But it is emails, instagram pictures, 4chan code words, and very loose links people have made that have proven nothing. Even with those links people claim to have made, I can at I'll ask "who is the victim? Who is the perpetrator? Where when and how did this crime take place? What specific crime?"

       Calling someone is a moron is a an attack, but the rest of that is not. While hyperbole, it's a valid question if it's toned down. Pizzagate has been going after CPP and BestaPizza like nobody's business because of "tunnels", "basements, "kill rooms", videos of kids "Crying for help", etc.

       Notice how I can discuss this without attacking anyone? OP doesn't want that. OP wants me to stay out of pizzagate threads. This isn't T_D where if you don't agree with the flavor of the week, your posts get deleted and you get banned. This is conspiracy, where we all discuss any and all esoteric topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If OP doesn't like people opposing his pizzagate threads, then he should stop posting them. People like myself want to discuss why we think it's BS. Some of us think pizzagate itself is a conspiracy to slander the alternative media and the conspiracy theorist community. Are we not entitled to try to enlighten people on why we believe that?

       Quite the contrary. It's to establish a precedent, because often times you hear from skeptics that it's too crazy to be true. Yet, it's happened before and was coverd up. Just like it is now.

       It's one thing to say "here was the Franklin scandal. Here was epstein. Here was Saville. Etc" and then "so here's what we have with pizzagate"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's another to say "Here's all of these cases and they are part of pizzagate". Even if you guys think you're 100% right, if there is even a 0.00000001% chance you're wrong and then proven wrong somehow, you've just lumped all previous, proven to be true scandals with a false scandal. It really brings down any future credibility you and the community as a whole has and it detracts people from wanting to find out from those true scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, another issue I have with pizzagate is the YouTube videos. Every video I've seen has to emotionally charge you before they present their case. It's "here are these other cases, here's why pizzagate is one of them." Or my favorite is the "now I'm only going to provide the information with no bias, just keep in mind that what you're going to see in this video is very disturbing and these people are extremely sick and twisted." (And nothing on a YouTube video is 'disturbing'. In the context of pizzagate, if there were disturbing material, it would be removed for violating terms of service)
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, if the information that was being presented was valid and pizzagate had an extremely solid foundation to stand on, they wouldn't need to emotionally charge you.

       I like your response which is really comprehensive and I can tell that you do want to discuss the topic. For every user like you, there are many more who do not pit this much effort in, and on top of it downvote people they disagree with and thus discourage discussion. You may prove yourself a quality user, but having vetted yourself, you still do not address the larger issue of low effort shilling that happens on most threads when pizzagate is brought up on any social media platform.

I gave it a chance which is why I participated but it's mostly just used for political points by t_d. I have yet to be convinced. I'm just tired commenting about it to be honest.

       is just a subtle way to discredit. A good conversation is not filled with attempts to shut it down by killing the messenger. I say this, acknowledging that there are those that try to shut pizzagate down. But, if a conversation stops because of the facts presented then it shut down.

       I mean, I could accuse you all of shilling as well when it comes to anti-pizzagate threads. I don't do that because I'm more concerned with the information presented, not who's presenting it.

       It's difficult not to get defensive when saying you aren't convinced of the evidence just ends up getting you called a shill, a member of CTR, or a pedophile trying to protect your own.  With some of the mods being bought, it's not like they're going to do anything to correct it.  There's a decent amount of people really pushing for it and trying to suppress dissent, which as a skeptic makes me want to fight back.

       Pizzagate is not only real, it's provably real without ANY of the instagram pictures or even the podesta emails but good ole-fashioned investigative journalism.   Tying William Engdahl's red line and the ratline article with eva bartletts's white helmets, with several other known connections made from mainstream sources like wikipedia and mainstream press articles (backed by news articles, wikileaks documents, foia documents, etc), Cynthia McKinney in 2004 congressional inquest of Rummsfeld over the 2.3T missing by the DOD,  George Webb's investigation has proven that Dyncorp is involved in human sex trafficking, and that Dyncorp is a defense services subsidiary of the intelligence community / cia; and that Clinton Foundation is linked up with these people in Libya, Syria, Mexico, Haiti, and in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI is actually on this case and actively working with Webb, which means that Pizzagate is being actively investigated by whitehats within the intelligence community
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's like everyone thought.  The baddies are the ones running CTR on pizzagate.  Anyone who actively and aggressively fights pizzagate is NOT ignorant of it, they are actually controlled opposition--ie they are a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, you're going to have enough information that a normal person would simply "give up in self shame" over this issue and 'drop it'.  When someone is proved wrong about something very immoral, they basically shut up about it and stop talking and move on or change the subject, because people don't like "being made wrong", "admitting they were wrong", "admitting they were fooled by someone", "admitting they were involved in or passed along disinformation", or "realizing they are on the wrong side of history".  That point has already passed now for the average person.  The point at which there should be no doubt as to whether there is something to this pizzagate thing.  Anyone still clinging to it must then be a paid astroshill for the bad guys trying to run damage control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look around you.  That's a shitload of people.  Some say it's 1000 new accounts here.  Think of how much this is costing them to keep 1000 employees trolling on social media...not just reddit but the hundreds of other websites on the internet, including even bigger sites like twitter and facebook...

       I don't see how this thinking helps anything. It seems like a way to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with you about this subject. I've argued against Pizzagate because the information I've seen hasn't convinced me, but that doesn't mean I'm a fake person. I could be mistaken, or you could be.

       Very good point. Literally more than 95% of the comments in

        this
       </a>
       thread are people bashing pizzagate saying there is no evidence, calling people insane yada yada. I fully believe that "flat-earth" theory is garbage meant to distract from real conspiracies, but I would never go into a pro-FE thread and start calling people insane. I think there is something else going on here along the lines of real pedos coming out of the shadows to defend their sick lifestyle.

       There are plenty of people who challenge flat earth when it's brought up. Pizzagate has many more advocates here than flat earth ever did, but even in flat earth posts with 5-10 upvotes I've seen fights break out.

       That word has lost its original meaning because of the way it's tossed around here so loosely by both sides of the argument. Evidence does not mean video footage of Alefantis fucking a kid in the basement of Comet Ping Pong. That would be proof. Evidence would be James Alefantis himself commenting on his own Instagram using words like #chickenlover to describe a weird picture of a man holding a boy with a yellow necklace around the two. How much more obvious do they have to be? They would laugh their asses off at this thread.

       They said there was an investigation and there was not. How can they determine if there was "no evidence" if they haven't looked. Looking is investigating. I hope

       That's where you're wrong. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence, pointing to a conspiracy of pedophilia and child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence is harder to fake than hard evidence, and law enforcement knows this. Circumstances can't be faked. Especially when it's dozens and dozens of circumstances. People are convicted and go to prison on circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know these pedo rings exist. We know they exist in the highest realms of power. They are busted all the time. These are not crimes where a body is left behind, as in a homicide. Kids disappear without a trace. And the ones that don't, disassociate from realty or suffer PTSD to such an extent that no one listens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never before have we seen the MSM so active in hiding something, calling it fake before it's officially investigated. Even to the point of deleting separate stories of pedophilia from around the world that might put more attention on pizzagate. Norway was just rocked by a pedo scandal involving top politicians. It's every country. Just a couple years child porn was found on dozens of Pentagon computers, then quietly swept under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is international child trafficking we're dealing with, and it's not about Hillary in the basement of a pizza place. You have been lied to by the media about what it is since the beginning. Because it is so big that it's going to take down a lot of powerful people and institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a political witchhunt and it sucks if anyone refuses to accept, even the possibility, that kids are being hurt because it doesn't agree with their political viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's all support a thorough investigation because otherwise this is not going away ever. The harder the pushback, the harder the push.

       Actually, a lot of "sane" people will argue against it because they view Pizzagate information propagators as attacking their intelligence.  Deniers don't believe it is true and feel compelled to attack the other side in order to feel better about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Pizzagate researchers have done an excellent job taking a rational approach to everything by putting potential child victims first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe a section of the elite are able to broker sex with children and get away with it.  Hopefully we can put aside our differences as a global society and agree that sex with children is unacceptable and then actually take measures to stop and prevent it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all this Pizzagate stuff is false, then it certainly doesn't harm anyone to actually investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is true, then it does quite a bit of harm to not investigate.

       after an honest look tho, i don't believe a "sane" person (someone who is operating on logic rather than emotion) could turn away... if these same facts were presented to the public without revealing who the actors in it are, truly "sane" people would be outraged and demand resolution.

       I would argue investigating some one for being a pedo could do long lasting damage to thier reputation even if the investigation brings up nothing. And lets be honest how many pizzagate followers would actually belive any investigation that takes place that says pizzagate is false? I doubt any of them really would belive it. It's the nature of a conspiracy theory not to believe the official public possition of those in power.

       It's not even this, it's the conspiracy community, so the "sane" people are used to getting exposed to theories and information that is outside the mainstream, and seem "out there".

       What bothers me about this is more the outright disregard of constitutional rights that gets me all hot and bothered. The fact that this is dominating the discussion scares the hell out of me.

       Another thing that gets to me is that pizzagate is clearly getting pushed from somewhere, and the community is eating it up like candy, when instead questions should be asked about what the agenda is here.

       No you're not. If it were "for the children" then you'd be filing police reports and making contacts in law enforcement in order to get a real investigation going.

       And to add to this, a common skeptic question: "

        If it's real, then where are all the complaining parents?"
       </em>

      <p>
       Where to begin!
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, there could be up to 500,000 children that go missing each year, in the U.S. alone. Sadly, they do not know the total number because many are never reported. The number could be much higher. This number is then multiplied when you take more countries into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the children kidnapped from crisis areas like Haiti, or refugees that go missing from places like Syria by White Helmets. We are only beginning to understand how big this problem is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have surrogate mothers who are trafficked by criminal organizations for the sole purpose of having children for further trafficking. We have no idea how big these numbers could be.

       Pizzagate is propaganda spread by Trump and his supporters. There's no denying it.

       This just isn't true. Sure, there may be Trump supporters, and they may be vocal, but not all supporters of PG are Trump supporters. Eventually PG will incriminate one of their guys (Trump or one of his buddies) and the Trump supporters will filter themselves out. Stephen Corbett (a well known conspiracy researcher and documentarian) even encourages people to continue researching into PG, and he's definitely not a Trump supporter.

       See the people that claim pizzagate isn't real (like this guy) always come in on the attack, with nothing to back up their claims. They aren't here to actually view the information behind pizzagate or have rational discussions over it. They're here to scream about Trump being a cheeto, bring up (debunked) pissgate, and argue in circles just to waste your time. Just downvote the dissenters and move on, it's not worth anyone's time.

       That's actually not too strange, especially in the democratic party. It might even be cliché that a political matchmaker and power broker is a restaurant owner, Like Tony in "The Professional." But in my hometown, there's a couple of bars that are
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       Dem meeting and deal making places. And 25 years ago, it was just one Greek restaurant.

       Alefantis seems to be involved in the art side of things quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also odd that he acquires property for almost no money at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smells like a giant money laundering operation for Democrats to turn "campaign finances" into art, real estate, and eventually liquid assets.  The pedophilia aspect may be true for a number of the involved and I think if it's connected to money laundering, then that could explain why a large cover up is underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not likely that all high level politicians connected to Alefantis are into pedophilia, but I bet all of them have skin in the game to keep a money laundering story from rising up through the dough and cheese.

       That's not a valid response. I asked for something that can't be easily explained, and you failed to provide evidence. Calling people trolls is not good enough. Back up your assertions with evidence.

       He's asking questions that are easily answerable. Honest discussion is fine but there are pizzagate threads all over full of concern trolls like this asking the same questions over and over without even doing in searching. It's attempting to discredit people looking into this.

       Concern trolling is a method of discrediting an idea, not a person.

      <p>
       What

        YOU

       Personally, I have not yet seen any easy answers to be more than shallow coincidences painted up with disinfo tactics until they look sinister.

      <p>
       I think I would change my mind if I saw evidence of a crime, but there's only "suspicious behavior", and all the examples of suspicious behavior are single instances taken over years of media, rather than patterns such as would be seen from a habitual criminal.

       Thank you. I was about to post a similiar thread myself. 
It'd be as if we went to r/politics and told them to stop talking about politics or going to r/gardening and calling them stupid for being into flowers. 
The shills are using mostly ad hominem attacks instead of debating the finer points. We need to develop a plan against these shills.

       This shows it can very easily be covered up check out George webb's videos if you want to see the connections. Many people thinks it's just the use of dodgy code words in the emails but the coincidences and links just keep adding up that it is impossible to say it can just be stupid conspiracy theory that has clearly been debunked, something fishy is most definitely going on.

       In addition, their testimony is fairly consistent, they didn't think anyone would believe them.  Pizzagate is different, people are

       Trying to monetize a smear campaign? What motive would he have to do this and I don't see how any of the content is monetized either? I think you've got your mind set in stone that something like this can't be true which is fine. But do you not think this deserves a investigation? Even if there is only the slightest chance that there are children are being harmed in this do you not think it deserves an investigation at the least? You have to admit something is not right ,from the emails and the Instagram alone, just on this slight possibility that many children are being harmed an investigation should take place instantly. But so far there has been NO official investigation which is absolutely appalling. Whether you believe in pizzagate or not you must agree there should be an investigation no?

       I genuinely apologize, but I'm not interested in debating my opinion here.  In my experience, the people who believe in pizzagate are not swayed by any of the conclusions I've come to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're genuinely worried you might be accusing innocent people of pedophilia, and that you might be wrong, then let me know and I'll elaborate.  But I've spent literally days of my time going over every point and it has proven to be a complete waste of time.

       interested to see if there's anything more solid.  Are you aware of any other evidence?

       I see where you coming there is no concrete evidence found yet which is why there needs to be an investigation. I don't by any means want this to be true I just want to actually be investigated properly for the simple fact that there may be something going on. I'm sure with all the circumstantial evidence gathered at the moment any other investigation would've have began but so there has been nothing apart from the DC police claiming they had investigated when they actually did not. If it's proven false and a real investigation takes place then people will trail off the conspiracy but an investigation needs to take place, whether it is true or false it is justified and needs to happen.

       as suspicious for political purposes, and harassed on that basis.

       the standards I hold for reddit, and didn't see enough to merit an investigation.  But thanks for your time.

       We did investigate.  After looking at the evidence we found, I think we don't have merit for any further intrusion.   I also came to the conclusion that the investigation itself was simply the result of a politically motivated smear campaign that survived past the election.

      <p>
       That's not true and you know it.  An official investigation did nothing to stop Sandy Hook conspiracy theories.  Our old government is
       <em>
        out of power
       </em>
       , having
       <em>
        never leveraged the tragedy
       </em>
       to the political ends we were assured they were seeking.  But people still hold on to it.  The families of the victims still have to keep their facebook profiles private for harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I were shilling for Trump I'd leverage the investigation as "proof" that they were suspicious and that my concerns were justified.  I'd  leverage the result (which I expect would be innocence) to distract from whatever Trump was doing.

       What do you mean by attacking though? The only people who I eve see attacked are anti-pizza get and get attacked for being called a shill. A dose of skepticism is healthy both ways, it's good for people to question things. It's good for people to question pizza gate just as much as it is for you to question the people behind it. I'll say pizza gate is dumb all day but I'll never tell you to stop looking in to it.

       I'm gonna sound like a shill, so lemme preept that and say that upfront, coz im not yo, check my post history. I realised yesterday, that 800000 kids are year are not being kidnapped by podesta alone, though of course he deserves the worst punishments. I had a street knife fight with someone in India and went to lite-jail holiday home like in manali for 3 months. There, inside, i saw the true face of humanity. Pedophiles were spread in a huge numbe ramong the inmates, the population, etc. There were 3 people in from 60 for under age rape. 14-15 others used to talk about having sec with 14 16 year old girls as normal. I think all over the world, there are a huge number of pedophiles, just look at the news stories of rape and murder of kids that poor and uneducated do. So do the rich and powerful. Does it mean we put 100% effort into going after the rich guys alone and shouting 24/7 from rooftops, instead of trying to highlight, if not solve, the problem itself, which is wide spread and more so among the huts, shanties, ghettos, slums than in the washington or elsewhere. I think we should just forget this shit, or do it normally, giving it equal importance along with other real problems too.

       I don't see how this thinking helps anything. It seems like a way to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with you about this subject. I've argued against Pizzagate because the information I've seen hasn't convinced me, but that doesn't mean I'm a fake person. I could be mistaken, or you could be.

       this is true.. paid, or unwitting via ignorance/ fear... everyone aware of pizzagate is either part of the Solution or part of the Problem..
      </p>
      <p>
       no sane person is going to peek into pizzagate and take away the thought that 'no investigation is necessary'...
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone who takes an unbiased, common-sense, logical view into the mounting conspiracy markers of pizzagate... must draw the conclusion that - if nothing else - it warrants a thorough investigation that produces answers and resolution.

       no one in a sane state of mind is going to argue down the value of children's lives.

       Epstein was called a serial sex offender yet it was only one victim who spoke out to start the investigation against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saville's victims only came forward after his death, years after the abuse before this the public was mourning the death a beloved star.

       This shows it can very easily be covered up check out George webb's videos if you want to see the connections. Many people thinks it's just the use of dodgy code words in the emails but the coincidences and links just keep adding up that it is impossible to say it can just be stupid conspiracy theory that has clearly been debunked, something fishy is most definitely going on.
