        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honestly, nothing is more annoying than seeing Pizzagate threads get derailed by people attacking each other. If you don&#39;t like a Pizzagate thread, maybe you can just ignore it? This sub is literally about conspiracies. </p>

<p>And for the love of God, PLEASE stop replying with the same attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Pizzagate is real why haven&#39;t we seen pictures of children being raped???</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Maybe because if Pizzagate is real, the victims wouldn&#39;t be allowed to see the light of day.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is so dumb, it&#39;s just emails and Intagram pictures</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Well perhaps if you did more research, you would realize that there are a lot more connections being made.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all know child trafficking exists moron! You really think CPP is raping children behind the cash register???</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>No, we don&#39;t think that, we believe it&#39;s much bigger than that.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey guys, I like Pizza, and I am pedo???? See you guys are dumb</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Not even worth replying to</strong></p>

<p>TL;DR - Don&#39;t like Pizzagate threads? Then post your comments without attacking someone, or explore other threads. We&#39;ve got plenty of threads here: Aliens, Antarctica, Obama, Trump, ISIS. Check out those threads! There&#39;s plenty of content for you here! When you attack threads, you just divide the subreddit even more, which is the last thing we need.</p>

<p>Find what interests you. Pizzagate interests me, and many others. So on that note, we&#39;re going to continue doing our armchair investigation, and if nothing results from it, oh well, it was 100% worth the investigation.  </p>

<p>Yeah, but it&#39;s not like that behavior isn&#39;t common with &quot;normal&quot; people in a discussion either though. Changing your opinion on a topic is not that common from my experience, and people routinely ignore points someone made just to &quot;win&quot; an online debate. People with an open mind to change their previously held believe is quite rare I think. Or maybe I&#39;m just too used to too many shitty online arguments </p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem to be all that common.  I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that.</p>

<p>Well, this has been my experience as well often time enough.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&#39;t disagree w/what you stated here, I also know there have been various OPs detailing organizations and corporations employing online shills, so they <em>do</em> exist and this is a real phenomenon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doubting that it&#39;s real, and debating shills is of no use for anyone. It&#39;s just that people calling other people &quot;shills&quot; is a new pet peeve of mine. I see it quite often these days, it&#39;s an easy way to not get into any discussion with people you don&#39;t agree with</p>

<p>Of course the ones employing the shills are to blame for all this, it&#39;s just natural that people have become very suspicious. But I also think it has become a trump card for anyone wanting to shut-down any discussion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some discussions aren&#39;t worth having, however.  Obviously not referring to this one, as we&#39;re still having it, but some individuals - even if they&#39;re not shills and are &quot;honestly&quot; disagreeing - are so obstinate in their thought process that attempting to show them a different perspective is not worth the effort.  The key, it seems, is to be able to differentiate which conversation is which and act accordingly.</p>

<p>It really makes me wonder how people in these threads are so outright rude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can write this away as pedos protecting their lifestyle, as the rudeness comes pretty much from both sides. Unless you&#39;re suggesting that nerves have been struck on both sides?  </p>

<p>I have mostly followed this thing from a skeptical point of view, asking all the weird questions that turn up in my head, instead of just downing the narrative.  </p>

<p>The point being, that if you start asking skeptical questions into this thing, that doesn&#39;t support the &quot;official&quot; pizzagate narrative, the story revolving around podesta and pizzaguy with the fbi-code spirals etc. - You will most likely be hit by the downvoting brigade, then probably get called either a shill or a pedo-supporter, and have absolutely nothing resembling any answer to your question. </p>

<p>Which in turn makes questions turn up in my head once again - either something is up with the pushing of this thing, or perhaps things <em>will</em> look like a conspiracy when you start to look at it that way.  </p>

<p>I have since more or less quit the discussion - could that be the whole point of pizzagate, to kill off any <em>actual</em> discussion about human trafficking, by turning this thing into a huge mud slinging argument between to sides? </p>

<p>If Pizzagate is real why haven&#39;t we seen pictures of children being raped???</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not an attack, it&#39;s a question. A shitty question that no one should ask because it&#39;s asking for cp</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe because if Pizzagate is real, the victims wouldn&#39;t be allowed to see the light of day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a bold claim with no source. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is so dumb, it&#39;s just emails and Intagram pictures</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling it dumb may be an attack, sure. But it is emails, instagram pictures, 4chan code words, and very loose links people have made that have proven nothing. Even with those links people claim to have made, I can at I&#39;ll ask &quot;who is the victim? Who is the perpetrator? Where when and how did this crime take place? What specific crime?&quot; I still get no answers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well perhaps if you did more research, you would realize that there are a lot more connections being made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Done my research with what I&#39;ve been shown. It seems like bs to me. I&#39;ve been following it since day 1, figured it could be plausible, but the further this movement has gone, the more they&#39;ve lost me.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We all know child trafficking exists moron! You really think CPP is raping children behind the cash register???</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling someone is a moron is a an attack, but the rest of that is not. While hyperbole, it&#39;s a valid question if it&#39;s toned down. Pizzagate has been going after CPP and BestaPizza like nobody&#39;s business because of &quot;tunnels&quot;, &quot;basements, &quot;kill rooms&quot;, videos of kids &quot;Crying for help&quot;, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, we don&#39;t think that, we believe it&#39;s much bigger than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then drop the moniker pizzagate. Pizzagate ties you to those places.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey guys, I like Pizza, and I am pedo???? See you guys are dumb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even worth replying to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can agree with that</p>

<p>Notice how I can discuss this without attacking anyone? OP doesn&#39;t want that. OP wants me to stay out of pizzagate threads. This isn&#39;t T_D where if you don&#39;t agree with the flavor of the week, your posts get deleted and you get banned. This is conspiracy, where we all discuss any and all esoteric topics.</p>

<p>If OP doesn&#39;t like people opposing his pizzagate threads, then he should stop posting them. People like myself want to discuss why we think it&#39;s BS. Some of us think pizzagate itself is a conspiracy to slander the alternative media and the conspiracy theorist community. Are we not entitled to try to enlighten people on why we believe that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;here was the Franklin scandal. Here was epstein. Here was Saville. Etc&quot; and then &quot;so here&#39;s what we have with pizzagate&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s another to say &quot;Here&#39;s all of these cases and they are part of pizzagate&quot;. Even if you guys think you&#39;re 100% right, if there is even a 0.00000001% chance you&#39;re wrong and then proven wrong somehow, you&#39;ve just lumped all previous, proven to be true scandals with a false scandal. It really brings down any future credibility you and the community as a whole has and it detracts people from wanting to find out from those true scandals. </p>

<p>Also, another issue I have with pizzagate is the YouTube videos. Every video I&#39;ve seen has to emotionally charge you before they present their case. It&#39;s &quot;here are these other cases, here&#39;s why pizzagate is one of them.&quot; Or my favorite is the &quot;now I&#39;m only going to provide the information with no bias, just keep in mind that what you&#39;re going to see in this video is very disturbing and these people are extremely sick and twisted.&quot; (And nothing on a YouTube video is &#39;disturbing&#39;. In the context of pizzagate, if there were disturbing material, it would be removed for violating terms of service)</p>

<p>In my opinion, if the information that was being presented was valid and pizzagate had an extremely solid foundation to stand on, they wouldn&#39;t need to emotionally charge you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is not only real, it&#39;s provably real without ANY of the instagram pictures or even the podesta emails but good ole-fashioned investigative journalism.   Tying William Engdahl&#39;s red line and the ratline article with eva bartletts&#39;s white helmets, with several other known connections made from mainstream sources like wikipedia and mainstream press articles (backed by news articles, wikileaks documents, foia documents, etc), Cynthia McKinney in 2004 congressional inquest of Rummsfeld over the 2.3T missing by the DOD,  George Webb&#39;s investigation has proven that Dyncorp is involved in human sex trafficking, and that Dyncorp is a defense services subsidiary of the intelligence community / cia; and that Clinton Foundation is linked up with these people in Libya, Syria, Mexico, Haiti, and in the USA.</p>

<p>The FBI is actually on this case and actively working with Webb, which means that Pizzagate is being actively investigated by whitehats within the intelligence community</p>

<p>So it&#39;s like everyone thought.  The baddies are the ones running CTR on pizzagate.  Anyone who actively and aggressively fights pizzagate is NOT ignorant of it, they are actually controlled opposition--ie they are a shill.  </p>

<p>At some point, you&#39;re going to have enough information that a normal person would simply &quot;give up in self shame&quot; over this issue and &#39;drop it&#39;.  When someone is proved wrong about something very immoral, they basically shut up about it and stop talking and move on or change the subject, because people don&#39;t like &quot;being made wrong&quot;, &quot;admitting they were wrong&quot;, &quot;admitting they were fooled by someone&quot;, &quot;admitting they were involved in or passed along disinformation&quot;, or &quot;realizing they are on the wrong side of history&quot;.  That point has already passed now for the average person.  The point at which there should be no doubt as to whether there is something to this pizzagate thing.  Anyone still clinging to it must then be a paid astroshill for the bad guys trying to run damage control.</p>

<p>Now look around you.  That&#39;s a shitload of people.  Some say it&#39;s 1000 new accounts here.  Think of how much this is costing them to keep 1000 employees trolling on social media...not just reddit but the hundreds of other websites on the internet, including even bigger sites like twitter and facebook...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this thinking helps anything. It seems like a way to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with you about this subject.

Evidence does not mean video footage of Alefantis fucking a kid in the basement of Comet Ping Pong. That would be proof.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence, pointing to a conspiracy of pedophilia and child trafficking.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is harder to fake than hard evidence, and law enforcement knows this. Circumstances can&#39;t be faked. Especially when it&#39;s dozens and dozens of circumstances. People are convicted and go to prison on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>We know these pedo rings exist. We know they exist in the highest realms of power. They are busted all the time. These are not crimes where a body is left behind, as in a homicide. Kids disappear without a trace. And the ones that don&#39;t, disassociate from realty or suffer PTSD to such an extent that no one listens.</p>

<p>Never before have we seen the MSM so active in hiding something, calling it fake before it&#39;s officially investigated. Even to the point of deleting separate stories of pedophilia from around the world that might put more attention on pizzagate. Norway was just rocked by a pedo scandal involving top politicians. It&#39;s every country. Just a couple years child porn was found on dozens of Pentagon computers, then quietly swept under the rug.</p>

<p>This is international child trafficking we&#39;re dealing with, and it&#39;s not about Hillary in the basement of a pizza place. You have been lied to by the media about what it is since the beginning. Because it is so big that it&#39;s going to take down a lot of powerful people and institutions. </p>

<p>This is not a political witchhunt and it sucks if anyone refuses to accept, even the possibility, that kids are being hurt because it doesn&#39;t agree with their political viewpoints. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s all support a thorough investigation because otherwise this is not going away ever. The harder the pushback, the harder the push.</p>

<p>I think the Pizzagate researchers have done an excellent job taking a rational approach to everything by putting potential child victims first.</p>

<p>I believe a section of the elite are able to broker sex with children and get away with it.  Hopefully we can put aside our differences as a global society and agree that sex with children is unacceptable and then actually take measures to stop and prevent it.</p>

<p>If all this Pizzagate stuff is false, then it certainly doesn&#39;t harm anyone to actually investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And to add to this, a common skeptic question: &quot;<em>If it&#39;s real, then where are all the complaining parents?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Where to begin!</p>

<p>According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, there could be up to 500,000 children that go missing each year, in the U.S. alone. Sadly, they do not know the total number because many are never reported. The number could be much higher. This number is then multiplied when you take more countries into account.</p>

<p>Then there are the children kidnapped from crisis areas like Haiti, or refugees that go missing from places like Syria by White Helmets. We are only beginning to understand how big this problem is.</p>

<p>And then you have surrogate mothers who are trafficked by criminal organizations for the sole purpose of having children for further trafficking. We have no idea how big these numbers could be.</p>

Stephen Corbett (a well known conspiracy researcher and documentarian) even encourages people to continue researching into PG, and he&#39;s definitely not a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>Smells like a giant money laundering operation for Democrats to turn &quot;campaign finances&quot; into art, real estate, and eventually liquid assets.

<p>I&#39;ve seen them.  The &quot;coincidences&quot; didn&#39;t hold up, even to the level that would justify <em>starting</em> a full investigation.  Rather, watching them brought me to the conclusion he&#39;s trying to monetize a smear campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to monetize a smear campaign? What motive would he have to do this and I don&#39;t see how any of the content is monetized either? I think you&#39;ve got your mind set in stone that something like this can&#39;t be true which is fine. But do you not think this deserves a investigation? Even if there is only the slightest chance that there are children are being harmed in this do you not think it deserves an investigation at the least? You have to admit something is not right ,from the emails and the Instagram alone, just on this slight possibility that many children are being harmed an investigation should take place instantly. But so far there has been NO official investigation which is absolutely appalling. Whether you believe in pizzagate or not you must agree there should be an investigation no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I genuinely apologize, but I&#39;m not interested in debating my opinion here.  In my experience, the people who believe in pizzagate are not swayed by any of the conclusions I&#39;ve come to.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re genuinely worried you might be accusing innocent people of pedophilia, and that you might be wrong, then let me know and I&#39;ll elaborate.  But I&#39;ve spent literally days of my time going over every point and it has proven to be a complete waste of time.  </p>

<p>Regardless, from what I had seen the videos you&#39;re mentioning didn&#39;t hold up.  Since so many people are convinced, I <em>am</em> interested to see if there&#39;s anything more solid.  Are you aware of any other evidence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you coming there is no concrete evidence found yet which is why there needs to be an investigation. I don&#39;t by any means want this to be true I just want to actually be investigated properly for the simple fact that there may be something going on. I&#39;m sure with all the circumstantial evidence gathered at the moment any other investigation would&#39;ve have began but so there has been nothing apart from the DC police claiming they had investigated when they actually did not. If it&#39;s proven false and a real investigation takes place then people will trail off the conspiracy but an investigation needs to take place, whether it is true or false it is justified and needs to happen.</p>

<p>why wouldn&#39;t you want an investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We did investigate.  After looking at the evidence we found, I think we don&#39;t have merit for any further intrusion.   I also came to the conclusion that the investigation itself was simply the result of a politically motivated smear campaign that survived past the election.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true and you know it.  An official investigation did nothing to stop Sandy Hook conspiracy theories.  Our old government is <em>out of power</em>, having <em>never leveraged the tragedy</em> to the political ends we were assured they were seeking.  But people still hold on to it.  The families of the victims still have to keep their facebook profiles private for harassment.</p>

<p>And if I were shilling for Trump I&#39;d leverage the investigation as &quot;proof&quot; that they were suspicious and that my concerns were justified.  I&#39;d  leverage the result (which I expect would be innocence) to distract from whatever Trump was doing.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re telling me that there weren&#39;t several posts on this very subreddit explicitly stating that they rape children in the basement of the pizza restaurant, that the fact that the place does have a basement in which they can rape children wasn&#39;t a hotly debated topic, and that people raping children in this pizza restaurant isn&#39;t one of the main reasons why this is called <strong>pizza</strong>gate?</p>

A dose of skepticism is healthy both ways, it&#39;s good for people to question things. It&#39;s good for people to question pizza gate just as much as it is for you to question the people behind it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna sound like a shill, so lemme preept that and say that upfront, coz im not yo, check my post history. I realised yesterday, that 800000 kids are year are not being kidnapped by podesta alone, though of course he deserves the worst punishments. I had a street knife fight with someone in India and went to lite-jail holiday home like in manali for 3 months. There, inside, i saw the true face of humanity. Pedophiles were spread in a huge numbe ramong the inmates, the population, etc. There were 3 people in from 60 for under age rape. 14-15 others used to talk about having sec with 14 16 year old girls as normal. I think all over the world, there are a huge number of pedophiles, just look at the news stories of rape and murder of kids that poor and uneducated do. So do the rich and powerful. Does it mean we put 100% effort into going after the rich guys alone and shouting 24/7 from rooftops, instead of trying to highlight, if not solve, the problem itself, which is wide spread and more so among the huts, shanties, ghettos, slums than in the washington or elsewhere. I think we should just forget this shit, or do it normally, giving it equal importance along with other real problems too.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this thinking helps anything. It seems like a way to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with you about this subject. I&#39;ve argued against Pizzagate because the information I&#39;ve seen hasn&#39;t convinced me, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a fake person. I could be mistaken, or you could be. </p>

<p>this is true.. paid, or unwitting via ignorance/ fear... everyone aware of pizzagate is either part of the Solution or part of the Problem..</p>

<p>no sane person is going to peek into pizzagate and take away the thought that &#39;no investigation is necessary&#39;... </p>

<p>anyone who takes an unbiased, common-sense, logical view into the mounting conspiracy markers of pizzagate... must draw the conclusion that - if nothing else - it warrants a thorough investigation that produces answers and resolution.</p>

<p>no one in a sane state of mind is going to argue down the value of children&#39;s lives.</p>
