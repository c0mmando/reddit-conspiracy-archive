       "That's very frightening; it's difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science," said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit that works to control, treat and eliminate vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The science is clear: Massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism, and as both a scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related neglected diseases and the father of an adult daughter with autism, there's not even any plausibility for a link," Hotez continued. "Autism is a genetic condition."

        Article in 2014 about Baylor School of Medicine professionals accepting unethical sums of money from pharma companies
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Christie Ballantyne, a Baylor College of Medicine cardiologist whose consulting got Grassley's attention 4 1/2 years ago, received the most drug company compensation among Houston physicians in 2012. In addition to funding they gave Baylor for his research, Pfizer and Merck paid him a total of $91,412, mostly for consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advancing patient care
      </p>
      <p>
       In emails and interviews, Ballantyne defended the drug company relationships, which were approved by Baylor. He said he sees his relationships as important to advancing patient care.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I consult for companies because I have expertise that I hope may help in the search for new therapies," said Ballantyne. "Research saves lives. I participated in a clinical trial when I was treated with lymphoma. If I had been diagnosed 50 years ago I would have lived less than 6 months."
      </p>
      <p>
       But in 2009, Baylor's failure to disclose Ballantyne's consulting work for Merck at the same time he was also receiving federal research funding prompted Grassley to write the National Institutes of Health expressing "serious concerns regarding Baylor's compliance" with federal regulations. The NIH subsequently found Ballantyne hadn't done anything wrong - he reported the payment to the school - but faulted Baylor for failing to disclose the relationship, something it said was an oversight.

       Its interesting how all of our doctors and nurses and scientists are so pro-vaccine. Ever since they started giving out vaccines, mortality has plummeted, so why do we even need them?
