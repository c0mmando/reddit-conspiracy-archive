       They're definitely on both sides, too. Download RES and flair the people you think are shills so you remember not to interact with them in the future. Mods can't really do anything about it because it's hard to tell who's a rabid X supporter vs a paid shill a lot of the time.

       I think its better to be more relaxed about policing comments than to try and stop "every shill" because once you start deleting comments you think are shills you will inevitably delete comments from people genuinely expressing their opinions. Its a slippery slope IMO. In reality people are learning to use their judgement to see whether or not someone is shilling. I think its best that we let people come to their own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also good to know the general pattern for the front page - type posts: Top comment is shill supporting / against (whatever the main narrative happens to be). Second comment is a more "thoughtful" post with links showing some nuance of the subject. Really this comment just serves to limit the discussion to a select few talking points, distracting from the questions that get to the heart of the matter (ie who is pulling the strings and what do they have to gain by doing so)

       Showing it to the mods, and deleting the comment does nothing and is censorship. You need to flair the comment and user as shills. If it is a shitty opinion that has been massively upvoted and maybe even gilded then you mark it as brigaded.

       And why did you remove this post?

       Unless you can provide a payroll/direct deposit slip for that user that is not something I

       You would need to prove to me it was brigaded. Just because an opinion doesn't match yours doesn't make it shitty.  If anything, this idea of yours is the shitty one.

       I don't know if you have ever been to /pol/ but they do all of the above. Shills go there to die, and the best they can hope to accomplish is civil discourse.  It doesn't matter if they are paid or not, they are actively shilling for globalist agendas and are therefore shilling.

       Having a globalist point if view is merely having a different worldview.

      <p>
       One could easily say their adversaries are shilling for a nationalistic worldview. Should those posts be removed too?

       What about those users who are shilling for 911 Truth? Should I remove them too?

       This is why the sub is dying. You are allowing shills to fuck around as they please and killing off contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the old users want to come to the sub and see shill #10 repeat "this sub is turning into the_Donald" and have that as the top three comments. There are more shills now than users. Every single thread looks just like r/politics and the only discussions are at the bottom. The top posts are being hijacked. Soon it will be gutted just like r/politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are literally killing this sub and everything it stands for. This is what you fucking want? You want this sub to become r/politics?

       Those users aren't shills (that I can prove) and they have a point- this sub
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       feel like TD2.0 sometimes.

       Do you know how many users I've banned from both pol and TD in the last week? And the whole team? All our logs are public, man.
