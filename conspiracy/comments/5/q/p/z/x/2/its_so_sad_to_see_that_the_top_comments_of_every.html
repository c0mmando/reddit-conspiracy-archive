    <div class="md"><p>I think its better to be more relaxed about policing comments than to try and stop &quot;every shill&quot; because once you start deleting comments you think are shills you will inevitably delete comments from people genuinely expressing their opinions. Its a slippery slope IMO. In reality people are learning to use their judgement to see whether or not someone is shilling. I think its best that we let people come to their own conclusions.</p>

<p>Its also good to know the general pattern for the front page - type posts: Top comment is shill supporting / against (whatever the main narrative happens to be). Second comment is a more &quot;thoughtful&quot; post with links showing some nuance of the subject. Really this comment just serves to limit the discussion to a select few talking points, distracting from the questions that get to the heart of the matter (ie who is pulling the strings and what do they have to gain by doing so)</p>

<p>It certainly does <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Unless you can provide a payroll/direct deposit slip for that user that is not something I <em>need to do</em> nor <em>will I do</em>.</p>

<p>You would need to prove to me it was brigaded. Just because an opinion doesn&#39;t match yours doesn&#39;t make it shitty.  If anything, this idea of yours is the shitty one.</p>
