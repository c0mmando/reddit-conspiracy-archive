<li><p>With US weapons and support, Saudi Arabia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen">is prosecuting a vicious war</a> of aggression against its neighbor, Yemen.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These obese savage wahhabi kinglets are &quot;our trusted friends and allies&quot;. They are armed, praised, consulted and defended by Western governments with the fruit of our labor. They are welcomed in DC to the sound of trumpets; they are said to be &quot;legitimate statesmen&quot; by the institutional propaganda.  </p>

<p>All the while that same propaganda criticizes Russia, after the US has destabilized many of its neighbors, supported Islamist insurgency in Chechnya, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7sJtv">circled it</a> with military installations. </p>

<p>There is a very strong historical imperialist/neocon russophobic current in the US. The hegemonists want to avoid at all costs the continental Berlin/Moscow/Beijing axis from forming (hence the recent destabilization of Ukraine, Europe being imposed to sanction Russia, etc.); such an Eurasian &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">world island</a>&quot; would undermine the influence of the Anglo-American maritime empire. Brzezinski explained it well in his book <a href="http://www.takeoverworld.info/Grand_Chessboard.pdf"><em>The Grand Chessboard</em></a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That&#39;s why intellectually independent people disregard this obviously artificial Russian bashing. The hypocrisy is just too suffocating to ignore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. We place heavy media on the little that Russia can do to push back against the immense pressure USA places on them.

    <div class="md"><p>If we wanted to get rid of &quot;islamic terror&quot;, we would decapitate the al-Saud regime and the Gulf sheikdoms, and turn the Arabian peninsula to Iran for safekeeping. America would pull out of the Middle East and let Russia handle things with Iran. We would then force (through boycott and/or sanctions) Israel to grant full civil rights to its Palestinian citizens in the West Bank &amp; Gaza. Finally we would hang all the traitors in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.    Obama continued the neocon foreign agenda of regime change based on the lie of the war on terror that goes back to the lie of 9/11 which was an inside job false flag.</p>

<p>The money that bought politicians in DC from Bush to McCain has been money that declared war against the American people,  and helped create a corporate elite whose agenda was regime change (failed states) from Libya to Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Putin and Russia have now put up road blocks to the agenda of this  corporate elite (Syria and Ukraine are not going to the US plan).  The US election where the Trump/Hillary/Bernie counts were rigged and where Trump was the winner also did not go the way of the corporate plan.    So,  Putin and Russia are on the shit list for the US elites.    However,   Trump&#39;s win over Hillary,  and the elites scramble to reformulate their control and policy means that the narrative about what Russia has done to meddle in US affairs is a contested battleground of disinformation where US intelligence has been politicized.    As much as the prosecution of Hillary&#39;s crimes has been politicized.    In other words,   total corruption and lies.    The outcome is likely to be a new myth as toxic as the findings of the Warren Commission or the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p>But the Russian position on the Ukraine and Syria will persist.    Trump administration positions on the other hand consist of hollow campaign positions and the daily corrupt deals of the Trump &quot;family&quot; positioning themselves to be the new beneficiaries of the corporate money flows,  as they cut out the old money flows that had been favored by those who supported the Bush/Obama years and favored the plans for the Hillary years.    Oil/guns/drugs/wall street are still the order of the day.    What is NOT still the order of the day is an ideological commitment to a globalist merging of US territory into a unified corporate market.   The territory of the US is now planned to remain a distinctively separate domain,  which means that the domains of Europe and Russia&#39;s sphere of influence are not necessarily targeted for elimination as they had been before. </p>

<p>The dreams for a global corporate monolyth have been temporarily suspended.   US corporations no longer have a mouthpiece in Washington DC advocating that particular angle.    But their corporate strategies have not yet been adjusted accordingly.   They are probably trying to reapportion their bribery to the Trump people and trying to re-evaluate their plans for global expansion within the modified Trump vision for global domination.    US self interest is not the same thing as the globalist agenda that viewed the US from the relative position of a global corporate marketplace.    This is a coup between distinct factions and ideologies.    The American people did not plan this coup.    Their hopes and dreams do not comprehend the broader implications.    They are on the sidelines of this battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  theoretically,  as long as the dollar can be propped up.    Eventually,  there will be a global readjustment as US empire will not be sustainable for ever without extraordinary (military) interventions.</p>

<p>In other words,  the greed that has already gone global will stay global until it is met with sufficient global opposition.    This US based opposition to business as usual is a shift to nationalism,  but still empire.    Before it was  with empire being defined from a non-nationalistic perspective.   Now its empire being defined from a more nationalistic perspective.    Before,  there was more willingness to hollow out the location called the US.    Now,  the location called the US is being elevated to a higher status than other parts of the empire.    At least from an ideolgical point of view.   But realistically,  the stinking poor,  which is a huge chunk of America,   their education, housing,  healthcare,   will only improve to the degree that the middle class gets a real boost for the first time since 1971.      What are the odds of that?    No,  the stinking poor isn&#39;t going to be reduced in numbers.    But maybe more sensation of greed,  more hatred,  more acting out of anger will help them to compensate for an otherwise shitty existence.    Or maybe at least distract them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thinking is they need to go back to simple farming and owning a few acres of land. Buy durable made items in the USA. Live in smaller houses. There needs to be a mental adjustment to priorities, not only a financial adjustment. I blame women more than men. They want a bigger house, they want bigger rooms and more improvements. Women&#39;s sensibilities need to be normalized to a reduced material acquisition associated with living. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is not how the American dream has been defined.</p>

<p>Unless we go back to the dark ages,   the information age,  the age of robots,  will mean millions of people can live without hard physical labor,   possibly including most Americans.   </p>

<p>But yes,  already,  many millennials have scaled back their ideas of materialistic acquisition,  whether or not it was their idea.    </p>

<p>When you look around at the fixtures in our lives,  their expected duration of useful life,  like cars,  furniture,  appliances,  electronics, what 10 years?   And the houses or other buildings,  what 20 years before  ruinous obsolescence?    I have seen how this shit is built.   It will cost a fortune to try to upgrade or maintain this crap.    Effectively,   our real wealth is in the soil and water, friends/community and our &quot;measured&quot; wealth goes to zero.   </p>

<p>100 years ago,  an older way of life disappeared forever from the beginning of WWI to the end of WWII.   Gone and replaced.   Look around,   because this way of life we are surrounded by is going to evaporate just as fast.     The word &quot;commonwealth&quot; fell into meaninglessness.    A new way of talking about <em>common wealth</em>  is being worked out,  which also recognizes a private wealth not measured in dollar signs:  <a href="http://www.socred.org/index.php/blogs/view/subsidiarity-distributism-and-social-credit-or-three-acres-and-a-cow">http://www.socred.org/index.php/blogs/view/subsidiarity-distributism-and-social-credit-or-three-acres-and-a-cow</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, i will enjoy reading that later. Agreed about the America dream BUT, if the dollar would fall to 2 cents tomorrow, the wealthiest will be the people who can feed themselves, cloth themselves and feel organically great about themselves. Jane Jacobs said you can&#39;t make a City, it forms naturally as a result of needing to gather to trade goods &amp; services. With the Internet, I think you can build a new city. You could organize quadrants for lifestyle, etc. It would be semi farming with Hemp as the labor intensive product that creates work. America could be rebuilt again. It is not for everyone but if your in an urban setting and working just to cover your rent, food, internet &amp; cell phone, this option allows you to back coin. My design enables a person the ability to bank coin every year they are there working 3 days a week.  </p>

And if so, what about his <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">recent speech</a>? What do you personally think of Israeli influence on American politics?</p>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t concern you, you may move along, thank you for your time.</p>

<p>If it does, how would a Trump Likudnik foreign policy enable Russia? Russia is allied with Syria and Iran, Netanyahu wants to overthrow Syria and bomb Iran. How do you reconcile both observations in your mind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not actually addressing what <a href="/u/CarpenterWalrus">/u/CarpenterWalrus</a> said. Trump&#39;s ties to Russia go beyond just the dossier. The conversation about Trump&#39;s ties to Russia should be thoroughly investigated and talked about.  You are trying to downplay his connections and deflect by pointing to other conspiracies which is disingenuous on your part. </p>

<p>Paul Manafort is a person very close to Trump and helped run his campaign. His name was found all over ledgers in Ukraine showing him receive over $12,000,000 in undisclosed cash payments from Putin&#39;s friends. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">That&#39;s a fact, not a conspiracy. This NY Times article is one of many that covered it when it happened</a>. Manafort was forced to resign from the position of Trump&#39;s campaign manager because of this story.</p>

<p>Manafort is just one person. There are others as well. This is a conspiracy that involves the highest levels of government and has world-wide implications. None of it should be dismissed and if you say it should then I question your motives </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a possibility Trump is &quot;working for the Russians&quot;. I cannot prove it&#39;s false, so let&#39;s accept what you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s a worldwide conspiracy that involves the highest levels of government </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you weren&#39;t aware, you&#39;ll have to get in line behind a few other criminal conspiracies that occurred (and are still occurring) at the &quot;highest level of government&quot; :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>911 was an inside job (spoiler alert: 2 aluminum planes don&#39;t pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers in this universe and terrorists don&#39;t throw passports out of aircraft cabins). Therefore the entire &quot;war on terror&quot; is utterly and completely phony. </p></li>
<li><p>People inside the the governments of Bush and Obama are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, prosecuting wars on knowingly-false assumptions, and failing to bring to justice the &quot;allied&quot; mass-murderers they mingle with. </p></li>
<li><p>The institutional abuse of children is <a href="https://archive.is/B1cpw">endemic in Hollywood</a> and it is most likely rampant in <a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">Washington DC too</a>. Pedophiles must be tried and sentenced.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But okay, let&#39;s assume Trump works with Putin. I don&#39;t deny it&#39;s possible. Can you post proof in this thread? Other than &quot;secret sources&quot; cited by the institutional propaganda? </p>

<p>Pro-life tip: the claims of a mythomaniac who defends war crimes and crimes against humanity are dubious, especially if he&#39;s asking you to take his word for it, offering no documented proof whatsoever.</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t. And neither does anyone else. People are going to continue talking about Trump&#39;s connections because they need to be talked about. If that bothers you then perhaps this sub is not the place for you and maybe you should just stop posting. </p>

<p>Now your motives do need to be called into question. Who are you to try and control the conversation and stop people from talking about Trump&#39;s ties to Russia?</p>

<p>I just gave you proof of his former campaign manager having extensive ties to Russia and your only response is to ignore it and pretend like it doesn&#39;t exist. Why would I try and find more evidence for someone so blatantly biased and unwilling to discuss something? </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t even try and say something like &quot;Well, that&#39;s Paul Manafort having connections to Russia and not Trump himself&quot; or anything. Just completely ignored it. </p>

<p>Trump’s forces have tabled a platform amendment that would call for maintaining or increasing sanctions against Russia, and have substituted “appropriate assistance” for  “providing lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine’s military. Removing sanctions and blocking lethal military assistance to Ukraine are the two primary goals of Putin’s foreign policy. The Republican platform is handing those goals to Putin on a golden platter.</p>

<p>What you said about russophobia in the US is true.  It&#39;s US/Europe hegemony vs Russia hegemony.  Obviously most Americans and Europeans prefer (or at least used to until very recently) the current situation in western civilization.  Putin would prefer to weaken US/Western Europe and increase Russia&#39;s power and influence in the world.  This doesn&#39;t disprove the theories about Putin&#39;s involvement in western politics and Trump&#39;s administration... it explains motive.</p>

<p>Nope, I didn&#39;t miss that at all.  Podesta was a moron who fell for a phishing attack.  Not sure what your point is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Everything you said about Saudi Arabia is completely irrelevant.  It can be true that Saudi Arabia is treated more kindly than they deserve by the US and that Putin is interfering in western democracy.  One has nothing to do with the other, so the entire first half of your post is irrelevant deflection.</p>

<p>I acknowledge US-led hegemony, yes, because it&#39;s pretty simple fact.  I&#39;m not excusing ambitions to &quot;rule the world&quot; but yes, I think western civilization and the progress it has made for principles of democracy and for human rights is preferable to the harsh authoritarian regime of Russia, where homosexuals are imprisoned and dissenters are attacked.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t mistake my concern about Russia meddling in western democratic processes with a desire for world domination and war.  That is a huge and ridiculous leap to make, and one that I never suggested in the slightest.  I can be against having Russian influence on my government and against my government waging wars that it shouldn&#39;t be.  My &quot;intellectual independence&quot; allows for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foreign policy language sounds very impressive, with big words like &#39;hegemony&#39; and &#39;influence&#39;, very impressive, but is that view of the world correct? What your argument does is beg the question. Framing foreign policy along an axis of duality is highly questionable logic because it <em>projects</em> motive. If the U.S. has aspirations of world dominance it needs to create a more evil counterpart and rival to justify it&#39;s excesses. We say this blatantly duting the Cold War. Russia never got it&#39;s shit together to rival the U.S. (despite all the money we sent them) so we concluded that they were using a clever subversive strategy of spies and subversion. Communism itself has been proven to be a total failure but never mind, the game theory mind set continues. It&#39;s a &#39;fact&#39; only in your mind. </p>

<p>If I start assuming my neighbor wants to blow up my house, pretty soon I&#39;ll start acting weird around him, raising his suspicions and eventually a war could erupt. The fact that he is returning my suspicions is not proof that he wants to blow my house up but eventually things may get so bad he may actually try to do it. But the fact that he eventually does still does not vindicate my logic. </p>

<p>Even if Russia wanted Trump in power, that still does not prove motive. The Clinton/Obama camp was so blatantly aggressive toward Russia such that support of Trump was inevitable. The fact that Russia prefers a moderate candidate is common sense and to read into it as a Russian takeover is unbelieveably paranoid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the American public has continued to vote in wave after wave of politicians that directly and indirectly engage in wars... we hold zero accountability over our elected officials, as is evidenced by the fact that our policy around the world has remained largely unchanged. </p>

<p>We, quite frankly, have become collectively complacent because we (and I say &quot;we&quot; to represent the entire population, not the group discussing this here necessarily) enjoy the fruits of these wars. We choose to argue about non-issues endlessly because we can&#39;t stomach the real debates that we should be having because we might end up feeling guilty and taking responsibility for the true cost of our way of life. </p>

<p>We like to bitch and moan, but when Election Day comes around, nothing changes for one reason or another. The government&#39;s influence grows thanks to our laziness and expediency... so, in a way, the public is just as much to blame for corrupt politicians as the politicians themselves... we just aren&#39;t aware of it because we have essentially given up hope that we can change anything (and frankly, the loss of responsibility probably feels good). </p>

<p>The media surely is suggesting what direction the public discourse moves in... but at the end of the day the media simply feeds the people the narrative that they <em>want</em> to hear. The media is not just a propaganda loudspeaker, <em>it&#39;s an echo chamber.</em></p>

<p>Okay, I looked up what you&#39;re referring to, and while the site I&#39;m reading (it was the first one I saw on the first page that seemed like it was relevant) is a pilot that doesn&#39;t believe your unstated theory, I....am....not convinced, but not unconvinced that a missile didn&#39;t hit the pentagon.  That is to say, I don&#39;t really believe it, but I consider it within the realm of possibility.  This isn&#39;t to say I believe it was intentional, I think it&#39;s more likely than not that, if it were a missile, it was an accident.  I think, if I were planning a conspiracy, and I were the SecState, i wouldn&#39;t keep a piece of metal that was related to the incident on my desktop.  It&#39;s evidence of the crime, and could, theoretically be subpoena, and then subject to metallurgical tests.</p>

<p>TLDR: I&#39;m not convinced it was, but I find the idea that a missile hit the Pentagon to not be outside the realm of possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Trump supporter, and as a hater of the MSM, I believe that the Russian connection deal is a big load of shit- but as a conspiracy theorist, and now that I am starting to gain an understanding of how this class and the media operate, I think I am beginning to understand that the Russian connection is real (to what capacity, I don&#39;t know how); but the whole elite already knows about it and they don&#39;t give a shit about it.  They are probably ALL personally benefitting from it in some way. And even though they all know about it, they are just putting on a show on the news and letting us peasants squabble about it and argue about whether it exists or not.  When you consider the powers of surveillance intelligence, how would Trump realistically be able to have a secret digital relationship with the russian state in any capacity without some intelligence blabbermouth knowing about it since the beginning?  Idk, i think we are all being played and they are laughing at us.  Its useless getting mad at Trump for it, because they would all be in on it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Steve Pieczenik says](&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM%22">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM&quot;</a>) (and said during the campaign) Trump was/is covertly supported by US intelligence agencies and brought to power through a &quot;silent coup&quot;. He says they gave the emails to Wikileaks, to help Trump and undermine Clinton. Realize who this man is before watching the video (and others on his channel if you&#39;re curious).</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s UK Ambassador Craig Murray who said  “I’ve met the person who leaked them [Podesta emails], not Russian – it’s an insider.” See <a href="http://theduran.com/uk-ambassador-craig-murray-ive-met-the-person-who-leaked-them-podesta-emails-not-russian-and-its-an-insider/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">Also read this</a>. Trump is a Likudnik. If he takes on Irak (and possibly Iran) anew like he seems to be considering, that would not go in Russia&#39;s direction.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not peremptorily stating Trump isn&#39;t &quot;dealing&quot; with Putin. But if he was a vassal to someone, in terms of probability, I&#39;d be more concerned about rogue intelligence organizations or foreign leaders such as Netanyahu.</p>

<p>If Clinton2, an avowed war criminal, would have been capable, then Trump (not a war criminal yet) is capable.</p>

<p>If Obama, Bush2, Clinton1, and Bush1 (avowed war criminals) were capable, then Trump (not a war criminal yet) is too.</p>

<p>You see, Trump has that speaking in his favor. He didn&#39;t kill anyone yet. So he&#39;s the most capable of all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are always multiple important things going on. If we blew up the Saudi issues, you could say it&#39;s a distraction from the Russia-Trump connection. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like our relationship with the Saudis. I wish people paid more attention to it. But I also realize that maintaining our relationship with the Saudis is crucial to keeping at least some sense of stabilization in the region where it still exists. </p>

<p>With the Russia thing, my issue is that Trump&#39;s an easily-influenced moron who may be subject to manipulation by Putin to do his bidding (or, at worst, even blackmail). These are both problems, but mainly independent of each other. Calling one a distraction from the other creates an actual distraction, rather than trying to highlight both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the logic in that, personally. Clinton&#39;s been involved in some things that could be interpreted to be very bad, though there are multiple sides to these stories. I don&#39;t like her though, and think she&#39;s the worst major candidate we&#39;ve had in the past century. But Trump has the potential for far worse, and he&#39;s given plans and implications for far worse. He simply hasn&#39;t gained a position of power to cause damage until now. Would you vote for Charles Manson over Clinton, just because he&#39;s not a war criminal and may be responsible for less deaths? Or Richard Spencer who, as far as we know, hasn&#39;t even committed any crimes? I don&#39;t think a potential lunatic and tyrant is necessarily the more conscientious choice over someone who just has a sketchy record.</p>

<p>Also, I do remain skeptical over the Russia-Trump accusations. But with reason to believe it could be true, and not much yet to dispute it, I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s not worth investigating. </p>

<p>This is a question I&#39;ve asked before, but I&#39;ll ask again if you don&#39;t mind. You imply being convinced these latest Trump/Russia claims are credible enough to vouch for deep consideration. </p>

<p>In that case, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">does this bother you</a>? And considering that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCW4IasWXc">does this bother you</a> even more? What do you personally think of Israeli influence on American politics?</p>

<p>If this criticism has ground, and if Trump would lead a Likudnik foreign policy, how would that enable Russia? Russia is allied with Syria and Iran, Netanyahu wants to overthrow Syria and bomb Iran. How do you reconcile both observations in your mind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People wouldnt see hope if it bit them in the ass. Thats the real problem here on this sub.</p>

<p>No one can change , no one in a seat of power can change their minds. they will apparently do what they have always done even with the smallest amount of evidence.</p>

<p>Why is it so inconceivable that a mediocre businessman , a conman, a celebrity reality star, a man who has done shady deals with all sorts of people , a tax dodging narcissist and general societal joke can suddenly have an epiphany and seize an opportunity to create a legacy unlike no other.</p>

<p>Remember it is possible no matter the past. Dont judge cabinet decisions because lets face it these people are much smarter in the behind the scenes politics than we are. Dont judge the communication style because its something that has never been done before in such a way.</p>

<p>Judge the man and his cabinet by his actions. If his actions show blatent collusion with Russia then we act on it. If his actions show a pro Israel slant to the detriment of the rest of the middle east then we act on it. If his actions hurt the majority of America and help the elite class of society while the rest of us suffer then we act upon it. </p>

<p>I have yet to see anything that has been done in his first week so far that points to any of these. Maybe next week will be the week where we see it or the week after and I applaud you all for remaining vigilant but dont try to be the polar opposite of the_donald how about you just be the sub of reason.</p>

<p>Excellent point.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">this speech at the CIA</a>, there&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">this backtround</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCW4IasWXc">that context</a>.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned on canceling the nuclear deal with Iran. That could easily mean war with Iran (Iran would ramp-up its nuclear program, and Trump/Netanyahu would bomb it. Remember Libya: a disarmament deal was made by Bush with Qaddafi before Obama bombed it back to the Middle Ages).</p>

<p>Because of this and other actions (and cabinet appointments) a Trump administration is likely to pursue the foreign policy goals of the Likud. That means countering Russian interests in Iran.</p>

<p>Pizza gate is 100% real and we&#39;re talking about a massive international child trafficking ring. These parasites are on the board of charities, orphanages and disaster relief programs.

<p>The amount of suffering and horror these children have and are experiencing right now is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>And so I don&#39;t understand why instead of demanding a transparent and honest investigation, we have these fucking ridiculous women&#39;s groups and scientists out there protesting a president who has barely been in power a week. It&#39;s absurd. 😡</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is why it works, distraction and misdirection. Were there WMD&#39;s in Iraq? No. But then we got told there was Taliban there. 
Did Qaddafi train terrorists or some other bullshit? No, he was in fact one of the only people there capable of holding a country like Libya together. But he got turned into an evil warlord to justify what was done. 
All the time the media is paid to justify things done by the political elite, whether it is another law to spy on us or bombing of another country for profit(not just taking over the country&#39;s resources, that might not even be the main goal, ordnance like missiles are expensive and while there is no war they don&#39;t get spent so military contractors don&#39;t get paid to make them. Ordnance gets used = $$, plane needs parts= $$$, plane shot down, need new plane = $$$$, Russia is a threat because it&#39;s Russia = new defence contracts = $$$$$$). 
And then there is the whole thing of social media, reality tv, celebrities, the new iphone and all the other stuff that gets thrown at people, that makes people care more about a selfie, their new vegan friendly double shot presto gato latte than the possibility that the political elites have been subverting the system to allow them to do anything they want and get away scot free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem really is not that Gaddafi was evil or not, it was that he was in the way of someone who wanted to make business. 
The thing is pretty much anyone in power does something at some point that is morally wrong. They might have different reasons for doing so and sometimes we find those reasons acceptable but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that they still do stuff like that. 
Basically what I am trying to say Gaddafi might not have been &quot;nice&quot; but he was a stable presence. Look at what happened to Libya ever since he got overthrown and killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/2ccIpN8wew8?t=2794">I was watching a George Webb interview yesterday and thought I&#39;d transcribe something regarding Putin</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;I do have to give Putin some credit though. Because Putin&#39;s last paper that he wrote as a KGB agent, right before the fall of the wall, was that we&#39;ll never be able to keep up with the West, with their resources. They outnumber us 50 to 1 in agents. So the only thing we can do - truth is our only weapon was the title of the paper - we have to do a network (RT) and fight fire with fire. Just keep putting out the video. And keep putting out stories that are written by Western journalists talking about these situations. Information is the only way we can win the war, that was his paper. RT was created from that. Some people believe that Wikileaks was created from that - I don&#39;t believe that. But RT was certainly created from that.&quot;</p>

<p>Putin created RT and told them to publish truth. That truth was the only thing that could defeat the propaganda of the west. I know this is hard for people to believe due to the massive propaganda shoved down our throats, but I truly believe that Putin is the biggest force for good currently in power.</p>

Anyways, been watching great commentary on YouTube breaking down their propoganda against Russia. All the media has taught me is the more the left despises someone or something the more it threatens them, the closer to truth or anti their agenda it is. Russia might not be perfect currently but I feel they are the good guys, not participating in Obamas terrorism that people are oblivious to doesn&#39;t make them the enemy. </p>
