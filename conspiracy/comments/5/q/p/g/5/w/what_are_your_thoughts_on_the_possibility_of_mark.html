<p>While the larger entities that provide overwatch today might evolve or even be replaced by different companies as time goes on, the framework is already in place thanks to years of failed neutrality, rampant global political corruption, and the massive for-profit corporations (like Google and Facebook) who can openly (and legally) gather more intel than the collective NSA-style programs of most other nations combined.</p>

<p>Things will just keep getting worse now that internet access is more of a necessity/utility, and internet content is now treated more like a giant shopping mall and no longer like a giant universal library.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People talk about Reddit alternatives, but I think what may work better is specific subreddit alternatives, since it would be way easier to organize a specific community to pack up and move their shit elsewhere than it would for the whole site. Conspiracy, for instance, is something I would go to another site to visit, especially for the assurance that it wasn&#39;t being curated by elites. </p>
