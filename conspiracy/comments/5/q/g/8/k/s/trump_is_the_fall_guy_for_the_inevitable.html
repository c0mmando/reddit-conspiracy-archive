        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was watching Alex Jones on Info wars last night and Ron Paul was on talking a few points on the upcoming financial crises.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_887uZJdgC4&amp;t=561s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_887uZJdgC4&amp;t=561s</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s looking more and and more like Trump is just &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; for whats to come and it makes perfect sense too. The &quot;Establishment&quot; as we know it has had full control over the government for many many years using it as a tool for limitless money and power, the recession in 2008 was something they were willing to ride out while still carrying forward the NWO plans unfortunate to them the previous recession had the effect of highlighting alot of the corruption taking place, putting some of the Elite in the spotlight.This next recession we headed for is going to be a big one, it&#39;s going to make 2008 look insignificant all together. The world leaders know every detail of exactly how its going to happen so they&#39;ve spent the last few years orchestrating this Trump (anti-establishment) character to stand at the top when everything falls apart.</p>

<p>This way the blame will go to the Trump administration and the people will come running back seeking safety, protection and guidance in the embracing arms of evil itself.</p>

<p>My guess is that Trump is being played, there is nothing he can do to stop the &quot;correction&quot; as Ron Paul puts it so the people who really pull the strings only have to sit back and let it all come crashing down. They can then take their public facing positions of leadership again, this time without question.</p>

<p>Another interesting article to provide more insight on the subject:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, I think he is honestly trying to do what he thinks to be the right thing, But it&#39;s kind of like the bankers have pushed America out of a plane with no parachutes, Trump willingly jumps out of the plane to save America but also has no parachute. </p>

<p>During the free fall he is doing everything he can to calm America down, maybe he&#39;s contemplating that they both pin drop into water or on something that&#39;s going to soften the fall, maybe he&#39;s making phone calls during the free fall to get help, and telling America she&#39;s going to be fine, its all good.</p>

<p>But the truth is none of it really matters, what he does in the short time he has to do anything at the end of the free fall everyone is going SPLAT while the bankers fly off into the sunset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think their initial intention was to bring down the whole country, this is a byproduct of funding continuous wars for the pursuit of global power and dominance, I think the only way to correct it is to see it through, but they cant afford to do that with their puppets in power, its much easier to just create &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; so they can point fingers and say &quot;Look what he did to us!&quot;. Also, it will be much easier for them to resume power after the correction has taken place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he&#39;s a moron that can&#39;t handle his own businesses. So I figure you just pick a guy that&#39;s good at going bankrupt and full of himself and just let him do what he does best. That&#39;d be the easy answer, but it&#39;s not the right answer.</p>

<p>Trump is much more dangerous than that. If it&#39;s true that Micheal Flynn sold out US spies to Russia. This is collusion on a ridiculous level. </p>

<p>If Trump lifts Russian sanctions on Saturday the writing is on the wall. You Trump supporters that have taken over this sub. Explain to me how in the last months it&#39;s become necessary to bow down to Putin to avoid a war. Why would we suddenly start a war with Russia? Why being the greatest country on Earth would we tuck tail and run? Why are we even talking about a war with Russia? We aren&#39;t going to war over Syria. Why the fuck are we going to war? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you know the answer to your question. War is profit, war has it&#39;s own laws which allow the murder/culling of thousands.</p>

<p>The reason for war is simple.</p>

<p>If you want something that doesn&#39;t belong to you and you can&#39;t buy it, just take it by force. War is theft on an international scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he&#39;s already stated he didn&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t just take Iraq&#39;s oil. I believe he said &quot;to the victors go the spoils&quot;. This way is easier though you lift the sanctions and oil is pumping. Trump wins Putin wins. The deplomacy shit is a load of shit. </p>

<p>Every other country can go fuck themselves. Mexico. China. Germany. The EU. NATO. Fuck them. Russia though? They&#39;re cool. </p>

<p>Strange how every country he&#39;s blocked immigration from doesn&#39;t have business ties to his companies isn&#39;t it? They aren&#39;t actually countries that have had people attack us. They&#39;re just some brown people countries that haven&#39;t done business with Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you saying, lets always try to look at it from both sides.</p>

<p>Why would trump make any effort in creating new prosperous relationships with countries and cultures he knows absolutely nothing about, its much easier working with countries where he has already established business ties, To him the rest of the world isn&#39;t even real, no need for them. </p>

<p>He could still be 100% confident that this is whats best for America and at the same time just lack the information to make an informed decision. which is why I&#39;m thinking he was the perfect pick to be the fall guy, I mean his Ego is nearly big enough to be declared a country by itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously want Trump to succeed. I know my comments don&#39;t look that way. It&#39;s because at least in my eyes he&#39;s going off the reservation. But if he does right we all win. </p>

<p>You say work with people he knows. Fine. So why Russia? They have nothing we need. He has criticized a ton of people, but he&#39;s never criticized one person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>~Trump</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t trust him. </p>

<p>Tillerson though. He&#39;s a different story. Medal of friendship from Putin. 800 billion oil deal. Without the pesky sanctions?</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely true, Russia has Gas as a natural resource and is currently supplying most of Europes gas, it also has location and land mass (being the largest country in the world), on that last point we really don&#39;t know how much natural resources lies within Russian borders yet, a lot of it remains undiscovered, The final point is Military, being one of the strongest Military powers in the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just guessing here but going in full partnership with Russia would create an unstoppable world power run by a very select few. Thinking from a world domination perceptive, two of the largest world powers joining forces would finish the job that Hitler. It&#39;s a very scary thought, end result Russia/America = Master Countries, rest of the world = slave countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a good question, I dont know the answer to it, but I&#39;ve been looking into gold and bitcoin to try spread my money around a bit more so its not fixed to one currency and have atleast half of it not in FIAT. </p>

<p>Again, I can only tell you what I&#39;m doing, the easiest way to prepare is to think of a world where money cant buy you anything anymore, either becuase its worthless or you dont have any (the banks wont let you access your own money, its happened in Greece and Italy already), In a world like that what could you obtain now that will be of high value later. think of cheap goods that will be scarce or very expensive during the financial crises, stock up and be ready to trade for things you will need later, back to the barter way of thinking.</p>

<p>It just helps to be prepared, there is no one solution and building a bunker under your house just doesn&#39;t sit well for something that might not actually happen. split your money up and obtain trade-able goods is probably the easiest/cheapest methods of being prepared.</p>
