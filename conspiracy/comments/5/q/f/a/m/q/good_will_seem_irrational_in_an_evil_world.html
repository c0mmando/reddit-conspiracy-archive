<p>Customs, traditions, movies, coloring books.</p>

<p>Walk outside tomorrow and ask yourself, &quot;If I knew absolutely knowing, what will I believe?&quot;</p>

<p>Not necessarily a religious question, it&#39;s a door that I walked through. So far I find the most interesting things I&#39;ve learned are regarding the state of the human condition. We are like robots until moments like the one you had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good will towards others of your species is probably one of the more rational things we are taught as children. Do you know how to wire a house, make a computer, raise cattle, grow crops, maintain vehicles, build a house, perform medical procedures, and educate children? This is how it is rational in a purely selfish sense, because very few people would be able to take on all those roles at once. So the good will towards those who can do those things allows for reciprocation of whatever need you can fill for them. If everyone is suspicious of everyone else, that breaks down.</p>

<p>In a more idealistic sense, good will is good just because it helps others. So it makes the recipient of the good will want to pass it on (hopefully)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished watching the latest Michael Moore documentary where he goes to Europe. Why do most European countries have free healthcare and college? And all the people interviewed said more or less about the importance of helping your fellow man for the benefit of society, that something&#39;s not right if people are homeless or hungry or sick or uneducated. Why do we have to view such things as idealistic and unrealistic when across the ocean people just like you and me have better lives just by virtue of being a human being?</p>
