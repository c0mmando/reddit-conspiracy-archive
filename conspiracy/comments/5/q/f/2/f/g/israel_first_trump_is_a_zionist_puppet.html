<p>Interesting...</p>

<p>Expanding on that thought, if we accept the Nature and Attributes that are attributed to God (at least in the tradition of Abrahamic religions) - that God... <em>(<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/g-d.htm">borrowing from a page of Judaism 101</a>)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>God Exists</p></li>
<li><p>God is One</p></li>
<li><p>God is the Creator of Everything</p></li>
<li><p>God is Incorporeal</p></li>
<li><p>God is Neither Male nor Female</p></li>
<li><p>God is Omnipresent</p></li>
<li><p>God is Omnipotent</p></li>
<li><p>God is Omniscient</p></li>
<li><p>God is Eternal</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(etc.)</p>

<p>So, reiterating your above statement <strong><em>[if] &quot;the devil is real, then it must be understood that God is real.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Given the &quot;Nature of God&quot; as described above, I am faced with the unavoidable hypohtesis that if God <strong><em>is</em></strong> real, <strong><em>God is the devil</em></strong>, no?</p>

<p>It must be understood that there is no such thing as free will, the God of Israel knows who is wicked and who is righteous. He weighs the souls.

<p>Apparently the fellow known as &#39;Jesus&quot; <em>(spit!)</em> was not all that far off base when he <em>(allegedly)</em> uttered the following:</p>

<p>To understand the full context, you must understand the full story. The people that call themselves <em>Jews</em> today are not the real Jews. They are Esau/Edom, hence why they are so wicked.</p>

<p>Now the real children of Israel, God cursed them to go into slavery/oppressed be and punished for following the way of the other nations. The real Hebrews are the so called Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans &amp; the multitude.</p>

<p>Ah it is noted because the Bible is not a religion, it was turned into one, you cannot convert to being a Jew/Israel. It is by <em>Blood</em>. This will be proven as we see the prophecies unfold more and more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You tell me that you and yours are the &quot;Chosen&quot; of the Holy of Holies, and that you are, simultaneously, the fingerlings of the Father of Lies and the Epitome of Evil...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling you anything, I&#39;m showing you what the most high has in store for the world. How this will all go down, the end of the world to put it simply. </p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; is not really a thing, you though, surely don&#39;t hold the spirit of the father, there are many others here are that hold the spirit but my text has enraged you because you know exactly what it means.</p>

<p>Sadly, again, as the prophecies move forward, you will bow down before the LORD, everyone who has the luxury of being alive after what&#39;s coming to this world will bow down.</p>

<p>You seem upset with me, as if I&#39;m some type of time traveler, as if I did this. I&#39;m telling you what is destined to come regardless of what I feel or you feel. Prepare yourself for this reality is not our own, it is owned and controlled by the most high.</p>

<p>If it makes you feel better, 2/3 of Israel will be killed first, for it will be Edom that comes down upon the wicked of Jacob and the prophets. So you have your last hoorah according to the Bible if that makes you happy. </p>

<p>In the end, this hail mary fails, it is my point only to attempt to save myself and the elect who understand the words that I am writing so that they do the same. Simply a watchmen for if I don&#39;t, their blood lies on my own hands for not doing so.</p>

<p>Well, many, actually. And the Bible itself is loaded with stories from much earlier texts (as from Mesopotamia, and others) that were re-written and inserted into the biblical narrative with new names, to make them seem specifically applicable to the Hebrews/Jews.</p>

<p>Again, you are of your father the devil, you do not hold the spirit of God.

<p>No, Edom is not just the Jews, there are tribes within the nation of Edom, starting from Rothschild on down, Amalek is the head tribe. Esau/Edom will be cut off forever as the prophecies of Obadiah come to pass. </p>

<p>Your assumptions were wrong. I never denied this, and it is only Abraham that received the blesssing.

<p>Yes we are, <strong>but as the Gospel goes on to tell us, the edomites broke the brotherly covenant when they didn&#39;t allow Moses to pass during exodus.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hebrews 12:16</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>16 <strong>Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</strong></p>

<p>17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your blessing is the sword and by the sword you shall live, for you were created for destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 27:40</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, we have the pyramid that is set today, from Alexander the great or the great nations like Greece, Rome and even America. All of them created and controlled by Edom. Destruction is your path and Death is your legacy.</p>

<p>I said what is true, The father controls the devil as he said he does.</p>

<p><strong>You said</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sayeth the chap who said that God and the Devil are One. You&#39;re twisting yourself into a pretzel, bro - don&#39;t hurt your back!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the above is not true, you are a liar and the truth is not in you, I did not say this, God himself said it.</p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 45:7 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proven even when God called the children of adam in Job and he questioned Satan about his whereabouts.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Job 1:7</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You said</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pardon me, but the above looks like a total COP OUT that folks like you fall back on when you find yourselves painted into a corner, caught in the quagmire of contradictions that virtually ALWAYS arise in the tangled mess of religious zealotry. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it is simply that you do not have a spirit, that you cannot see it. Those with the spirit understand, it is your carnal mind that keeps you from seeing why the rivers flow, wind blows and the grass grows. You wish for proof but proof is not faith.</p>

<p><strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You said</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems rather unlikely, given that the Amalekites were GENOCIDED by Saul...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes the edomites also disappeared from Greece and then they became the Idumeans and then the Idumeans became the Khazars and from their, the Rothschilds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The significance of the Edomite population merging with the Jews is often overlooked. But it is not really any secret. Many modern Biblical scholars admit that the historic event did, indeed, occur. For example: “But during the warlike rule of the Maccabees (Hasmonean dynasty of the jews) they were again completely subdued and even forced to conform to Jewish laws and rites and submit to the government of Jewish perfect. The Edomites were then incorporated into the Jewish nation, and the whole providence was often termed by Greek and Roman writers ‘Idumea’…From this time, the Edomites as a separate people disappear from the pages of history.” (The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary, p. 333)</p>

<p>There is Edom [Esau is called Edom in Genesis 36:8]. And Edom is in ‘Modern Jewry’ Jewish Encyclopedia, 1925 edition, Vol. 5, p. 41. Even the encyclopedia on your shelf may inform you of these events, <strong>if one is sharp enough to understand the significance: “The Hasmonean dynasty conquered the Idumeans in the 100’s B.C., and converted them to Judaism.” (World Book Encyclopedia, 1967, Vol. 6, p. 55)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So from the above, you are incorrect. You do not exercise critical thinking because then you would see the truth but the truth is not in you because the most high has blinded you from the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Psalms 49:11</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; <strong>they call their lands after their own names.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>America = Amerigo Vespucci</p>

<p>Africa = Scicipio Africanus</p>

<p>Columbia = Christopher Columbus</p>

<p>I could go on and on...</p>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:3-4</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</p>

<p>4 <strong>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Look BROTHER, please don&#39;t take offense. The reason that I am familiar with these topics and texts is I was raised in one religious &quot;group&quot;, and after leaving, hung out for some time with several others - so I am fairly &quot;well versed&quot; - but apparently I have a flaw that makes me irredeemably &quot;lost&quot; - that being that I exercise CRITICAL THINKING, which is a big NO NO among groups that demand unquestioning deference to AUTHORITY, so naturally, I did hang around too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not offended, I know that you don&#39;t have the truth and I know what is coming. Nothing you can say can pull me from the faith of Yahawah Bahasham Yahawashi. He is my shield and my protection in the coming days. I know that you yourself are unprotected and will be perish just like the rest in the coming calamities for the Lord is not with you. So pray to your money, guns and bombs but they shall not save you in the end. </p>

<p>The end is near whether you want to admit it nor not. I am not here for you Amos, never have been, for I know your spirit, it is familiar, a true child of Edom. I am here to warn those who are of the spirit of God what is coming and how the Lord&#39;s movie ends, so that they can repent and fix their ways. </p>

<p>For all 18 nations will be shown the wrath of God, some more than others.</p>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:16-18</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</p>

<p>16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</p>

<p>17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</p>

<p>18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who understand will repent, those who don&#39;t will continue in their ways until judgement day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about you? What &quot;brand&quot; have you subscribed to?</p>

<p>I am just a lowly servant of God doing his labor and giving warning to those with a righteous spirit. </p>

<p>A &quot;blessing&quot; from who?

<p>Not that Abraham WANTED it that way. Issac and his mommy CONSPIRED to trick his demented and dying father into BELIEVING that he was blessing ESAU, didn&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, OKAY, so Esau SOLD his birthright to Issac for a &quot;mess of pottage&quot;, right? Now, what kind of an ASSHOLE would REFUSE his starving brother a bowl of lentils - relenting ONLY on the CONDITION that he &quot;sell his birthright&quot;??? </p>

<p>Yes, it could well be said that Issac <strong><em>&quot;JEWED&quot;</em></strong> Esau out of his birthright, could it not?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Prophecies&quot;?** Impress me with a few that have already manifest, will you?** </p>

<p>In the meantime, I have a few of my own &quot;prophecies&quot; that you can record for future generations of &quot;believers&quot;:</p>

<p><strong>THUS SAYETH AMOS!!!</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mankind is brilliant in its cleverness and ingenuity... but it lacks the empathy and foresight to apply its inventions to its own benefit - and so, through ego and greed <em>(God attributes)</em>, it will likely KILL ITSELF OFF (or set itself back to the Stone Age) <strong><em>IF</em></strong> some natural catastrophic event (meteor, comet, Yellowstone-type eruption, etc.) doesn&#39;t do it FIRST.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sun will eventually run its course, burn out, and Earth will become a cold, dead, irrelevant chunk of icy stone drifting in an ignored section of an uninteresting galaxy. </p></li>
<li><p>The likelihood that we will escape the fate #2 via technology (moving to another planet) is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY due to the pervasive character flaws of humanity (and <strong><em>the &quot;God&quot;</em></strong>) as described in #1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The &quot;prophecies&quot; that you seem indignantly irritated that I ignore amount to little more than &quot;Goose Bumps&quot; stories written for the entertainment and enrapture of those who are inherently intellectually indolent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You education lacks the wisdom</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that so?</p>

<p>Behold, Friend, I grow weary, bantering with a creature that splitteth the hoof, but doest not cheweth the cud...</p>

<p>I empathize, but cannot overlook the myopia that you so valiantly preach... so alas, I must bid you good evening - retiring with a heavy heart... with the full understanding that while I have NOT ONCE wished evil to befall you and yours, you have wished death, destruction and eternal misery on me.</p>

<p>Is that what YOU call &quot;Holiness&quot;?</p>

<p>Ask your &quot;God&quot; and get back to me on that, okay?</p>

<p>Pleasant dreams!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct.  But that is the only thing I don&#39;t like about trump so far, other than that fact he has been doing what he said he was going to do, and he never pretended to be anti Israel.  This was easy to see during the campaign, I think they both would have been pro Israel,  the choice is never anti Israel.
Even Wikileaks Won&#39;t publish negative things about Israel.  </p>

<p>Israel was founded by the Rothschilds who at some level probably have a stake in every central bank in the world, so they basically run the world by proxy.</p>

<p>In revelations they have a passage about a group much like the Rothschilds,  so it is interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>With that,  to change this one would have to have an immense platform with which to shout about this, but to get to that platform you must be pro Rothschild or you will simply have no money and no one will listen to you.  </p>

<p>Anyone who speaks about it becomes an unemployed nut job like roseann barr or Katt Williams.  </p>

<p>So I guess my question is how do you replace a system like that if by some chance you are able to expose it to a point where the world will believe yiur theory?  What do you replace it with?  What will become of those who like this system?  It takes extreme organization to pull that off and several decades at least, and we haven&#39;t even gotten started.  And Bitcoin isn&#39;t a Start.  </p>

<p>If you think Bitcoin cant disappear just wait till the world is dependent on it then they all disappear over night.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This started in the mid 90s but every president so far has blocked it. Most will tell you its religious but im sure the elite are happy to see that division.  As someone raised in a Jewish family its so unbelievable that mature adults in this country  (jewish,evengelical, etc) actually believe people can be the &quot;chosen ones&quot; and their location will signify the second coming of a messiah and usher in the end times and salvation of believers. Its death and war for completly outdated mysticism.  And those dying are just being used under the false guise of religion when its all about control and no one sees it.  Sorry venting. </p>

<p>Not unless Stone has a thousand sockpuppets on 4chan he didn&#39;t.   I watched it develop organically.   Again, not saying Alefantis and company are guilty, but have you taken a good look at Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection?   And do you not think that elite pedophile rings are an essential area of conspiracy research?    I think the reason the (CIA) corporate media reacted with such hysteria to pizzagate is that it struck a nerve.   Pedo rings their biggest darkest secret.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stone has been running political dirty tricks since he was in elementary school, seriously. He once spread rumors at school that presidential candidate Richard Nixon was in favor of school on Saturdays, in an attempt to get his schoolmates to get their parents to vote against Nixon. From there, he went on to work for Nixon, Bush Jr, Sr. Bob Dole, Trump, and gay pedophile Roy Cohn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the simplest explanation is that there are competing factions of the elite, and Zionists are represented on both sides.   The more hardcore (read: insane) Zionists of the Likud faction favor Republicans whereas the majority prefer Democrats.   Both are subservient to Israel, but perhaps they recognize that completely over the top fealty to Zionism is dangerous to Israeli interests.   </p>
