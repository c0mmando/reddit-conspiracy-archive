        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s great work what everyone does here to find justice for all. We&#39;re doing well targeting &#39;them&#39; and figuring out the massive problems within society. But doesn&#39;t that affect us? Following a few rabbit holes, I&#39;ve definitely found myself spooked or feeling needy of thinking more chill thoughts. </p>

<p>Tonight, I had to babysit my little sister. I&#39;m in my late 20s -- yes it was a weird period in my earlier life when mom was pregnant -- but anyway, being away from home, I didn&#39;t have much to do. I could&#39;ve played piano, but didn&#39;t want to. Couldn&#39;t watched the news, but not worth it on TV imo. Laptop was dead. Brutal. So I just sat there. </p>

<p>And within seconds, my mind was fighting with me. I had to find something to do, like pull out my phone, or I might lose my mind. But this time, no, I just sat there. And in a moment of grace, I realized...this whole &#39;I&#39;, this whole game I play called &#39;me&#39;, is not even real. It&#39;s a fiction I create through thoughts and memories. If, sitting there, I stopped thinking and stopped &#39;doing&#39; for a literal few seconds, the realization dawned on me more and more. It&#39;s not until I go thinking again that I enter back into the dimension of &#39;me&#39;. </p>

<p>The truth is that we&#39;re groomed in a society that believes it is its thoughts. We, for example, believe we are our names, social security numbers, our thoughts and unreal images. And from that image, we develop a paradigm through which we experience reality. We also call that tension-causing, lack-of-clarity-enducing &#39;me&#39;, or ego. </p>

<p>That ego, as a spoiled millennial, absolutely sucks. It thinks and thinks and criticizes. And we&#39;re exposed to so many opinions nowadays through social media + illegitimate public news, we don&#39;t know what to think. So it feels like we&#39;re all slowly going mad. </p>

<p>It can&#39;t be until people start waking up in a more conscious sense and realize that the selfish paradigm is an illusion. It isn&#39;t even real. That will help us find the truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that no matter what we pick reality to be, it&#39;s never good enough because each person is everything themselves. Since we all have our stories we can continue them. Breaking the story for everyone would be mean though. You think it would be your best interest but people would not be ready to handle reality as &quot;raw&quot; as others want to take it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like you realized &#39;people should start waking up..&#39; but it has likely just started with you.  And here&#39;s the thing: many millennials have realized they were on a track that wasn&#39;t natural to them and have been shaking that off, rewriting their focus, their vector.</p>

<p>Listen to your gut, find what is important to you, simplify those things, and go for it.  I just gave this advice to another brother, but seems like it may help you too.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t accept the negative labels placed on you.  Make your own labels, be a part of the solution.  Ditch the negativity and fear, focus on loving others.  Hurts no one, helps everyone including you.</p>

<p>Be well.</p>
