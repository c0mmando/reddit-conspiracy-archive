    <div class="md"><p>His tools were the parts of an old T Model that had been left on his property. He liked the battery particularly but used the rear leaf springs for quarrying. From the holes left in unfinished coral excavation you could see he had driven the leaf spring pieces into  the outside end of his quarry bed  at regular intervals and most likely had set them into  strong vibration to get the coral  loose but he still had to raise it  from the ground, shape it, move it across his property and  set it  into its   final position. He could do all of that  with multi ton stones, before lunch.</p>

<p>This tiny guy had shit going on.</p>

<p>A lot of his writing was about his  16 year old girlfriend in Latvia  who left him pitifully upset because she rejected life in the castle he made for her in Florida. There is a little about his using the earths magnetic field to do  his work but not enough to allow replication.</p>

<p>He claimed that electricity worked in a different way than       what science believes. He also made a more important claim. He said he could pull a, south pole only, magnetic force up from the earth and that helped him move the massive coral monoliths he quarried. What a dude.</p>
