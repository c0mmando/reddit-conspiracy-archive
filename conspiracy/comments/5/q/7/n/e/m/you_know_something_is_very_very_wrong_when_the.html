       When did I ever say the words concern troll. I  think you are fighting an argument over something that was never said by me. I agreed with you that it was your own sincere observation but only stated that having some form of evidence helps your case.

       Trump is actually very poor in liquid assets. There is even a noted joke in the new york billionaire's club when speaking of trump.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At least I could write a check for a billion dollars and it would clear

       Trump has over exaggerated his wealth to just about everyone. But modern views of democrats are not even democratic anymore. It is more akin to the

        Whig party

       "conspiracy theorists" are generally anti-authoritarian.  that can be left or right.  It can be "nationalist" or "globalist"- but those terms have different meanings to authoritarians and anti-authoritarians.

       It's the pro-authoritarian conspiracy theorists that you have to watch out for.  Those are the fascists.

       In this day and age, the left expects the government to censor hate speech, foster affirmative action programs, wellfare programs, and further regulations. It's pretty hard to have those sorts of expectations for the government and not be a statist.

       when you're talking about "the left", you're referring to the democrats- who occupy the authoritarian big government quadrant of the political compass.

       Both wings of the party are authoritarian.  And the vocal anti-tyranny groups are filled with cointelpro and then funded and coopted to represent extremism (think "alt-right/ tea party" and antifa/ black bloc) which still pushes authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "regressive left" (see the journalists at TruthDig and The Intercept) are multi-culturalists, but they aren't the SJWs you on the right are reacting to.

       There is proof that politics was taken over, between massive ban waves, CTR agenda being pushed and more...which when the topic is brought up, people link to or provide some form of evidence, they don't just make a claim and leave.

       Meanwhile, we are supposed to believe Russia is controlling Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally a media conspiracy to make Trump look bad and paint the enemies as his friends while people like Marc Rich do business with Iran and get presidential pardons and John Podesta gets 75,000 of Uranium One for his daughter's company, Joule.

       It isn't so much that this community is pro-Trump as it is anti-government criminal conspiracy, which is substantially proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the victim of an obvious conspiracy and it boggles the mind that people can't understand why this subreddit, of all subreddits, is going to latch onto it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who doesn't see the media collusion on a massive scale, intentionally distorting the weight of shitty opinions, is suffering from a myopic view.

       I think you only have to look at the polls and the reaction to see how widespread it is and how far from the truth the media is willing to go.

      </p>
      <p>
       If people are betting on Trump, Twitter is banning hillaryforprison, spiritcooking, et cetera, as they are hitting the number one trending while that polling app was showing Trump would win in a landslide... it should have been obvious to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is how much people trust the tv screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       One candidate does not have the resources employed in the last election. The Democrats burned through a billion dollars and the machine behind them may have been a great deal more. Trump didn't spend anywhere near what they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the CIA and FBI have a history of infiltrating the media, then how much money is that really? We take the billion they spent that we know of, then we add all of those man hours and cost of doing business with mainstream news outlets using our own government employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even worse, when you start taking into account the amount of money stolen through corruption that is allowed by these people who are kept in power by taxpayer money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is really not a part of their scheme, then it is significant. He is doing what he said he was going to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible to say, yet, how far he will go. We are only in week one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Donald Trump gets to everything he said in 4 years, the world's mind will be blown. Thus far, no politician has ever been that successful.

       Get out of my head man I wish more people could see it like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governments little mind control experiment is over. They never counted for the internet and the spread of information and knowledge at this level. That is why they are so desperately trying to control it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point even if they continue on this path too many people are awake now to the politics lull. Trump if nothing else sets a whole new level of scrutiny that the whole government is now facing now and in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next local elections I think change is coming to congress. I hope anyway. Even if they subvert the internet people are now interested in their local politics on both sides because of trump love or hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he stops getting baited by the media and just does his job we might see something special. But he is just a man and everyone has flaws. I believe his biggest flaw is our salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a narcissist and I think he is going to legitimately try to go down in history as one of greatest presidents in history. His ego to be the best just might be our ticket to getting off this wacky ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I wouldn't put it above him to put in the a new "power structure". Road to hell is paved with good intentions and all.

       Trump did hire astroturfers, though not seemingly with anything near Hillary's budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       One America News seems to be a pro Trump mainstream source.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, due to the leaks, the volume of information on DNC collusion, combined with other independent sources, does a lot better of a job uncovering Clinton cohorts their connections to organized crime and possibly being a bridge between intelligence and clandestine operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may have some mob lawyer connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was accused of sleeping with an underage girl, but the accuser, while able to describe Epstein's egg shaped penis, had no such details about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can tie Trump to DynCorp, Rand, Tavistock, ARK, or something similar, you may be able to make the case he is on the same team.
      </p>
      <p>
       The direction of the evidence hasn't seemed to have gone that way, yet, but that is what to look for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills would do well to play their games in that direction. That is something

       So, I went through the Panama Papers and turned up zilch. Trump sells companies, real estate development, usually, the use of his name. It makes tracking his stuff a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bizapedia is probably the best thing to go through, while Googling every name and cross referencing it with news articles, but I haven't taken the time to do that because the list is about 500 businesses. So, it is more involved than just a little Googling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote for Trump. I think the jury should still be out, because we have way more leaks on the other side and there is no reason to believe Republicans as a whole aren't dirty.

       has not yet been convinced that Trump is part of the problem. I haven't either. I am open to the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hurdle you really face is the John Titor and FBI Anon mythologies. According to the mythos, Trump is the savior and has been planning this, at least, since 2000 when he predicted 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also predicted Anthony Weiner pedo status.
      </p>
      <p>
       He appeared certain of his victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few others I'm not remembering, but the point is that he is very well informed and a lot smarter than people give him credit for. I mean, that or the time traveler story is true, which I can't believe for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke... he seems to avoid vices. His biggest scandal seems to be his taxes, which my understanding is that he merely applied Hillary's rules to defer losses for a number of years and pay no taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The grabbing the pussy thing, while damning, seems to be talking about women who are consenting... and let's face it, women do throw themselves at celebrities. Hillary's "hot dog no bun" for lunch email seems to be much the same, in terms of sexual harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't collected links or anything on him, but where I am at with Trump is:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I've never cared for his personality. Lately, he has improved.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't know what to make of his policies. Like the wall. Drugs still fly over, dig under and swim around. So will people. But hell, everyone seems to love the idea. That is clearly one of the reasons he was elected. So was the repeal of Obamacare. Americans wanted it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will not shun evidence or information that exposes his involvement in a wider scheme, I just haven't seen anything convincing, yet. I'm going to trust primary sources, as with the Clinton issues, but that detailed information isn't available on Trump, yet.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The whole leaks thing could totally be a scam. Selective leaks. If there was really a hostility with Russia, Russia could create chaos by releasing everything they had on the US intelligence community. So could China. Probably Iran and North Korea, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely not a leak war going on, as much as I would like to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has the power to implement transparency in every supposed 'enemy' government and force every regime to fix itself. Instead, we prefer conflict, war and drug cartels that the CIA participates in.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr In 6 months, I will have a more informed opinion. I've already had about that long to sit on the Clinton Foundation stuff.

So the sub just becomes a watered down version of what it was. Most people who have enjoyed this sub for a while would laugh at anyone still arguing a left/right paradigm.
