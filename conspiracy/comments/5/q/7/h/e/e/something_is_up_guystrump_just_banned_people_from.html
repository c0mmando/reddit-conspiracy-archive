        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So according to the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/trump-refugees-visas/index.html">mainstream media</a> reports Trump just banned people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering US for next 120 days?I wonder how he decided which countries to ban and for what reason?</p>

<p>Also does anyone remember when General Wesley Clark revealed that they had planned to bomb seven countries in 5 years immediately after 911.Take a look at the video below,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw</a></p>

<p>He mentions the same 6 countries out of 7 mentioned above and mentions Lebanon too.The countries are Iraq,Syria,Lebanon,Libya,Somalia, Sudan and Iran.The only new one that Trump included is Yemen.</p>

<p>If Trump really wanted to stop flow of Terrorism why did he not Include Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.I dont know how he chose these countries for the ban but to me it looks like he is just following the same puppet foreign policy that his predecessors were following.But i would like to hear from you what you have to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen- I&#39;ll buy into most conspiracy theories.  Hell, ill even buy that a bunch of those terrorist beheading videos are bought and paid for by insiders, especially the really high quality ones that look like they were shot in a professional studio.  But what I wont buy is that extremist groups don&#39;t exist and aren&#39;t exacting acts of legitimate terror.  You are giving humankind TOO much credit.  When conditions are poor, we become animals - people become animalistic for fucking half priced toasters on black friday.  But most importantly, there are TONS of totally raw unprofessional footage of grisly terroristic acts all over the internet that nobody really advertises or talks about, but its there.  Don&#39;t tell me it doesnt exist; thats just retarded and you aren&#39;t using any logic in your theorizing.  Its very well documented and legitimate</p>

<p>And how did the conditions in those countries became poor?Are you saying the rich first world countries mainly in the west and the US are not responsible even a tiny bit for their misery.If you really think this way then i am afraid you are totally naive to the realities of this world.Just pick up any credible history book and you will see how the nations that conquered and subdued other nations and their resources and brought them back to their countries are now called first world countries and most of them are western nations.Open your eyes and think for yourself dont let yourself be manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok lets clean this up.  </p>

<p>1) It&#39;s not a ban on travel, or an outright ban on specific nationalities.</p>

<p>2) It&#39;s a <strong>hiatus</strong> on refugee claimants. See this <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/trump-refugees-visas/index.html">CNN article</a> for the full text.</p>

<p>From the article;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump is considering a blanket ban on refugees for up to four months  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan also bars all persons from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen from entering the US for 30 days  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan outlined in the draft order indicates that once the 120-day suspension of refugee admissions ends, the US prioritize admissions of those refugees who are fleeing religious persecution  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Admissions for Syrian refugees would be suspended indefinitely, until Trump determines the system has undergone a sufficient overhaul in vetting and screening practices.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is wrong with this?</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Why is it unreasonable to temporarily cease refugee admittance until the vetting process is analyzed for accuracy?</strong> </p>

<p>You are wrong. This is about terrorism. This is a reaction to Europe astounding vetting and integration failure which has turn into a social and legal crisis. </p>

<p>Honestly, you should be more concerned about this statement;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the months-long suspension of refugee admissions into the US, the draft order would suspend the US visa waiver programs, which allows citizens of major US allies to enter the US on a temporary tourist visa.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This move will damage tourism and trade from allied nations and potentially cost the economy billions of dollars in the long run. </p>

<p>Ouch someone is a little pissy aren&#39;t they?  </p>

<p>This is about stopping terrorists. A terrorist will not make a &quot;refugee claim&quot;, they will just get the correct papers pretending to be from Greece and fly on in.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know, it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s job to figure it out. Might be a way for Trump to gain favors post-presidency. This ban doesn&#39;t apply to places he&#39;s done business in, like Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Wrong. There has been many terror attacks in Europe committed by those who have entered France or Germany as refugees. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34832512">In the November 2015 Paris attacks</a> some, but not all, were Syrian and Iraqi refugees.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/germany-bomb-blast-what-we-know-so-far-ansbach-attack">The July 2016 attack in Ansbach</a> was committed by a rejected Syrian refugee.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/europe/berlin-attack-christmas-market.html">The Berlin Christmas market attack</a> was committed by a Pakistani asylum seeker. </p>

<p>And on and on and on (I can&#39;t be bothered looking more up). </p>

<p>The problem with refugee claimants is that many of those seeking asylum arrive with no identification, passport, birth certificate or any other travel documents (such is the problem with being a refugee). While intelligence agencies have names and id&#39;s on suspects it&#39;s difficult to catch these people at international borders. Thus, Trump has paused refugee processing until an effective screening process can be reviewed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a ban on muslims. It&#39;s not a ban on refugees. It&#39;s not a ban on immigration. It&#39;s simply a pause to ensure the problems Europe is experiencing don&#39;t show here. <strong>Again, why is this a problem?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ban doesn&#39;t apply to places he&#39;s done business in, like Saudi Arabia.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the ban is on nations with refugee crisis&#39;s. Saudi Arabia is not exporting refugees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The European attacks show clear evidence that terrorists use the refugee system to gain entry to countries specifically to attack those nations. The US hasn&#39;t dealt with an attack like this, in part because of the low volume (relative to Europe) of refugees it&#39;s accepted.  </p>

<p>The purpose of the temporary ban is to correct issues like false claims of Christian asylum seekers fleeing ISIS. The ban is to allow immigration and intelligence officials an opportunity to develop filtering tools so that legitimate asylum seekers can gain access to the country and not pose a terror threat to the nation. </p>

<p>The optics you are interpreting about Saudi Arabia are not a result of the ban, but how the ban has been presented in the media. Look at the CNN article OP linked to. </p>

<p>CNN says;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan also bars all persons from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen from entering the US for 30 days, consistent with the &quot;Muslim ban&quot; that Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in the <em>very next sentence</em> clarifies their propaganda with;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the measure doesn&#39;t reference Islam specifically, advocacy groups said the order was plainly targeting Muslims.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, CNN just said &quot;Trump is banning all Muslims... but he really hasn&#39;t done anything to ban Muslims specifically..&quot; What the fuck?? </p>

<p>The news coverage this has gotten has headlined the executive order as an outright immigration ban. </p>

<p>Forbes <em>&quot;These Countries with Business Links to Trump Aren’t Part of His Immigration Ban&quot;</em><br/>
The Gaurdian <em>&quot;Protesters gather in New York as fear grows over Trump&#39;s immigration plans&quot;</em><br/>
Huffington Post <em>&quot;Protesters Flood NYC’s Washington Square Park To Oppose Muslim Ban&quot;</em><br/>
The Independent <em>&quot;Donald Trump’s immigration ban hits Muslim-majority countries (except those linked to his business)&quot;</em><br/>
Washington Post <em>&quot;Trump’s order to ban refugees and immigrants triggers fears across the globe&quot;</em>  </p>

<p>a) Its not a permanent ban
b) The ban doesn&#39;t mention religion so Christians and Hindus (etc) are included in the ban
c) It specifically targets war torn countries
d) It&#39;s scheduled to last 4 months. </p>

<p>You, me, and everyone else are being lied to constantly. </p>

<p>It hurts refugees instead of terrorists because terrorists can still find ways in to the country. It leaves out Saudi Arabia and Egypt, countries he&#39;s done business in, showing that if you help Trump&#39;s pocketbook he grants you preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Is there anything suggesting the &quot;vetting process&quot; needs to be &quot;analyzed&quot;? We&#39;re seeing refugees at a far lower rate than Europe, so we won&#39;t get bogged down like them. There&#39;s an entire ocean seperating us, the only way in is through flight so there&#39;s literally no way they can come here unnoticed. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Not a racist move, and not a new one either. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s true. The situation for any refugee will be always be horrible, but the finger of blame should not be pointed at the United States for protecting its own national interest.   </p>

<p>True also that terrorists will find alternative means of entering the country but there is no reason leaving the front door unlocked if you thing you will have a break in from the back door. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It leaves out Saudi Arabia and Egypt,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they aren&#39;t at war, ergo no refugees should be coming from there. Refugees coming out of Saudi Arabia or Egypt will be sourced from one of the banned countries. Furthermore, most of the United States and Western society does business with Saudi Arabia because of oil. Using a billionaires private business interests in Saudi Arabia as evidence of political collusion doesn&#39;t really hold any water. Qatar, the UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Jordan aren&#39;t on the list either but that doesn&#39;t mean Trump does or does not have business dealing with those countries. Besides, the Clintons also deal heavily with Saudi Arabia and Qatar and we would be in the same position if Hillary had been elected president. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The European situation definitely indicates the vetting process used there is garbage. I&#39;m not sure what if the US process is the same, but if it is similar then it merits evaluation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I agree 100% we should help them, especially considering many of their problems are caused by our actions in the middle east. There has to be a balance of security vs charity though. The current administration was elected partly because of their stance on immigration and asylum. Trump has never hidden his plans for refugees, and has been stating he wanted to increase the quality of the vetting process since last summer. You can look up transcripts of his speeches and he was explicit in his plans. He&#39;s doing what he said he would do, and at least 46% of the electorate agrees with him.  </p>

<p>The logic puzzle of how many terrorists should you allow in vs how many refugees get saved is never ending. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do believe that there are many terrorists in Saudi Arabia and it is wrong to target refugees, but not the actual terrorists.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Saudi Arabia is a fucking hotbed of anti-American terrorism and the government clandestinely funds terror groups internationally. Unfortunately, international politics is what it is right now and the President can&#39;t simply alienate Saudi Arabia without just cause. That in itself would make the terror problem explode (pun intended) beyond what it is now. Trump (or any other president) needs to find a valid reason to punish Saudi Arabia while at the same time maintaining a supply of a strategic resource (oil).   </p>

<p>The best approach to take right now, in my opinion, is catching who we can as they migrate. ISIS has openly stated they will abuse the refugee process to infiltrate Western nations. Because of that statement increased measures need to be taken to filter legitimate vs illegitimate claimants.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We won&#39;t have that situation because there&#39;s an ocean separating us.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True again, but Europe does have a vetting process however. It&#39;s absolutely terrible. Europe also has an integration program that&#39;s equally as terrible. North America (US, Canada, and to a lesser degree Mexico) has been accepting and integrating migrants for over 200 years. The nations are experienced at integrating differing cultures and ideals and teaching newcomers about the differences of their new home nation. The entire continent knows how to do this properly. Europe on the other hand, is made up of bumbling idiots who think collection camps and power point presentations will integrate people who have been goat farming in the desert for the better part of their lives. The refugee crime rate in Europe proves this. </p>

<p>Even worse for the European situation is the active participation of organized crime in the trafficking of illegal migrants. The mafia in Italy makes <strong>a lot</strong> of money smuggling in people through Sicily and Calabria.    </p>

<p>Despite all of this I think it&#39;s better to step back for a few months, assess the situation, and proceed once we are assured this process functions properly or better than it has. Now that the massive flood of migrants has died down we have an opportunity to cherry pick the most deserving or the most capable refugee applicants. It&#39;s a harsh approach to take, but I feel a better one in the long run because it will strengthen the country and serve those successful applicants best. </p>
