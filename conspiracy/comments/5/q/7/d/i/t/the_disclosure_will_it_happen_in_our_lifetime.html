    <div class="md"><p>Ive always theorized that ETs would most likely look very similar to us (up right, 2 legs, 2 arms, eyes at the front, very &quot;anthropomorphic&quot; . Another is that maybe we were planted here by &quot;us&quot; in an effort to see their progress on a different planet or just in an effort to study how we would manage if were somehow sent back to the &quot;stone age&quot;. Your theory sounds fascinating. Mind expanding? Are you talking about a sort of Kyle XY (if you even heard if that show) or something like the next step in human evolution?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are being visited by aliens and not alone I would guess it&#39;s more like we aren&#39;t allowed to join until we get our stuff together. Imagine a race of beings that can travel the stars. The technology and culture of a race like that would have to be highly organized and far beyond what we have. We couldn&#39;t be entrusted with such technology, imagine a terrorist with such power. We still kill each other over make believe fairy tales. We are really pathetic as a species even though we have accomplished some great things. We rape each other, kill each other for paper, torture each other, rape kids, the horrors never end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah Ive definitely thought that before. It would make the most sense to wait until we can collectively &quot;ascend&quot; to a higher plane of thinking. First contact today would send the world into a panic. It would turn most religions onto their heads and a lot of peoples first instinct would be to attack. There also could be the possibility that there are no species capable of interstellar travel anywhere near us and we go extinct or are long gone from this galaxy before anything visits our solar system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people believe a lot of things, some more likely than others. I believe the moon landing was real because if the Soviets had a chance to expose America like that they would have but i can definitely see why people doubt it, it being a time of global posturing and with tech less advanced than most cellphones. Are you saying though that believing the earth is flat along with moon landing being fake contradicts believing in aliens?</p>

<p>Who knows? not me. My ideas and images of alien life involve spheres, stars, space, and spaceships. It&#39;s possible they used other flat planets as skipping stones to get here, or that the flat space is never-ending.</p>

To agree with u/vanquish,  we are savages, who amongst us has tried to communicate with a wild beast, an how successful was it?

    <div class="md"><p>maybe a &#39;partial&#39; disclosure; meaning, not the whole truth. so what good will that be? how will that profit the handlers? it won&#39;t, so they want to keep us where we&#39;re at: on prison planet.</p>

<p>the flip side to that, is if we&#39;re able to free ourselves. should that happen, then i&#39;d expect some &#39;good guys&#39; to show up (or reveal themselves, with our &#39;blinders&#39; removed, we&#39;ll be able to communicate). we won&#39;t get an invite (be approached) until we&#39;ve ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading about the <a href="http://www.ufohastings.com/">UFO-nuke connection</a> (where on multiple occasions UFOs have been sighted hovering over nuclear weapons storage facilities and disabling the warheads), I believe that while they don&#39;t want to interfere with our development (prime directive), they also don&#39;t want to see us blow ourselves up and will take action to prevent such a scenario.</p>

<p>As to why their existence hasn&#39;t been publicly acknowledged yet, the cabal that owns this planet will never agree to disclosure because they benefit too much from keeping the public in the dark for a number of reasons, the most important of which is the ETs&#39; free energy and anti gravity technologies that have the power to destroy their control systems and set humanity free.</p>
