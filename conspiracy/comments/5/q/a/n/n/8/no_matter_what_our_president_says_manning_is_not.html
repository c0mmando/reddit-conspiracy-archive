       I agree. Just don't think breaking the law for noble purposes negates the law. Especially if you are member of the military. Bradley Manning lucked out that an impotent president needed to clutch to something besides failure. Had Hillary won, Manning would still be in prison.

       That's awful logic if what we want is more transparency.  The law isn't always ethical, which is why whistle blowers have to exist in the first place.

       What about the people killed because of his actions? Isn't he responsible and complicit of collateral murder as well? Yes, he is. Also, his motivation might have been less than noble and more spiteful...which changes the dynamic as well. Now that he's going to be released, the unvarnished truth will reveal itself. Buckle up.

       We can speculate about his motivations all day long. Doesn't absolve the crimes he exposed. Same thing with hillary. Whether it was russia or an unhappy NSA agent, she comitted crimes.

       AFAIK, difference between Snowden or Assange and "traitors" like Manning, is that the former did it through the proper channels and as responsibly as possible. Manning just dumped a bunch of files without vetting them for state secrets, op identities, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, the fact that she got pardoned before Assange or Snowden is absolutely ridiculous.

       None of them should need a pardon. If MSM could be trusted to do the right thing, Wikileaks wouldn't be necessary. The only reason the NSA leak was handled the way it was, is because Glen Greenwald is persistent enough to make sure his editor doesn't completely censor it. Now that he has his own outlet, he is the last MSM bastion to publish wrong doing. Even then, how many americans actually read the intercept? Not enough. But if you have something big enough, like top military brass knowingly authorizing the murder of civilians, better to release it to wikileaks, because at least then it will get read.

       I agree, although Manning's choices on how to handle the documents was not the best way to go about it. Wikileaks is far and away the best option, because the media is completely unreliable.

       I shill take that into consideration. We live in very dark, cold times. It's shilling.. Brr.. But it's ok. I went to eat dinner the other night, and I was like "bring me the shill", but the manager comped my meal! Some good things still happen, and I'm gonna try to focus on that unshill I can't anymore.

       Oh, I mean "shall", "chilling", "bill", and "until", not "shill, shilling", "shill" and "shill". Whoopsie. Butterfingers.. My apologies.

       I think Trump equates the Manning leaks with being disloyal, eg traitor.  I fully agree with leaking due to moral reasons.  However, leaking due to moral reasons is different than protections for disobeying unlawful orders.  At the time, the actions that the military was having Manning preform in Iraq were considered lawful, while morally reprehensible.  Additionally,  morality is unfortunately subjective.  I'd much rather Trump give an opinion on this matter that isn't limited to 140 characters / a sound bite.

       Perhaps moral axioms are subjective, but inferences made from them are either true or false.

       If you're a humanist, for example, and you believe in human rights, then the way Manning is being treated is very obviously wrong.

       Well, it kind of is ungrateful to call the guy who let you out of prison "weak".

       That being said, I think the real torture would have been to keep her in prison but withhold the transgender medical treatments.  She did get hormone therapy and treatment for her gender dysphoria while in prison.  That's more treatment than some vets with more serious medical problems get and they didn't even break the law.

       I agree, although Manning's choices on how to handle the documents was not the best way to go about it. Wikileaks is far and away the best option, because the media is completely unreliable.
