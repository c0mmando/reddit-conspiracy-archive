    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK, difference between Snowden or Assange and &quot;traitors&quot; like Manning, is that the former did it through the proper channels and as responsibly as possible. Manning just dumped a bunch of files without vetting them for state secrets, op identities, etc. </p>

<p>Personally, the fact that she got pardoned before Assange or Snowden is absolutely ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of them should need a pardon. If MSM could be trusted to do the right thing, Wikileaks wouldn&#39;t be necessary. The only reason the NSA leak was handled the way it was, is because Glen Greenwald is persistent enough to make sure his editor doesn&#39;t completely censor it. Now that he has his own outlet, he is the last MSM bastion to publish wrong doing. Even then, how many americans actually read the intercept? Not enough. But if you have something big enough, like top military brass knowingly authorizing the murder of civilians, better to release it to wikileaks, because at least then it will get read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump equates the Manning leaks with being disloyal, eg traitor.  I fully agree with leaking due to moral reasons.  However, leaking due to moral reasons is different than protections for disobeying unlawful orders.  At the time, the actions that the military was having Manning preform in Iraq were considered lawful, while morally reprehensible.  Additionally,  morality is unfortunately subjective.  I&#39;d much rather Trump give an opinion on this matter that isn&#39;t limited to 140 characters / a sound bite.</p>
