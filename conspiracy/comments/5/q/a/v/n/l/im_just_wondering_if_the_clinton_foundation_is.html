       Eric Braverman was found on Jan 17 when there was an announcement that the ex-Clinton Foundation CEO was hired by a Google foundation.  George Webb has interesting insights into the CIA, NOCs, the rapid appropriation of rising technology by the CIA.
      </p>

       We know this isn't theory but fact.  That Google (now "Alphabet" (wink)), started out as In-Q-Tel, a CIA company.  We know that Microsoft works closely with the CIA and NSA, so do apple.  We know Facebook got its start by funding from the intelligence community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange says Google is not what it seems, it turns out he's right.  Eric Schmidt is a NOC.  Gates is likely a NOC.    Zuckerberg is so obviously a NOC he's also a trying to hard at it.  Yahoo has been working with the intelligence community and personally I believe they bought DDG in order to turn it into lycos so that people would be corralled to go back to Google.  They took this as a bailout from the total failure of management that is marissa mayer's reign bringing yahoo to a near death rattle.  Jobs was not a NOC and because of that he got Cancer and died.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/582421/is_cia/">
        Hillary and Obama are CIA / NOCs
       </a>
      </p>

       Your whole world is being run by criminal gangsters, everything you see everything you touch, everything you hear.  Oh and they are bombing innocents and raping kids...for YOU!
      </p>

       <strong>
        Land of Opportunity
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who made a very earnest and skillful effort to compete with these online social offerings in the early 2000s, it's was eye-opening to retroactively reassess why funding was so difficult then, and why I could finally stop being so butthurt about it.  Because if I had come from a CIA family, then, or had any relationship whatsoever to any of them, then I'd be 'in the club' and therefore would be a multimillionaire by now.  Therefore all the narratives we've talked about since then, about luck, timing, marketing failures, badstrategy, optics, etc...all fall by the wayside with the idea that this level of elitist dotcom tradecraft appropriation necessarily undermines any notions of 'equal opportunity', or "friendly competition" in entrepreneurship.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nice to have my experience be retroactively validated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you invent something, they will infiltrate your company with a NOC, steal your intellectual property and then sell it to China.  If they can do this to our own military and defense contractors such as Boeng, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, with military stealth jet technology, then they can certainly do it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is immune.  No one.  Not Sun Microsystems.  Not McDonalds.  Not the Fairview K-12 School District.  The sooner everyone understands that the CIA is a crime syndicate that steals everything, including intellectual property, the sooner you'll understand why they need to be dropped like a bad habit.  Until we fix this, we have no rigtht to talk about America in terms of "land of opportunity". That's a myth.  It's been a myth since they blew up JFKs cranium.

       You're wrong about CIA and In-Q-Tel. It was the success of google that led to the creation of In-Q-Tel. The Highlands forum was the original backer for google. In-Q-Tel came after.

       They certainly seem to be in cahoots don't they. The Assange account for Google lays out the exact same game plan of the CF. 
I was not aware Braverman had joined forces with Google.

       Partnered is not the same as being sold. Far from it. Would it be preferable they partnered with Google? I don't think so. They're using the Yahoo API to get search results. And if I'm not mistaken Yahoo uses Bing on the back end anyway...

       Jobs was widely ridiculed for not being "charitable", but once you start connecting the dots from charity ---&gt; foundations ----&gt; tax legal evasion it's starting to look like a whole different story. If nothing else, he was paying his taxes.
