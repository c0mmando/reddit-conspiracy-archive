<p>Which would necessitate South being the entire circumference of the disk. How would that work? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A similar question for the Globe model is how planes maintain altitude over an earth curving lower away from them without also making a constant slight adjustment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. The &quot;constant slight adjustment&quot; is made for them by gravity.</p>

<p>You have to understand how lift works to understand why an aircraft does not have to &quot;make adjustments&quot;. The lift provided by a wing is relative to the density of the air it is passing through - this is why aircraft have a maximum altitude. Any higher and their wings can not provide enough lift.</p>

<p>In &quot;level flight&quot; the balance between lift and gravity is equal, so the aircraft maintains altitude. If it flies higher, the lift is not enough to overcome the gravity and it falls back down. So in &quot;level flight&quot; the aircraft is &quot;floating&quot; on the surface of a bubble of air dense enough for the lift and gravity to cancel out. This causes it to follow the curvature of that bubble without any adjustments being made by the pilots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Level flight over a round ball means you eventually would be much higher . Flight works because of density by overcoming gravity.  Gravity is not a factor as it is cancelled out of planes would crash.Jet engines need atmosphere to work or they stop. We don&#39;t let our airplanes self correct by flying to high until they come back down because of air density.  When you fly you know when you go up or down and you would feel it. planes use gyroscopes to maintain level flight not air density or gravity. Gyroscopes prove the earth is both flat and non moving. Gyroscopes are purely mechanical devices. Constant adjustments would need to be made manually and you would alway feel like you were failing or fly down. Flying west to east should be way fast if the earth is moving 1000 mph under you the other direction. All flights on a ball would be the same direction if it moves at 1000 mph. In airplane you are not spinning with the earth and are free to fly where ever . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sympathetic to FE but I know all the globe retorts so I&#39;ll supply them in the interest on intelligent discussion over ad hominem attacks. </p>

<p>The issue of why flight time isn&#39;t separated from the spin of the globe below it  is explained by the plane already &quot;moving before takeoff&quot; and &quot;continuing&quot; this motion after it no longer touches the ground. Similar to tossing a ball on a moving train. But the earth moves at different speeds at different latitudes. In fact this is why they claim a plane flying from a large number altitude towards the equator will have to adjust for the Coriolis Effect because the earth near the poles spins much slower than the earth near the equator. So, hypothetically, you could take off in a VTOL aircraft in Canada, fly to Panama, hover, and the Earth would actually visibly rotate underneath you. I&#39;d like to see someone try that.</p>

<p>As to the gyroscope, they claim it works via gravity but the manufacturer disputes that. I agree with you, it is highly problematic for the globe model.</p>

<p>As to the physics of wing lift, I think they may very well be correct. But that just means that on this one point their model survives. Of course on a flat earth flights would also maintain altitude without adjustments, so on this issue we are scored a draw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you&#39;re cool and nice. You&#39;re good dude. You can hover in helicopter or balloon and the earth never rotates out from under it. And it should. If the earth rotates at the equator roughly at 1000mph and you hover for an hour above the ground should have moved one thousand miles. Planes can fly in any direction independent of the earth below,even if the atmosphere moved with the earth,which it doesn&#39;t , planes flying west to east should be faster than flights flying was to west. The plane can&#39;t be locked to the rotation of the earth and still fly independently to random destinations and all four directions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going the same speed as the earth when you hover dude. Seriously drop something straight down from a moving car it doesn&#39;t drop straight down like a laser it travels forward until air resistance and gravity slow it down the car over takes it. Also once you escape that influence of the earths gravity and rotation the earth does spin under you.

    <div class="md"><p>How would you go the same speed as an object that is now separate from you without some force to propel? How would you hover at the same speed? That defies logic and can only be accomplished by imagination. You understand resistance would work for my position to? In your scenario, The helicopter would experience major drag when it hovers, which it does not, unlesss there is wind. And that would be from any direction and has nothing to do with the spin of the earth. You are not moving a thousand miles per hour. If we were and you hovered above the earth you would move in relation to where lifted off from and you would drift a lot. And that doesn&#39;t happen. Once in the air you have defied gravity. Which really comes down to density in most cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve really never understood this argument.  Let’s say the earth is round and rotating.  At the equator, it’s something close to 1000 miles per hour of rotation.  I’m sitting in my balloon, but it’s resting on the ground before takeoff.  That means my balloon and I are both going 1000 MPH too.  Cool, so now I fire up my balloon and take off.  I’m 1 foot off the ground, but I’m still going 1000 MPH.  How could I not be?  Where would my speed have gone?  What would have slowed my down?  As I rise, what would slow me down?  Where would my kinetic energy be transferred to?</p>

Repeat this process for billions of years, and you have an atmosphere that is entire accelerated to the speed of the earth.  What would slow it down?  What resistance does the wind have?  It only has other wind (which is also being accelerated by the earth), or the earth (which is trying to speed it up).  What other forces are there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That much friction and we would baked and not 420style . Air is not moving with the planet. Anything that moves hits air resistance . It&#39;s less going with the wind than against. All the air is not magically connected together and to earth spinning at 1000mph. Try spinning something 200 mph and if not designed properly it will self destruct. You can&#39;t have physics and then take it away when it&#39;s convenient for you. There is no magic moving the air at increasing speeds as you go up to maintain a fixed position with the earth. If the earth was spinning at a 1000 mph all air travel would be one direction. The airplane moves independent of the air and earth and the air moves indep made fly of the earth dep being on its temp it will rise and fall due to density. Fires should look like an old locomotive spewing ten mile trails of smoke in your model, if you add in physics. The smoke that left the train was moving at the same speed when it left the chimney and is pulled back because of resistance. The same concept would apply to your model if the earth was spinning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes 0 energy to continously spin something.  There is no resistance in space, only the momentum of the earth.  With nothing to slow it down, it will spin forever!  There is only a tiny wisp of atmosphere, and 5.9 * 10<sup>24</sup> kg of mass of the earth.  The air can&#39;t slow the earth down significantly, and once it&#39;s sped up NOTHING will slow it down.  There is nothing else to worry about.  Even if it took a billion years for all the air to get sped up by the earth, we&#39;d still have 3 billion years of air moving with the earth, and nothing to slow it down.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qbpv6/how_is_flat_earth_theory_not_a_psyop/dcyf29p/">here</a> you&#39;ll see me agreeing that air higher up doesn&#39;t keep up with air lower down.  The problem with your argument is, the difference in speeds, when you calculate them, is very small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you saying? On a flat earth that is not moving, I expect the ball to land at my feet. That works on flat land too, brainiac.  It is not supporting any spin. If the earth is spinning 1000 mph , anything in the air would drift from its initial launch location. Air does not move with the earth through friction. Friction applies to objects. Air is not an object. All of this works in my favor but you reply wih this....think about what I&#39;m saying</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal attacks and insults add nothing to discussion. I was simply pointing out that the word &quot;round&quot; does not implicitly relate to a 3 dimensional shape. Before you throw out insults and down vote in retaliation, reflect upon your own statements and expand your own knowledge and understanding of the words you use.</p>

<p>The word &quot;round&quot; as defined in the dictionary is
1. Having a flat, circular surface, as a disc</p>

<ol>
<li>Spherical, or globular, as a ball</li>
</ol>

<p>There are actually 18 different definitions for the adjective form of &quot;round&quot; in the English language according to the dictionary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the vector shifted you would see the artificial horizon roll back or forward. Gyroscopes spin in their own vector and resist gravity. Gyros maintain a spin with mechanical precision that defies gravity and maintains a level spin regardless. The base or gimble moves with gravity letting you know where you horizon is.

    <div class="md"><p>No they do not spin with gravity. They maintain precision locked position. You can start the spin of a gyro in any position and it will maintain it, that&#39;s its job. Put a gyro on a board spin it and lift and tilt the board and it will maintain the same vector because centrifugal force over comes gravity if you keep it spinning. It maintainst the position it was spinning in when it started.  The gimble of base moves . Watch a video from NASA about how a gyro works. It&#39;s all there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Respectfully, the time lapse photography can&#39;t be used to prove or disprove either theory. I can just as easily say &quot;time lapse photography proves there is no parallax effect and that the stars rotate above us&quot;. All I&#39;m saying is that our observations of the sky above us fail to tell us much of anything about the ground beneath us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your opinion too.  Let me ask, what would be one instance of a reality (you choose) that has different stars in north vs south Hemisphere?  And the time lapse photography in each Hemisphere rotate around a central point at opposite sides in opposite directions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I should clarify where I stand. I&#39;m anti-globe and a cautious flat-earther. I can&#39;t possibly pretend to know the true nature of our world. I do know we&#39;ve been lied to as there&#39;s overwhelming evidence that our earth is not as we&#39;ve been told. The current heliocentric model is a product of the religion of science, a theory that is based on solid math but not sound, repeatable, scientific proofs.</p>

<p>So back to our discussion about the sky. I don&#39;t know what causes the star trails to be different between the northern and southern hemisphere. I&#39;ve entertained different theories but haven&#39;t found one that makes sense. I also don&#39;t know what causes eclipses (it&#39;s gotta be more complicated than &#39;shadows&#39; between earth/sun/moon.) There are a lot of things about our sky that cannot be easily explained by either model. If there&#39;s a firmament above us, it probably isn&#39;t a simple dome (based on the aforementioned star trails). The earth may not be entirely flat, it could be concave, it could be much much larger than we think. It could be hollow. It could be a realm with portals to other worlds. See what I&#39;m getting at? Once you realize we don&#39;t live on a ball, everything is open for debate. And this is healthy. If common citizens were allowed to make expeditions to Antarctica and the north pole, it would get us a lot closer to the truth.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important for us all to admit that we do not know as much about the cosmos as we think we do. Given enough scrutiny, it&#39;s obvious NASA and all space agencies lie about almost everything. So just because the stars follow a certain path doesn&#39;t immediately prove we live on a ball. Or just because our moon and other planets appear spherical (are they really?) doesn&#39;t immediately prove we live on a sphere. It&#39;s unscientific to jump to those conclusions, just as it would be unscientific for me to say we live on a flat disc under a dome surrounded by an ice wall when there is no scientific evidence to back up those claims. All that said, I&#39;ve done enough research and analysis to conclude we do not live on a spinning ball flying through space. </p>

At the equator, the circumference of the Earth is 40,070 kilometers, and the day is 24 hours long so the speed is 1670 kilometers/hour ( 1037 miles/hr). This decreases by the cosine of your latitude so that at a latitude of 45 degrees, cos(45) = .707 and the speed is .707 x 1670 = 1180 kilometers/hr. You can use this formula to find the speed of rotation at any latitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the math made up?  Do you agree that a circle has 360 degrees?  Do you agree that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees?  Then, with some high school level math, we can prove the earth can&#39;t possibly be flat.</p>

<p>Suppose that it is the equinox.  On the flat earth model, that means the sun is directly over the circle of the equator.  Now, let’s calculate the sun’s altitude.  At 45 degrees latitude, at exactly noon, we measure the angle to the sun.  The lines of latitude, in fact, are named for the angle to the sun on the equinox at noon.  So, we know the angle will be 45 degrees.  If we draw a line from where we are standing, to the equator, then to the sun and back to us, we’ll have made a nice right triangle.  Since one angle is 45 degrees, we know the other is as well.  That means that the distance to the equator from where we are standing MUST be the same as the distance to the sun from the equator.  Incidentally, that’s a little over 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Now, let’s pretend, at the same time, we have another person in Antarctica, making the same measurement.  But they’re going to wait until their local midnight.  This means the sun will be on the opposite side of the equator, its maximum distance.  It’s about 6213 miles from the north pole to the equator, so we can triple that distance to get Antarctica to the opposite side of the equator, 18639 miles.  But, we now have another right triangle!  Let’s just plug in what we know in <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">this</a>   handy calculator and find out the angle to the sun.  Side b will be the 18639 (the observer to the far side of the equator), and side a will be 3000 (the height of the sun).  Angle A will represent the angle to the sun.  This is the LOWEST the sun will ever get for that point, since we waited until local midnight.</p>

<p>I got 9.14 degrees.  To give some context, the width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10 degrees.  That means the sun should be no less than a fist’s width above the horizon at all times for the equinox.  For most every other city in the world, it should be MUCH higher.  High school trigonometry proves the earth can’t be flat; the law of perspective says so!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem is these scientists have so much power over the general dumb population ( there&#39;s a lot of stupid people in this world, im sure you&#39;re aware) that anything science or scientists say or show, even with proof, fully knowing that these people make up information, supress truth and doctor whatever stats or numbers they need to, in order to push whatever agenda or truth they wish to.</p>

<p>We are at the point today where science is more of a religion than religion is.
Whatever these few people say (scientists etc) people believe without question, because &quot;science&quot; and &quot;science says so and tells us&quot; such and such. We have been conditioned hard for citizens to believe anything and everything science and scientists tell us.</p>

<p>Im not sure if you&#39;ve noticed this, but as soon as any scientific article comes out people start showing these sciences to be total and complete proof, even when studies are being funded by the same companies the study is to benefit. Like coke saying sugar is perfectly fine for you and the study was funded by the sugar industry. We see shit like this all the time.</p>

<p>You need to keep an open mind and open eye, study and learn what happens in this world and what type of show and stage they are trying to set or show us. We are all being guided and run by influences that do NOT have any of our best  interest in mind.</p>

<p>So there is no incentive for scientists to hide the truth from anyone, theres actually a whole lot more for them to gain as individuals by proving some long held belief wrong. Thats how you win a nobel prize.  Thats how you get institutions named after you. </p>

<p>Well you asked how gyroscopes would work without gravity so it seems that you are implying that &quot;gravity&quot; exists.  I agree that the 9.78m/s calculation can be measured but that doesn&#39;t mean that it is caused by gravity specifically.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly following you here.  A plane does not have to pitch the nose forward to not fly off of the Earth because of gravity.  Gravity is the human explanation for why things are attracted to each other.  That said there are conflicting theories as to what gravity is and the mechanics behind it as humans have yet to fully understand what gravity is and how it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s attraction to the earth, perhaps the plane thing is a silly argument either for flat earth or globe earth. One thing the theory of gravity never makes clear is whether a gravitational field is a gradient or constant? That&#39;s why the &quot;official&quot; explanation is so full of theories to back up the official theory, but that&#39;s just a jumbled mess. You&#39;ll not find a single axiomatic principle in the theories other than acceleration at 9.78m/s</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They have talked extensively with pilots about how the planes do not compensate for the spherical nature of the earth by constantly nosing down, which they would have to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they would not have to do that at all. That claim is based on a total lack of understanding of how aircraft fly.</p>

<p>To maintain altitude, an aircraft has to generate enough lift to overcome gravity. More lift will cause it to climb, less lift will cause it to descend.</p>

<p>The amount of lift a wing generates is directly related to the density of the air it is moving through. As an aircraft flies higher, the air becomes less dense and the wings provide less lift.</p>

<p>So an aircraft in level flight will follow the curvature of the earth because if it didn&#39;t it would gain altitude into less dense air, reducing its lift and causing to to fall back down until the air was dense enough for the lift to cancel out gravity.</p>

<p>In other words, without making any adjustments at all, the aircraft will follow the surface of the &quot;dense enough&quot; air, neither gaining or losing altitude. This means it will follow the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;Nosing down&quot; would reduce the amount of lift the wings generate, causing the aircraft to lose altitude, and it will soon hit the ground. So not only do pilots <em>not</em> have to constantly &quot;nose down&quot;, if they did they&#39;d soon be dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously believe in gravity, so what is it? Beyond a description of the effect, do you understand how it works? Or do you have little more than a parroted theory? Einstein&#39;s flawed theory was never and has never been proven. So again, I ask you, what is gravity? </p>

<p>If we can&#39;t even directly detect so called gravity waves. How can you possibly know the truth? You can&#39;t you are simply taking someone&#39;s word for it and attempting to undermine any point that disagrees. That is far more ridiculous than actually believing the earth is flat.</p>

<p>So I ask you again, what is gravity? </p>

<p>You say a group of people are stupid for thinking the dominant force is electromagnetic in nature. You think it&#39;s gravity, except you don&#39;t even know what it is. Do you realize how absurd that sounds? You believe in something but you can only describe it phenomenologically, you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p>So again I ask you, what is gravity? because you sure act like you know. </p>

<p>Just because I don&#39;t know the particulars about the mechanics, math and science around it, doesn&#39;t negate its existence. A 5 year old can grasp that. A hot stove will burn you whether you believe in the conduction of heat in metal or not. Getting burned by a touching a hot stove isn&#39;t a theory, it is a fact. Gravity is a force that acts upon everything on the planet, pulling toward the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>quite the opposite. there is no scientific proof, no experiment has ever proven that the earth is spinning. gravity is just a theory - it cannot be explained by anything other than math. the religion of science pushes globe earth without actually practicing real science. conversely, flat earthers are using the actual scientific method to prove things like...there is no curvature. </p>

<p>No Curvature is the #1 easiest way to debunk globe earth. We do not live on a spinning ball. Keep an open mind and do some research of your own. It hurts to admit you&#39;ve been lied to your entire life, but might as well get it over with now than keep maintaining the lie. </p>

<p>Cannons firing at ships had to aim slightly off target to account for the coriolis effect.</p>

<p>Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his assistant Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east.[6] In 1674 fr:Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how the rotation of the earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet&#39;s poles.</p>

<p>What I can say is that whenever I am at a point of high elevation and look out at the horizon. It is always impossible for me to discern any curvature.</p>

<p>We can calculate the alleged curvature of the Earth. Standing on top of the Empire State building the horizon in front of you encompasses hundres of miles. Well using the formula to calculate the curvature of the Earth you will find that these vast expanses should display a visible curve, however they do not. </p>

<p>My tertiary knowledge so far points to a flath Earth. The idea that we are spinning at 1,000 mph while our solar system hurls through the universe at tens of thousands mph all the while the constellations remaining unchanged for thousands of years and all of this motion completely undetectable by humans is not confirmed by tertiary knowledge, but instead shite NASA fuckery. </p>

<p>Conclusion from the paper:</p>

<p>In view of the agreement between the visual observations, measurements of the photographs, and the theoretical curvatures, it seems well established that the curvature of the Earth is reasonably well understood and can be measured from photographs. The threshold elevation for detecting curvature would seem to be somewhat less than 35,000 ft (10.6 km) but not as low as 14,000 ft (4.2 km). Photographically, curvature may be measurable as low as 20,000 ft (6 km).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The atmosphere which the balloon rides on is spinning right along with the Earth below. From the perspective of the balloon, there is no relative motion to the atmosphere, so you can&#39;t see the spin. You need to climb above the atmosphere for that, which a balloon cannot do. To an outside observer, sure, the balloon is moving at a thousand miles an hour even when its sitting &#39;still&#39; on the ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my point is that the perception of motion is relative to the observer. in your example, from space (in our solar system), the motorist would appear to be going at 1065 mph. A ground observer only sees you going 65 because his frame of reference is spinning at 1000. Your passenger sees you sitting still, because his reference is the earth + the car&#39;s motion which is the same as yours, 1065mph. You feel like you&#39;re not moving at all, your speed is constant relative to your frame of reference (the car carrying you).</p>

<p>This is a good example of why I think you&#39;re being disingenuous. If we assume the Earth is flat and unmoving, why say &quot;what about driving on the free way at 65 mph while spinning at 1,000 mph?&quot;</p>

<p>What about it? my example illustrates you won&#39;t feel the movement if there&#39;s no acceleration relative to your frame of reference. That would hold true regardless of the Earth&#39;s shape. </p>

<p>Science looks to eliminate &#39;faith&#39; by encouraging attacks to the accepted dogma. Both Tesla and Einstein would want you to find fault in their arguments instead of taking anything on &#39;faith&#39;. If you find them to be in error, you too can be a part of science by publishing your findings and opening yourself to attacks from your peers in the scientific community. By doing so science can advance, no &#39;faith&#39; needed.<br/>
Of course, if your ideas do not stand up to scrutiny, you should acknowledge that too. </p>

<p>For this example, you wake up on a train with no windows. This example train is impossibly smooth and glides along the tracks without bumping and jostling. 
Logically you know you&#39;re on a speeding train, but you&#39;d be unable to feel any motion. Without windows to see the passing terrain, you might not realize you&#39;re moving at all. </p>

<p>I think this train is like the Earth. You&#39;ve been moving since you were born here, so you couldn&#39;t feel it accelerate. Standing on the ground, you might think you&#39;re not moving at all. </p>

<p>This would work the same way if the Earth were truly stationary, so I&#39;m not saying this proves that the Earth is moving or round. I&#39;m saying that not feeling the motion doesn&#39;t prove its not moving. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll look into the crepuscular rays and get back to you if you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense taken. btw I&#39;m anti-globe but not 100% flat-earther. Please keep an open mind in reading this -- how do you think people become &#39;flat earthers&#39;? Maybe they&#39;re just so feeble minded that they believe any video they find on youtube? Maybe that explains some people, but I assure you there are many intelligent, scientific, professional and rational people in the FE community.</p>

<p>Believing some form of the flat earth happens <em>after</em> someone researches and analyzes the evidence of the globe earth. Once they realize the scientific evidence of the globe earth is so weak and flimsy that it doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, where is there to turn? Flat earth is the only reasonable alternative once the globe is debunked. But we don&#39;t have all the facts, all the evidence, all the science, or all the mapping needed to present a complete conclusion. This is what makes it easy to ridicule this fringe group that looks like a bunch of whackos following a psyop. IMHO, there needs to be much more focus presenting the evidence disproving the globe earth rather than flat-earthers proclaiming &#39;the earth is flat&#39;.</p>

<p>Why flat earth is not a psyop: disproving the globe earth means rejecting establishment science, NASA, and a load of crap lies and indoctrination that has been crammed down our throat since grade school. It&#39;s the ultimate deception. There simply is no reasonable motive for tptb pushing this as a psyop other than &#39;it discredits the conspiracy community&#39;. Any reasonable, intelligent person should be able to analyze the facts and conclude that we&#39;ve been lied to about the globe. It&#39;s just a very tough pill to swallow, so instead it&#39;s far easier to ridicule flat earthers as crazy.</p>

Look at the elevation of this continent and you&#39;ll find average elevation is is 9000 ft above sea level.the coriellas effect is a myth, water does not spin the opposite direction . Cosmology has shown as a recent that the same math the shows the earth spinning through the universe allows can be used to show we are at the center. The earth does not move.gyroscopes prove that he this , run one for 24 hrs it will not move with the earth as it should. If the earth h moved at a 1000mph and your plane goes mad 600mph all flights would be on direction. Going east to west or west to east should not take the same time minus the jet stream adding some speed, and those trips are the same. If the earth was round You would not be able to see flat land that stretches out 170miles on a clear day. In a plane at 600mph you have to constantly point the nose down to adjust for the curvature or the earth end up in space. Planes fly straight and level unless landing or on take off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Higher objects must trace larger circles to maintain their position over the ground.  Air clearly isn&#39;t rigid, so it has no force to maintain its position.  So, high altitudes should have massive winds against the spin of the globe.</p>

<p>But, how big a difference should there be?  Let’s calculate it!  We’ll start at the equator, with a speed of about 1000 MPH, and a radius of about 4000 miles (a circumference of 24901 miles).  As we ascend, we’ll have to add more and more to the radius, but the air still keeps the 1000 MPH (it was touching the earth to get the initial speed, but there’s nothing else to speed it up).  So we’ll go up 10 miles.  How much farther does the air have to go?</p>

<p>A cool thing about circles, for every 1 you add to the radius you can add 2 pi to the circumference.  If we add 10 miles to the radius, we just have to add 31.4 miles to the circumference.  That means the air travels 31.4 miles LESS each day than the air at the surface.  A day is 24 hours, so that means the air 10 miles up FEELS like it’s moving backward at 1.3 miles per hour.  A 1.3 mile per hour wind is almost nothing; it’s WAY less than wind caused by normal weather systems and the sun’s heating and cooling.</p>

<p>The air does move in the upper atmosphere, but it’s just too slow to really care about!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing keeps 1000 mph on its own. If the air did move with the planet as you go up it would have to be going faster to stay locked relative to a point on the earth , the air at the ground slower. This is basic. . The air does not move with the planet. You can see how the currents flow. Go watch the weather channel .  In fact the currents move counter to the supposed rotation, often. A balloon or helicopter can hover and the earth doesn&#39;t move underneath. This is not because the air is moving and therefore the balloon is moving with it. A balloon,helicopter,plane etc move independently of the earth once they floating above it, because they are floating above it and not touching it. All one do is release a balloon and you realize it&#39;s density is less than the surrounding air that is compressed at 14psi at sea level. When the psi drops the balloon rises till it pops because of little pressure outside the balloon holding it back from expanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed what I was saying.  I agree, the air DOESN&#39;T speed up as it goes higher, how could it.  It DOESN&#39;T stay fixed over the earth.  As you go higher, the air appears to start moving backward relative to the ground!</p>

<p>However, my post was saying this effect is tiny.  I calculated how much slower it should appear to move, and the amount is very small.  Much smaller than, say, the wind caused by a high pressure system moving toward a low pressure system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your calculations are wrong though . Consider how fast the air would have to move at 90,000 versus  the speed at 1ft of the ground. If at 90,000 feet the atmosphere is slower, it would still have to be doing more than 10,000 mph to cover the greater rotational distant than the air at ground level. Bigger track. Dog in this extreme would have to go ten times faster because his circle is ten times bigger around.. I find it self evident that the air does not move at the same speed as the earth below it. It moves independently. To defy this magic gravity you&#39;ve so leveraged to account for the speed of the air, can be defied by hearing said air . Showing you it&#39;s not connected to the earth or spinning with it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where the hell are you getting these numbers?  All your calculations are totally wrong.  At 90,000 feet, the air has to move 107 miles more per day.  That means it&#39;d appear to be moving about 4.5 MPH slower (107 divided by 24 hours).  Yes, you have to travel further, but I don&#39;t think you understand any of the numbers actually involved.</p>

<p>And this is all assuming we&#39;re around the equator, with the greatest speeds!  This becomes even less noticeable as you go further away from the equator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back up. The air doesn&#39;t spin with the earth at all. The earth doesn&#39;t spin. If it did, and the atmosphere moves with the earth, spinning 1000mph, the air higher would have to move faster to stay in line with the air at the ground. Bigger circle greater distance would require air to move faster at higher altitutudes. It&#39;s not hard to understand. 107 miles ? If the earth grow to 90,000 everywhere you&#39;d have more than 107 additional miles to travel to go around the equator . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the air higher up DOESN&#39;T stay with the earth on the ground.  It moves at something roughtly the same speed, but since it has to move farther in a day, it does appear to move backward. It&#39;s just the amount it&#39;s moving backward is WAY smaller than you&#39;re quoting elsewhere.  Slow enough that you can barely measure it.  4.5 miles per hour at 90,000 feet kinda slow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the atmosphere moves in sync with the earth, we have two possibilities. The first , the upper layers of atmosphere would have to move increasingly faster than the lower layers to stay in sync.  Second, there is a spiraling effect where the upper atmosphere layers go slower and slower. I don&#39;t see either. Air is not moved with friction. It&#39;s viscous in nature. If air molecoles moved as they must for your theory,using friction, a fan would move air all the way down your street. Except it doesn&#39;t. The wind generated runs into other air and is slowed considerably.  The atmosphere has mass of 5.136 × 10(18 ) kg . 18 is the exponent not sure how to do that on a phone. Moving this much mass by friction alone would generate a lot of heat and would require major energy. The truth is that Friction only happens with solid objects, but you do get resistance to motion in both liquids and gases. This doesn&#39;t involve sliding surfaces like friction does, but is instead the kind of resistance you get if you try to push your way through a crowd. It&#39;s a colliding situation, not a sliding one. If the gas is air, this is referred to as air resistance.taken from physics for kids.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s the second option, that&#39;s what happens on earth.  The problem is that this effect is small (I did the math for you), so it&#39;d be incredibly hard to measure.</p>

<p>You keep looking at the atmosphere as if it&#39;s just a small part being moved at a time.  The entire surface of the earth is in contact with the atmosphere.  When two objects are in contact, they apply a force against each other.  The earth is about a million times more massive than the atmosphere, so it makes sense that the atmosphere would be moved far more easily than the earth.  All this heat generated by the friction is then distributed across the entire planet.  And this is then spread out of thousands, and millions of years.  The net energy from any given moment is tiny.  What&#39;s more, the atmosphere wasn&#39;t suddenly there one day, static relative to the earth.  It was gathered slowly, a little bit at a time from gravitational attraction of gasses and comets!</p>

<p>My problem here is that you are misrepresenting the idea you&#39;re arguing against.  You&#39;ve created some bizarre strawman that has no baring with any actual proposal for the earth, and arguing against that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The friction required for your model is dry friction that applies to solid objects sliding against each other. Air is not an object. You feel resistance because your hand is colliding with particles in front of it. This creates drag.  Air investigators involves collision not sliding. The natural behavior of gas is to first, fill the container, gravity does not stop this,nor does the supposed spinning of the earth. Air wants to spread out, not stay stuck to the earth. Air particles bounce off each other trying to spread out too. We have enough atmosphere that the 14 psi loosely holds some the gases down . Air resistance is, loosely speaking , a type of friction we call drag. Drag however, makes the wind roll back into itself the opposite direction slowing it . Drag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluid&#39;s path. Air does not behave like a solid allowing it to be carried along with the earth spinning 1000mph. Any heating of the air shows that it easily defies the gravity and friction you claim move it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you have any understanding of how air or fluids work.  You just defined friction.  You just said air experiences friction. Then you said friction doesn&#39;t apply to air.</p>

<p>You then go on to say heating air defies gravity, when hot air only rises BECAUSE of gravity.  Without gravity, it doesn&#39;t rise.  In reduced graity aircraft, you don&#39;t see hot air rise ruing the wieghtless portion of the flight.  There is no preferred orientation for air without gravity.  It&#39;s exactly because gravity is pulling down on the warm air that it rises!  Buyancy is a really interesting phenomena, and I suggest you look into it more thoroughly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re having trouble with comprehension. There are different types of friction. Dry friction is sliding , air resistance or drag is a series of collisions.  Both are resistance. However, there is an important subtle difference . Hot air rises because it is less dense than cold air. Hot air defies gravity by rising against that force. I don&#39;t want to tak to you anymore. you fail to access t basic shit. Fluid dynamics does not support the retard theory that the atmosphere moves with the earth because of friction. Air causes drag, that is not friction and the results are different. Friction is applied to solid objects . Fluid dynamics explain gases and liquids . I&#39;m done he with you though. I don&#39;t have time for semantics and nonsense </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Full of busted premises. the earth doesn&#39;t move below a hovering helicopter or balloon. It&#39;s impossible for gravity to move the atmosphere with the planet and still have the atmosphere flow independently. The atmosphere at higher altitudes would need to spin faster,where in physics are you accounting for the extra energy required to make the upper atmosphere spin at a much higher speed. The dog on the outside lane of the track has to run faster than the dog on the inside lane . We can track the atmosphere and often it moves counter to the supposed rotation of the earth. </p>

<p>However, my pet theory on the Flat Earth shit is that its a fundamentalist Christian fringe group pushing the narrative. They saw how much &#39;conspiracy&#39; shit was blowing up online, and brought a lot of it under the Flat Earth umbrella. Often these vids use good material, such as obviously fake or doctored NASA footage to get their foot in the door.</p>

<p>Once they got you with swimming pool astronauts, they hit you with alien-demon deception, holograms, Luciferian elites, etc. And then cap it off with Jesus.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my theory, though. Someone else I keep tabs on on Reddit thinks that the videos are created by members of the Flat Earth Society, which he says is a &#39;gag&#39; organization. The gag being that they don&#39;t believe the theory but enjoy the mental excercise needed to counter the bogus assertions.</p>

<p>For me, it doesn&#39;t fucking matter one way or the other, it&#39;s not a big deal if it&#39;s round or flat. We&#39;re being lied to about MANY things, so trusting &quot;government sources&quot; saying either way is stupid.</p>

At the equator, the circumference of the Earth is 40,070 kilometers, and the day is 24 hours long so the speed is 1670 kilometers/hour ( 1037 miles/hr). This decreases by the cosine of your latitude so that at a latitude of 45 degrees, cos(45) = .707 and the speed is .707 x 1670 = 1180 kilometers/hr. You can use this formula to find the speed of rotation at any latitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the math made up?  Do you agree that a circle has 360 degrees?  Do you agree that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees?  Then, with some high school level math, we can prove the earth can&#39;t possibly be flat.</p>

<p>Suppose that it is the equinox.  On the flat earth model, that means the sun is directly over the circle of the equator.  Now, let’s calculate the sun’s altitude.  At 45 degrees latitude, at exactly noon, we measure the angle to the sun.  The lines of latitude, in fact, are named for the angle to the sun on the equinox at noon.  So, we know the angle will be 45 degrees.  If we draw a line from where we are standing, to the equator, then to the sun and back to us, we’ll have made a nice right triangle.  Since one angle is 45 degrees, we know the other is as well.  That means that the distance to the equator from where we are standing MUST be the same as the distance to the sun from the equator.  Incidentally, that’s a little over 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Now, let’s pretend, at the same time, we have another person in Antarctica, making the same measurement.  But they’re going to wait until their local midnight.  This means the sun will be on the opposite side of the equator, its maximum distance.  It’s about 6213 miles from the north pole to the equator, so we can triple that distance to get Antarctica to the opposite side of the equator, 18639 miles.  But, we now have another right triangle!  Let’s just plug in what we know in <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">this</a>   handy calculator and find out the angle to the sun.  Side b will be the 18639 (the observer to the far side of the equator), and side a will be 3000 (the height of the sun).  Angle A will represent the angle to the sun.  This is the LOWEST the sun will ever get for that point, since we waited until local midnight.</p>

<p>I got 9.14 degrees.  To give some context, the width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10 degrees.  That means the sun should be no less than a fist’s width above the horizon at all times for the equinox.  For most every other city in the world, it should be MUCH higher.  High school trigonometry proves the earth can’t be flat; the law of perspective says so!</p>

<p>You then go on to say heating air defies gravity, when hot air only rises BECAUSE of gravity.  Without gravity, it doesn&#39;t rise.  In reduced graity aircraft, you don&#39;t see hot air rise ruing the wieghtless portion of the flight.  There is no preferred orientation for air without gravity.  It&#39;s exactly because gravity is pulling down on the warm air that it rises!  Buyancy is a really interesting phenomena, and I suggest you look into it more thoroughly.</p>
