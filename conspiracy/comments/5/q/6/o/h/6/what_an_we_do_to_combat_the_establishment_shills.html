       I'm so upset that this once last bastion of freedom is starting to look like r/redacted. What can we do fight back? I find it so depressing that free speech doesn't exist in r/conspiracy any longer and my comments are getting removed. I feel forced to only visit r/the_donald because it's literally the only place on Reddit that doesn't allow CTR shills and it's the only sub to find relief from them.

       Believe it or not, but being informed of the issue you are debating and having sources ahead of time to back up your claim is like kryptonite to shills.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You have to be prepared to read their source
       </li>
       <li>
        You have to be prepared to find counter sources (Being informed of the topic being debated helps here)
       </li>
       <li>
        Being civil and logical works wonders and do not stoop to attacking their personal attacks.
       </li>
       <li>
        In the case of someone blatantly refusing to read your sources and provide a counter argument disengage debate.

       Okay, fair enough. I will work hard to employ all these strategies. Thank you so much for taking the time to lay them out there for me. It's been hard to not feel absolutely frustrated and angry, especially after their takeover of the politics sub and all of Reddit. When that happened I hunkered down in r/conspiracy but now they're taking over my favorite sub too and it gets discouraging. But I will fight the fine fight w/reason, sources and civility for the lurkers and keep in mind to forget about the shills. Thanks again!! Much appreciated!

       They can't handle being in a friendly debate and literally will attack you without provocation. Unless it is a sensitive emotionally charge topic it is one of the most telling give-aways to less than honorable intentions. But never rule out the emotional card. I still am guilty of it sometimes myself :).

       Yeah, you're so correct. I can't count the number of times I got called a cunt for defending trump as a outspoken Jill supporter-lol! It does devolve rather quickly. Real Hillary/establishment supporters will just block or unfriend you (well, the one and only Hillary supporter I know in real life just unfriended me for supporting POTUS). Thanks for the reminder. And, yes, I'm guilty of getting emotional and frustrated and calling them out to be a shill...but of course that word is not allowed...I wonder why? :)

       What happened to our allies in the mods? The mods never allowed this level of shill-like activity before. I feel like we're losing our stronghold against the shill onslaught. I'm not a tech person and don't know how to code, but will happily join any free speech platform! If you build it, they will come...just need to find that builder.

       Take a look at the modlog some time, you clearly have no idea how much is going on in the background and just how many trolls, shills and generally anti-conspiracy activists are being dealt with here on a daily basis.

       Trump is the establishment? Hahahahahahaha 
Does MSM know this?!?! I guess they can stop attacking him now and start giving him favorable coverage and polling numbers and lots of praise, the debate questions ahead of time for 2020 debate, like they do for all the puppets that they love like the Clintons, Bushes, McCain, Obama, the glorious CIA, etc.

       Here is a tip. If someone tries REALLY hard to make you think they're on your side, that they're not part of the establishment even while most of the evidence shows otherwise, they're probably full of shit.

       Trump and Obama both came in with similar messages and celebrity cult of personality, hope and change, hope and change.

       Enjoy Obama v. 2.0.

       Trump is already fulfilling most of his campaign promises (I think all but one now in less than 5 days!) despite the gnashing of the teeth by the real establishment (swamp) and media.  And I'm already enjoying Trump every single day. I couldn't be happier I decided at the last minute to vote for him, because with each passing day, I am more and more impressed and feel more optimistic day after day in the people's America. On top of him actually working hard, getting shit down under budget and ahead of schedule, he still finds time to troll the media. I have gone to bed and wake up with a smile on my face every day since his inauguration. All I wanted for election/inauguration day was not Hillary but I got so much more!!

       I can't think of a single campaign promise that Trump has fulfilled. I don't believe that is even physically possible in only a few days anyway. You sound like a typical pro-government cheerleader TBH.

       I'd rather not have a in-depth discussion about politics with someone who chooses to remain so uninformed that they haven't even heard of the TPP, so this is all I'll be saying about the matter:
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it amazing that you'd even say something so dumb as 1). Trump is a do-nothing Obama 2.0 who hasn't fulfilled one of his campaign promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, he's already fulfilled several of them and you, although grossly uninformed, choose to say w/confidence that he hasn't even fulfilled one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I reply and name one, but you haven't heard of it. Then despite not hearing of the TPP, you seem to know w/certainty that Hillary or Bernie would have put an end to the TPP when we on r/conspiracy had so many threads about how Hillary was all for the TPP and that she would pass it if Obama couldn't get it through. Proof was in the Podesta emails released by wikileaks in plain English, no debate about it. So sorry, but you're uninformed and wrong again on that count too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, if you were paying attention, you would have known there was no chance Bernie could win with that lying criminal and nomination stealing Hillary and the DNC. Yes, Bernie was opposed to the TPP but he signed a nonaggression pact w/HRC, so even Bernie knew there was no chance of winning the nomination and ending the TPP. Source: wikileaks -there's tons of threads here about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only person who could have ended the TPP did, and we all have Donald Trump to thank for that.

       Spread the truth and shine your light.  Free thinkers will find you.  We don't have to acknowledge our politicians nor do we have to acknowledge our government.  If our pursuit of greater truths is thwarted by some bot on a sub, we were never looking hard enough for truth in the first place.  So downvote them and move on brother, when you carry around your big ass light with you everywhere you don't need to argue with the darkness, they just go the fuck away.  Move past politics, look to yourself for answers, trust your gut and love your neighbor.  It all starts with you.  We got got your back

       I have eyes and can read and have past experience to remember and draw upon. Top comments from non regulars that love Hillary and the CIA and MSM?!?! And not just that, but hundreds of upvotes. We have excellent high-content posters here who never got hundreds of upvotes for their comments. In fact, regulars are getting down voted like crazy. I know who the regulars are and that is not normal. This sub has been overrun with shills, maybe it's already been taken over. I have never seen such high activity and popularity of comments that are antithetical to r/conspiracy.

       But, I will say I haven't had my comments removed or anything like you are describing. I also keep cheerleading to t_d where it belongs, I like to come here to have rational conversations with people that might not agree with me. Shoot, I am not that huge of a fan of Trumps, it was just fun to be a fan. And we can still have decent conversations here, sometimes. It is getting more rare though, it is completely infested with people that are obviously not really part of the community, or the unfortunates that drank too much of one koolaid or the other, and aren't much use to anyone.

       You'll notice this post isn't about me proving that there are shills and bots but asking how to combat the shills that everyone with a brain knows exist. Everyone with a pair of eyes saw what happened in the main politics sub, then all of Reddit. We're not stupid. Or have you not heard of the record correcting shills that I probably can't say their name w/o a ban or removal...you know, the ones from Hillary's super PAC or do you not believe those shills existed either?

       Excuse me, but what can't I prove? Where did I call someone a shill in this thread or others? Why are you bringing up another thread that has nothing to do with this one?? I replied to you in the other thread already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think shills exist like Hillary's super PAC one that got like $6 or 7 million to shill on Reddit? I can easily provide proof for that.

      <p>
       Have you not read the OP because you're not making any sense at all. I'll write it out slower for you: this thread isn't about me losing an argument and calling someone a shill-in fact, you'll find that no where that that happened because those comments get removed and you get banned for doing that. Again, slower: this thread is solely about combating the shill army, not proving that they exist. It's obvious they exist. But feel free to lie and gaslight just like the record ctr did as they too denied the presence of shills until we had hard proof. By that time, mods and admins were corrupted-all dissent got removed/banned and you couldn't even utter the name CTR nor mention shills.

       You don't direct it at a specific person, you just said the thread was full of them so you don't get banned for shill accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know shills exist, it's pretty established ctr was a thing. The problem is people on this sub always complain about shills when it's just people who don't agree with them. Why the fuck would you even pay shills to come to this sub? If they did it'd look like politics did, which it pretty clearly doesn't resemble at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what this thread is about, I'm saying you're calling people shills when they're just regular people. I know it's not about proving their presence because you can't prove it. Know why? Because you aren't arguing with shills.

       Well, it's my OP not yours. How many times have you responded to my thread? At least half a dozen now. Seems to me you're really pushing your narrative really hard-perhaps it would be less obvious if you started your OWN thread? And when have I called you a shill? I was wondering why you're so passionate about my topic of shills. Not exactly the most sexy topic but I sure got your attention!!

       Hey, do you remember what my op was about? Maybe you forgot the topic. Again, I didn't make the post to prove anything to anyone about the presence or non presence of shills in this sub. This was a post asking for tips in dealing with shills, which is something that has been a REAL and PROVEN thing that has happening on reddit for the last year or two by Hillary's super PAC CTR. I was asking for tips in how to combat the presence of shills and you came here to --what? -- harass me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you think I think everyone that disagrees with me is a shill. Where have I said that or accused everyone who disagrees with me a shill? Where??? But I don't want to waste any more of my time talking to you, so yes, every bot, shill and human on the internet and real life who disagrees with me is a shill; that includes my Hillary supporting friends and even my husband who often disagrees with me, they'll all shills. You're so right. There. You happy? Can we agree to disagree already? I'd like to get back to the actual topic of my post now, if you don't mind.

       I came here to tell you that the people you call shills are just regular people, why is this so hard for you to grasp? Mad I'm not circlejerking about the shills with the rest of you and actually calling you out on your bullshit?
      </p>

       You've implied I'm a shill and then in a thread where you couldn't accept being wrong you had to act like it was shills. Again, not shills, just regular people.

       Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for calling me out on my bullshit. You obviously know me so well with my comments on two threads, so, again, thank you so much for caring about me so deeply that you'd take so much time out of your day and ten replies later just to make sure I really 'get' what an asshole I am. I may not speak for everybody here, but I think that you're providing such an amazing service for your peers on this sub if this is how you help everyone out. I'm so grateful you took so much time out of your day to correct me and set me straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I know you've already provided me with so much insight and not to sound ungrateful, but I'm wondering: do you have any advice or tips for me about the subject of my OP? I'd be so grateful. I'm sure you'll respond, so thanks in advance! :D

       Honestly it's a waste of both our time to keep going on the first part of this argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advice: beat them in the argument, calling them in a shill is like me discrediting you for being a Trump supporter, it just makes our argument look weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't engage in distractions, especially ad-hominems. I've been guilty of this in pizzagate threads, but when I stopped I found I actually agreed with the person on quite a few things and we were able to better debate the actual topics we felt differently on, sometimes ya gotta agree to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the argument reaches a stalemate there's no reason to keep repeating yourself, if they are a shill they want you to waste your time, just say you disagree, summarize with what and why, and leave it there if no new discussion is spawned.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I can think of off the top of my head.

       Lol you can't see the difference between accusing people of being a shill and someone copying your username after their old account was banned. It's pretty obvious due to how you write and the sources you post from, you're not fooling anybody. Like I said, it's just sad this is what you do for fun.

       More than likely it is bots made to upvote certain topics. You only need 1 person to post talking points and have the botnet do the upvoting for ya. Way easier than having a team of "shills" if you think about it :).

       Yes I might be wrong here but I don't think mods have access to site ip addresses and logs to even check for suspected bot behavior and the likes.. Might be wrong here.

       You gotta see it from their side too. If they accidentally ban a couple folks who were just plain illogical 12 year old trolls. It would hurt the sub more than them spewing their bullshit. Promoting a culture of logical debating is the only true way to do it. It is just slow because not everyone feels like putting 30 minutes to 2 hours into a smart post :(.

       To the poster accusing me of wanting an echo chamber and then deleting your comment:
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I want an echo chamber, you got me. You do realize all of Reddit, except for r/the_donald is one giant echo chamber of anti-trump bs? You can get it anti-trump bs and lies with Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, every single MSM and comment section, PredictIt comment section, NPR and all other mainstream radio, every mainstream magazine on whatever topic, doesn't matter, there will be anti-trump bs. Then I step outside the internet to wonderful liberal Los Angeles where there is a real life constant onslaught of anti-trump bs. Btw, all my friends are anti-trump, so I get it there too. So, yeah, I think I'm getting multiple daily doses of anti-trump garbage. But I suppose you're unhappy that I visit the r/the_donald and "live" in an echo chamber, huh? I guess you won't be satisfied until I get nothing but 100% anti-trump all the time? Well, no thanks. I don't like to live in the alternative fictitious reality of the MSM, which is all lies all of the time. Fuck me for being a free thinker and wanting TRUTH.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I don't expect not want r/conspiracy to be r/the_donald or pro trump. That's why I come here: to get a neutral source, to search out the truth. The regulars of r/conspiracy realize that left v right is all political theatre. We are not partisan here but truth seekers and that's why I used to love this place.
      </p>
      <p>
       There tons of shills here. Anyone saying otherwise makes me think they're probably a shill too. It's so obvious and something that upsets me greatly is feeling like my intelligence is constantly being insulted. Yeah, like I really believe that this sub overnight has become a Hillary loving, media loving, vaccine/gmo loving, "experts say" bullshit, and frankly, anti conspiracy. Yep, Soros' shills have really fooled me.

       They're not shills, you just want this to be another echo chamber for Trump. Believe it or not most people don't like him, so when you leave your echo chamber you will see a lot of people criticizing him.

       You think people must be shills because they disagree with you. T_D doesn't just ban shills, it bans any criticism of trump, which is what you want. Can you even post examples of ctr shilling that doesn't have a Trump supporter equivalent?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what don't you believe? Maybe leave your fucking echo chambers for once and you'd see most people don't like him, you got fooled, guess those alternative facts work on you.

       T_D is a cheerleading sub for trump. They don't claim to be a neutral sub like the joke that the main politics sub is. So just like you can't talk shit about Bernie or Hillary in their respective cheerleading subs, you can't do it in t_d either.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, you're right, I should leave my echo chamber because all of Reddit except for r/the_donald is PRO trump -- and Facebook, Twitter, every single MSM and comment section, PredictIt comment section, NPR and all other mainstream radio, every mainstream magazine is PRO Trump. Then I step outside the internet to real life in wonderful liberal Los Angeles where there is a real life constant PRO TRUMP agenda. Btw, all my liberal Hillary voting friends are Pro trump, so I get so much pro trump stuff there too. Yeah, every where I turn, I'm faced with so much PRO TRUMP stuff, it's unbelievable and I really need to step outside that echo chamber. You're so right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as my comment history on the inauguration photo, I stand by the fact that there are shills all over that thread. How did I form that conclusion? Probably the implicit trust and deference to MSM in people's comments, citing them as proof! as if r/conspiracy regulars have ever trusted the media!! Try again!

       And what are you even trying to say here? Yes, leave your echo chamber and see the world is overwhelmingly anti-trump you'll see its not that weird for reddit to be anti-trump as well.

       So because people don't think everything the msm says is a lie they are shills? Honestly that's retarded.

       Your last point is a straw man argument, so I'm not gonna bother with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct about one thing: the world (those a part of the global MSM and all the world's government, aka the establishment, is anti-trump.) And to me, that's his best feature! But it's funny you're trying to get me to believe that regular Americans are anti-trump when he is the one America choose, mostly the silent MAJORITY. They are silent because they don't want to lose their friends, family, job, social standing, or be physically harmed or their property damaged. Have you seen the destruction, violence and hysterics from the Hillary-living left? I don't ever hear from Trump supporters for this reason; therefore, it'd be pretty difficult for me to even try to live in an echo chamber. Try again.

       Only the last half, the point about it being retarded to assume everything the msm says is a lie is still true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people didn't vote for trump, you know that right? The majority did not vote for trump, the majority of voters did not vote for trump either. America is largely anti-trump no matter how far you stick your fingers into your ears and scream, and even people who did support trump can still point out when he's doing stupid shit like what he's doing with the EPA, or his many lies, or whatever else they don't like.

       Visit the New and Rising tabs. Upvote good content so that it doesn't get buried by shills, and downvote the shill garbage before it gains any traction. These early upvotes and downvotes make a huge difference in whether content makes it on to the front page.

       Yeah, you're right about this being a tough crowd to deceive. I never mind dissenting opinions because free speech is extremely important, which is why paid shills are so frustrating. It's censorship and it wastes so much time and we are never able to talk about the real important issues but stay instead debating the stupid shit that MSM and whoever sets the shills' narrative want us to talk about.  TPTB through its tentacles of Msm and shills set the narrative always. How can we get around this when we're talking about politics which is a running topic through most conspiracies? How do we not fall into the traps of shills wasting our time through asking stupid questions or feigning ignorance on subjects and wasting our time pointlessly debating trivial bs? -This would have been a better question instead of my OP.
