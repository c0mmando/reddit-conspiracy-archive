       Recently i noticed a number of comments and posts in r/conspiracy that are out of the norm. I also noticed an increased number of posts in r/politics calling this sub biased, censored and fake that aim to undermine our credibility. This makes me assume that we're now on their radar so i want to warn everyone to take a defensive stand and question everyone's legitimacy here. We should not get comfortable and let down our differences, we're better than that. Calling for everyone to defend our sub and credibility.

       <em>
        Edit:
       </em>
       When you see a stupid obvious fake news post that aims to make us look that we're a child sub of r/politics and r/The_Donald don't skip it. Call it out and down-vote it. We need to clean up and raise our standards again. We all know what those posts are.

       Who is attacking this sub? I am relatively new at posting here, and I enjoy many of the comments by the posters who have done extensive research and those who have probing minds. I think the dummies pretty much stand out like a sore thumb on this sub.

       Well, I'm one of the r/politics "shills" who's lurked on r/conspiracy forever and have started engaging the last few days.  From our side, we're seeing all this obvious r/conspiracy fodder -- Like the dossier saying a 19% stake in Rosneft would be offered to Trump, and then later that sale actually occurred to mystery buyers that folks haven't been able to trace, with word leaking that the administration has been prepping an EO rescinding Russia sanctions without conditions, and the fact that within days of Trump taking over Russian agents who reportedly were working for the U.S. end up dead or arrested -- there's so much shit like this happening, it's frustrating to see people putting their tinfoil to work against someone completely irrelevant like John fucking Podesta and not the federal government.

       No one cares what r/politics thinks. If you've been there too much, you probably need to put your head in a freezer awhile, as your brain may be going bad. Don't get caught up in the worry train. It is meant to trap the weak into fear and paranoia. Take a step back, get some fresh air, and turn off the tunnel vision.

       People from r/politics are coming over here because there is just avalanches of shady fucking shit about the Trump administration, and so they think, "Huh, I bet r/conspiracy is having a field day with this shit.  I bet they're going nuts about those guys arrested/murdered in Russia."  And to come over here and see r/conspiracy doing double-time to deflect anything negative about Trump -- it's insane.  Isn't it your people's jobs to be skeptical of the establishment, and yet here you are sucking the federal government's dick and still going wild about a bunch of Democratic assholes who aren't in power and don't even matter anymore.

       If r/politics are discussing it, that means it's an msm talking point. Most of us don't believe that narrative.  You shouldn't take offense if your posts are downvoted and start pointing your fingers.

       But shouldn't you judge the case on the merits, not just on who else is talking about it? If you make a fast rule like "I always believe the opposite of these people," it closes your mind and makes you easy to manipulate.

       Well I don't know about you but I don't agree people here are defending Trump. I admit that I voted Trump but if you bring me something that is legit and valid I would accept it, i'm not here to defend Trump, I'm here to look on everything that comes in the same way. But when you bring "fake news" and people debunk them it doesn't mean they defend Trump, its fake news. As the majority of fake news aim Trump though it just makes it seem that they defend him.

       Oh another brainwashed sub! Been there, banned from there too as well as from r/politics. For some reason those subs can't handle truth and critical thinking. I mean i voted too, and i defend my opinion but i also accept criticism and i'm ready to acknowledge wrongdoings but those 2 are technically brainwashing camps.

       Why get involved with this paranoid unreality, OP? This war you want to believe is happening? This sub doesn't matter, that sub doesn't matter, Reddit doesn't matter. One's real life does. The one's you love IRL. Real relationships. All this here is unreal and for fun.

       Download RES, tag the constant political posters, notice which subs they mod and xpost, You'll quickly see who the paid posters are, their alts and their political agendas.  There are a core of posters who took over this sub and are actively destroying/destroyed it.

        Probably because the organic default to most people is to avoid pedophiles, muslims and Singer's call to cull blacks with abortions.

       Conspiracy theorists inherently have little to no credibility to begin with. When you arrive at a conclusion, then try to fill the vacuum of almost zero substance, with nonsensical rubbish..you'll not receive much legit support outside of your own expanding bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub and forums like it all have the same fatal flaws and they are easily capitalized on by detractors. In short, the way theories are formulated, substantiated, and later issued to others all rest upon "what if". That's not even a remotely effective way to go about things and does little to gain real traction.

       A conspiracy theorist is their own worst enemy.
