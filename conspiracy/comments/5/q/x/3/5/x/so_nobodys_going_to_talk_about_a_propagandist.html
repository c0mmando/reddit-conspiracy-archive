    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also a chance that Trump is at least a skeptic, and at most, a conspiracy theorist himself.   He treats everything outside his circle of trust with a healthy degree of doubt.   He talks about the military with honor, but I&#39;d guess he&#39;s very aware of the military-industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that&#39;s great, thanks for that! I don&#39;t think he was implying Israel though, probably thinking about Qatar. But one can only hope. Everything for the time being points to him being a Likudnik Zionist. Let&#39;s hope I&#39;m wrong, and let&#39;s wait and see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, if we&#39;re Qatar he would&#39;ve just said so. Like he did with Saudi Arabia 😉. He COULDNT say &quot;Israel&quot; they even tried to force it out of him &quot;Look, I don&#39;t have to say it. You know who, even home does but, no one can say anything about it.&quot; </p>

<p>I think moving the embassy to Jerusalem isn&#39;t for Israel&#39;s benefit. I think it&#39;s to keep an eye on them AND for safety. They would blow up  ANYWHERE other than, Jerusalem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all in his book lmao. He allows them to underestimate him. It&#39;s part of the art of the deal. As for the Goldman Sachs appointments, I&#39;m not too worried. They&#39;ve had A LOT of brilliant people work for them and they&#39;ve had hundreds of people leave, once the see what is really going on. I.e. Steve Bannon. If GS was behind him, they wouldn&#39;t have banned all employees from donating to the campaign. They looked for a loophole so they could make it a fireable offense. Donating to Hillary was a-okay but, if you donate to Trump? Pack your shit and get out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, notice how the fake news anchors try forcing him to say &quot;Israel&quot; but, he knows better. He couldn&#39;t get the republican votes if he was critical of Israel. Those Christians are too brainwashed. He knows that. </p>

<p>TBH, I think it&#39;s the same way with Alex Jones. I see him being called a &quot;Zionist puppet&quot; in the comments of every video. While he&#39;s not my cup of tea, I think it&#39;s because he&#39;s on hundreds of Christian FM stations. Gotta kiss Israel&#39;s ass if your audience is brainwashed Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its sad but a majority of people believe in Breitbart as a credible news source. They havnt considered the fact that its alt right has been co-opted by zionists. Take this article for example
<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/11/17/breitbart-news-network-born-in-the-usa-conceived-in-israel/">Breitbart News Network: Born In The USA, Conceived In Israel</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel. We were sick of the anti- Israel bias of the mainstream media and J-Street. By launching Breitbart Jerusalem, the journey comes full circle and a promise between two friends is fulfilled. And in a very real sense, Breitbart News Network returns to its roots.
Especially funny, that when the anti-defamation league called him a anti-semite. He had his cast of disgusting writers like Howard Johnson and Pam Gellar, along with lolitta express passanger and child rapist <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/steve-bannon-made-breitbart-space-pro-israel-writers-anti-semitic-readers/">Alan Dershowitz</a>to speak up for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it’s quite illuminating that whereas just 2 months ago this sub treated any authority or President as inherently corrupt, they now laud not only The Racist in Chief Donald Dickbag Trump, but also suck the dick of his unelected handler Bannon as if they are Gods Gift. </p>

<p>It’s demonstrates that most the of the ppl here were not anti-authoritarian conspiracy theorists they were just far-right racists who hated having a black man as their president. Now they have a fat old white guy to tell them what to do they seem to think that’s ok. </p>

<p>It’s really revealed to me who the user base of this sub are, they’re the fucking pepe badge wearing Richard Spencers of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t doubt there are plenty of conspiracies around Trump in which he is knowingly and unknowingly involved I think this, like the first week of his presidency is more accurately described by the old saying: &quot;Never ascribe to malice what can be explained by stupidity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, if we&#39;re Qatar he would&#39;ve just said so. Like he did with Saudi Arabia 😉. He COULDNT say &quot;Israel&quot; they even tried to force it out of him &quot;Look, I don&#39;t have to say it. You know who, even home does but, no one can say anything about it.&quot; </p>

<p>I think moving the embassy to Jerusalem isn&#39;t for Israel&#39;s benefit. I think it&#39;s to keep an eye on them AND for safety. They would blow up  ANYWHERE other than, Jerusalem. </p>
