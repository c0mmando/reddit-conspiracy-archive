I&#39;m driving and there was a really bright &quot;star&quot; on the sky, it was really bright and I thought it was weird, so i got my phone thinking to take a pic so i can zoom in to see what it is. Once I took the pic it fucking disappeared. I will post the picture once i get home, I can&#39;t really tell what it is but I&#39;ll download the pic on my computer and study it. Right now it seems like a really bright ‚≠êÔ∏è on my phone but i bet i can zoom it in and clean the noise. I&#39;m so happy right now i want to pee myself üòÅüòÅ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, our technology cannot pick up on them for some reason. It can read the light but the rest seems to be unrecognizable. Almost as if they have a sort of cloaking device that not even electronic technology can capture. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when you see a light bug in the dark, when it&#39;s on, you see it but once it cuts the light off, it&#39;s gone. But then it lights up again and you see it again. They only show us what they want us to see, any proof is usually distorted to the point of making you look crazy.</p>

<p>Here is a comp of UFO sightings, so you don&#39;t think you are crazy or anything.</p>

According to the Bible, they are the chariots of God. The reason why the Ancient Hebrews were able to navigate through the wilderness, how they knew when to stop and go. How Elijah was able to call down fire on the kings armies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yay! How exciting for you. It&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to see much. They need to get closer to get a pic that reveals who/what it is. </p>

<p>A friend spent months looking and watching. After a while, it went from one in the distance (like yours, it looked like a really bright star until it started zipping around) to a few that came closer until there were twenty or so maybe 100ft away. </p>

<p>They were all different colours/sizes and looked like orbs. We&#39;re in different states, so he&#39;d send pics/video in real time and I&#39;d enlarge and send back during pauses in the action. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure which of us was more surprised the first time faces appeared in them; there was one face per orb and each was different. </p>

<p>Keep looking and you&#39;ll see more. Spend some time doing it at the same time every night, weather permitting, and see what happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats interesting for sure. I always wondered about spotting more. I like the idea of a set schedule. I go camping a few miles from one of the most verifiable accounts called the allagash incident. I mean there is nothing up there. No cell service, no electricity. Nothing. </p>

<p>Our family knows about a nice fishing spot off a dam, on Harrington Lake, my uncle, whom regrettably is an alcoholic, claims to have seen shit. I think he was abducted. Story goes he went to do some night fishing, what time idk, but returned at dawn extremely disheveled. The crutch to the story is, he left his fishing gear and beer on the dam. Ran back, mumbled  to cousinss and his brother, about fucking aliens and got in his truck and left the camp at 5 am. A 3.5 hour drive home.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That must&#39;ve rattled your uncle something fierce for him to bug out like that and not look back. </p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely something to a consistent schedule when looking for these. </p>

<p>After a few night, it got to the point where they&#39;d give my friend a nudge mentally and he&#39;d look out a window to see 1-2 of them letting him know it was almost time. It was after he responded to their nudges a few times that their numbers increased significantly and they began to come in much closer. </p>

<p>Being out of the light bubble of a city is awesome. That&#39;s great you&#39;re so near those places. Give the scheduled times thing a try. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I definitely believe the story. The guy does not let a beer go to waste. </p>

<p>Crazy about your friend, ive definitely got to try a schedule. Was there any specific time he used? Im typically up pretty late, but pretty close to major cities, D.C. and Baltimore. Lot of light pollution at night down here on the east coast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He goes out as the sun is setting and pretty much stays out there. When it&#39;s warm, he&#39;s been known to sleep outside on the patio if he fell asleep watching the sky. Once they began to develop a relationship, he&#39;d go in when they&#39;d leave for the night (usually between 10-11p). </p>

<p>At the time, he lived in house at the top of a mountain, so the huge patio was a great spot to sit and watch. He moved a few weeks into them showing up and they actually followed him and gave him a nudge to come outside the first night at the new place. </p>

<p>It was at the second location things really picked up. It all stopped once it was too cold and the snow was several feet deep. Things resumed once the weather permitted. </p>

<p>(As an aside, they do appear during  the day, but it&#39;s like they were saying hi and to see if he was paying attention. The best was when he&#39;d hear others on the lift saying things like &quot;did you see that,&quot; &quot;what was that,&quot; etc. He took the opportunity to red pill people and make friends with others who were awake.)</p>

<p>It attracted some weird attention once they started getting close that was a bit unnerving; if we can see visitors, others are aware of those interactions, too. </p>

<p>We had a lot of talks about the others and what their intent was as silent helicopters and/or black SUV&#39;s showed up right as the orbs did on more than one occasion. There was some strangeness during that time, but no direct interactions. </p>

<p>It can be beyond amazing if a relationship is established; you see things you might not otherwise believe. Just use care and be safe if you attract unexpected attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen a few in my days. Including the star type you mention. Very bright, brighter than normal. Attention getting for sure. Mentioned to a friend, cause he was like dude watch the road, so I go, &quot;wtf is that.&quot; We both look, he definitely see it, and it zooms away, like away from earth, it just faded out. We were screaming and hollering. </p>

<p>Also seen one turn clouds green down in Florida, driving down I-4, with my dad. It followed the highway, striking above the clouds but illuminating them. He was on the phone, but i was like &quot;TELL ME you saw that&quot;, as he was wide-eyed, nodding his head in affirmation. </p>

<p>I personally felt as though I saw more, those stick out because I was not alone and having an additional witness and somebody to say wtf was that with makes it better.</p>

<p>Youll be watching the sky for the next week or so, happy hunting!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been hunting for one years now! I just moved to a different area last year and I must say I experienced some strange things. I live alone now and the are I live is pretty secluded, last year I experienced memory loss, one was for 17 hrs. I went home and then I woke up on my bed 17 hrs later, I can&#39;t remember even going to bed, it happened 3 times so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really haven&#39;t thought of doing that! But that means I have to record every day, because last year each time it happens there were couple of months between them. Also, sometimes I might go to bed and my heart starts beating fast, for some reason I get the feeling that someone is in my room with me but I can&#39;t see anyone. The thing is that I&#39;m not afraid being alone and I definitely don&#39;t go to bed thinking that someone is in my room. The first time i almost went crazy, I saw the clock and I got really really confused, I couldn&#39;t believe a whole day passed. I was literally looking at all the clocks in my house to find one that is normal. Then I thought maybe I passed out or something. Second time i started thinking something is wrong with me and I should see a dr, like I&#39;m passing out for some reason. Third time I kinda pushed it out of my head and didn&#39;t really want to think about it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I forgot to mention that the section time it happened I woke up and i had a big scratch on my arm. I didn&#39;t really see it but when I tried to take a shower i felt my arm burning, so I looked at it and there was a scratch on my arm about 3 inches. I wasn&#39;t bleeding or anything but you could definitely see a red straight line and i felt a burning sensation. I couldn&#39;t remember any way I could have scratched myself and i also looked in my bed and around it for anything that could cause it but could not find anything.</p>

I also have a smoke detector but i&#39;m not sure if its also a carbon monoxide detector, I&#39;ll definitely check it out though. Thanks, that comment might be life saving! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I mean, with no clouds etc I have no logical explanation as to why it disappeared. The time I can see Venus until it disappears is still significantly longer than what you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p>Appreciate the pic and description OP. This stuff fascinates me. I&#39;ve only seen a UFO once. Back in the summer of 2000. It looked like a star, pulsating color, pretty high up and kept doing a zig-zag like pattern in the sky for about 3-5 minutes before zipping away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All week? It&#39;s been like that since September. Now here is where it gets interesting. Venus as a weak magnetic field, so the solar wind interacts with the Venusian atmosphere very strongly. The reason this is important is because the brightness of Venus is an accurate representation of solar wind output. The higher the output the brighter Venus glows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy for you!  Here is mine:</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening.
edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas)
edit: Sorry for the potato quality drawing. I could always take more time and sketch something more detailed, but this is the gist of it. It was below the clouds. This is a sketch as it passed directly in front of me. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong... I&#39;ve seen some amazing things, including the above man-made phenomena, which can be quite sensational if you don&#39;t know what they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can them. They will look like a tiny moving star (or a large one, depending on its size, its altitude, what it&#39;s made of, etc). If you do not see an FAA light, it is not an airplane and the contrast becomes very clear after you&#39;ve seen a few. They do not have lights and are only visible when they cross the sun&#39;s line of sight. You can see the same effect with airplanes in the sky, especially during twilight, that they will shine very brightly for just a few moments, and thereafter are barely visible at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting! It seems like Venus, except it disappears so it&#39;s interesting. Here under a dead Ohio sky, I live pretty close to Wright Patt and see some strange things out here. For me it started when I visited family in Iowa when I was like five or six. It&#39;s a farming village made up of mostly my family in the early 90&#39;s, so leaving me alone wasn&#39;t a big deal back then. That&#39;s when I see an object that got up close and personal with little ol me. It was colorful, like shifting through different hues of colors- blue, pink, yellow, orange, light green. At one point all the colors formed perfectly to show an Eye. It was so close. Right above the country house. I was terrified, I mean shit the bed terrified. Still bothers me to this day and I have an extreme fascination with eyes now. 
Two other incidents happened here in Ohio. One time I was star gazing on one specific star that wasn&#39;t twinkling, nor moving like a plane or satellite. A good five minutes passed until it darted across the sky to disappear. The second time I have a friend with me, thankfully. It was probably seven or nine objects in the sky behaving not like a plane, flare, balloon, satellite, or helicopters. These lights were like dancing, making shapes, and just moving around a fixated part of the sky. Went on for a while. They didn&#39;t move out of vision across the sky, they just simply disappeared. My friend I concluded that they&#39;re either aliens or Wright Patterson is testing alien technology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats interesting for sure. I always wondered about spotting more. I like the idea of a set schedule. I go camping a few miles from one of the most verifiable accounts called the allagash incident. I mean there is nothing up there. No cell service, no electricity. Nothing. </p>

<p>Our family knows about a nice fishing spot off a dam, on Harrington Lake, my uncle, whom regrettably is an alcoholic, claims to have seen shit. I think he was abducted. Story goes he went to do some night fishing, what time idk, but returned at dawn extremely disheveled. The crutch to the story is, he left his fishing gear and beer on the dam. Ran back, mumbled  to cousinss and his brother, about fucking aliens and got in his truck and left the camp at 5 am. A 3.5 hour drive home.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really haven&#39;t thought of doing that! But that means I have to record every day, because last year each time it happens there were couple of months between them. Also, sometimes I might go to bed and my heart starts beating fast, for some reason I get the feeling that someone is in my room with me but I can&#39;t see anyone. The thing is that I&#39;m not afraid being alone and I definitely don&#39;t go to bed thinking that someone is in my room. The first time i almost went crazy, I saw the clock and I got really really confused, I couldn&#39;t believe a whole day passed. I was literally looking at all the clocks in my house to find one that is normal. Then I thought maybe I passed out or something. Second time i started thinking something is wrong with me and I should see a dr, like I&#39;m passing out for some reason. Third time I kinda pushed it out of my head and didn&#39;t really want to think about it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I forgot to mention that the section time it happened I woke up and i had a big scratch on my arm. I didn&#39;t really see it but when I tried to take a shower i felt my arm burning, so I looked at it and there was a scratch on my arm about 3 inches. I wasn&#39;t bleeding or anything but you could definitely see a red straight line and i felt a burning sensation. I couldn&#39;t remember any way I could have scratched myself and i also looked in my bed and around it for anything that could cause it but could not find anything.</p>

If so, and I&#39;m not trying to scare you, but missing time is usually the result of an abduction. Any wierd markings or lumps on your body? Ringing in ears, bloody noses, or random brightness? </p>
