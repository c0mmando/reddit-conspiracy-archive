    <div class="md"><p>Yeah okay, I don&#39;t thinking naming a day after a rich European dude counts as a &quot;sorry for the genocide&quot; day. There is no day of remembrance for it. In school they teach you &quot;oh yeah, we told them sorry and gave them the entire state of Oklahoma&quot; and that&#39;s about it. Sorry, here are some casinos.</p>

<p>In k-12 the only genocide you ever learn about is &quot;6 million joooos!!!&quot;. I wasted months of my</p>

<p>Like it is the only one in existence. Don&#39;t pay attention to the mass genocide, theft of an entire continent, and slavery that happened right here.</p>

<p>Or the Asian concentration camps for Chinese slaves, oops I mean &quot;indentured servants&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t learn about the scale of any of those until I did my own research. Both got about 1 chapter each in my &quot;higher level&quot; history books, and it was mostly &quot;yeah, not really a big deal, small, isolated incident&quot;. Or anything about native Americans, &quot;oh the savages that would randomly come attack us for no reason, it was for our own good, self defense!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I teach in Arizona. I&#39;ve taught AP US History and on level American History (as well as government and politics). Even if I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d be supported by my administration for teaching some of the ugly side of American history I still would. It&#39;s easier to get the students engaged when they learn new things. By the time the get to me junior year they&#39;ve been taught the general narrative (no fault of their elementary and middle school teachers-I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d have a conversation about American imperialism with a sixth grader) and are floored when they realize it&#39;s ok to question things and talk about how the US government has been the villain at times. For example, we just finished WWII in one class period. We finished the lecture let on Friday and then today watched a TED Talk with George Tekei about his time in a Japanese internment camp and watched propaganda videos from WWII where racism and dishonesty was rampant and discussed everything. But I also teach in a school that offer a Mexican American and African American US history classes from those perspectives. I guess this is where I add the obligatory &quot;#blessed&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Texas, and we spent at most a day on the trail of tears and that&#39;s about all that was covered. &quot;We needed the land for our farms&quot;. Just we, not &quot;the same elite ruling families from back then that are also still in power today centuries later did it&quot;. The teachers had no education in who &quot;we&quot; or &quot;they&quot; were or how it related to modern society, just &quot;these events happened, read the chapter tonight that this guy from this publishing company wrote, because that&#39;s what I learned, look at my degree.&quot;</p>

<p>McGraw-Hill is the most shameful educational company in America. This is the same company that got caught trying to replace the term &quot;slave&quot; with &quot;worker&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to work on today learning about this shady company and figure out who is paying them to teach lies and whitewash history. Pretty much every public school reads from McGraw-Hill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes that is the other company. I will look into them too, good call. I trust none of these major publishers. I think there is a 3rd one too. Dumb how just 2-3 companies are the only source of information prescribed (yes, that&#39;s right) to children these days. &quot;I see you have a condition called lack of knowledge.

    <div class="md"><p>I found out about it a different way. The creek that run behind my house is called Murderer&#39;s Creek, I thought that was a weird name so I looked up the history. It turns out the creek was named that because when the surveyors first came here, they discovered a dead man hung up in a tree. I think I found his camping spot. </p>

<p>It turns out that a lot of the locals were murdered or enslaved in order to make way for the white people moving in. That is California for you. A state that was founded on genocide. </p>

<p>Columbus never landed on the continent. </p>

<p>That includes North and South.</p>

<p>The man never harmed the Islanders until he left behind 1200 men behind. Guess what? Yeah, they were all killed by the Islanders long before Columbus even made his return trip.</p>

<p>So what did he do when he got back? The same thing humans have been doing since the dawn of time. He proceeded to conquer. Slash and burn tactics along with some slavery. The shit still happens to this day all around the world.</p>

Arawak/Taino Indians</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the Arawak/Taino Indians, the original natives of the land today called Haiti (and Dominican Republic). This is not so much an original treatment, but I pulled a lot of material together from about a dozen sources, so it&#39;s more like an extended report.</p>

<p>The word &quot;genocide&quot; is an interesting term. Etymologically it means the killing of an entire &quot;gens,&quot; a whole people. The word is used a good deal in politically charged language these days with people often charging that some group or other is attempting genocide. Certainly Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich of Germany attempted it on the Jews of Europe, and failed. As far as I know, the only case in history of where complete and total genocide was carried out was here on the island of Hispaniola. The entire GENS, the whole people of the native Americans of the Arawak/Taino people were wiped out. It is a horrible and astonishing story. </p>

<p>Equal rights != anti semitism (which this post is pointing out)<br/>
Criticism of Israel != anti semitism<br/>
Criticism of Zionism != anti semitism (even the UN ruled Zionism as a racist institution)        </p>

<p>It&#39;s logically equivalent to saying you&#39;re a racist because you hate Nazis. Criticism of Nazis != anti German racism.     </p>

<p>Some of my favorite people are Glenn Greenwald and Richard Feynman. Both amazing people. Both Jewish. Just wanted to make that clear since I&#39;m honest and brave enough on the internet, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n3yxj/check_out_my_comment_that_was_deleted_from/">my comments about Israel have had a history of being censored on Reddit.</a></p>

<p>Naturally the Jew supremacists did not like that idea and they attacked me in every way they could think of. Which, thank God, was mostly on line. I live in an area with lots of Jews, but not so many that they could just walk up and kill me. They could play their tricks, but they would never be able to know who all was busy watching my back. </p>

<p>I remember one conversation I had with one of them on line where he/she was asserting that I could not use Anne Frank as a model for what I was doing because I was not Jewish. That made me laugh, I knew the book was being taught to millions of Americans. If I compared myself to her in some way, they were going to be able to &#39;get it&#39;. </p>

<p>It still makes me laugh, some Jews may think they are a superior race, but I sure don&#39;t. I think their hubris will be the cause of their big downfall. </p>

<p>I mean, shit - even look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">Wikipedia</a> - &quot;was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler&#39;s Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.&quot;</p>

<p>It then goes on to say &quot;Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Some</em> definitions. Like those other people don&#39;t even fuckin  really matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to the Holocaust museum in DC, and all that spoke about were jews.</p>

<p>In school we were only taught about how it targeted jews.</p>

<p>Never once were we taught about the Slavs, Poles, Gypsies, Mentally ill, physically disabled, political opponents and so on etc that make up a much larger number than the jews that were killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone of Native American ancestry, I die a little inside every time I read &quot;American Indian...&quot; like....I am pretty sure the government did this on purpose to eradicate Native Americans. India is getting to be a serious contender in the world. More people think of actual Indians than Native Americans when you say Indian now, an &quot;American Indian&quot; must be an Indian who lives in America now, not a Native American, get it? </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking 1984 newspeak- its weaponized language. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this very same comment a few days back in <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> and got downvoted. About how the &quot;Holocaust&quot; only refers to jews. </p>

<p>I mean, shit - even look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">Wikipedia</a> - &quot;was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler&#39;s Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.&quot;</p>

<p>It then goes on to say &quot;Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Some</em> definitions. Like those other people don&#39;t even fuckin  really matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to the Holocaust museum in DC, and all that spoke about were jews.</p>

<p>In school we were only taught about how it targeted jews.</p>

<p>Never once were we taught about the Slavs, Poles, Gypsies, Mentally ill, physically disabled, political opponents and so on etc that make up a much larger number than the jews that were killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Texas, and we spent at most a day on the trail of tears and that&#39;s about all that was covered. &quot;We needed the land for our farms&quot;. Just we, not &quot;the same elite ruling families from back then that are also still in power today centuries later did it&quot;. The teachers had no education in who &quot;we&quot; or &quot;they&quot; were or how it related to modern society, just &quot;these events happened, read the chapter tonight that this guy from this publishing company wrote, because that&#39;s what I learned, look at my degree.&quot;</p>

<p>McGraw-Hill is the most shameful educational company in America. This is the same company that got caught trying to replace the term &quot;slave&quot; with &quot;worker&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to work on today learning about this shady company and figure out who is paying them to teach lies and whitewash history. Pretty much every public school reads from McGraw-Hill.</p>
