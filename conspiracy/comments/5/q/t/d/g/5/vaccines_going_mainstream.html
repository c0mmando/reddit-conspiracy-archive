        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the sake of privacy and safety, I will be brief. I have information regarding Trumps recent actions regarding vaccinations. I will lay out a simple roadmap, first, or now, CDC computers with innacurate information about the safety of vaccinations have been seized, second, Trump will reveal a committee, involving the Kennedys, that will be investingating and revealing new information legitimizing criticisms about vaccinations that have been silenced previously. This information will pertain to many things, but most importantly, why Autism and ADHD have become rampant in modern, middle and upperclass America and other first world nations.  These investigations will conclude that vaccination in its current state is highly dangerous, leading to the third step, which is reform. As it stands vaccines are manufactured primarily in China, and some in India. This will be ceased and control of the production of vaccines will be transferred to US facilities that will be under close scrutiny, for what it is worth. Following this there will be more open discussion of the damage caused by these flawed vaccines. All of this is true, and will remain to be, unless there are serious events tha interrupt this flow. </p>

<p>Check back in 6 months or so and be surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no real knowledge of the issue, it seems. They don&#39;t want vaccines to be gone, they want them made <em>the way they&#39;re supposed to</em>.</p>

<p>Vaccines work, and they&#39;re amazing, however I don&#39;t think it would be too much to ask if they wouldn&#39;t put <em>Thiomersal</em> as an additive in the vaccine. Thiomersal is an anti septic and anti fungal agent labeled as <em>&quot;Very toxic (T+)
Dangerous for the environment (N)
Repr. Cat. 1&quot;</em> using the ratings from the Dangerous Substances Directive in the European Union Laws regarding chemical safety.</p>

<p>Yet it is a very common chemical/agent used in the medical industry to &quot;kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, immunoglobulins, and vaccines.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the United States, countries in the European Union and a few other affluent countries, thiomersal is no longer used as a preservative in routine childhood vaccination schedules.[4] In the U.S., the only exceptions among vaccines routinely recommended for children are some formulations <em>of the inactivated influenza vaccine</em> for children older than two years.[15</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why some people generally avoid flu shots. They also don&#39;t work in the first place, but that&#39;s another discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making a big mistake. They embedded in your head that vaccines are good for you but it&#39;s not necessarily true. I know people from countries that literally people get only the basis vaccines like tetanus and they are way healthier than Americans. ADHD is also non existent there. Just by seeing their historic charts people there started getting sick and dying from cancer during the last 10 year when the government mandated them to get vaccinated and take medication for illnesses that literally did not exist there 15 years ago. Its a big setup and a huge lie to depopulate and profit from people dying.</p>

It really just equals more money into the pockets of the medical/pharmaceutical industries.  All these people will eventually get sick from the contaminated water,  then they go to the doctor for their meds and end up in that cycle.  And going to the doctor and getting meds are as expensive as ever.  If you&#39;re from Jersey you can thank ya boy, bitch ass Cory Booker.</p>

<p>If they have any power at all, they won&#39;t allow what your describing to happen....if it&#39;s even intimated in a public way that vaccines can or have hurt children, you&#39;re looking at billions of dollars worth of class action lawsuits. Every single parent of an autistic child will be jumping on that train, whether it was vaccines that caused their kids issues or not. That&#39;s very, very bad for business. If Trump wants to go to war with big pharma, that&#39;s admirable, but it&#39;s gonna get real messy because they won&#39;t let this happen without a fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. Mercury and lead work in a synergistic fashion- which means when theyre combined they are way more toxic than they are alone. The same is true for mercury and aluminum-they are extremely toxic when combined. Since everyone excretes metals differently, some more than others based on their genetic profile, its hard to know who is going to be vulnerable to vaccine injury because no one knows how much their heavy metal body burden is-that is how much they have accumulated in their brain and fatty tissues over their lifetime. That would seem to make children in areas with lead in the water more vulnerable to damage from mercury-no matter what the source. Coal plants and amalgam fillings also emit mercury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I predict that Trump will completely ignore vaccines throughout his entire term. His and Bannon&#39;s goal is to divide the American people, not to make them sick. So there will be encouragement of hatred towards certain population groups - starting with gays, foreigners and muslims - along with a general gaslighting of the American people to make facts mean less, as has been pioneered with great success by Fox News during the Obama term. </p>

<p>The goal is to divide and conquer the American people and take away lefty and degenerate things such as &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;. Anti-vaccination doesn&#39;t seem to contribute to that.</p>
