        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see a <em>lot</em> of posts on here, primarily about the US government and political stuff. Now, I&#39;m not American so that stuff doesn&#39;t really interest me. Though I do find pizzagate really interesting. </p>

<p>But what I&#39;m saying is what happened to other conspiracy theories? UFOs, the MIB, Flat Earth, are we living in a computer?, stuff like that. The ones about a huge wall in Antarctica, or a sub-terranean Nazi city. Reptilians, celebrities who faked their deaths. Was the holocaust a hoax? How about the Illuminati, the freemasons, more on the occult. MIB experiences are interesting to read about, personally. I just think we should branch out and talk about other things. Maybe we could limit the amount of US government posts on this sub. Why not make another sub for US government conspiracy theories? This sub needs more variety imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right!? </p>

<p>There should be a sub specifically for political conspiracy purposes. It makes up a huge chunk of what gets posted here, and also gets a majority of the the attention. If there was a political conspiracy sub, it would clean up a lot of the bickering in here, leaving more room for actual conversations that don&#39;t involve being a shill or being labeled whatever cause you think pizzagate is out in left field. </p>

<p>If I had more time or even knew where to start I&#39;d make a political conspiracy sub. But it&#39;s not something I could invest much time in to, or even know where to start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed. too much of the political posts here barely qualify as conspiracy, but it seems the sub has been invaded by CTR as well as normal people waking up, looking for more MSM psots but unfortunately that&#39;s what they get from the reddit rigging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The politcal spam is intentional.  It&#39;s used to make this sub look heavily invested in politics and hence divided. They don&#39;t want the average user stumbling into this sub seeing us asking bigger questions,  together.  They don&#39;t want the average user asking bigger questions.  It&#39;s been a good 2-3 months now of non stop linked posts by random users.  Just got to sort through the noise. True free thinkers will find the good threads.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is the deep state.  Reddit has been in lock step with the MSM the whole way.  Reddit has been complicit in covering up child pedo rings.

    <div class="md"><p>I can only give you my personal experience from this site.  On Labor Day, a political sub was taken over in one weekend.  Flooded with bots and a complete 180 in the narrative.  Then came political leaks, which were scrubbed off of this very sub and continue to be scrubbed off the internet.  There was also an apology from the CEO of this site after he went in and edited users comments to make them look bad.  It is understood that Reddit is a business, I have no problem with that.  But it&#39;s a front that tells us &quot;come here and discuss freely&quot;...And if man discussed freely, we would be able to accept certain truths and make great changes together.  And yet every day, every minute, Reddit promote division.  Divisive clickbait article shoot to the top of subs, bots brigade subs, comments are edited.  I mean this quite literally - Reddit rewrites our history in real time.  The implications for human history are startling imo.  Divide, conquer, rewrite the history books...Which side do you think Reddit is on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s still a place for free speech and discussion, just, like every institution, it had owners, shareholders, people in charge. Naturally those people have a specific ideology and set views and values. 
Going against those very values and views of the owners and shareholders is obviously going to be met with resistance. But it&#39;s still a place we can push the fact that maybe other views and values are right and not there&#39;s. </p>

<p>For censorship, well yea that is wrong, but if you go to a sub about toilets and start talking about sinks and bathtubs, and how how much better they are other than toilets, odds are what is talked about and said about those sinks and bathtubs are going to be removed. In a sense that is censorship, but it&#39;s not in a malicious way. </p>

<p>And history is hardly being rewritten, your basing your perception history and current history of what subs you read. For 1, reddit shouldn&#39;t be the place you come to determine what&#39;s proper history and what not. Reddit is for discussion and analysis. And 2, again what your learning is what subs you read, so obviously your not going to learn about Asian perspective and history if you don&#39;t subscribe to any Asian based subs. If all your subs are memes, and democratic based subs, no odds are you won&#39;t learn or get the same information republican based subs dishing out. And it&#39;s that information we get from specific subs that generate what we learn, hence what our perception of history will be. </p>

<p>But again, reddit isn&#39;t censored technically, just need to look elsewhere, the narrative your looking for might not be on the best interests of the sub, so they edit what is seen. Yes that sub changed or hid things, only because it goes against them as a sub, but if you look elsewhere, the information we seek will most likely be be there... </p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s scary people base their world views and world history off of one or two subs they read. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some people say that all the major world events are orchestrated. 9/11, school shootings. And for different reasons too. For instance, 9/11 was used as an excuse to invade Iraq for oil, whereas mass shootings are used to enforce gun control and get supporters for it. I also read a comment by another redditor which said that the Simpsons TV show is a platform for the elite to drop hints on their plans for the world, which would explain how they predicted 9/11 and the election of Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did. Here is the comment:</p>

<p>The Simpsons have been a platform for the elites to drop clues to us about their plans. </p>

<p>A couple episodes talks about cloning people and also cloning animals/Humans which will serve the elites as labor and sex slaves. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=0AQqkkKx9uY">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=0AQqkkKx9uY</a></p>

<p>Also, the Zionist Jews are the head of all this. They are the SATANIC Bloodline (13 Bloodlines) which Hitler says they live in the inside the earth from the openings of the N/S poles. Check it out, they believe in white genocide and the Jews becoming the superior race. After all that happens and the messiah is here they get 2,800 slaves. So, I&#39;m thinking some of those slaves will be the people left over after they kill off the whites and others. The rest of the slaves will be the clones. <a href="http://rense.com/general86/talmd.htm">http://rense.com/general86/talmd.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I believe it or you should believe it, but we should be open to possibilities, no matter how crazy they may sound. To me, this one does not sound ridiculous. </p>

<p>Think about it. Did you ever suspect that the all the world&#39;s major events are planned in advance? Would you ever think that those in control would give us hints as to what their plans are through a very popular TV show? And after the things they showed came true, we thought they had mysteriouly predicted it, but would we ever have stopped to think that maybe they knew exactly what was going to happen? </p>

<p>As for their reason for giving us these hints, maybe they know that they are pretty untouchable. They could be taunting us. They&#39;re giving us the answer literally in front of our faces and no one is picking up on it.</p>

<p>Could also be that dropping these &quot;hints&quot; has nothing to do with the rest of us, necessarily. The hints could be a form of manifestation/magick to ensure these events actually happen.</p>

<p>Or, they could be unintended predictions by the show&#39;s creators. I&#39;ve seen it happen so many times in popular culture or just among my friends and family. Someone makes a joke about something, and then weeks/months/years later it happens. Intuition works in strange ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the idea of predictive programming sounds rediculous on a a whole, and anywhere you read about it is not from authentic mainstream sources... one must ask what is evidence these days? Can we trust the main stream of &#39;true&#39; information? Trust no one. But do not dismiss something because it sounds crazy. Many crazy things have happened in history, or as I like to call it &#39;hostilory&#39; haha. Allegedly of course, we could all just live in a hologram tailored for each and every one of us like in the matrix, afterall.</p>

<p>I feel the person who is the last to react to a crazy idea and consider the implications and willing to accept that what they thought the truth is indeed a lie, is the the more wiser than who vehemently denies such preposterous ideas based on their emotions and trust in society / mankind / the elite. </p>

<p>Take comfort my truth seeking or maybe but i doubt it troll shilling friend.

The British Empire was only following a higher order/directive on what to do to keep the big plan moving along (the Magnum Opus). You have to build a power up, right? Why was the US not re-colonized by Britain during The War of 1812, when according to history the US should&#39;ve lost, as we were the weaker of the two? The allowance by Britannia (using the Roman word for a reason) of the U.S. being a &quot;free&quot; nation allowed the Roth s child bankng British Empire to focus on the global drug trade through a colonization of another country (India) and their opium poppy fields to sell to the Chinese, also sparking The Opium Wars. On top of that, the British East India Company fostered the growth of the US from sea to shining sea by supplying the supplying the opium used by the Chinese railroad workers during the building of all of the railroads in the US. Wait, what? Yeah, surface history books aren&#39;t going to expound upon those tidbits at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m cautious to say 100% it&#39;s flat because people have different definitions of this. I&#39;ve noticed a lot of flat earthers proclaim that we&#39;re on a flat plane inside a dome. We don&#39;t have sufficient evidence to prove this 100%. We don&#39;t know enough about Antarctica, whether there are &#39;edges of the earth&#39;, and whether there&#39;s such thing as outer space. I lean towards the dome or enclosure theory simply because of all the deception happening in space, but all that deception doesn&#39;t immediately prove outer space isn&#39;t real. While my observations and research tell me the earth is flat, and this is a good catch-phrase to wake people up, we still need to keep investigating.</p>

<p>Are we in some sort of realm? Are we on an infinite plane, or does it stop at the ice shelf with a dome enclosure? Perhaps the earth is slightly concave, maybe it&#39;s hollow with portals to other realms at the north or south pole. (If there even is such a thing as the south pole.) These are the questions we need to keep asking and investigating because we haven&#39;t been told the true nature of our world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth is interesting, but it&#39;s easily disproven with a basic knowledge of physics. Shadows on Earth would not behave how they do if the Earth was flat. You can easily test this using a flat object and a sphere object with a lamp. The Greeks figured out the Earth was not flat thousands of years ago using the positions of shadows in Alexandria and in Memphis at noon on the solstice (the shadows were in different positions at the same time of day).</p>

<p>Unless of course, you believe science is not real. In that case good luck to you. I mean, I can&#39;t for sure prove or disprove any of this because reality is subjective to you.</p>

Thanks to global warming, we will be able to see it very soon.  Living in a computer?  If the computer is big enough, then it would not make a difference.  If it was not, then you might come across some &quot;glitch in the matrix&quot; phenomena.  Worth looking into?  Yes.  Reptilians?  Seems unlikely.  Celebrities?  Who cares.  Illuminati?

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, IMO Trump&#39;s rise to power and the election are deeply linked to many conspiracies. It&#39;s a visible output linked to the battle for the planet, a quiet coup happening around the world that connects to the suppression of advanced technologies, secret space program, aliens, lost ancient history, antarctica, competing secret societies and the end of an age culminating in an ascension event.</p>

<p>After a year of studying everything I began laying it all out in the <a href="http://realitygateway.com/reality-guide/">Reality Guide</a>. I plan on adding a Battle For Earth section, I&#39;ve just been too swamped with other stuff. The big stuff to follow to make connections is David Wilcock, Cosmic Disclosure, Benjamin Fulford (read between the lines with him, there is disinfo too) and Simon Parkes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some people say that all the major world events are orchestrated. 9/11, school shootings. And for different reasons too. For instance, 9/11 was used as an excuse to invade Iraq for oil, whereas mass shootings are used to enforce gun control and get supporters for it. I also read a comment by another redditor which said that the Simpsons TV show is a platform for the elite to drop hints on their plans for the world, which would explain how they predicted 9/11 and the election of Trump.</p>

The British Empire was only following a higher order/directive on what to do to keep the big plan moving along (the Magnum Opus). You have to build a power up, right? Why was the US not re-colonized by Britain during The War of 1812, when according to history the US should&#39;ve lost, as we were the weaker of the two? The allowance by Britannia (using the Roman word for a reason) of the U.S. being a &quot;free&quot; nation allowed the Roth s child bankng British Empire to focus on the global drug trade through a colonization of another country (India) and their opium poppy fields to sell to the Chinese, also sparking The Opium Wars. On top of that, the British East India Company fostered the growth of the US from sea to shining sea by supplying the supplying the opium used by the Chinese railroad workers during the building of all of the railroads in the US. Wait, what? Yeah, surface history books aren&#39;t going to expound upon those tidbits at all.</p>
