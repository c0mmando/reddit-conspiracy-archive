       Seeing as the military intelligence school in the UK (DISC) still uses the Russian intelligence and military structure as the basis for much of the education, I'd argue my knowledge is fair to middling.

       There is very little either country is capable of doing that the other isn't made aware of extremely quickly. That would include diplomatic cables through embassies, tracking of mobile phones and email accounts, and even secure communications systems, should the need arise.  And the US, UK and European countries have far more advanced technology in terms of collection. Russia has brute force, but it isn't subtle in those terms

       And you don't think Russia knows that and would adapt if they were trying to blackmail or control someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit, the general public has known for a long time that future presidents and people in positions of power are put under more scrutiny by intelligence services. I forgot which whistle blower it was that talked about this, maybe Binney or Drake though. Surely Russia would know this and work around it if they intended on controlling the president.

       By that logic the US just counter adapts and uses the same blackmail.

       That's not the same line of logic... I'm arguing that Russia isn't going to just let their operations be compromised by something even civilians are aware of. Do you seriously think Russia is unaware of ours and our allies capabilities? Or do you think they're aware and would just not give a shit?

       It's exactly the same logic and it's exactly the definition of flipping an asset or double agent. Whatever is being used to blackmail someone can be used by anyone, which is why half of a vetting process is background checks into porn favorites, gambling habits, affairs, sexual deviance etc. If you have a fault, anyone can find it and use it to gain information. Disagree all you want but its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say anything about Russia not being aware. They are very aware and they have very specific programs trying to gather counter electronic intelligence to understand how systems work. But that doesn't give them the system, it gives them a picture of what the system does.

       Its getting off topic. Trump is not a Russian asset.

       No its not the same logic lol I understand what you're saying, but it's not at all the same line of logic.

       So they'd be aware systems are compromised but still use them? No way they'd have clandestine channels for this thing.

       Trump is a Russian asset, keep believing what you want though, your beliefs won't change reality.

       Wow, you again with the same post, so here is my same reply:
      </p>
      <p>
       From my previous reply: Rather than rebut each of these points individually—and to be clear, many of these points or their significance can be disputed—I'll just say that most of it is based on the assumption that a normal, "right-thinking" person should not want to normalize relations with Russia, and I do not accept that assumption. That assumption is what underlies the implication that all the evidence above is in some way sinister. If you know anything beyond superficial reporting of world affairs, then you know that the US has repeatedly screwed over the Russians since the fall of the Soviet Union. Official US policy and covert meddling by the CIA have repeatedly sought to isolate Russia and undermine its interests. Neocons have been leading the US on a path to conflict with Russia, whether through another CIA-led "regime change" or through outright war. And we're citing McCain, the stooge who supported Svoboda in Ukraine, as a reputable source of information about concerns about Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what, let Trump's team talk to Russia, and hope that they can make the real-politic concerns about oil work out, because the conflict with Russia is totally contrived and in the true interests of neither the US nor Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the real reason for the propaganda push against Russia: it is meant to divert attention from the Middle East, and the totally reckless and unethical agenda that has been pursued there for the last several decades by the US government. Did we think it would be okay with the vested interests to just let Russia put a stop to the Saudi-Qatar pipeline through Syria? Of course, so they are doing everything—fabricating lies and spinning the facts like mad—to make sure the massive investment of financial and political capital isn't lost by a change in foreign policy at the top.

      <p>
       If people want to pick on Trump's policies, how about going after him for the ones that actually threaten peace: like the prospect of conflict with Iran or with China? Or you know, keep driving this propaganda train against Russia because you're a bitter Democrat or willing to dance to the CIA's tune.
