<p>Personnally I don&#39;t have an opinion on &quot;the Holocaust&quot;. I&#39;m agnostic. Plus I refuse to discuss it, as one party of that discussion risks State violence for sharing his thoughts (in most of Europe at least). In solidarity with him, and because no conversation exists if one portion of it has been criminalized, I simply avoid the subject. I don&#39;t see the point of talking about something if everyone is forced (by law) to agree (even if I would too).</p>

<p>I prefer asking people what they think of <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs">this 1992 documentary</a> made by a Jewish-American Holocaust investigator.</p>

<p>If historical revisionism is criminal, what kind of researcher is the historian?</p>

<p>And why would you say this &quot;trust Russian sources?&quot;. Are you part of this propagandized neo-McCarthist Russian-bashing movement? Or do you not trust your eyes and mind enough to reason by yourself, but rather choose to rely on whose interpretations you regurgitate because you identify with them?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s ridiculous to review this particular segment of history, why not penalize other incorrect opinions? Why not criminalize flat-earther theories? Or slavery denialism? Or saying Julius Caesar walked on the Moon? Or praising Stalinist policies? Denying Holodomor?</p>

<p>Even provided the figures are correct, the Holocaust is not, by a long shot, the worst atrocity committed by statist fanatics. Even in the 20th century. What happened to innocent Jews during the 2nd world war is, regardless of any number, horrific and atrocious. It shouldn&#39;t be necessary to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11993382/German-Nazi-grandma-sentenced-to-10-months-in-prison-for-Holocaust-denial.html">jail grand-mothers</a> because they disagree on some parameters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I don&#39;t have sufficient evidence to either corroborate or deny it. As I stated, I&#39;m agnostic on the subject.</p>

<p>I do have enough evidence however to state the Nazi regime was one of the worst enemies of individual liberty in the 20th century. It is responsible for millions of innocent deaths during WW2. I can also say Rousseau may be credited for inspiring the two worst forms of socialism in the 20th century (fascism and communism). I also regret we are currently being governed by a statist political ideology that is a syncretism between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of it was provided by the Soviet Union for the Nuremberg trials. Much has been officially debunked already (by institutional researchers that is, not negationists).</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is not one single Nazi document that shows there was &quot;intent&quot; to mass-exterminate the Jews, i.e. no top-down order was given, not budget was decided, no plan was made. That&#39;s why mainstream (Jewish) historians are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">divided into 2 camps</a>: the intentionalist school and the functionalist school of thought.</p>

<p>Add to that the inconsistencies in Jewish demographic figures, the number of deaths at Auschwitz that was officially (and drastically) reduced without the total being changed, or the fact we now know there were no gas chambers in Dachau.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why IMO the law is strenghtening: because much of the narrative is being revisited. The unfortunate part of that is people are using reasonable arguments such as the ones I&#39;m putting forth to commend/praise/defend Nazism while it was one of the worst totalitarianisms of the past century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read what I wrote? There were no gas chambers in Dachau. This is mainstream history btw.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005214">Here</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no credible evidence that the gas chamber in Barrack X was used to murder human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were 32,000 documented deaths at the camp, and thousands that are undocumented. (<a href="http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/stop11.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this didn&#39;t prevent the Americans prosecutors for stating in Nuremberg that humans were gassed on a mass-scale in Dachau. The myth survived for decades thereafter. Now there&#39;s not 1 serious historian that disputes this was unsubstantiated US wartime propaganda.</p>

<p>About the Wannsee conference, please show me an historical document. This Wikipedia article reflects the intentionalist school of thought on the Holocaust. Again, it is not the dominant one (although it was for 1 generation after WW2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">Read this again.</a></p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not necessarily denying the reality of the &quot;holocaust&quot;. I just think it&#39;s important to be up-to-date with the current canonical precepts.</p>

<p>How about we legiferate in America to forbid slavery denialism, or negating the natives&#39; own holocaust? Would you support that? Much more than 6 million died because of these two institutional crimes alone.</p>

<p>The problem with criminalizing opinion is you elevate the opinion thus being defended by violence. Plus you create a hierarchy of sufferings, which is bound to provoke hostility from minorities whose own sufferings are not thus priviledged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most convincing estimate I&#39;ve come across on the Jewish death toll during WW2 amounted to round about one million, most of them occurring in concentration camps. What most holocaust &quot;deniers&quot; will note beyond the inflated death-toll, though, is that there is no evidence for extermination mechnaisms or gas chambers, as is traditionally claimed. Instead, most evidence is pointing towards Typhus being the main cause of death in the camps at the time, as they were usually built in damp and swampy areas. Combine that circumstance with tight living quarters and limited hygiene and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>The 10.000 people figure seems unrealistically low, while the 6 million figure is unbelievably high. The truth, as you point out likely lies in-between. </p>

<p>The point though, as with every major event in our history, is that we&#39;re being lied to about it. So to question the facts and the narrative here is in no way idiotic if we aim to seek the truth of it all. </p>

I am saying that i deny the way they died and how they all died.<br/>
Yes jews where gassed ( but millions of them ? )<br/>
I am more inclined to believe they died of malnutrition.<br/>
U know the kind of malnutrition u get in a country that is losing the war and all its supply line,s are cut off and bombed.<br/>
But then again your just gonna say i am wrong.<br/>
I do not believe that the story we are told and thought is the real true story.<br/>
But only the parts that make the winners look GREAT and GOOD<br/>
If Germany won we would be tough how great Germany was and how good they where and how evil the others where.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>In that case it&#39;s not saying &quot;fire&quot; that is illegal, but rather <em>imposing</em> that speech upon others. If you say it at a low volume and nobody (who didn&#39;t want to) hears it, it&#39;s a-OK.

<p>To only care about the suffering of jews during that time is racist against all other groups that suffered. Including Palestinians by extension.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment. Obviously I agree with you. Just one little thing, if you don&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>We should stop calling Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza an &quot;occupation&quot;. </p>

<p>First of all, Israel levies taxes there, and controls the airspace, borders and currency. It builds and destroys wherever and whenever it pleases. </p>

<p>Second, there is no Palestinian state. Israel doesn&#39;t recognize it, as much of the world. If there ever was a Palestinian state recognized by Israel, it would be a set of demilitarized non-contiguous corridors between Israeli walls. It would be a sham.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it would be best for Palestinians and the world to stop talking about a Palestinian state (or a so-called &quot;two-state solution&quot;). It is a red herring. For all intents and purposes, the West Bank and Gaza <strong>are part of Israel</strong>. The Palestinians living there are Israeli citizens - only they don&#39;t enjoy civil (voting) rights. The situation is akin to that of former South Africa. Israel is an apartheid state. Only South Africa didn&#39;t come up with the legal/linguistic trickery the Israelis found.</p>

<p>The US Federal gov doesn&#39;t get to say &quot;Chicago is not in the US&quot; (while retaining all the prerogatives of a sovereign) in order to deny civil rights to the people there and be able to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Mowing-the-grass-in-Gaza-368516">&quot;mow the lawn&quot;</a> with white phosphorus there once in a while.</p>

<p>If a Palestinian leader with enough clout, inspired by Mandela, stood up and said &quot;our fight is not one for statehood, it is one for civil rights; let&#39;s renounce violence and demand equal rights, let the future representative and democratic government we shall elect together decide upon the issues that divide us; Eretz Israel!&quot; his life expectancy would rapidly drop to zero. </p>

<p>He&#39;d be right though. Only such a just solution is utterly unthinkable for the racists Jewish-supremacists that compose a large portion of the population (and that underlies and defines Zionism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Palestinians (in terms of culture, language) are very close to the Jordanians. And there&#39;s no Sharia law in Jordan. Actually it&#39;s the most tolerant/progressive country in the ME. There&#39;s no Sharia law in the WB, or Gaza for that matter (where the Hamas governs autonomously minus the prison walls and regular warplane depopulation).</p>

<p>The real islamic nuts are in the Gulf: kingdoms amd sheikdoms governed and populated by obese wahhabi savages. Our friends and allies. Those who <a href="https://28pages.org">financed 911</a> and continue to <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/10/hillary-in-leaked-email-saudi-arabia-and-qatar-are-funding-isis/">finance ISIS.</a></p>

<p>No, the ones who fear the one-state solution the most are the Israelis Jews (all political denominations except for ultra-right wing who want overt one-state apartheid).</p>

<p>You see that would mean the end of the &quot;Jewish state&quot;. Thus it would mean the end of Zionism. A multi-confessional state works well in Lebanon, it should be forced on Israel through boycotts/sanctions, like what was done about similar South Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t negate it, as it precedes it by nearly 200 years. Yes, Nazis were horrible people. They easily make it to the top 10 of worst regimes in the 20th century (even top 5 in terms of death toll).</p>

<p>Democide (death by government, a word surprisingly absent from conversations) <a href="https://archive.is/0wTaW">was the first cause</a> of non-natural deaths in the 20th century. Over 250 million dead (not including soldiers in warfare).</p>

<p>My point was that &quot;antisemitism&quot; (judeophobia) has been a prevalent sentiment throughout the ages, not limited to the 19th or 20th centuries, to Hitler or Bauer. It was a consensual position during the Enlightenment. Throughout the ages they&#39;ve been accused of sacrificing children for their rituals. The Jews were expelled from all 110 homes they were tenants to. It&#39;s only recently that people have started considering the problem lies with all the landlords (rightfully or not, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m agnostic). </p>

<p>Concerning WW2, the Nazis mostly killed Slavs, but also many Jews, gypsies and others. This is undeniable. These groups were single-out, persecuted, and sent to labor camps. Many many died in the labor camps and during the persecution in general. </p>

<p>Therein doesn&#39;t lie the question.</p>

<p>The question is the State discrimination against certain parameters of that equation. The sacrosaint 6 million. The intentionality of the Nazis (while at the same time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">mainstream Jewish historians officially consider</a> Hitler (and high-ranking Nazis) never gave the order, never made the plan for industrial-scale genocide.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an historian, so I have no competence to carry that debate forward. But historians should be able to do it without conclusions being drawn <em>a priori</em> by people with guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone with any true historical insight into the holocaust would know that jews were not solely prosecuted.

<p>It was not all non-germans. Austria, Czechoslovakia and other Germanic people not part of the German Empire. Were not persecuted. Satellite states like Viche France did not persecute their own innately non-German people. The French, Italians, Japanese even (who Hitler assuredly thought were inferior, non-Aryans) were not persecuted. Same can be said of the Spanish in the Franco puppet regime.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that point that&#39;s been made. </p>

<p>The illegality of defamatory allegations do not exist <em>a priori</em>. They are not systematically prosecuted. Charges need to be brought, and the veracity of the allegations are challenged in court.</p>

<p>ELI5: It is not illegal for me to say &quot;John rapes his dog&quot;. If John believes that to be wrong, he can sue me, and my allegations will be examined in court. If they are found to be untrue, and to have thus knowing been expressed, I am sentenced.</p>

<p>So this is clearly NOT what I&#39;m talking about here. I&#39;m talking about crimes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9">lèse-majesté</a>, or crimes of thought regarding personal/private interpretation of historical evidence. </p>

<p>The &quot;screaming fire in a theater&quot; has already been addressed btw.</p>

<p>And just to assuage the formalists: my OP title is not peremptory, it leaves a certain place to doubt.</p>

<p>Plenty of cites there. Correspondence about planning and administration of the solution has been found. Wannsee conference and such pffers more proof it was planned by nazi officials.in high ranks of the ss. Do you think they went rogue and did thos without hitler&#39;s approval?</p>

<p>Dude the nazis lost and burned a shit ton of evidence. Wake up.</p>

<p>Historians have drawn conclusions. There is also dissent. Dissent doesnt equate to disproving this.</p>

<p>If you need to see a piece of paper that says i am hitler, i order the holocaust than you need to be spoonfed.</p>

<p>There was never a death certificate ossued for Hitler either, does that mean he never died?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think nazis were the worst? Many times they tried to have peace, they even sent the Jews out of their country with their money. Also Hitler had Jews ranking officers in his regime. Germans were held in camps too, often times murdered and forcing Hitler to act. </p>
