       We all know illegal immigration from Mexico is at an all time low, and we know that climate change is real. Some of us debate the man made part but riddle me this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the wall is being built due to fear of abrupt climate change due to the slowing of the oceans thermohaline current. This has happened in the pst in earths history and lasted for 1000 years causing extreme weather and temperature increases/decreases across the globe and when it happens it happens and there is nothing you can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a study the department of defense did in 2003 about abrupt climate change (
       <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/an-abrupt-climate-change-scena/">
        http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/an-abrupt-climate-change-scena/
       </a>
       ). Full doc is linked there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their recommendation, that the us build a wall on the Mexico border to strengthen borders and block large scale migration from our neighbors to the south.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, if we are past the point of no return on climate change and the thermohaline current stopping maybe that's why he is shutting down agencies that put regulations on companies and we are focusing on the Dakota pipeline. If this is the case they could never tell us the true reason or there would be mass panic, better to have everyone hate your policy choices than to have chaos erupt.

       FDR signed an Executive Order that gave the Federal Reserve System the power to literally "enslave" Americans into forced labor when the U.S. government can no longer pay on the national debt. When Nixon gave the "death blow"  to what remained of the gold standard, he too signed an order giving the Federal Reserve even more power to force Americans to work to pay on the national debt. I am worried about the millions of Americans who have student loan debt. They can't go bankrupt on their debt, and Obama turned the student loans collection over to the IRS. These Americans will be forced into labor camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the link below. In 1933, with FDR's Executive Order, "the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets
       <strong>
        and labor of their "subjects,"
       </strong>
       the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System."
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, FDR sold Americans into "forced labor" from the time they are born.

       This would never happen. They can already garnish wages of people who don't pay their student loans, so why would they need to put them in camps?

       I didn't say that the end of the world would happen. During the Great Depression, 40% of Americans were out of work. The end of the world didn't happen then. Just think of the coming "collapse" as a major "correction". It will be very bad and wipe out millions of people, but it will be a correction. If what I posted "could never happen", why did the U.S. government give the Federal Reserve such power in the first place? For "re-assurance" purposes?

       Why do you feel that way? FDR forced innocent Japanese Americans into concentration camps during WW2, and after the war, these people were never compensated for all of their property and assets that the government had taken from them. There is an old saying we have in Yiddish about people. It translates: "Throughout history, people have not changed. They won't change. It will always be the same faces with different names".
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to believe that the U.S. government will not resort to actions against American citizens that would be harmful if the economy takes a turn for the worse. But powerful people will do whatever it takes to hold onto their power; regardless of what country it may be. That would include the U.S.

       Yeah? &amp; I bet he is kind enough to sell you some "physical gold" as well since paper money will be useless. While I support auditing the fed, I think just about everything else Ron Paul says is prepper fear mongering on par w/ Glenn Beck.

       You guys who think this are clowns. You're seriously telling me Americans would rather flee to Mexico or Central America rather than say oh...Canada where we have no plans for a border wall? Are you guys really this dumb?

       The wall in the end will be used to keep Americans inside. The Mexicans are not the ones who'll be "pouring in". The engineered economic chaos will produce hordes of American refugees fleeing the cities and migrating south.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that for a NWO to be instated, the US must be taken down. You'd have to provoke utter and debilitating chaos, to demoralize the population (including southeners) to accept the "new age".
      </p>

       This will fail IMO because so many Americans would rather live in conscience than live. That's what makes America exceptional btw. The screechy rats trying to bring us down hate to the core of their bones free-minded, unpretentious, creative and sovereign individuals. The US is where they're found mostly.

       This is a joke, no ones fleeing the US to go to Mexico where the cartels literally skin people alive. What a load of shit. If anything Americans would flee to Canada, so why aren't we building a wall on our northern border? Do you guys even think or just spew whatever bullshit that instantly comes to mind.

       We're talking about a very different America, post-economic crash (or do you not realize an impending monetary calamity is already baked in the cake?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cities like Los Angeles or San Diego will be literally unlivable. The gradual and nearly complete militarization of local police will become readily self-evident. People aren't going to go all the way to Canada. It's far, and it's cold. There's lots of countryside and empty spaces in Mexico, the weather is nice, and the nature is abundant. We are talking millions of people, nothing the cartels or the Mexican government can do anything about.

       People have been saying the same thing as you since the dawn of the internet, in fact, in the early 2000s it was huge on the internet that America would collapse and/or the world would end pretty much every single year up until 2012 where it became MASSIVE, then nothing happened and it went back to doom and gloom every year.

       Central America has been suffering from increasingly bad droughts.  Many people who are coming north are "climate migrants."  They are not just running from violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if people were to migrate south from the US they would continue on to South America as Central America is increasingly inhabitable.   What prevents people from going south now?  These same factors would be in place if US citizens tried to head south in several years.

       I don't personally share the view that climate change will produce such a drastic choc in the short/medium term. (Unless a extinction-event meteorite or something hits Earth). If it exists, its effects are gradual. An economic shock however is much more likely in the fairly immediate future. So we're talking about 2 different time scales. Where do you go if you live in LA or SD and the economic system implodes and the city turns to chaos? I think millions will head to the US countryside, other will head south, out of the US, where it's warm.

       TBH, there are only a handful of freeways going in and out of Los Angeles.  Shut those down and you can trap most people in town.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have shut down one of the ports on the border for the last 3 weeks due to the Mexican protests.  I think with a surge of people coming from CA, they would shut down both ports and not anyone leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could head north, or to AZ or NV, but again, there are only a handful of freeways that leave the state.  If we had a massive earthquake in CA and there was a giant exodus to leave, they could easily regulate the freeways and meter people in and out of the state.

       A "wall" has been in place for decades. A new wall might takes decades to complete. Trump is giving everyone topics for discussion. I mean, everyone. It might be interesting to find out what is actually happening at the same time that we all speak of his Trumpiness' follies. In Mexico, heavy duty infrastructure changes have happened since Peña Nieto came to power. But what do mexicans speak about? Peña Nieto's perfect hair, his public speaking difficulties and his telenovela wife. Literally all distracted by the Political Telenovela that they are feeding the nation. Specially the women that think that he is really cute. Trump might do the same thing. We all speak about him. But surely something must be happening that we are not supposed to know.

       I thought it was because the construction contract would go to one of trump's firms, and construction will be endless. Ergo he'll use taxpayer money to fund the contracts he gives himself. He's just milking money from the state and redirecting it to trump accounts.

       The wall is to stop Americans from leaving the country when income inequality explodes from Trump's authoritarian business first policies.

       Honestly, I think that the border is how all the drugs and CIA sanctioned illegal smuggling goes on, and he's trying to cut that.

       The discussion about a wall on the Mexican/U.S. border was simply a way to encourage racist voters to show up and vote Republican.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is mainly about racism for Republicans, as a majority of American policies aren't really affecting Left vs. Right, rather Wealthy vs. Impoverished.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, given that the overall policies of the two major American political parties are quite similar through the lens of wealth, one of the few main differences between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats openly denounce racism, while Republicans have many viewpoints which bolster racist sentiments and policies which harm people of color to a disproportionate degree.

       What do you mean about antarctica? Or, which of the many antarctica topics are you referencing here? I definitely think its strange how both John Kerry and John Glenn have been there recently...
