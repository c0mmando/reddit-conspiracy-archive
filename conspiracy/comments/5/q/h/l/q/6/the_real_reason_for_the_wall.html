        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all know illegal immigration from Mexico is at an all time low, and we know that climate change is real. Some of us debate the man made part but riddle me this. </p>

<p>What if the wall is being built due to fear of abrupt climate change due to the slowing of the oceans thermohaline current. This has happened in the pst in earths history and lasted for 1000 years causing extreme weather and temperature increases/decreases across the globe and when it happens it happens and there is nothing you can do about it. </p>

<p>Here is a study the department of defense did in 2003 about abrupt climate change (<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/an-abrupt-climate-change-scena/">http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/an-abrupt-climate-change-scena/</a>). Full doc is linked there. </p>

<p>Their recommendation, that the us build a wall on the Mexico border to strengthen borders and block large scale migration from our neighbors to the south. </p>

<p>Think about it, if we are past the point of no return on climate change and the thermohaline current stopping maybe that&#39;s why he is shutting down agencies that put regulations on companies and we are focusing on the Dakota pipeline. If this is the case they could never tell us the true reason or there would be mass panic, better to have everyone hate your policy choices than to have chaos erupt. </p>

<p>FDR signed an Executive Order that gave the Federal Reserve System the power to literally &quot;enslave&quot; Americans into forced labor when the U.S. government can no longer pay on the national debt. When Nixon gave the &quot;death blow&quot;  to what remained of the gold standard, he too signed an order giving the Federal Reserve even more power to force Americans to work to pay on the national debt. I am worried about the millions of Americans who have student loan debt. They can&#39;t go bankrupt on their debt, and Obama turned the student loans collection over to the IRS. These Americans will be forced into labor camps. </p>

<p>Read the link below. In 1933, with FDR&#39;s Executive Order, &quot;the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets <strong>and labor of their &quot;subjects,&quot;</strong> the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, FDR sold Americans into &quot;forced labor&quot; from the time they are born.</p>

<p>This would never happen. They can already garnish wages of people who don&#39;t pay their student loans, so why would they need to put them in camps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that the end of the world would happen. During the Great Depression, 40% of Americans were out of work. The end of the world didn&#39;t happen then. Just think of the coming &quot;collapse&quot; as a major &quot;correction&quot;. It will be very bad and wipe out millions of people, but it will be a correction. If what I posted &quot;could never happen&quot;, why did the U.S. government give the Federal Reserve such power in the first place? For &quot;re-assurance&quot; purposes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you feel that way? FDR forced innocent Japanese Americans into concentration camps during WW2, and after the war, these people were never compensated for all of their property and assets that the government had taken from them. There is an old saying we have in Yiddish about people. It translates: &quot;Throughout history, people have not changed. They won&#39;t change. It will always be the same faces with different names&quot;.</p>

<p>I would like to believe that the U.S. government will not resort to actions against American citizens that would be harmful if the economy takes a turn for the worse. But powerful people will do whatever it takes to hold onto their power; regardless of what country it may be. That would include the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wall in the end will be used to keep Americans inside. The Mexicans are not the ones who&#39;ll be &quot;pouring in&quot;. The engineered economic chaos will produce hordes of American refugees fleeing the cities and migrating south.</p>

<p>This will fail IMO because so many Americans would rather live in conscience than live. That&#39;s what makes America exceptional btw.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t personally share the view that climate change will produce such a drastic choc in the short/medium term. (Unless a extinction-event meteorite or something hits Earth). If it exists, its effects are gradual. An economic shock however is much more likely in the fairly immediate future. So we&#39;re talking about 2 different time scales. Where do you go if you live in LA or SD and the economic system implodes and the city turns to chaos?

<p>They have shut down one of the ports on the border for the last 3 weeks due to the Mexican protests.  I think with a surge of people coming from CA, they would shut down both ports and not anyone leave. </p>

<p>You could head north, or to AZ or NV, but again, there are only a handful of freeways that leave the state.  If we had a massive earthquake in CA and there was a giant exodus to leave, they could easily regulate the freeways and meter people in and out of the state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &quot;wall&quot; has been in place for decades. A new wall might takes decades to complete. Trump is giving everyone topics for discussion. I mean, everyone. It might be interesting to find out what is actually happening at the same time that we all speak of his Trumpiness&#39; follies. In Mexico, heavy duty infrastructure changes have happened since Peña Nieto came to power. But what do mexicans speak about? Peña Nieto&#39;s perfect hair, his public speaking difficulties and his telenovela wife. Literally all distracted by the Political Telenovela that they are feeding the nation. Specially the women that think that he is really cute. Trump might do the same thing. We all speak about him. But surely something must be happening that we are not supposed to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The discussion about a wall on the Mexican/U.S. border was simply a way to encourage racist voters to show up and vote Republican.</p>

<p>It really is mainly about racism for Republicans, as a majority of American policies aren&#39;t really affecting Left vs. Right, rather Wealthy vs. Impoverished.  </p>

<p>So, given that the overall policies of the two major American political parties are quite similar through the lens of wealth, one of the few main differences between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats openly denounce racism, while Republicans have many viewpoints which bolster racist sentiments and policies which harm people of color to a disproportionate degree.</p>
