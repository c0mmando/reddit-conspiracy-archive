<p>The MSM will continue to spread disinformation, hatred, and biased opinions as facts while using their power to cover up and discredit dissenting opinions. Anything is possible, try to keep and open mind, you are on conspiracy. Shit nobody believed could happen happens, look at Jimmy Saville for Christ sakes, Roman Polanski...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not on a speaker box and handing out pamphlets about pizzagate, I won&#39;t be doing anything to further the researchers cause, but I find the level of suppression fascinating and it makes me take another look whether it&#39;s false or otherwise... humans have proven to be capable of far worse crimes over and over </p>

<p>There are approximately 20 to 30 million slaves in the world today. According to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year, of which 80% are female and half are children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you said not to follow the links, but that made me question why you put them up in the first place. Nowhere, anywhere, even a little bit, is there talk of pedophilia accusations. And any accusations of Slavery or Sweatshop conditions are crazily exaggerated.</p>

<p>The first wikipedia link details how Chipotle&#39;s made a deal with that workers group years ago. Looking at further stories, it looks like they&#39;ve joined the CIW&#39;s Fair Food program to great aplomb. I don&#39;t really see an issue here; they were told through peaceful protest that issues were arising, and stepped up to stop those issues. No slavery, and certainly no pedo stuff. This is actually a great link to support Chipotle, rather than indict them; you might want to remove it from your list. </p>

<p>Labornotes seems to have some of its information wrong; new workers at Chipotle, at the most baseline starting benefits, get around $10.50 and two weeks vacation off the bat. My sourcing on that comes from 2 friends in 2 different states who started off in the &quot;crew&quot; (lowest entry level.) Both are latino/a. Given that, I&#39;d take it off the list too.</p>

<p>The third is made entirely irrelevant by the First, because it&#39;s all about CIW. Again, this is moot, and I have no idea why you put these two in here when they&#39;re so drastically out of date.</p>

<p>The fourth has a laundry list of complaints from former workers, but jesus christ, just because someone says, &quot;They&#39;re practically running a sweatshop operation here!,&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so, because I doubt the complaining kid working at Chipotle also spent a few months in an actual fucking sweatshop just to see how it felt. Using exaggerative language doesn&#39;t make that language accurate.</p>

<p>The fifth suffers the same issue as the fourth; claims of sweatshop labor-like conditions is not equivalent to sweatshop labor conditions. Maybe they just got pissed at their manager and walked out. No follow-up, no context, really shitty excuse for journalism.</p>

<p>The practices in the 6th are really shitty, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they don&#39;t equate to slave labor, and they&#39;re not company-wide. This seems like a few managers who liked the feel of a whip in their hand a little too much. That&#39;s human error, not company-wide endorsement of slavery.</p>

<p>The last one&#39;s a vegan blog talking about how eating meat is bad and about how the pigs are slaves. Pigs. Not humans. And you thought this was an indication of slavery and / or pedo activity?</p>

<p>How does any of this help your case? I&#39;m seeing a story of a company that had shitty practices but has gotten better over the last 5-6 years, and still has room to go in quelling inevitable human error / shittiness, but isn&#39;t awash with company practices of promoting either slavery or pedo activity. That means the pages you&#39;ve given me to the story You want me to get are not the ones you need, and you should probably get some new ones.</p>

<p>A fucking vegan blog talking about how pigs are slaves is supposed to make me think there&#39;s a slavery and/or pedo ring in Chipotle?</p>

<p>Sorry. Just. Jesus. That doesn&#39;t help your case at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is also still a VERY intentional design. If it were a circular spiral then no, but a triangle and with the same number of lines. It cannot all be chocked up to confirmation bias. Especially when you consider one of the bands that regularly played at comet ping pong has that symbol predominantly displayed in their music video.</p>

<p>The symbol is known for being a secretive communique and is surrounding these places and people who visit there. If you sincerely argue it is confirmation bias you are either not educated on all of yhe instances of it surrounding these businesses or you are shilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that the original design for Besta pizza doesn&#39;t strongly resemble the symbol, it totally does. I think that a coincidence is possible in that instance(triangle motifs common in pizza places) but I wouldn&#39;t argue more than that. The symbol is certainly used(its significance in True Detective and the message therein is just starting to be understood I think) and it could have been intentional for sure.</p>

<p>But I think it is extremely intellectually dishonest to try and roll up the strong maybe on the Besta pizza logo into two other logos that are laughable reaches. And in doing so in betrays the lack of intellectual rigor and borderline mass hysteria that is the bedrock of pizzagate. </p>

<p>Which is a real shame because elite abuse of children is a thing that actually happens, and all you bozos are doing is distracting from and delegitimizing the whole real-world subject.  This is going to play out like the 1980s satanic ritual abuse thing all over again mark my words.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem, and possibly brilliance here is that it is a relatively common shape/symbol.  Though this doesn&#39;t seem like it would help much in identifying like minded peers (too much risk for misinterpretation I would think?), it does very well to blend in inconspicuously.  Given the allegations it&#39;s certainly worth looking into, but the symbol itself has no weight with me.

<p>All kidding aside Christians used the fish symbol to discretely show their religion without being suspect... 2000 years ago.</p>

Myself and another user pointed out that there was no easy way to do this at the time.

<p>Perhaps the pedos use the heart in heart symbol because of the good humor logo. All those kids licking ice cream gets them going. </p>

<p>there are 1000&#39;s of &quot;a relatively common shape/symbol&quot;</p>

<p>the fact that this TV show chose the pedo symbol (<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">recognized in 2007 by the FBI</a>) for their pedo scene shouldn&#39;t be a shock to anyone.</p>

<p>seriously mate -- stop trying to make all this seem like it&#39;s perfectly normal.  in doing so, you are actively (tho inadvertently, I can only hope) protecting people who rape and murder children.  stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. </p>

<p>My point was that this was known, and derived from <em>real cases</em> or <em>real activities</em> that had been investigated. Symbols inserted into a serious show and all of that <strong>prior to it being known widely by the public</strong> prior to <em>discovery</em> within the Podesta emails. </p>

<p>A timeline is in place.</p>

<p>In November 2007 the Wikileaks published the FBI document:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols</a></p>

<p>Does it help or hurt the public to be made aware of signs and symbols? Does public awareness push the pedos <em>underground</em>? Have there been enough links now tied to the Podesta emails? How much TV are Americans really consuming these days? How much Political News are people really following?</p>

<p>but you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8mBl-Z7ffxE/hqdefault.jpg">this</a> right?  it&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s referencing two preexisting symbols: the Hillary Clinton campaign logo, and pizza.  you still haven&#39;t mentioned what it has to do with the pedophile spiral or even the stacked triangles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point we are into semantics but here goes!</p>

<p>Pizza is part of many email exchanges outside of election banter or politics. It is displayed/used/featured in some disturbing videos, photos, songs, kids sitcoms/movies (where rampant pederasts were/are known to be using and abusing kids) and the <em>secret pizza logo</em> ties into the whole PIE. It&#39;s in pseudo <em>military</em> freaks (of Black Water fame!) lingo all captured in emails. Do they mean arms, ammunition? Perhaps. My gut turns to think so many victims of this level abuse would be better off dead and that rips at ones core. If you&#39;ve not seen &quot;Whistle Blower&quot; you might check it out.</p>

<p>When this nasty personal journey began, we weren&#39;t looking for symbols or pizza - the scope was photo evidence of my nieces known <em>birth marks</em>. Back in the late &#39;90&#39;s we didn&#39;t know there were clues that the FBI might have had clear back then! That LEO&#39;s and CPS might have fully known about. We were flying blind!</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about left/right politics! </p>

<p>Put all of them into a State of The Union setting but all mixed around in the Chamber seating...now, picture a blindfolded cluster of Victims on the floor, scattered in the aisles, hand them each a dart - chances are pretty good they will all hit an abuser of We The People. IMHO. An exaggerated example? yes.</p>

<p>That is indeed how poorly I rate the Leaders we&#39;ve elected. The Fourth Estate that partakes, lies and covers are equally, if not more guilty. Powerful people that throw weight in disguise come in all shapes, sizes and status.</p>

<p>Turn over every rock, check every detail - did we miss anything? Anything at all? </p>

<p>The FBI and agencies put out an odd request to travelers world wide to take photos of their motel/hotel rooms...Oh! WTF?! Hell can we see any way that this could lead to extreme entrapment? My damned hair was on fire! </p>

<p>Do we know how many kids fell victim to the McGruff campaign for SAFE house placards? It was just a symbol, right? How about the long allure of the Candy Man, the Ice Cream truck? Well parents, people fight what they know something to be a threat!</p>

<p>Simply put, an immature thinker walks away and says these fanatics are fucking up my pizza pleasure! They&#39;re whack jobs and upsetting the balance over innocuous symbols! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve attempted to be considerate, thoughtful and inclusive of your over all concerns knowing still we may never agree because semantics.</p>

<p>Ice creams which carry the ‘Specially for Kids’ logo have been developed for children to enjoy as part of a balanced diet and lifestyle.</p>

<p>The logo, in conjunction with explanatory information, was introduced across 38 different kids ice cream products sold in multipacks across 14 countries in Europe and in Turkey in 2013 to help parents in choosing a treat for their children.</p>

<p>In 2014 it will be implemented in Asia and Latin America on the Max and Paddle Pop brands. Max, as it is known in Europe, Turkey and Latin America, or Paddle Pop, as it is known in other parts of the world, is the kids-focussed brand in the Wall’s global ice cream portfolio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise a very important point, one which is debated within the <em>key-board</em> investigative crowd. There are concerns of <em>pushing the pedos underground</em> or causing them to <em>switch-up</em> the symbols.</p>

<p>However, parents started finding the Pedo symbols on toys, clothing and it took off like wildfire - we might hope it saved a lot of innocent children...that we remain diligent if they Switch Tactics!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just occured to me that the spiral is an extremely appropriate symbol for child molesters to use. A spiral is a cycle, a process, a fractal. It draws in, down, and binds tighter. That which is drawn in is twisted and draws in more in turn. A spiral is hungry.</p>

<p>Almost all child molesters were molested as children. The spiral represents the process through which the victim becomes the abuser and symbolizes the cycle which perpetuates this abuse. The spiral is the perfect symbol for this dark and twisted alchemy of the soul.  </p>
