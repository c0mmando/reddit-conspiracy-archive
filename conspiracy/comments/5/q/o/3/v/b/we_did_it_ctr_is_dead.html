       We will.

       They may think they can sweep it all under the rug. They may think their relentless brigading will work. They may think they will continue to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't. It won't work. Light has been shined on this darkness and the light will only grow from here on out. As such, I am quite sure we will witness even more brigading and nonsense in an attempt to stifle progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant and safe folks, the brigading and shit talking about pizzagate is getting worse by the day. Common sense and logic tells me that means we are getting close to busting this open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember; every single day innocent children are being kidnapped, raped, and sacrificed. It is our duty to stop these atrocities.

       American Bridge was the parent organization long before CTR existed. Likely Brock just realized CTR now has a negative connotation (tyt actually brings them up every so often when Brock is involved) and that changing the branding would help obscure them.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brock began his career as a right-wing investigative reporter during the 1990s who wrote the book
        <em>
         The Real Anita Hill
        </em>
        and
        <em>
         the Troopergate story
        </em>
        , which led to Paula Jones filing a lawsuit against Bill Clinton.
        <strong>
         In the late 1990s he switched sides
        </strong>
        , aligning himself with the Democratic Party, and in particular with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

       In the brigaded thread, every time CTR was brought up some dumb fucking response like "The election is over, CTR doesn't exist." Or this gem. "Clinton doesn't even matter anymore, her political career is over."

       I DONT GIVE A FUCK THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER. She is a fucking CRIMINAL. Just cause she failed to fully cheat her way into the whitehouse doesn't mean it's over. Fuck that bitch. We should send a message to all current politicians and future scum bags.

       Nah brah. This is the USA. Land of the free. My conscious is clean knowing i didn't vote for any of these dumb fucks. You seem to have mild dem syndrome. Keep spinning the tires and pointing the other finger instead of self reflection. What credibility does the dem base have? Senate majority? Nope. House majority? Nope. POTUS? Nope. Maybe rigging the primaries and forcing the definition of Corrupt political whore VS reality show douche bag wasn't the best idea. The dem party is done. No shred of credibility left.

       Primaries weren't rigged, and it's berniebros lack of self reflection and the hacking of the general election that put the reality show host in the white house.  The dems lost the house and the senate in '02 and won them all back in '08.  By 2020 most berniebros will have grown up and gotten over themselves, not to mention changing demographics strongly favor the dems.  Berniebros had their day in the sun but it's over.  They are responsible for the next four years whether they are self-aware enough to admit it or not.

How the fuck do you think they are going to come back when kids don't even pay attention to the media? These kids don't even watch TV none the less CNN. And here you are on Reddit (a community consisted mostly of young dudes) touting "history". LMAO I don't give a fuck about political history, Donald Fucking Trump was able to buy the president of the United States. This game isn't politics anymore.

       Who said anything about Biden?  There are plenty of other centrist
      </p>
      <p>
       Dems won under 30 voters by 18 points.  Voters over 70 voted republican by a margin of 60-40, so simple demographics change the result of last year's  extremely close election to a democrat win in four years with everything else being equal.  That and berniebros growing up and getting jobs will swing the vote even further to the dems.  The election of Trump has shown that the country is more conservative than people thought, so if anything the dems will shift in that direction, not towards bernieism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you don't "give a fuck about history" is patently obvious which is why you won't learn from it.  Trump buying the presidency is what needs to be exposed if you have any interest in democracy, which I don't think you do.  Enjoy your time in the dustbin of history.

       She was given at least 2 questions in advance. One about the death penalty and one about the Flint water crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, those are only the ones we know about. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more than just those 2, based on what Donna says in this email:

       The title alone implies more than what we've found out about. She specifically states she gets the "
       <strong>
        questions
       </strong>
       " (plural) in advance. "From time to time" itself also implies more than once or twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the title wasn't obvious enough though, she flat out says that she will "send a few more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it doesn't matter if you think the questions sent to her are "obvious" or not. She wasn't sent "By the way, you'll get a question about the death penalty." Besides the fact that the death penalty doesn't always come up, the question she was given was specfic enough to allow fine tuning of the answer in advance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Here's one that worries me about HRC.
       </p>
       <p>
        DEATH PENALTY
       </p>
       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even Donna herself says that it's a question that worries her. Obviously Donna didn't think it was such an obvious question since she emailed it so that they could be prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there are people who completely downplay this is really worrisome to me. Not only did she automatically have an advantage because she's Hillary Clinton, she was given even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       of an advantage over everyone else she debated because of her connections in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do so many people not see this as
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       wrong? She was straight up
       <strong>
        cheating
       </strong>
       ! The shitstorm over her being given questions in advance was
       <em>
        nowhere near
       </em>
       how big it would have been if it were literally any of the other candidates.

       Brock is a weirdo, and likely a pedo.  If he somehow reads this, I challenge him to a duel or boxing match.  Please American Bridge employees, if you trust in him, set this up.  It could be great public publicity if he wins.

       See their motto "holding Republicans accountable" that's why the shills try to turn everything they don't want people talking about into an alt right conspiracy. "t_d really took over here" sound familiar? They want casual lurkers here to associate pizza gate and other conspiracies they don't like with Donald Trump and the alt right. That's why they always include trump in their comments, even if the post didn't involve him. They seem to be here in large numbers currently, I wonder why they decide to bridge now?

       They may think they can sweep it all under the rug. They may think their relentless brigading will work. They may think they will continue to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't. It won't work. Light has been shined on this darkness and the light will only grow from here on out. As such, I am quite sure we will witness even more brigading and nonsense in an attempt to stifle progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant and safe folks, the brigading and shit talking about pizzagate is getting worse by the day. Common sense and logic tells me that means we are getting close to busting this open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember; every single day innocent children are being kidnapped, raped, and sacrificed. It is our duty to stop these atrocities.

       LMAO OKAY BUDDY! BIDENBROS2020! 😂😂😂😂😂 the dem establishment has little to  no support under from people under 45. In 4 years that number will be at 50. How the fuck do you think they are going to come back when kids don't even pay attention to the media? These kids don't even watch TV none the less CNN. And here you are on Reddit (a community consisted mostly of young dudes) touting "history". LMAO I don't give a fuck about political history, Donald Fucking Trump was able to buy the president of the United States. This game isn't politics anymore.

       No. That isn't correct.
      </p>

       She was given at least 2 questions in advance. One about the death penalty and one about the Flint water crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, those are only the ones we know about. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more than just those 2, based on what Donna says in this email:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39807">

       The title alone implies more than what we've found out about. She specifically states she gets the "
       <strong>
        questions
       </strong>
       " (plural) in advance. "From time to time" itself also implies more than once or twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the title wasn't obvious enough though, she flat out says that she will "send a few more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it doesn't matter if you think the questions sent to her are "obvious" or not. She wasn't sent "By the way, you'll get a question about the death penalty." Besides the fact that the death penalty doesn't always come up, the question she was given was specfic enough to allow fine tuning of the answer in advance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here's one that worries me about HRC.
       </p>
       <p>
        DEATH PENALTY
       </p>
       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even Donna herself says that it's a question that worries her. Obviously Donna didn't think it was such an obvious question since she emailed it so that they could be prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there are people who completely downplay this is really worrisome to me. Not only did she automatically have an advantage because she's Hillary Clinton, she was given even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       of an advantage over everyone else she debated because of her connections in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do so many people not see this as
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       wrong? She was straight up
       <strong>
        cheating
       </strong>
       ! The shitstorm over her being given questions in advance was
       <em>
        nowhere near
       </em>
       how big it would have been if it were literally any of the other candidates.
