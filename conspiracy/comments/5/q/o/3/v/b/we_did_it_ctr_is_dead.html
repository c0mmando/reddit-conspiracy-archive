<p>They may think they can sweep it all under the rug. They may think their relentless brigading will work. They may think they will continue to get away with it. </p>

<p>They won&#39;t. It won&#39;t work. Light has been shined on this darkness and the light will only grow from here on out. As such, I am quite sure we will witness even more brigading and nonsense in an attempt to stifle progress. </p>

<p>Stay vigilant and safe folks, the brigading and shit talking about pizzagate is getting worse by the day. Common sense and logic tells me that means we are getting close to busting this open. </p>

<p>Just remember; every single day innocent children are being kidnapped, raped, and sacrificed. It is our duty to stop these atrocities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about Biden?  There are plenty of other centrist</p>

<p>Dems won under 30 voters by 18 points.  Voters over 70 voted republican by a margin of 60-40, so simple demographics change the result of last year&#39;s  extremely close election to a democrat win in four years with everything else being equal.  That and berniebros growing up and getting jobs will swing the vote even further to the dems.  The election of Trump has shown that the country is more conservative than people thought, so if anything the dems will shift in that direction, not towards bernieism.</p>

<p>The fact that you don&#39;t &quot;give a fuck about history&quot; is patently obvious which is why you won&#39;t learn from it.  Trump buying the presidency is what needs to be exposed if you have any interest in democracy, which I don&#39;t think you do.  Enjoy your time in the dustbin of history.</p>

<p>One really obvious question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That isn&#39;t correct.</p>

<p>She was given at least 2 questions in advance. One about the death penalty and one about the Flint water crisis.</p>

<p>Also, those are only the ones we know about. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were more than just those 2, based on what Donna says in this email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39807">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39807</a></p>

<p>The title alone implies more than what we&#39;ve found out about. She specifically states she gets the &quot;<strong>questions</strong>&quot; (plural) in advance. &quot;From time to time&quot; itself also implies more than once or twice.</p>

<p>If the title wasn&#39;t obvious enough though, she flat out says that she will &quot;send a few more.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, it doesn&#39;t matter if you think the questions sent to her are &quot;obvious&quot; or not. She wasn&#39;t sent &quot;By the way, you&#39;ll get a question about the death penalty.&quot; Besides the fact that the death penalty doesn&#39;t always come up, the question she was given was specfic enough to allow fine tuning of the answer in advance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s one that worries me about HRC.</p>

<p>DEATH PENALTY</p>

<p>19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free.

<p>The fact that there are people who completely downplay this is really worrisome to me. Not only did she automatically have an advantage because she&#39;s Hillary Clinton, she was given even <em>more</em> of an advantage over everyone else she debated because of her connections in the media.</p>

<p>How do so many people not see this as <em>very</em> wrong? She was straight up <strong>cheating</strong>! The shitstorm over her being given questions in advance was <em>nowhere near</em> how big it would have been if it were literally any of the other candidates.</p>

<p>She says she gets questions, that doesn&#39;t mean she always gives the questions to anyone.</p>

<p>Also, it doesn&#39;t matter if you think the questions sent to her are &quot;obvious&quot; or not. She wasn&#39;t sent &quot;By the way, you&#39;ll get a question about the death penalty.&quot; Besides the fact that the death penalty doesn&#39;t always come up, the question she was given was specfic enough to allow fine tuning of the answer in advance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqX7t5S4VCA">But that question wasn&#39;t asked. A couple of sentences from it were used in the introduction to the actual question asked by a former death row inmate.</a>  Not to mention the exchange isn&#39;t even CC&#39;d to Clinton herself.   How do you know this was used?</p>

<p>Probably because the information is from hacked emails which is several orders of magnitude <em>more</em> wrong, and the fact that the impact it had on anything was so infinitesimally small that it would generate nothing more than a shrug from anyone but the most spiteful and vindictive Clinton haters.  </p>

They want casual lurkers here to associate pizza gate and other conspiracies they don&#39;t like with Donald Trump and the alt right. That&#39;s why they always include trump in their comments, even if the post didn&#39;t involve him. They seem to be here in large numbers currently, I wonder why they decide to bridge now?</p>

<p>They may think they can sweep it all under the rug. They may think their relentless brigading will work. They may think they will continue to get away with it. </p>

<p>They won&#39;t. It won&#39;t work. Light has been shined on this darkness and the light will only grow from here on out. As such, I am quite sure we will witness even more brigading and nonsense in an attempt to stifle progress. </p>

<p>Stay vigilant and safe folks, the brigading and shit talking about pizzagate is getting worse by the day. Common sense and logic tells me that means we are getting close to busting this open. </p>

<p>Just remember; every single day innocent children are being kidnapped, raped, and sacrificed. It is our duty to stop these atrocities. </p>

And here you are on Reddit (a community consisted mostly of young dudes) touting &quot;history&quot;.

<p>No. That isn&#39;t correct.</p>

<p>She was given at least 2 questions in advance. One about the death penalty and one about the Flint water crisis.</p>

<p>Also, those are only the ones we know about. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were more than just those 2, based on what Donna says in this email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39807">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39807</a></p>
