But don&#39;t get sanctimonious about republican warmongers when democrats from Truman on have all started illegal wars, when Kissinger and his progeny have trampled upon numerous sovereignties, and where your last liberal incumbent has destabilised the Middle East and North Africa in a way that will have ramifications across EMEA for generations. </p>

<p>This is not an argument about whether the left or right should be in charge. It&#39;s about what America&#39;s impact on the world is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So cut the neo liberalism crap? The biggest mistake liberals have made is moving closer to conservatives, you can talk about what the Obama administration got into but that was all extension of the trillion dollar wars Dick Cheney started which were just more extensions of Daddy Bush and Reagan&#39;s wars. And we have the big granddaddy of them all which is Nixon and Kissinger purposefully keeping Vietnam going.</p>

<p>In other words, take it somewhere else, on the arches maybe, with that anti liberal dribble. </p>

<p>Real liberals don&#39;t have segregationist economic systems. Real liberals believe in helping the ill, not charging them more. </p>

<p>Capitalism and neoliberalism and neoconservatism are all sides of the same broken machine. This election has made that now obvious to the whole world. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time your people stepped outside the insular bubble that is US media and culture and started to understand how other countries work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What im just saying is that &quot;conservative&quot; to you as an American is a concept that appears as &quot;stark, raving lunacy&quot; to the rest of the world. Now &quot;liberal&quot; has an equally muddy connotation. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve basically got &quot;failed state&quot; painted all over you. The fact that your markets are thriving is more evidence of a stacked deck; when leaders in the rest of the world do the things Trump is doing, they are painted as despots, but now that he&#39;s the president of the free world your ratings agencies don&#39;t reflect the enormous shit pile that is your current situation? </p>

<p>Your capitalism proves this week that when a man like Trump comes in, and your rights are stripped left and right, and your religious freedom is compromised, the markets approve. </p>

<p>There can be no clearer indication for me, and in sure many millions like me, that the is no longer has any moral authority at the head of the table of nations. </p>

<p>We need new leadership. Europe and the us both prove that the system was always going to fail. Alternatives need to take responsibility for their roles, sharing the burden of not having the us and their resources available. </p>

<p>But we can do it. We&#39;ll see you guys in four years, when you&#39;ve picked someone comprehensible, who doesn&#39;t have a cameo on WWE Wrestling.</p>

I can agree to that though, Dems arnt innocent in this, but that&#39;s not what you said. You claimed the liberals where the whole reason, which is so laughable false I don&#39;t know where to start. Liberals didn&#39;t put Saddam in power, they didn&#39;t fly the Saudis out of America after 911, they didn&#39;t lie about WMDs, they didn&#39;t supply Iraq with mustard gas, they didn&#39;t open CIA Blacksites to torture people, they didn&#39;t arm the mujahideen. Liberals want to be the police men of the middle East, which is dumb, but Republicans have historically wanted to invade and secure the resources for themselves and their corporations. One is much worse than the others.</p>

<p>When a country gets so fucked up like Somali did in the 90s there are people who get driven from their homes by war and have nowhere to go. Maine opened its doors and welcomed a lot of these refuges. Like most refuges they had trouble adapting but now a generation later you go to Portland high school and the Somali kids are just normal high school kids. That&#39;s all they know. </p>

<p>If you support your countries military fucking around in other countries then you should be ready to man up and help the people who get displaced by those conflicts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have pointed this out before to people that are against illegal immigration.  The US, through the CIA, has devastated countries throughout the world.  The CIA helps steal the natural resources, and makes sure that these countries cannot build an infrastructure like we have in the US.  They do not want these countries to consume the natural resources because then US corporations can then make no money.  The CIA was created specifically for this reason.  Look it up.  </p>

<p>It is no surprise that people want to immigrate to the US.  They are not allowed to build the life they want in their home countries.  </p>

<p>Some people in this world are extremely fucking evil, and a lot of them are American.  When do we do something about it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right.  The US does not want them to gather resources and become stronger.  Also, the US wants the profits from those resources.   Chomsky writes quite a bit on this subject.  </p>

<p>It is all spelled out in the historical record.  I am not making anything up or guessing.  After WW2, this plan was written by certain officials who did not see anything wrong with it at that time.  It was perfectly natural for them, so they saw no need to hide it or be discrete.  </p>

<p>Yes, the development of other countries is a huge threat, especially if they try to implement Socialist governments.  The US will undermine any attempt at Socialism because, if it is successful, then people will want it here.  Also, the corporations cannot profit as much from Socialism because there is more money for the people and less money for the corporations.  </p>

<p>Socialism is the same as Communism to these people.  Also, they are Fascists, and Fascists absolutely despise Communists and Socialists.  </p>

<p>Fascists have been in control of the US government for a long time.  With Trump as President, it just becomes more apparent.  With Obama, it was better hidden.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that&#39;s just not happening in Western European countries. Look at Germanys new year debacle over the North Africans. Those people aren&#39;t living in camps, they&#39;re regular  immigrants who refuse to assimilate into the established culture. France and Belgium have had the same problem hence the advent of the recent increase in terrorism. A lot of Muslim immigrants (not all obviously) move to western countries to take advantage of government benefits but refuse to assimilate making them unemployable leading to groups forming impoverished ghettos where resentment fosters leading to rise in criminal activity from these groups. I&#39;m all for helping refugees but there are Muslim people not willing to meet halfway to make the transition plain and simple.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where you get your news, but as I not only happen to live in Germany but also work with refugees, I can tell you, that your description is overall pretty false or at least extremely misleading. Is there some welfare abuse? With several thousand people, of course there is. Are there problems with integration or crimes committed by refugees (or immigrants or however you want to classify them)? Again, sure. With several thousand people, of course there is. But for one, investigations show time and again that if anything, the percentage of refugees and immigrants commit ting crimes or abusing the welfare system is less than that of our own population - overall lowering the rate. It is still an increase in absolute numbers of course, but - and again, actual fact-oriented studies and experiences show this consistantly - if you let the refugees/immigrants participate so that they have a stake in their host society AND a sense of future, they contribute to the economic development and social cohesion of society more than they cost. They create small businesses, create jobs, add to the domestic market, and decrease the pressure on health care and retirement funding. However - and that is unfortunately still the case in Germany and many European countries - if you tie them down in red tape, keep them from shaping their own lives and having a stake in the future - you produce more costs and make integration harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the USA allowed 85,000 refugees to enter the country in 2016 (about half of which were Muslims, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the State Department&#39;s Refugee Processing Center). At that time the USA had a population of about 320 million people. That makes the immigration through refugees one of less than 0.025 percent. Hardly even in the vicinity of &quot;mass immigration&quot;. Also overall immigration (including illegal immigration from Mexico) has been negative in the last years, with more people leaving the country than entering. The numbers simply do not support the &quot;feeling&quot; of being swamped in foreigners. (Also, oddly the feeling of being overwhelmed by immigrants has a negative correlation to the proportion of foreigners actually encountered by people, and that is true on both sides of the Atlantic. In other words, the <em>less</em> foreigners people have around in their communities the higher they estimate the threat from foreigners. No clue why, but it holds true in Germany, the UK, the US, France, etc.)</p>

That phrase bothers me, as it is a struggle now for taxpayers to support the education system.

In what ways do you see being able to fund this &quot; decent education&quot;?  I live in a state now where we had to close public parks, art and music is brought into schools on a volunteer basis, and credit is exhausted.  The opportunity for scholarship is low.  College savings is a great thought to entertain for my kids, but i pay weekly to the school to fundraise for supplies that the school is in desperate need of..I want everyone to have a shot at bettering their lives, please don&#39;t get me wrong....

    <div class="md"><p>I... am really at a loss for words. Your argument seems to me like that of, say, a shipping agent complaining about getting new trucks to deliver his goods because more trucks will cost more fuel. A good carrier should make more money of a delivery than his costs, obviously, but can only do so by making necessary payments. Like gas, or repairs, or wages or whatnot. Education is one of the running costs of an industrialised society, but one that pays for itself. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re american and under the strange delusion that colleges <em>cost</em> money to an economy. As someone from a country where education is paid largely through taxes to get educated citizens who can deliver decent work and pay those taxes, let me assure you, that a good education <em>decreases</em> costs and creates more wealth, than keeping people away from it unless they already <em>got</em> the money to pay for it themselves.</p>

<p>in previous years, the soviet union; recently, germany (where i think u/Orvil_Pym resides) and other long-term members of n.a.t.o. seem to be pretty concerned about the russian federation,* hence the near panic regarding president trump&#39;s statements about debtor n.a.t.o. member states needing to contribute more to the common defense to make n.a.t.o. worth the time and resources of the u.s.</p>

<p>As the author says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The fact that anti-Islamic’s make such claims shows their lack of knowledge on Islam, and that they should really study Islam with an open heart rather than visit anti-Islamic sites, and read anti-Islamic books and believe everything they tell you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so every time I quote from the quran you&#39;re going to pull out an Islamic scholar to tell me I&#39;m misinterpreting what is pretty plainly written.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I&#39;m guessing every time I quote Islamic scholars you&#39;re going to be telling me that they aren&#39;t official representatives of the religion.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t worry about my opinion, I am lower than the lowest of animals.  Your &quot;peaceful&quot; god is ensuring all of my ancestors are suffering for the rest of eternity, and when I die I will suffer the same fate.</p>

<p>[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, &quot;I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the fundamentalists don&#39;t give a shit what the scholars say.  They believe the Quran to be the perfect word.  They don&#39;t need some human to interpret the words for them.  The words are what they are.  They read the Quran literally and they read the biography of Mohammad and they read the Hadith and they apply it all to their lives literally.  That&#39;s the problem with religious fundamentalism.. if the fundamentals of your religion are bad then fundamentalism is dangerous.  (And that does go for all religions but right now Islam is the only one that is a problem on a widespread scale).</p>

<p>Studying Islam &quot;with an open heart&quot; is advice that should be taken by Muslims since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law">half of all British Muslims think homosexuality should be illegal</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he can actually read refugee crime statistics, including the staggering rapes and gang rapes where the rapists thought they did nothing wrong.    </p>

<p>...maybe he&#39;s aware of what is actually happening to the countries in Europe that open arms to all refugees? Germany alone should explain the threat.  Maybe he has an understanding of how oppressive sharia law is, how ISIS was formed, etc.  Think Trumps a misogynist?  hang out in a country that is governed by sharia law for a month and tell me that with a straight face.  </p>

<p>Not all refugees are the problem, but we have to err on the side of caution before we let the US become subway gang rape central.  the argument for accepting refugees is: we&#39;re going to increase your crime rate substantially and bring a group 170 times more likely to participate in a rape gang, a group that targets gays, and has been responsible for some very public violent crimes against Americans, but we also have some hard working, law abiding citizens. If you think that makes us terrible, live somewhere else.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t destabilize all the countries, and we certainly didn&#39;t force sharia law beliefs on them, and we didn&#39;t create a rape culture where other muslims do nothing even after knowing the rapes were happening (see U.K.). Eventually metal plate head orphans will get into the US, but it&#39;s obvious right now, taking in all refugees is a recipe for disaster.  </p>

<li>War is money. A lot of money.</li>
<li>To start a war, you need public acceptance to a certain extent. Not 100%, not even 50%. But you need some public backing.</li>
<li>First you need an enemy; Employing/recruiting highly educated people to recruit and rally the less educated, fueling their religious belief. (ie. al-Baghdadi holds a doctorate in education). Effectively creating an enemy to fear - the terrorists. Because just like when the commies were propagandized - they&#39;re posed as the enemy that would kill and harm everyone, not just combatants.

    <div class="md"><p>A lawsuit was brought against trump accusing him of raping a 15 year old. The story broke in november and you only have you bubble to blame for not knowing it. It&#39;s by no means a proven fact though. The lawsuit was dropped supposedly because the plaintiff feared for her life after receiving death threats in response to the suit. The trump-epstein connection is real, but people also lie and make false accusations.</p>

<p>Impeachment has not been seriously discussed because it requires a majority of the house and two thirds of the senate. It can&#39;t happen unless some republican legislators decide that the value of law and order is more important to them than their ideologies or whatever personal benefit they hope to derive from a trump presidency. The lack of an attempted impeachment does not correlate with laws being broken.</p>

<p>Trump - Epstein connection... yes they know each other. Anything else to this that does make the Clintons look much worse in comparison? Does Epstein exclusively associate with pedos? I&#39;m not saying I know the full truth, but do think it should be completely aired out and investigated.</p>

<p>I completely agree that everyone associated with Epstein looks slimy. Believe it or not, I don&#39;t see things as Trump vs Clinton. Trump won. All I want to see is an honest investigation as well.</p>

<p>Impeachment for violation of the emoluments clause because of his refusal to divest his assets. Believe it or not, giving it to your sons and just claiming you won&#39;t talk to them about it is not divestment. That is the only real reason so far. It&#39;s not going anywhere and won&#39;t as long as the political situation remains the same. But with a different looking house/senate composition it could.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to say he should be impeached, just that the lack of impeachment should not imply innocence.</p>

<p>Trump knew Epstein through Mar-a-lago and that&#39;s it.  When he found out what Epstein had done he kicked him out of his club.  Trump fully cooperated with all investigations.  The Rolling Stone (I think) article where Trump said Epstein was a great guy was given years BEFORE Epstein was arrested.</p>

<p>This whole Epstein smokescreen is simply a deflection from the Clintons extremely close and long standing relationship with Epstein.</p>

<p>Your first 2 points are clarifying background information on the quot, and correcting the quote. Your 3rd point is an argument against my quote, in which you extrapolated information I never once said and assumed my stance on an issue which i never once mentioned my stance. I simply asked the poster if It held any weight with him, as this was a belief of our founders, albeit non-legally binding as you did point out. </p>

<p>So a fun recap: He set in motion plans to repeal obamacare... without a replacement, which he claimed to provide, but republicans have had close to 8 years to come up with one and they don&#39;t have JACK SHIT.</p>

<p>He also claimed he&#39;d make Mexico pay for the wall, without for the longest time stating how. Now apparently it&#39;s via tariffs on mexican goods... that&#39;s right, imported goods, not exported goods. This will naturally drive up the prices, because mexican businesses sure as hell don&#39;t want to take the hit. They&#39;ll sell less, but for every unit that does sell, it&#39;ll be the american people paying the difference. Mexican businesses will suffer a lower number of units sold. Source: Economics 101
(protip: Try to think of why the same isn&#39;t being done to american exports. It&#39;s because that would hurt american businesses, which are more important than american consumers.)</p>

<p>And lastly, in an blatant and transparent move, Trump blocked off immigration from pretty much the entire middle east... except for countries he does business in. Gotta keep that free good PR, amirite? No conflicts of interest here, no siree! And we can talk at length about the american citizens who are now locked out of the country.</p>

<p>tl;dr Did Trump do things he promised to do during the first week? Yes. Did he do all of the things he promised? NO. Did he do right by the american people? HELL FUCKING NO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obamacare has not been fully repealed yet. When it does we can critique his replacement or lack thereof. As it is he has stated he will replace it. Is there any reason not to believe him in this instance? What I read was that DHS is reevaluating all residents and refugees coming from a law Obama passed. Are you saying you disagree with obama&#39;s law passed by congress? If so why? </p>

<p>On Mexico. He played the media against Mexico to our ultimate benefit. They cancelled and then he lodged the tariff and then they met and Nieto had to appease Trump. Thats a power play i have no problem with. I think they will end up paying for the wall and the tariff is merely bargaining chip. Ill eat my hat otherwise. This power play sets the stage for all future meetings and likely set the tone for the meetings with Theresa May and Justin Tredeau.</p>

<p>I think you meant greencard holders (not citizens)?being locked out. That is incorrect. That has been fixed. I think DHS was caught unprepared with some folks and fucked up on who was and wasn&#39;t allowed in as reflected in the press.</p>

<p>Do you think any of the countries listed for the temporary ban have adequate screening processes in place to prevent violent islamist from migrating and if so which countries? </p>

<p>Interested in your thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I hope you have a hat that&#39;s good to eat. Mexicans despise Trump, at all levels of the government. At this point I&#39;m even half worried about them dropping trade with the US altogether just to spite Trump. but I&#39;m uninformed. This is merely the way the situation looks to me. (Unrelated but important: The wall will cost shit tons of money and not help. At all. Also fuck up the environment.)</p>

<p>I meant greencard holders and dual citizens. Apparently they are contradicting themselves on that one (And when is Team Trump not contradicting themselves?). Friends have since linked me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Fqas7d5MI">this video</a>. Still in the process of watching it. I have to take take breaks because listening to him makes me angry.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that has been what Obama&#39;s Visa Waiver thing was about. It essentially meant that Visa Waiver was not available for those countries, and that a Visa would have to be acquired, which meant further vetting, including an interview. I&#39;d argue it&#39;s largely been successful because <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/immigrants-commit-crimes-us-united-states-born-america-donald-trump-alien-weekly-list-a7548956.html">immigrants are actually less likely to commit crime than citizens</a>. I think that speaks volumes about the process. It is my personal opinion as a German citizen that america&#39;s vetting process is very strict and successful, but that the overall volume of immigrants admitted (perhaps as a result of that vetting?) could be higher.</p>

<p>Thank you for your civility. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but I&#39;m a liberal. I had a rather international childhood, have only good experiences with diversity, and hold empathy-lacking conservatives responsible for the bullshit in this world. With that background, you can understand that I take Hitler personally, as a stain in the history of my country. I don&#39;t really see myself as a patriot, though, nor was I interested in politics before 2016. At the time it seemed like pure policy, and who does what... kinda like what Republicans have to do with Obamacare right now. But apparently some people see racism, sexism, antifeminism and anti-intellectualism as a viable political platform now, so I realized barriers to entry were pretty much as low as they were going to get... anyway, enough of the rambling. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking into politics in my own country. I am moderately satisfied with the way the refugee crisis has turned out; I would have liked the influx delayed until more and better facilities were in place, but can understand that refugees can&#39;t exactly just hold on a second and wait for us to make their beds. I would vote for Merkel or for a more liberal party, but I will definitely vote: Anything to counter the populist racism that is on the rise again. Everything is starting to look like 1933. Like Animal Farm. Like 1984. Like Brave New World. I don&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>As for the rest of my country, I can only offer the following: Nazis were banned, but assholes and neonazis continue to resist. They&#39;re called the AfD, and they have a presence, though it&#39;s not much. Germany&#39;s political party system is quite different from the American one. We don&#39;t have a Winner Takes All. We have several parties, and they form coalitions to secure a majority. Seats are given depending on the percentage of votes received, and who has the majority. You can look it up for more (and probably more accurate) details, but what i am essentially trying to convey is that germany won&#39;t suddenly &quot;flip&quot;. It&#39;s more likely to slowly creep, and that people will have a chance to see the effects of that crap before it gets to that. Though America is proving to be a good/bad example, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>I think that those men should be punished accordingly. I have negative feelings about the fact that those who cannot conduct themselves properly here cannot be sent back to their own countries, because the rule of law here is clear and, while punishment has been given, they will sit in german prisons if they get a sentence. I believe we should help those deserving of help. The innocent. The refugees. If you spit on our hospitality like this, I do not want you here. Not even in our prisons. </p>

<p>I believe that integration into western culture requires a westernized Islam. For me, that means that the law of the host country stands always above the law of the religion, and that your religion should be practiced within the confines of that law. </p>

<p>I am in general against religion having any place in law -- pro separation of church and state. It&#39;s quite obvious that this is where a lot of conflict between Republicans and Muslims comes from: Both want to follow outdated moral and other laws from ancient scriptures that doesn&#39;t reflect modern society, and so see themselves in direct opposition. Since I&#39;m against that, my stance is simple.</p>

<p>So to summarize: If you&#39;re muslim, you can come to germany. Bring your Islam, your beliefs, the objects of your culture, your principles. Do not bring your laws, your prejudice, and your hate. We&#39;ve got our own laws here, and if you want to stay, you will have to obey them. </p>

<p>As for your odd unrelated question about feminism: I believe it is about equality, and I support it. Men and women both stand to gain from the discarding of assigned roles and stereotypes about how men and women should look, act, and think in our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe assimilation is paramount to a cohesive society just like you. </p>

<p>I am very concerned about a &#39;westernized&#39; islam. Is it possible? I can&#39;t say. </p>

<p>All i can do is look at countries that have accepted majority muslim countries to ill effect. There&#39;s a point at which their views can become a majority and your views a minority. </p>

<p>I look at London&#39;s mayor who <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-terrorism-attacks-part-and-parcel-major-cities-new-york-bombing-a7322846.html%3Famp?client=safari">normalizes</a> the violence as a part of living in a major metropolitan area. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a unsettling thing to accept living there.</p>

<p>I asked about feminism specifically because 3rd wave feminism is a different beast. It isn&#39;t about equality. The march on Washington excluded pro life women. They included muslim women speakers that associate with hamas and a women who sodomized a man and killed him. Madonna said the white house should blow up killing Trump. Our Democratic party says white men should shut up and listen to black women. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that political power they seek?</p>

<p>An oppression olympics if you will.</p>

<p>Its like the tenets of ingsoc:

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that integration will be difficult but something we must achieve. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/22/14335292/womens-march-washington-abortion-pro-life-feminists">I think this article is good.</a> In essence, abortions aren&#39;t fun. No sensible is going to skip using contraceptives just because &quot;we can always abort&quot; because it obviously has an impact on the body and causes unnecessary stress etc. People don&#39;t have abortions for fun, or to kill babies. They do it because something went wrong, and they can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to have the child growing inside them. This can be for any reason. Rape? Deformities or sickness that make the fetus unsuitable for life outside the womb? Is it really any of our business? </p>

<p>You must also make the distinction between the women&#39;s march, which aimed to include all women, and feminism, which fights for women&#39;s rights. There&#39;s nothing stopping women from being against women&#39;s rights, but their presence does not somehow invalidate feminism. If an African American a century or two ago was indoctrinated to believe that because of his skin color, he was inferior to white people, and that his people were meant to serve white people, and he went out and said that... would that somehow invalidate the racial equality movement because it doesn&#39;t serve the interests of literally all african americans? Doesn&#39;t that sound fucking stupid to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our Democratic party says white men should shut up and listen to black women. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really a conflation of two arguments. One is that white people should shut up and listen to black people, the other is that men should shut up and listen to women. I believe they deserve to be argued separately. &quot;Men should listen to women&quot; because those who make policy (largely men) are a step removed from abortion, because they&#39;ve never had to (and will never) have to go through one, may not ever have needed one, and don&#39;t deal with women&#39;s issues. They mean men who speak of women&#39;s issues, needs, and desires and speak for them, instead of just, letting them speak. It&#39;s not supposed to be an unconditional thing that should be followed at all times. And it especially concerns those men, those moments when someone thinks they know best what women want (despite what they&#39;re told) and believe they can just &quot;grab them by the pussy&quot;. You know the type. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Bush isn&#39;t responsible for Obama&#39;s shitty economy? </p>

<p>And Clinton had many opportunities to cut the head off of Bin Laden&#39;s crew back in the 90s... The CIA knew where he was at all times. He should had enough reason to especially after the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.</p>

<p>Trump is moving fast to make sure a terrorist attack like that in Paris(which was masterminded by an Isis cell pretending to be refugees) ... Obama&#39;s immigration stance with regards to refugees has been leaky at best. Republicans place blame and so do dems... Regressive leftist are the ones who always claiming victimhood and calling everyone a racist/misogynist/blah blah blah</p>

<p>This is why is 100% support pizzagate - because the CF CGI and other &quot;foundations&quot; are just corrupt horrible horrible ideas.</p>

<p>So, now we have trump fucking shit up big time, and I think it&#39;s going to awaken people to all the shit that was already going on behind the closed doors of politics. So, I want him to fail and awaken people such that these practices are fully exposed and can be taken down.</p>

<p>I am amazed how much he has &quot;accomplished&quot; in just a few days to this end.</p>

<p>People need to be pissed at the entire governmental facade and revolt. So for this, I support the absolutely batshit actions of trump if it means people are finally saying &quot;WTF!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that if Trump &quot;fails&quot;, it means America is impacted across all socioeconomic statuses, right? I&#39;m all for a political awakening or raising corruption awareness, but not to the extent that I want the president to fail at his job of trying to make his country better than the people that have come before him. If anything, people should be hoping that he proves the world wrong, regardless of preconceived notions or ideas, because him doing good and succeeding means America as a country is stronger and better than before. I&#39;m by no means a raging trump supporter, but I&#39;m anti Clinton. He may not be what the popular vote of America wanted, but people wanting him to fail need to remember that him failing impacts all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton would have worked out in their favor but its really odd how they made things seem too obvious with their shilling. There has to be more to this because before Trump the propaganda was kept pretty chill. I don&#39;t believe they were set on duping the public with his aid however they didn&#39;t become trillionaires by being dumb and I&#39;m sure they had their backup plans just in case he won. As far as the loss goes yea its shitty for her but 1B is a drop in the bucket for her donors. I still believe there has to be more to this and there is NO way the elites would have preferred to have a nationalist nation &quot;just cause&quot;. Its always about the big picture but the question is for what in the long term? The whole thing about building up the military sparked off this thought because remember officially we stopped going to war so peacetime military SHOULD be smaller.</p>

<p>As far as the lobbyist thing sure however the Elites are homegrown for the most part so it won&#39;t matter. There are still a shitload of dudes in government that know who the real owners are so things will be worked out in the shadow govs favor. All you need is a few populist statements and gritting of teeth to wow the populace (with maybe a few things done afterwards) to keep them off once the 100 days pass. </p>

<p>As far as draining the swamp you do realize he&#39;s appointed Goldman Sachs folks to his Cabinet. That name should sound familiar because they also appoint people to the Fed and once they finish their term they go back to Goldman. Auditing the Fed - sure - they&#39;ll probably work out something to please the public but no way they&#39;ll ruin the good shit they&#39;ve got going now. Remember that SA is not on the ban list because they are part of the Fed with the petrodollar deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your line of questioning about why SA isn&#39;t on the ban list. It&#39;s also worth nothing that Israel has been working with Saudi Arabia and Qatar to fund ISIS and Al-Nusra in hopes of overthrowing Assad. Assad&#39;s Syria being friendly to Iran serves as Iran&#39;s through point to provide logistical support against Israel in Lebanon. So Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together on that front, and getting that pipeline built through Syria would&#39;ve been a huge blow to Iran as well. I bet Israel had a say in keeping SA off the ban list.</p>

<p>But dude, working at Goldman Sachs at one point doesn&#39;t mean you embody Goldman Sachs. Mnunchin&#39;s whole deal is he wants to get banks lending again and he&#39;s against Dodd-Frank. Being against Dodd-Frank isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. The problem with Dodd-Frank is it prevents lending. Banks hoarded all that bailout money, and Dodd-Frank is part of the reason why there isn&#39;t enough growth investment in the economy right now. It&#39;s all going into financial instruments that benefit the wealthy even more.</p>

<p>Dodd-Frank is an example of outsiders fucking up because they don&#39;t understand the potentially adverse effects of their policies well enough. You can&#39;t have a non-banker try to control commerce / banking. You need a banker that realizes why, where and how banking is fucked up. Trump is also in favor of reinstating Glass-Steagall, which would be an epic swamp drain if he could pull it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is actually a good point. </p>

<p>The biggest thing with refugees is, they somehgow expect the easy life here. Frau merkel invites them, everybody should come, ect. </p>

<p>Hell, they see nothing else in the news. Plus, their coyotes and such tell them, you make it to germany, you can send some of that money home, and pay me off. </p>

<p>Now, lets not get ahead of ourselves. </p>

<p>I am not against refugees in the slightest. But, instead of making uncalled for advertisements , show the real deal. That germany has problems with the refugees, it&#39;s not all, &quot;Frau merkel invites us, you can&#39;t do jack shit to us&quot;, or something. </p>

<p>Show them, we can offer you a roof over your head, and maybe something to at, and come the end of the syrian war you will go back, or we will make you.... </p>

<p>I have not the slightest bit against that. That is what the dedication to human rights demands. That is what you do for a buddy. </p>

<p>Your buddy can allways sleep on the couch, and have some leftover ramen, but it will be a chore. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t tell your buddy, come on over, and stay as long as you like, I will pay your rent, I will pay your food, you jst lean back and get on doing nothing. </p>

<p>You tell your buddy, Listen, you can have my couch, but it will be tight. There will allways be some ramen for you, but my situation is not that good, so I hope you get a job instead of freeloadingf and couch surfing, I know, your situation is tight right now, but we are buddies, so you would do the same for me, but if I catch you wanking off in the GF&#39;s undies again, not only will you break your hand by accident, don&#39;t think you will enter that house again. </p>

<p>The refugees that come back from germany do more to destroy the public image the human trafficers try to create then any publicity campaign. And that is good. </p>

<p>We have gotten rid of the neo nazis, and made our cities safe. we have gotten rid of the people that set refugee camps on fire. We kind of need a deterrent. </p>

<p>And the US? It would be marvellous if we could just write an invoice to the US. US started the war in syria, demands it continues to the point where it is just the way they like it. </p>

<p>Okay. Lets add up everything that the refugees cost, from healthcare to police protection, and lets invoice the US. If they don&#39;t pay, Every single corporation that pays taxes in the US gets 10 % war tax on all imports to europe, untill the war in Syria either has stopped, and we can begin to get the refugees back to their country, or untill the US take in syrian refugees by an european average. </p>

<p>OH, and just for kicks, if the US says a peep to this, throw the US out of the UN for crimes against humanity, and put Russia in the UN. Bing a superpower is one thing, lots of people can do that. If you refuse to behave like one, what do we want with your asses?</p>

<p>This is the main reason why the war in Syria can&#39;t end as long as Assad is in power, there is no way Assad is going to let US Companies take all the money, and no way the US is going to let anyone else (most likely Russia) take it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice master plan but that doesn&#39;t explain why the media is actually hell bent on NOT sending refugees back or even slowing the flow. In parts of Europe to even suggest it might cost you. Further the media has been caught covering up rapes, and human trafficking by Muslim gangs. They are even downplaying terror attacks now. The Orlando shooting is the deadliest in US history but the story was gone in like 2 weeks. This seems to run contrary to what your saying that they want to intentionally stir up nationalist fervor.

<p>Do you people even hear yourselves?   Hey, bud, I&#39;ll ask this plainly: why do people seek refugee status?   Does it have anything to do with militant Islamic extremists beheading and raping people in the streets?   Huh, maybe they should just hide better; I like the civilians who don&#39;t get caught by terrorists.

<p>The US started the war that has been such a catastrophe for US foreign policy and so great for Russia? I&#39;m not saying US foreign policy didn&#39;t play a role in destabilizing the Middle East but assuming what you&#39;re saying is just fucking stupid.</p>

<p>WTF didn I even expect from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Is Trump a leftist now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem, most of those 16 years have been spent trying to fix it. Doesn&#39;t take too long to technically win a war with a middle eastern country. The problem is our failure to understand that those places need an extremist type ruler to keep things stable. I have talked to some Iraqis in my neighborhood that say that Sadam was a psychopath, but things were calm,  there was a peace and understanding that went along with the iron fist. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read similar things about Afghanistan and the Talib and as well. People miss the peace and stability. With us staying over there, we make it worse every time we kill a citizen. Yes most of them are the baddies, but you those baddies are <em>their</em> baddies, and they don&#39;t like us dealing with them. So this can never end, we just keep earning more and more resentment. </p>

<p>But yeah,  now Europe takes the brunt, but let us not forget our &#39;Coalition of the Willing&#39;  we made sure we got their hands dirty too! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some of it but it&#39;s so much more. Our responsibility for the current situation goes back quite a bit further. Everything is a result of decades of policy.</p>

<p>But I will give it this one tiny thing: I don&#39;t know that it would be better in these places had we not armed people in the way that we did. I don&#39;t even know that it would be better for us. We had our reasons, and one just cannot know if our reasons were ultimately justified. We can speculate, we can theorize, but you can never really know what didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Either way, we did it. Suck it up, America, the state of the world is on our hands whether or not we created it with good intentions.</p>

This whole idea that we specifically are morally obligated to take these refugees because it&#39;s our FAULT is just liberal feels. You could argue we have a moral obligation to help refugees because it&#39;s our DUTY as a nation that has the capacity to help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only they could learn from the European settlers who came to steal the land from the natives of North America -- instead of war, we&#39;ll just bring them sickness, slavery, rape, destroy their food source, institutionalize their children, and systematically remove their culture from them while killing and incarcerating the rebels. That&#39;s the &quot;civilized&quot; way to steal land from people. Right?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be duped into thinking we&#39;re any different. Europe tried to colonize the planet on a few occasions. Hitler was just one example of many. Humans are always fighting over land.</p>

<p>This temporary ban does absolutely NOTHING but push moderate Islamists to more extreme beliefs. The few attacks we&#39;ve had in the US have been US citizens of middle-eastern descent -- and not including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on the list makes it a purely symbolic gesture that can only appeal to Trump&#39;s dumbest supporters.</p>

<p>However, on the flip side, if these refugees have ANY idea of what really happened (as how you have noted here today) what possible reactions could you assume they would have?  I can see many of them feeling lost about where to go but not considering the US (the place that caused the problem) as an option at all.  It&#39;s not like immigrants here are being treated like royalty at the moment.</p>

<p>I just think that all of this technology that is causing us to be more aware of what our government is doing, is naturally educating the enemies of our government as well. The dynamic is changing between the US and its refugees, and I feel like that&#39;s why they&#39;re trying to stop them from coming in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA is terrorist nation #1 in the world today.</p>

<p>The level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is so much misinformation and disinformation put out by the corporate media.</p>

<p>However, in the age of the internet, ignorance is a choice.</p>

<p>&quot;The USA is terrorist nation #1&quot; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-USA-is-terrorist-nation-1/189645587773074">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-USA-is-terrorist-nation-1/189645587773074</a></p>

<p>Ever since at least 1980, We the People of planet Earth have had the capability of providing the highest quality of food, the highest quality of clothing, the highest quality of shelter, the highest quality of healthcare, and the highest quality of education for each and every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth, and to do it in such a way that was in Harmony with Nature.</p>

<p>We already have gazillions of creative practical solutions that have not been implemented yet on a grand scale around the world.</p>

<p>What we don’t have here in the USA is at least 150 million well-informed individuals, free of disinformation and misinformation, who are ready, willing and able to actively participate in the political process to make sure that the Presidency and at least 2/3 of the Congress is made up of the most Loving and the most Wise among us, who would implement those solutions on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Then we would have an environment in which we can more easily transition to a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.</p>

<p>i am waking up and mentoring around 10 new uninformed/misinformed individuals every week. It&#39;s imperative that each and every one of us, without exception, does so too.</p>

<p>Here is my proposal:</p>

<p>First the cities, then the states, then the nation and then the world.</p>

<p>Creating a Wonderful World. (let&#39;s get it done already).

Those people aren&#39;t living in camps, they&#39;re regular  immigrants who refuse to assimilate into the established culture. France and Belgium have had the same problem hence the advent of the recent increase in terrorism. A lot of Muslim immigrants (not all obviously) move to western countries to take advantage of government benefits but refuse to assimilate making them unemployable leading to groups forming impoverished ghettos where resentment fosters leading to rise in criminal activity from these groups. I&#39;m all for helping refugees but there are Muslim people not willing to meet halfway to make the transition plain and simple.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to people who immigrate here and don&#39;t actively seek citizenship?  You say &quot;let them have a decent education&quot;.... That phrase bothers me, as it is a struggle now for taxpayers to support the education system.  Americans carry a huge burden currently trying to get their kids decently through public school, not to mention college.  In what ways do you see being able to fund this &quot; decent education&quot;?  I live in a state now where we had to close public parks, art and music is brought into schools on a volunteer basis, and credit is exhausted.  The opportunity for scholarship is low.  College savings is a great thought to entertain for my kids, but i pay weekly to the school to fundraise for supplies that the school is in desperate need of..I want everyone to have a shot at bettering their lives, please don&#39;t get me wrong....  But we cannot provide this until we have determined a solution.  Otherwise, it will continue in the downward spiral that has been escalating for years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your line of questioning about why SA isn&#39;t on the ban list. It&#39;s also worth nothing that Israel has been working with Saudi Arabia and Qatar to fund ISIS and Al-Nusra in hopes of overthrowing Assad. Assad&#39;s Syria being friendly to Iran serves as Iran&#39;s through point to provide logistical support against Israel in Lebanon. So Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together on that front, and getting that pipeline built through Syria would&#39;ve been a huge blow to Iran as well. I bet Israel had a say in keeping SA off the ban list.</p>

<p>But dude, working at Goldman Sachs at one point doesn&#39;t mean you embody Goldman Sachs. Mnunchin&#39;s whole deal is he wants to get banks lending again and he&#39;s against Dodd-Frank. Being against Dodd-Frank isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. The problem with Dodd-Frank is it prevents lending. Banks hoarded all that bailout money, and Dodd-Frank is part of the reason why there isn&#39;t enough growth investment in the economy right now. It&#39;s all going into financial instruments that benefit the wealthy even more.</p>

<p>Dodd-Frank is an example of outsiders fucking up because they don&#39;t understand the potentially adverse effects of their policies well enough. You can&#39;t have a non-banker try to control commerce / banking. You need a banker that realizes why, where and how banking is fucked up. Trump is also in favor of reinstating Glass-Steagall, which would be an epic swamp drain if he could pull it off.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s an arrogant fuck that wants to prove he&#39;s <em>better</em> than the previous elite running our country for decades, the people might still win. They might lose even harder too, but hey, at least we get to roll a dice instead of slowly march to our demise.</p>
