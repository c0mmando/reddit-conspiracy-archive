<p>George Webb has a great series where he&#39;s figured out what&#39;s actually going on.  This is part 8 of &quot;cliff notes&quot; on George Webb&#39;s video series. This is my attempt to drink from the firehose of George Webb&#39;s material by taking notes on it.  </p>

<li>A lot of the swamp creatures are still there and so the story continues</li>
<li>Google &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and &quot;george webb&quot; and you&#39;ll get this video</li>
<li>How do we get at the 650k emails to drain the swamp, because if you get them, it drains the swamp.</li>
<li>People in Haiti upset that they only got 2% of donations</li>
<li>George does a big recap using the new Trello board</li>
<li>He has it sorted by:</li>
<li>Braverman slides</li>
<li>DynCorp Haiti</li>
<li>DynCorp Syria</li>
<li>Dyncorp Inportant Persons</li>
<li>DynCorp CFR CCC Petrofac</li>
<li>Books About Private Contractors -- Human Trafficking</li>
<li>Dyncorp - US - FBI -- JTTF</li>
<li>George proposes that Syrian child trafficking is taking them into Turkish [Northern] Cyprus, Nicosea and Island of Malta</li>
<li>The coordinated efforts are planned within one room, the CFR</li>
<li>If you know about the oil, where it&#39;s mined, where the pipelines are going to be, you can predict where the sex trafficking going to be, where the organ harvesting is going to be, that DynCorp is going to do it, and even predict financial events (the example of Genie Energy in Golan Heights).</li>
<li>Heavily sourced &quot;Holistic analysis&quot;, connecting it to the pizzagate and the content of Podesta emails</li>
<li>It seems like they are shopping organs and trying to sell them for campaign contributions</li>
<li>Brownstone operations--CIA agents are given a starter kit with ten thousand and instructions on how to blackmail your way into the government to take it over.</li>
<li>Divide the country, create a buffer zone with the UN and that bufferzone is the sex trafficked area.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>&quot;It&#39;s all one thing&quot; -- cookie cutter</li>
<li>Not just a Hillary thing, it&#39;s a drain the swamp thing</li>
<li>&quot;It&#39;s about control&quot;</li>
<li>Althought Irving, Tx is where Dyncorp is based, it&#39;s really about this spy school in Denver (University of Denver Korbell School International)  -- training people to take control of the police force by pedo blackmail, UN foreign peacekeeper for example, normalize prostitution and ease the corrupted police towards committing statutory rape and child sex trafficking (conflate prostitution with child sex trafficking)</li>
<li>This child trafficking corruption is used to blackmail and extort other high-level police, local politicians, and then the high level government officials</li>
<li>&quot;They don&#39;t wakeup one day and say &quot;oh I want to be a child sex trafficker&quot;&quot; -- get the UN peacekeepers used to getting a new girlfriend every week, rape them for a while, selling the girl</li>
<li>You will get the local population infuriated, they will protest, be put in jail and they will become the organ donors</li>
<li>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s organ harvesting yet in the US, but this JTTF is really a task force against state and local agencies, that if you don&#39;t get onboard with this, the JTTF will intimidate you</li>
<li>They extort the chief of police, then the mayor and then they have control over the police force and it expands out</li>
<li>We need to get the 650,000 Huma emails and drain the swamp because we&#39;re going in a bad direction</li>
<li>I showed yesterday how it looks like they are shopping organs</li>
<li>&quot;It looks like a cabal of people who are interested in living forever...do you need a kidney, a heart...&quot;</li>
<li>Similar thing happened with this &quot;Happy Hearts&quot; in Thailand after the 2004 Tsunami.  The same group of folks Sean Penn and Petra Nemcova<sup><sup><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/11303121/2004-Tsunami-Petra-Nemcova-the-supermodel-who-survived-the-Boxing-Day-tragedy.html">[]</a></sup></sup> toasts themselves and drinks, but only 2% of 3% of the money has come through to the relief group.</li>
<li>George mentions these groups&#39; weird cake art where they are cutting out the organs from the Podesta emails &quot;Spirit cooking&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Podesta &quot;Pam&quot; email talks about collecting for heart and kidney transplant from Pam Fleischaker &quot;Rape Pillage Plunder&quot;&quot;</li>
<li>George talks about his support for Rockefellers because of their meritorious donations and programmes whose fruits he&#39;s seen for himself</li>
<li>Monica Petersen redux</li>
<li>&quot;Where we aren&#39;t doing this Sean penn thing with the champaign, we&#39;re actually exploiting...&quot;</li>
<li>All the spending is in the north [of Haiti].  This is all going to be an annex of Dominican Republic, and here&#39;s your UN peacekeeping zone (((points to the middle, in green))), this is where you have your sex trafficking and organ harvesting. And down here in the swelter is going to be (((organ))) mined for political protesters, and exploited for microsharking.</li>
<li>If you want to join the effort send him a trello invite</li>
<li>0.6% of Haiti quake funding went to actual Haitian organizations</li>
<li>Mirobalais is going to be the funnel point for protesting and their wives will end up with Nepalese UN peacekeepers and they will end up in a bodybag without a heart</li>
<li>I show the repeating pattern--the same thing happened in the Congo and Sudan.  It&#39;s not mechanized labor, it&#39;s foot labor.  Hand to hand to get heavy rocks and carrying those on a backpack for miles.  {{{Did you mention that they are also radioactive? (uranium)}}}</li>

<ul>
<li>George incorrectly refers to this as Day 98 part 3.  Published jan 22, 2017</li>
<li>Focus on CIA tactics that came into the FBI via JTTF, it&#39;s D&amp;D -- diffuse and disrupt.  I&#39;ve been focused on the disrupt (psyops) methods.  I want to talk about the subtle methods.</li>
<li>Diffusion really is separate the person&#39;s boss from the employee and get them (((employee))) to start reporting back to you.  The decisions are made by the handler  or the headquarters.  Insert someone into the org and get them to feed information.</li>
<li>Open Society Foundations -- must be 100 of them or more.  Doctors without Borders for example.  Just to be clear, it&#39;s a lot of great doctors giving their whole life and could be making a lot more money.  But what they do is take a few doctors or even an orderly working the late shift, you get them to start giving information back to you.  This is a long slow process.  They don&#39;t want to be detected so they move slowly. Hospital lists of employees and patients.  The goal is to find out who can be targetted.</li>
<li>Famous example is the dumptruck that hits a car and everyone is near death.  A couple ambulances come and one goes one way, the other goes the other, 30 mi away.  Saying it doesn&#39;t have enough beds or something.  And the misdirected one has the patient that has the donor heart.</li>
<li>George discusses operatives planted into different industries as subverts / provocateurs</li>
<li>The potential pedo blackmail leverage concerns only a few key votes from the Senate Arms committee needed for passing the NDAA (national defense authorization act), or defense contract or some other civilian-rights-destroying bill that enriches the security state</li>
<li>Torture is mainly used for networks, like a pyramid scheme, with 2 operatives and a handler.  Cells of 3.  That way in case someone gets a conscience, the 3 superior positions can shut them down, suppress, silence them; crush them.  If you talk to the press you&#39;re going to end up in an accident.  If you talk you immediately die.</li>
<li>They got Al Capone on tax evasion; {{{they will do the same for Hillary}}}</li>
<li>There are conspiracy theories about torture that it superoxygenates the blood and then they take a transfusion...I don&#39;t see any scientific support or evidence for this</li>
<li>There is some evidence that women who were being tortured and men were in the room getting off on it; so there is some macabe justification.  There&#39;s always a &quot;We / They&quot; narrative to justify the torture.  It&#39;s called the &quot;revenge motive&quot; -- they implant this in their head and then they are able to do all these things.</li>
<li>If you say for example her father wanted to punch out your son at wal mart, then you can justify drugging her and raping her or bugging her dad.</li>
<li>This is right out of the CIA manual</li>
<li>The head of the CIA Allen Dulles was fascinated by this.  He had a macabe fascination with torture.  He would watch flies under a microphone glass and pull the wings off to watch the dialation of the eyes.  Getting dark movies sponsored</li>
<li><em>Sleeping Beauty</em> was supposedly a CIA-sponsored film. The idea of drugging a women that she would somehow find you as prince charming when you had sex with her when she was sleeping and it would bring her alive and bring her awake.  That whole meme they tried.  It ruined full screen animation for 30 yrs.  A little CIA folklore. {{to psychopathologize you}}</li>

<ul>
<li>When you first try to take over the country, you compartmentalize concerns and people in charge of these concerns</li>
<li>All I need is one person on a cruise ship to bring people in for sex-cations (sex vacations)</li>
<li>Talks about a guy with a tophat, who becomes the guy to talk to for sexcations</li>
<li>You go to an orderly and ask them about anyone on the edge of death, we&#39;ll give you 100 dollars to bring them to me; they put a pill over their mouth and they expire on the way to the hospital.  Dead patient arrives, they harvest the organ, put on ice and helicopter to remote Mirabalais</li>
<li>If you compartmentalize this right, you don&#39;t need many people and you don&#39;t need to pay them a lot.</li>
<li>This has been done for thousands of years: put the men in the mines, sell the women and children into slavery; keep the most attractive as sex slaves  {{rome}}</li>
<li>People say &quot;this vast conspiracy&quot; can&#39;t happen, but I just showed it was a four low-level employees</li>
<li>Say you have a fund for Haiti after an earthquake and call it the clintonbush fund {{lol}}, you run that money through a company like Shorebank, you move it in at the beginning of the day and move it out to several other banks, zeroing it out.  Fill it up with something believable, then wipe it out by the end of every day.  So when you see a summary log it looks like nothing is happening, 100M today 102M the next day 103M the next day, etc, but every day each of those is being moved out.  By the time the board members look at the fund, all the money has been processed.  No one looks at the daily transactions.</li>
<li>You could have a thousand good police officers, you only need one.  You can find plenty of people in the police force in Haiti that are willing to take bribes.  They don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and don&#39;t care if you pay them enough</li>
<li>If I wanted to run a radio station to run the revolution in Tunisia, I send a million dollars through the World Bank for a communications grant.  The World Bank is basically a funnel to launder money, no one is asking where this is coming from.  &quot;It&#39;s clean&quot;  No one is going to question the legitimacy of it, because of the notoriety of the bank.</li>

<li>Any time a general is the head of a drug company looking for vaccines, you have to wonder...</li>
<li>You&#39;re going to see the Duke Medical School being involved here</li>
<li>When &quot;the loan is on the phone&quot; that&#39;s a place to look for kidney / organ harvesting</li>
<li>Organ cruises.  People going down to get new kidneys and hearts</li>
<li>And flying organs back to Duke</li>
<li>I have proof, there are bodies in Syria and Libya of bodies with the hearts cut out; and it turns out to be true in Haiti.  I will prove that</li>
<li>650,000 emails, there are 19 email accounts including Hillary&#39;s.  QPQ, evidence destruction, etc.</li>
<li><em>811 Referral</em>, from the 1995  Intelligence Act--to improve communications between intelligence agencies--is the 911 for the IC; specifically when classified information is being sent to a foreign power.</li>
<li>McCullough is the ICIG intelligence community inspector general.  He sends the FBI in July of 2015, an 811 referral, which says in the 300 documents that FBI released last week, that 3 governments have hacked this classified information.  I think it&#39;s going to be all the 650k emails on Anthony Weiner&#39;s server.  1 friendly Israel and 2 hostile China and Russia</li>
<li>Here is Judge Napolitano saying the same thing on  Lou Dobbs&#39; show a week ago.</li>
<li>I believe--through other documents I&#39;ve received--the whole sex thing is fake, like Petraues--it&#39;s a diversion.  Peole say that&#39;s not true, couldn&#39;t be true.  The connection is Ehud Barak.</li>
<li>Ehud Barak is the foreign minister of Israel (George says he&#39;s Mossad).  Information is going to Barak</li>
<li>Barak is cutting out parts they want to hide from Saudi, reselling that massaged info to the Saudis and they cut out what they don&#39;t want to pass on, and reselling their massaged dataset to Qatar</li>
<li>Preet Bhahara you can choose to investigate it or not investigate it.  It&#39;s going to be proven here whether you like it or not.  &lt;&lt;laughs&gt;&gt;  Boyce quote recap</li>
<li><strong>We can also place Barak at Epstein&#39;s island</strong></li>
<li>Bob Maxwell is a superspy for Mossad.  He did all the NATO Brownstones.  His daughter, Ghislaine, worked for Epstein to get the young girls to Epstein&#39;s island.  She went to Hillary&#39;s wedding and so forth.</li>
<li>Bow Maxwell, Marc Rich, Ken Lay, Joe Paterno, all these guys who ran Brownstones are supposedly dead, but I think they&#39;re all in Tel Aviv, that&#39;s my opinion.  I&#39;m  not going to try to prove that.</li>
<li>All the kids that settled can reopen their cases because the government did not disclose that they were involved in these cases.  They are also a defendant if they were involved.</li>
<li><strong><em>When you put Barak at Little St. James island, now Pareet BHAHARA HAS TO GET ALL the cellphone records of EVERYBODY that was in Jeff Epstein&#39;s little black book (((it&#39;s a matter of national security)))</em></strong></li>
<li>This is our national secrets going to Israel, Russia and China</li>
<li>The 19 email accounts is the 811 Referral.  We have to release at least the metadata publicly, right now.  If Trump doesn&#39;t at least know who the people were, the topics were and the dates, then he is flying blind.  He could be sending agents to their deaths.</li>
<li>Not releasing at least the metadata.  And showing them in secret and not publicly is worse yet because now we think Trump is making side-deals and back deals for his own benefit.  This just gets worse if you don&#39;t publish the metadata right now.</li>
<li>We know the people with immunity ((on the 19 list)) won&#39;t be honest with us</li>
<li>For instance if Jack Lew is doing secret treasury slush to fund black ops in Haiti and different countries, we need to know that because we need to stop it.</li>
<li>I&#39;m ready now to name the NGO that I feel--after looking at the other NGOs--is running the paramilitary organ harvesting under the guise of triage operations: it is <strong>Team Rubicon</strong>, and I&#39;ll name the doctor tomorrow</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to impune the whole team.  It&#39;s a subset of the team. They come in at night and do the cleanup.</li>
<li>If you get the heart on ice, you have about 6 hours, an hour otherwise &#39;the golden hour&#39;; people can check my timing.  Kidneys you may have up 24 days.</li>
<li>I&#39;m not making these comments because I dreamt it up.   I&#39;m seeing a video of Dyncorp and White Helmets and can view their activity, correlate it with news articles, people, places, all known.</li>
<li>Peter Kadzik is involved on the PAM email thread with Fleischaker</li>
<li>I believe it is Team Rubicon.  You can sue me if you like but you&#39;re making a big mistake {{it will only call attention to this}}</li>
<li>I believe most of the cholera deaths are actually toxicity deaths from drug trials; the heart doesn&#39;t filter so it&#39;s ok even with that death; that UNICEF is going to be doing the patient populations</li>
<li>Bill Swing is going to be moving folks across the Domincan Republic this land and partition Haiti just like it was done in Congo and Sudan.  This is what is being done with gold mining in Haiti, and that Lukas Lundin is running the operation with Frank Guistra.</li>
<li>Claude D&#39;Estree changed the name of his trafficking center from Cord to Chore  {{common chore?--no child left behind? Got to get them all}}</li>
<li>CIA has these funny &quot;WINK&quot; play on word names like DynCorp is Dying Corp {{{occult mockery}}}</li>
<li>Pug Winokur and his involvement with Enron and that why I think Ken Lay is still alive {{wut}}</li>

<ul>
<li>Military versus Civilian objectives</li>
<li>Soviet union used PNEs 715 times</li>
<li>You can look at the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, 2010 earthquake in Haiti; India, Pakistan (gov&#39;s admit to) draw your own conclusions</li>
<li>You can ram a barge into levees and create a flood in say New Orleans--there are many ways to create a natural disaster</li>
<li>Going to explore <em>Team Rubicon</em>--a play on words--Kissinger&#39;s Red Team - is a marine sniper team on the ground in Haiti 3 days after the earthquake</li>
<li>Peter Thiel -- from Palantir</li>
<li>David Petraeus</li>
<li>Jake Wood</li>
<li>William McNulty</li>
<li>George believes that in those emails between Petraeus and Hillary it&#39;s going to contain Team Rubicon activity; and that it starts in 2010</li>
<li>This is Petraeus&#39;s movie squad, using attractive, square-jawed marines to make movies for the Senate Arms Committee</li>
<li>McNulty worked for DIA and was more of an intelligence guy</li>
<li>They would be helping Haitians during the day but then would run covert ops at night</li>
<li>Petraeus specialized in extractions using incapacitating gas, to go in and &#39;get the sleeping beauty&#39;</li>
<li>Porton Down tested how much Sarin gas could be used before it would kill someone.</li>
<li>Semi-classified they sprayed a coastal English town with Sarin over a period of time, can&#39;t remember the name of it.</li>
<li>Eliminate political opposition</li>
<li>Petraeus changed counterinsurgency where no one is killed -- by building a FOAF network, metadata, by bodysnatching someone, torturing them for info on who they know, wash rinse repeat</li>
<li>{{{George has misspelled/pronounced &quot;Palantir&quot; as &quot;Planatir&quot;.  I doubled checked with google}}}</li>
<li>You don&#39;t send a crack sniper team 3 days after the earthquake ad hoc</li>
<li>Palantir is used to find the opposition leaders to Haiti to kill or kidnap the friendly soldiers, special forces people who question things</li>
<li>Palantir has software for building social networks, they do what I try to do with this series.  They bring in facebook, twitter, etc...it&#39;s part of the TIA total information awareness program, deploy mini satellites that sit close to the ground and scan the deployed quantum dots (chemtrails) and they attach to cars and to people.  If someone had both the red and the green show up, then they were at different places.</li>
<li>Lots of Volunteers for Team Rubicon in Haiti but the core is a crack team.  Dyncorp is going to be more the police force.  The Rubicon is going to get everybody in the first couple of months.  Rubicon is going to be more like the marines; Dyncorp the army.  Says his dad was in Georgia with the army, and the marines were off to the side, so they got &quot;the experience that marines get when they land&quot; (ie: shot up to hell)</li>
<li>Israeli adversarial overkill strategy: you don&#39;t just kill them, you take their organs, sell/rape their kids and wives.  That mentality is no longer needed.  You are safe.  {{You have nuclear weapons you aren&#39;t supposed to have.}}  It ends in blowback.  Go to the Geneva convention, that&#39;s why they wrote it.</li>
<li>Caesar crossed the Rubicon, that&#39;s what the moniker is about.</li>
<li>George discusses military helicopter heart dispersal in the US</li>
<li>This is why these military people commit suicide years later.  They remember the faces of kids and women.  You end up getting PTSD because you have to follow this pattern by your commander, and you&#39;re compartmentalized so you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, but then you find out what you unwittingly participated withini years later--organ harvesting and child sex trafficking for oiligarchs.  People have flashbacks with hollywood movies when they see similar faces.</li>
<li><strong><em>All three of these nations can selectively release certain emails as Donald Trump starts saying certain things</em></strong>, they can release an email, &#39;pardon me hillary here is a tidbit about the yemeni child trafficking we did for you / you did&#39;; {{{and it totally undermines his control and credibility of the US Government, making him look like a silly cuck to all people}}}</li>
<li>Where Netinyahu is coming from on this, is that Obama and Hillary--mainly Hillary--gave 8B of USAID to buy a homeland for the muslim brotherhood right next to Israel in the Sinai pensula, and he pushes back &quot;this is not security for Israel&quot;.  That goes back to the 30 yr friendship that Hillary has with the Egyptians.</li>
<li>George discusses the psychohistorical aspects of Israeli-Arab organ eating</li>
<li>George discusses the Prism system that comes from Palantir system; the quantum dot tracking Palantir system is the nextgen PRISM from Snowden revelations.</li>
<li>Who becomes the enemies?  Terrorists, families, friends, journalists, then you can track all your criminal assets are...it gives them this sense of power, the eye of sauron/god, but there is no moral compass.</li>
<li>This system needs sunshine first--like the church committee hearings--then it needs a moral compass.</li>

<li>Oil and Arms go together because they serve a dual purpose; how international groups decide who can explode PNEs for oil exploration (western powers) and who can&#39;t (India / Pakistan)</li>
<li>DynCorp is really oil/gas and mining police</li>
<li>NSA Synapse model, a mindmap of who they know and what they are doing {{see Mr. Robot}},foaf and foafoaf</li>
<li>Topple with Osprey, then Team Rubicon, then Dyncorp</li>
<li>Based on the quantum dots, they can build a disposition matrix, same as for the drone program--you can see the drone footage as input to Palantir</li>
<li>Going to send dad to the mine, the woman to the sex shop, the kid to Colombia; if he starts acting up at the mine we take his heart to Duke medical</li>
<li>You just kill the journalists, because they tell the truth and they don&#39;t have a network</li>
<li>The quantum dots are being deployed closer to home</li>
<li>Denver / Norad is where they will be tracking everybody via quantum dots</li>
<li>I shouldn&#39;t have said Team Rubicon is doing the organ harvesting; I think I conflated the two when I started talking about Dyncorp and Syria, so I apologize for that.  Rubicon is the mop up squad</li>
<li>The marketing side of the heart business is John Podesta and he&#39;s a big salesman and he&#39;s going to say, &quot;hey have you ever thought about eternal life&quot; (((points to body heart cake)))</li>
<li>There is a [medical] doctor in NY that shares the name Eric Braverman with Eric Braverman, and he&#39;s a very good friend of David Petraeus, he will also be a salesman of organs</li>
<li>Prince Andrew was also on Epstein&#39;s island; and the Dutchess of York was a stringer for Jeffrey&#39;s kids, and you&#39;re going to find her with Eric-Braverman-the-doctor talking about new organ living</li>
<li>He found a link between Anthony Weiner and Ehud Barak, and if [George] knows that, I don&#39;t know why the Southern District Attorny of NY doesn&#39;t know that.  &lt;&lt;&lt;helicopter passes overhead&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>How can Trump move forward, if Israel, China and Russia have these emails and Trump doesn&#39;t?   Or Trumps&#39; been informed in private, but these emails belong to the people of the United State?  You need to at least release the metadata if you have state secrets to fence.</li>

<li>Team Rubicon can take out political dissidents under the cloak of natural disaster, and they go back to Katrina</li>
<li>George connects theology excuse for militarism, as a guise for creating a revenge motive in rural areas</li>
<li>Grange is going to be doing the Gladio programs in the US, if there were an uprising</li>
<li>When there is a natural disaster you have a 2 month window in which you can get rid of your political enemies</li>
<li>It&#39;s terrible to make a serviceman shoot another serviceman who is--for example--investigating sex trafficking</li>
<li>Same thing is going to happen in Chile, and in Katrina</li>
<li>DynCorp is heavily invested in medical technologies--looking at people like cattle</li>
<li>Not a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars, but if you start acting up at the mines, you go to the glue factory</li>
<li>How long before all this comes to pass in the US?</li>
<li>There is a whisper market for stem cells, blood transfusions, organs</li>
<li>Better to rip off the scab</li>
<li>If we don&#39;t publish those emails now, they are going to have so much more impact as time goes on.</li>
