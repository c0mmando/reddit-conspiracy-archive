       If you want to find the butteriest of the buttery comments, follow these steps. These are the comments that the men in black (couldn't resist) do not want you to not see. Follow these steps (for laptops/desktop - not sure how it works on mobile, as I don't use mobile for Reddit):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Navigate to the top right on the screen where your username is
       </li>
       <li>
        Click on "preferences"
       </li>
       <li>
        Scroll down to: "comment options"
       </li>
       <li>
        Look under for this: "show a dagger (â€ ) on comments voted controversial (a controversial comment is one that's been both upvoted and downvoted significantly)" and click that checkbox,
        <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/q6tfjbNz6f26Y/giphy.gif">
         like you're spanking a fine ass
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        Then under that, you will see: "don't show me comments with a score less than". Whatever number is in that box to the right, erase it (leave it blank), to show all comments, no matter what. Reddit hides comments with &lt; ~x amount of upvotes (wonder why)
       </li>
       <li>
        Scroll down, and click save
       </li>
       <li>
        Yeah, buddy... Now you can see all the buttery comments without Reddit hiding shit on you, and shows you a red dagger were it's being hit hard by up/down votes
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also, be sure to always frequent the /new and /controversial queue. This is truly the community, and if you want to be the change you wish to see in the world, participate here. This is where the magic happens ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers all. Love you guys and gals! Keep fighting the good fight!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This post is getting hit hard, why? Hmm.. The game is up, spooks :)

       No interest in what you do in your bedroom... but I'm open to freely discuss what I have done in mine... because living a life with no shame or regret begins with not doing anything to be regretful or ashamed of.

       Okie dokie, thanks for letting others know. Let it be a personal choice, just like if I decide whether to tell you if I'm into Swedish models or Russian.. There is a difference between private individuals and public. There is no shame or anything wrong with not making it known what you vote on or against...

       You should really re-think what you are saying... Humans need privacy, for many reasons. See the 20's and mafia/unions intervening in the "voting" process. Privacy, private property is inherent and Creator given. You either have an agenda or are sorely ignorant.... I don't mean to be mean or anything, you just may be very well ignorantly digging your own grave... Think about it...

       This is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Times of privacy is occasionally necessary for growth. Being private or open should generally be a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       However privacy is a means to an end, it helps or is necessary to get from point a to point b in various circumstances. It is not beneficial in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stand by your views you should stand by them openly. Voluntarily standing by your views (even when you are wrong) begets personal and community intellectual growth.

       Recognizing and voluntarily admitting when you have been wrong is also very important to personal growth. You need to constantly re-evaluate your beliefs in the face of new evidence to properly flourish.

       I have no clue what you are talking about... you sure I'm not Tyler Durden and you are my Narrator? If anyone was to be accused of being my doppleganger it would be you... your use of ellipses is very similar... but I am not ostentatious enough to pull off a quadruple.

       Is there a reason you couldn't type your whole post like a normal person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is that currently how children type.  Because that's how it reads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stupid ass shit added in there was not needed if you were serious about anything you typed.  It looks pathetic is what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically people downvoted you probably because it read like garbage and some are getting tired of those types of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying my history is good, but if you want to complain you only have yourself to blame here.  Look at that shit.  Spanking a fine ass gif?  I don't know how else to explain how pathetic your post is.

       I can't seem to do this. I'm on mobile but I can't find preferences. Also my user name isn't on the right. Also I'm apparently a few donuts short of a dozen so that could be the reason. New as well. Sorry if I'm just too dense, but I liked this.

       There are a bunch of apps. Their app is decent for lurking but not good for contributing imo. It was really buggy still when i tried it last month.

       I'm not gonna go back 100 years for some convoluted analogy... I'm well aware that many humans need privacy... I'm just not one of them... I'm all for private property... and many other things that have the word "private" in them... but I just hate keeping secrets even if they are my own... cause secrets lead to lies... and I fuckin' hate lies.
