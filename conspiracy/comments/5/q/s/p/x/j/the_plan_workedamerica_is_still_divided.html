Democrats or Republicans..it&#39;s the same thing. Now Americans are fighting each other when they should be protesting the bipartisan system of government. Instead we get protesting for a democratic election result. No change, just child&#39;s tantrum. That&#39;s all these protests are. Why don&#39;t they protest how independent candidates aren&#39;t allowed the debate floor. How about they protest the DNC who screwed Bernie out of the nomination. How bout they protest Bush&#39;s ties to the Saudi government and 9/11 involvement. I can think of a million things to protest this corrupt government and this is what we get instead. Pathetic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that keeps people from protesting is simply money.<br/>
People would protest if they could afford it which is why the 99% doesn&#39;t make diddly-squat.<br/>
People are struggling to survive, to pay medical bills, to pay water bills and trying to save something despite not having the luxury of doing that....etc<br/>
There are no jobs which makes keeping the job (where they don&#39;t get paid nearly enough to be described as &quot;comfortable) they have their number one priority. (How many big chain stores just announced their closing after the holidays?)<br/>
So they don&#39;t have money to take a few days off and stand/rage.<br/>
Even if they did have some money most people are a little apprehensive about &quot;standing out&quot; or taking time off when some other desperate person would love to walk right into their spot and probably even &quot;eat&quot; less pay for the security of having that low-paying sh<em>tty job.<br/>
PLUS...say they had the money, the time, a super cool boss that agreed with their motivations for protesting....say that&#39;s all perfect...you know what happens when they do go and protest?<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
We have only to look into our not-so-distant past for proof.<br/>
Look at the completely f</em>cked DNC convention for starters.<br/>
You had a rabid group of organized people that were given false info to keep them from events and from gathering together in large numbers, you had machines to drown out their voices and hired &quot;tools&quot; blocking and assaulting people trying to protest the corrupt system, msm cutting out and away from any protest to show the masses boys 2 men because G<em>D forbid we see anyone not agreeing with establishment B</em>LLSH*T and this is just one of many examples I could name.<br/>
People can&#39;t afford to protest which is why they keep wages so low, keep jobs so limited....money and desperation keep the tptb in power, keeps protests to a minimum and easy to edit out of the msm narrative.</p>
