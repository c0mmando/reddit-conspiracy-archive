<p>It is not new at all to be randomly detained and question before being released into US soil.

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, I tried to explain the difference in sub politics and literally gave up. They have almost all the rights as US citizens but they kinda depend on congress for the validity of the green card, so the gov basically can take it away. Now what people don&#39;t understand is that anyone who steps on US land technically has all those rights anyway, the difference is that the gov can take away their status and ones they deport them or step out of US land they loose all the protections under the constitution. They have a hard time understanding 1) people not on US land are differently treated, 2) a US citizen is always a citizen and no one can change it but for everyone else its subject to change if the gov wants.</p>

<p>They really pissed me off at /politics at one point, I really can&#39;t communicate without those people. They cherry pick anything they want and then argue on things normal people think is common sense while arguing that you need to die ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but given that there are no U.S. Consulates or Embassies at ports of entry to the U.S. it is basic logic to see that anyone outside the country who was on there way back when this went into effect would have have to turn away and go to another country where they could visit a U.S. Consulate or Embassy.</p>

<p>Here is the title from the article:</p>

<p>Green card holders <strong>will need additional screening</strong>: White House</p>

<p>Here is the very first sentence:</p>

<p>U.S. green card holders <strong>will require additional screening</strong></p>

<p>And here is the sentence DIRECTLY AFTER the suspiciously out-of-context quote: &quot;It will bar green card holders,&quot;</p>

<p>Here we go:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It will bar green card holders,&quot; Gillian Christensen, acting Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in an email.</p>

<p><strong>A senior White House official later sought to clarify</strong> the situation, saying green card holders who had left the United States and wanted to return <strong>would have to visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;You will be allowed to re-enter the United States pending a routine re-screening,&quot;</strong> the official said.</p>

<p>You wrote: </p>

<p>&quot;If somebody was in transit to the US and now has to return home...&quot;</p>

<p>And my point is that I don&#39;t believe that people currently in transit are being affected by this. And until I see an actual article about it, I am not going to blindly believe people on reddit pretending to be airport employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually true. Anyone that has a green card or visa and is a citizen of the resent banned countries will not be allowed to come back. This is temporary though, especially for green cards because they already put a mechanism in place to screen the green card people and let them back in.
