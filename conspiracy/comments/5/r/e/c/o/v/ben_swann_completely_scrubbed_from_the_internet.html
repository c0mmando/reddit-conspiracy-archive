<p>I think a major move is going on. My facebook post where I shared his facebook video also disappeared along with the comments under it. Sessions approval is held up? Anyone have any other news or speculation as to what is going on regarding this?</p>

<p>** Edit **  <a href="http://www.cbs46.com/clip/13068403/president-trump-nominates-neil-gorsuch-to-supreme-court">Video from CBS 46 confirming Ben Swann is back on the air. This at least confirms Ben is back on the air as he announced would happen. So it looks like he&#39;s alive, at least as of a few hours ago.</a></p>

Once DOJ is clean and FBI is ready to move he will be back with an exclusive on what has been going on... well not exactly exclusive...

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a link to the post here, but some other users were speculating that this was all to promote a documentary he has been working on. Furthermore, this documentary was the project that was supposedly cancelled after 5 years of work. The pizzagate coverage was simply to get traction on his channel before he released the trailer. The reason all of his SM outlets went black is due to the potential conflict of interest. Ben Swann, employee of CBS, uses CBS news time <em>and</em> viewers to gain traction for his documentary. And if there was an NDA clause in his contract....he has to keep his mouth shut.</p>

<p>Though I am skeptical of this theory because he already had almost 500k followers on his FB which is now gone. I don&#39;t know why you would risk throwing that away to promote a movie that is already going to get pretty good exposure to his fan base. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ben Swann is somebody that put his neck on the line to do his truther series and that pizza gate thing that got shat on by virtually everyone in the MSM.</p>

<p>He cancelled his project and refunded everyone their money. I doubt he has any nefarious plans going on in his head.</p>

<p>Not sure what the hell he&#39;s thinking erasing himself from the net like that, I hope he&#39;s fine and will return soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Praying is essentially manifestation. Manifestation requires belief, unshakeable faith in your intent. For believers I think praying/manifestation does work and could only become more powerful when like-minded people come and &quot;pray&quot; together. For non-believers, their own prayers will not work unless they have a true believer praying along side them. Negativity consumes and often prevails, but it will one day stop winning the battle.</p>

The biggest one will be that this social page will go dark f/n on Tuesday, Feb 1. We&#39;ve been building this project for 6 years and those who have come to know me.. i hope you have also come to trust me.&quot;</p>

<p>If it leads us to think &quot;oh he&#39;s got it under control, he&#39;s going to reveal something big, we can relax&quot; then we&#39;re playing right into their hands.</p>

<p>There is nothing good about him disappearing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question and I can&#39;t give you a 100% answer on it. If he is doing this on his own will, my theory is that he has something big up his sleeve. Whether it be a check mate in this case or him moving onto something bigger like another news organization or project. I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>To preemptively start scrubbing his accounts/internet presence would lead me to believe that:</p>

<p>A) He has a truth bomb somewhere that he&#39;s waiting to drop. Something he knows is going to cause people to try to tear him down at any level and he is trying to prevent a character assassination before he can be publicly discredited.</p>

<p>B) The character assassination has already started and he&#39;s being threatened into silence or given a gag order.</p>

<p>C) He isn&#39;t in control any longer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Well, if I was some big money billionaires that loved raping children, what I would do is have him replaced by a double. It may or may not be easy to silence all the people in his life, but if they had to take a couple of weeks to replace...say with a body double, in order to get all the mannerisms right. Get all the personal information mined, I could probably do it.</p>

<p>Be easier maybe to brainwash him with substantially large amounts of drugs and treatment measures. That would require a couple of weeks off. Zoolander makes fun of that shit, but subtle suggestion is pretty easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dems are doing everything they possibly can to block Trump&#39;s nominees because they know damn well what comes next: the total destruction and implosion of the democratic party!  &quot;Irony&quot; is the understatement of the year when it comes to the fact that the liberal media did its absolute damnedest to finagle things such that Trump would be the eventual Republican nominee, foolishly believing that Hillary ought to at least be able to beat him and win the presidency.  The old saying &quot;be careful what you wish for ... &quot; ought to be emblazoned on their tombstones because their &quot;brilliant strategy&quot; turned out to be their own undoing.  Their strategy is certainly going to be highlighted in the annals of history as one of THE most bone-headed to ever have been conceived.  Did they, per chance, evaluate the IQs of their strategists and go with the ideas proposed by their most idiotic member?  It sure seems so.  No wonder they align themselves with Islamic terrorists!  Such camaraderie between the severely mentally challenged is completely logical, and was entirely predictable, because nowhere else can people feel most at home as they do when associating with like-minded folks.</p>
