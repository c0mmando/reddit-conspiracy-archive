       Speaking as someone who posts almost exclusively on science content, most people don't really respond well to it.

       Aliens are interesting, but after a while you begin to run out of things to say on the topic. Then there's the theory that aliens are a hoax designed to hold up heliocentricity etc.

       I love sciene posts, or even off the wall stuff, shit i even like political posts that are CONSPIRACY, but posting what the hell trump is doing in office, isn't a conspiracy here. And its flooding the feed. It's repulsive. :(

       yeah, the politics posts can sometimes be quite thoughtful.

       I'm fine with the state of affairs in this sub... I get to examine the shills up close... you build up an immunity to them... and get to spot their patterns. They all tend to repeat a lot of very similar topics and talking points. You really get a feel for it when ya get to study them like this.

       On the real, this shit used to not be so damn repetitive. And now its all the time, to say people haven't came here and started posting stuff that wont make it on the front page of T_D or news/ world news. Is a joke.

       into the discussion. I don't like conspiracy discussions getting politically heated either and it isn't fun having trolls from political subs come here for nefarious reasons. But it happens and you deal with it. And guess what, we are living through an extremely political awkward time, arguably like none other in the past. Expect a little dash of politics everywhere you go.

       Why look at posts of political fact or current events, if it bothers you? Again, NOBODY is forcing you to click the link, read the post, and be disgusted. You have the POWER to not click. You can also use the search function, nobody is stopping you. I only said I'm a politically minded person who likes the ability to express my opinion. You could ask the authors of posts you don't like why they post them, that's up to you.

       I know rights it's not hard to skip a post or challenge another. Discussion, give it a chance. If you don't agree try to plant seeds for yoyr reasonable alternative. Even the most hardened left or right should be able to read another viewpoint. Whining because people talk about things is not productive, in hear to learn and teach others.

       Thank you for voicing your opinion, we all need to take a brake from this shit now and then. When you focus on certain aspects of politics it becomes visual for you and you will start seeing only supporters of this and that. We all know about the shills coming in here to disrupt and demotivate, you need a brake.

       Take a couple of months off, don't read anything regarding news or politics and read a good book. Meditate, go for a walk outside while you listen to relaxing music, visit old friends. Never give up hope! :)
