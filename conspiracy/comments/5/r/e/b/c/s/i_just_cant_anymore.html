<p>you must be part of the problem regardless of your intentions. <a href="/u/ninjakick666">/u/ninjakick666</a> is sarcastically mocking your post due to the plethora of exact ones like this in the recent weeks. While it may be rude, you are the one that insists on involving <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> into the discussion. I don&#39;t like conspiracy discussions getting politically heated either and it isn&#39;t fun having trolls from political subs come here for nefarious reasons. But it happens and you deal with it. And guess what, we are living through an extremely political awkward time, arguably like none other in the past. Expect a little dash of politics everywhere you go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know rights it&#39;s not hard to skip a post or challenge another. Discussion, give it a chance. If you don&#39;t agree try to plant seeds for yoyr reasonable alternative. Even the most hardened left or right should be able to read another viewpoint. Whining because people talk about things is not productive, in hear to learn and teach others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got my support, this sub used to be unbiased and viewed both political parties and scumbags. This sub is the canary in the mine. They are testing us.
Beware the government shills are the majority of this sub.
The real conspiracy is that they are controlling all the info we get.</p>

<p>Guaran-fucking-tee that when pizzagate heads towards the republicans and trump, it will just disappear and all these sick people here takikng about saving kids will go to the next planted conspiracy.</p>

<p>Keep your head up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for voicing your opinion, we all need to take a brake from this shit now and then. When you focus on certain aspects of politics it becomes visual for you and you will start seeing only supporters of this and that. We all know about the shills coming in here to disrupt and demotivate, you need a brake. </p>

<p>Take a couple of months off, don&#39;t read anything regarding news or politics and read a good book. Meditate, go for a walk outside while you listen to relaxing music, visit old friends. Never give up hope! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just sucks to see where this place has gone and has become. I mean 5/6 months ago we had lists made of PROVEN conspiracies, and posts that actually had something to do with conspiracies.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s just like folks post here, to get traction to the front page because so many people filter out those subs lately.</p>
