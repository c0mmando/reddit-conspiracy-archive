       I think we can all agree that /conspiracy is being ravaged by vote manipulation, censorship and paid narrative control.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this makes me proud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope they keep trying to sway us. It just adds fuel to the fire in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I witness friends and family members waking up to the MSM's constant parroting of one another every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, thanks /conspiracy for being the true enemy of the media.
      </p>

       You are the fly in their ointment. The monkey in the wrench. The pain in their ass.

       Post "this sub is dead" had 50% up vots had nothing to do with a conspiracy was calling everyone in this sub an idiot and somehow made it to the front page within minutes...

       The exposure is getting very close now you see. The hillary emails that were released and the 650 K emails NOT RELEASED by the NYPD contains so damning information that people will be very shocked about the people who have ruled them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYPD chief says emails contain, child exploitation, sex crimes, perjury, obstruction of justice, money laundering, pay to play...

Within the last 2 days ive had several people start shilling to me in r/hunting a place they had never posted in before ever do to a post about Trump and federal land. The shills are out in full force and not to mention there comments were getting 5-10 up voted within minutes on a sub that has very few users. Stange as fuckif you ask me

       Unfortunately this is nothing new. This has been going on for years now, and I can confirm this as being a mod here previously, at a time when certain other subreddits were targeting this sub with brigades on a daily basis.

       Most people have been conditioned to blindly accept anything they hear or read from the MSM or government without question, and to dismiss anything to the contrary without due consideration. Some do this consciously. Most do not, and can't be blamed for reacting the way they've literally been brainwashed and conditioned to by various societal control mechanisms put in place by TPTB to accomplish just that.

       It's better if people stay away from here. Because, instead of seeing actual conspiracy topics, there's just drama. now I understand, some people don't want to remain low-key because then it doesn't spread the message of all the injustice occurring, but then again, this place is attracting too many questionable figures right now, therefore decreasing the potency of the message(s) being sent out. I don't think you understand how strong people who are determined to engineer an area of the internet can be, how strongly they can overwhelm a place to the point that it's a shell of its former state. There must be a strategy in place to offset this, and it involves much more than posting "there are shills all over this board".
