<p>Unfortunately this is nothing new. This has been going on for years now, and I can confirm this as being a mod here previously, at a time when certain other subreddits were targeting this sub with brigades on a daily basis. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Most people have been conditioned to blindly accept anything they hear or read from the MSM or government without question, and to dismiss anything to the contrary without due consideration. Some do this consciously. Most do not, and can&#39;t be blamed for reacting the way they&#39;ve literally been brainwashed and conditioned to by various societal control mechanisms put in place by TPTB to accomplish just that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s better if people stay away from here. Because, instead of seeing actual conspiracy topics, there&#39;s just drama. now I understand, some people don&#39;t want to remain low-key because then it doesn&#39;t spread the message of all the injustice occurring, but then again, this place is attracting too many questionable figures right now, therefore decreasing the potency of the message(s) being sent out. I don&#39;t think you understand how strong people who are determined to engineer an area of the internet can be, how strongly they can overwhelm a place to the point that it&#39;s a shell of its former state. There must be a strategy in place to offset this, and it involves much more than posting &quot;there are shills all over this board&quot;. </p>
