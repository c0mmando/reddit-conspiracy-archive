        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On 1/31/2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann Resonance has reached frequencies of 36+.</p>

<p>This is a big deal.  In 2014, it was considered anomalous for the frequency to have risen from it&#39;s usual 7.83 frequency to somewhere in the 15-25 levels.</p>

<p>Here is what it looked like in 2014:

<p>And an article discussing how strange this was back in 2014:

<p>Now it is spiking at well over 30 for the past two days. </p>

<p>Then click on &quot;Schumann resonance&quot; on the left.  The site needs to be translated.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances</a>), the Schumann Resonance &quot;are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth&#39;s electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth&#39;s surface and the ionosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>It has long been suspected that human consciousness can impact the magnetic field and create disturbances in it, particularly during moments of high anxiety, tension and passion: <a href="http://sedonanomalies.weebly.com/schumann-resonance.html">http://sedonanomalies.weebly.com/schumann-resonance.html</a></p>

<p>According to the above article, &quot;As human beings we have extraordinary potentials we have hardly begun to study much less understand.  Creative gifts, intuitions, and talents that are unpredictable or emergent may become stabilized in generations to come.  Hopefully, we can learn to understand both our emergence from an essentially electromagnetic environment and facilitate our potential for healing, growth and non-local communication.&quot;</p>

<p>Many have been reporting the feeling that time has been speeding up.  Could the increased frequencies have something to do with this?</p>

<p>People on YouTube are actively discussing these anomalies: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urF_u3DpWw0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urF_u3DpWw0</a></p>

<p>For more info on global consciousness and the &quot;science of interconnectivity,&quot; here&#39;s another good resource: <a href="https://www.heartmath.org/research/global-coherence/">https://www.heartmath.org/research/global-coherence/</a></p>

<p>It includes a link to the Global Consciousness Project (<a href="http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/">http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/</a>), which seems to correlate to the increase in the electromagnetic frequencies in the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>As the previously cited article (<a href="http://www.trinfinity8.com/why-is-earths-schumann-resonance-accelerating/">http://www.trinfinity8.com/why-is-earths-schumann-resonance-accelerating/</a>) states:</p>

<p>&quot;For many years this resonance frequency has hovered at a steady 7.83 Hz with only slight variations. In June 2014 that apparently changed. Monitors at the Russian Space Observing System showed a sudden spike in activity to around 8.5 Hz. Since then, they have recorded days where the Schumann accelerated as fast as 16.5 Hz. (The graph is usually blue with some green, and no white.) At first they thought their equipment was malfunctioning, but later learned the data was accurate. Everyone was asking, what’s causing this intermittent spiking activity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the Earth’s frequency speeding up? Since the Schumann frequency is said to be “in tune” with the human brain’s alpha and theta states, this acceleration may be why it often feels like time has sped up and events and changes in our life are happening more rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These emerging resonances are naturally correlated to human brainwave activity. So this means, we are changing. Many years ago I was trained in EEG Neurofeedback, so I looked at what these accelerated frequencies might be telling us about human evolutionary change. A 7.83 Hz frequency is an alpha/theta state. Relaxed, yet dreamy—sort of a neutral idling state waiting for something to happen. A 8.5 – 16.5 Hz frequency moves one out of the theta range into more of a full calmer alpha state with faster more alert beta frequencies starting to appear. (This correlates with slowly waking up cognitively). Since the Schumann Resonance has had sudden spikes between 12 – 16.5 Hz (see pic’s white areas),  I found this even more interesting. In Neurofeedback, 12-15 Hz is called Sensory-Motor Rhythm frequency (SMR). It is an ideal state of “awakened calm.” Our thought processes are clearer and more focused, yet we are still “in the flow” or “in the know.” In other words, Mother Earth is shifting her vibrational frequency and perhaps so are we. This may be one of many signs that we are AWAKENING.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scientist’s report that the Earth’s magnetic field, which can affect the Schumann Resonance, has been slowly weakening for the past 2,000 years and even more so in the last few years. No one really knows why. I was told by a wise old sage from India that the magnetic field of Earth was put in place by the Ancient Ones to block our primordial memories of our true heritage. This was so that souls could learn from the experience of free-will unhampered by memories of the past. He claimed that the magnetic field changes are now loosening those memory blocks and we are raising our consciousness to greater truth. The veil is lifting. The blinders are coming off. If true, it raises even more intriguing questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever is happening, it’s clear that this acceleration may make you feel more tired, exhausted, dizzy, depressed, and even strange as you raise your own frequencies to be more “in tune” with the New Earth. Adaptation is not always an easy process, but keep in mind it’s all part of your own unique AWAKENING.&quot;</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on what will happen if we maintain spikes of 30+?</p>

<hr/>

<p>2/2/17 update:  we are now in our 3rd straight day of 30+ resonance, and it seems like it is getting more constant / stronger! <a href="http://imgur.com/a/UPAVh">http://imgur.com/a/UPAVh</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree however it was once told to me, when you are 5 years old 1 year is a fifth of your life, when you are 20, 1 year is only a 20th of you life hence relatively a much shorter portion of your life, by the time you 50 a year is only one 50th of your life.....</p>

<p>Breaking it down to months, at 5 years of age 1 month is a 60th of your life, by 20 its a 240th of your life, by 50 it&#39;s a 600th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think that also, but casual conversation with my father and other older people (60s and older), they seemed to start experiencing the acceleration at about the same time I did. Like, the first 40+ years of their life really felt pretty normal, but then things began to go really fast. For me, it was when I was in my late 20s, I really began to notice it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEEP in the basement of a dusty university library in Edinburgh lies a small black box, roughly the size of two cigarette packets side by side, that churns out random numbers in an endless stream. At first glance it is an unremarkable piece of equipment. Encased in metal, it contains at its heart a microchip no more complex than the ones found in modern pocket calculators. But, according to a growing band of top scientists, this box has quite extraordinary powers. It is, they claim, the &#39;eye&#39; of a machine that appears capable of peering into the future and predicting major world events. The machine apparently sensed the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre four hours before they happened - but in the fevered mood of conspiracy theories of the time, the claims were swiftly knocked back by sceptics. But last December, it also appeared to forewarn of the Asian tsunami just before the deep sea earthquake that precipitated the epic tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also an experiment where they had two atomic clocks set to the same time. One stayed on Earth and the other was spun around the Earth several times. </p>

<p>When the other clock returned they found that it was slightly ahead in time. From this they concluded if you travelled far into space and came home, your relative time would be ahead and you could come back and find your whole family dead from old age. </p>

I mean shit we can see auras with cameras, we can see anti matter entities with new telescopes, we have crystals that vibrate at the molecular level while being in a solid state and producing no energy output.... shit is deff getting interesting so dont discount it yet... smoke a little dmt and watch some sacred geometry with an open mind</p>

<p>We can see auras on cameras? Give me a break.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography">Kirlian Photography.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kirlian photography is a collection of photographic techniques used to capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges. It is named after Semyon Kirlian, who, in 1939, accidentally discovered that if an object on a photographic plate is connected to a high-voltage source, an image is produced on the photographic plate.[1] The technique has been variously known as &quot;electrography&quot;, &quot;electrophotography&quot;, &quot;corona discharge photography&quot; (CDP), &quot;bioelectrography&quot;, &quot;gas discharge visualization (GDV)&quot;, &quot;electrophotonic imaging (EPI)&quot;, and, in Russian literature, &quot;Kirlianography&quot;.</p>

<p>Kirlian photography has been the subject of mainstream scientific research, parapsychology research and art. To a large extent, It has been used in alternative medicine research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s debatable that it captures &quot;auras&quot; in the classic sense, however.</p>

But I do not understand the DMT part of your statement. I was referring more to Kirlian photography. But do you see auras after DMT? I never have. But in the days after I have seen some floating objects come into existence and then fade out again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lighting tech here. Street lights, particularly metal halide and high pressure sodium, &#39;cycle&#39; on and off as they get ready to fail. This can happen once every few minutes, which is typically how fast a lot of people walk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s just an insane coincidence that I walked by a light it went out then I crossed the street  and walked past another light and it went out. This was on a cul de sac and these were two out of 50+ lights. I walked back the same route but the opposite direction an hour later and the same exact two lights went out when I walked by them but in the <em>opposite order</em>. How can timers explain that? I&#39;m completely open to what you&#39;re saying but it doesn&#39;t explain this particular experience IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not timers. It is the lights failing. Especially since it&#39;s the same two. Lights tend to have the same life span, so these were likely installed at the same time and failed around the same time. </p>

<p>The lights begin to get too hot as they fail, so instead of becoming balls of fire and exploding (though some do do that) they have built in thermal protections that shut the light off at a certain temperature and then when the cools down again, and the capacitor in light fixture charges, the light refires. This will happen over and over until the light totally fails and is changed. </p>

<p>So, if light A cycles every, say five minutes, and light B cycles every 4, when you walk in one direction you may see light A go off first, then light B, then on your return trip the opposite. </p>

<p>The human mind likes to find patterns in otherwise normal events, but I am an expert in this particular field and I assure you, it is just what those lights do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And like I said, because they do this every few minutes, it is close to the time it takes for a person to walk by them. So people think they are special, but the light just needs changing. </p>

<p>Also, like I said, LED lights do not do this. So as we phase out metal halide and high pressure sodium, we will get a whole lot less of these reports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in that case it sounds like the wiring to that fixture is bad. It depends on the timing of when they installed the LED as well, because the first LED technology they came out with had a high failure rate because of overheating. </p>

<p>If a new fixture died in that same spot, there is likely a short somewhere in the line, or bad LED or combination of that. Further, you literally come across thousands of lights in a day and millions as you go about your life. You brain disregards all of those instances of the lights behaving normally, and sets aside the few times they don&#39;t, as a recognition of a pattern (confirmation bias). </p>

<p>If you were actually giving off some kind of interference, this would happen constantly. The device you are using to communicate with me has lights behind the screen. If it is a computer it has LED lights likely connected to the CPU. You are likely in a room with lights and see tons on your way to work. </p>

<p>If there is something you would see it constantly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, exactly . It&#39;s only from one sensor in SA.</p>

<p>&quot;These daily spectrograms show the activity occurring at the various resonant frequencies from 1 to 50 Hz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Within the spectrogram, the power, or intensity level of <strong>each frequency</strong> is displayed as a color, with yellow being the most intense. <strong>The Schumann resonances appear as the horizontal lines at 7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33 &amp; 39 Hz</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The graphs seem to be showing the harmonics too. So that means you will ALWAYS see something at 7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33 &amp; 39 Hz</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible, I don&#39;t dismiss this, however, I will translate part of one of the pages to illustrate what I mean.</p>

<p>From the origin point, everything was formed. From the initial seed burst heaven and earth, all was consumed by fire, the from the inferno, the fire calmed and formed earth (the element, which seems to refer to initial formation of celestial bodies as we know for example, Earth was indeed a molten block initially). The sky created water that rose and expanded (seems to imply formation of an atmosphere.)</p>

<p>The universe is large indeed, but it all originated from but one point. From this point came the first (no mention of what this first is), from the first came the second (again no mention of what second is), from second came the third, until all you see exists (notice no reference to any creator or anything, it describes spontaneous events).</p>

<p>Thus is how all that is what is known today came into existence. That which was before, is a mystery even to me.</p>

<p>This is a rough translation of part of one of the poems of part 40 of his (Laozi&#39;s) writings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the interesting part is where he says </p>

<p>&quot;That which was before, is a mystery even to me.&quot;</p>

<p>He does not try to claim credit nor does he try to attribute credit. Now, I will also state that classical Chinese mythology indeed has many, many, tales of &quot;how the universe started&quot;. Many of such revolve around a female entity named (Queen Mother of the West) and clay figures which turned into humans. This is entirely in line with say, Greek creationism (which revolves around deities having sex with each other and giving birth to whatever), Roman creationism (which follows the Greeks), then we have Christianity, Judaism and Islam which all attribute things to one &quot;God&quot;.</p>

<p>The common ground with all of these explanations is creationism. Some intelligent will or being with a plan is used to explain. Not to a spontaneous chain of events which has no driving will behind it. Almost everyone started religions to worship something, so that some meaning and or purpose could be established.</p>

<p>Tao, was not a religion initially, it was a school of science and thought (by ancient standards). It became a religion after persecution by the emperors who changed Tao into a religion they could use to further control the populace. This is something most people who read up on Taoism will not be able to tell you. That Tao, at its very origin, was not a religion, or anything even remotely resembling that, unlike what you see today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Laozi&#39;s writings go on to cover what he terms &quot;energy&quot; which is what he claimed everything was made of. The scientific terms of today did not exist so he was unable to give a more clear picture, but I&#39;d translate some of what he wrote to be touching on string theory and quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>As we know, under those two areas of science; once one goes to the subatomic, everything becomes unstable and in constant flux - nothing is solid or tangible anymore; if we look at string theory, then everything is at a constant set state of vibration at some frequency or wavelength. </p>

<p>This is not entirely inconsistent with what OP is claiming, although I do find some of those claims to be pretty BS and pseudo science without sufficient evidence. But I also accept that what we term pseudo science today, may become proven fact tomorrow; a hundred years ago, no one could have imagined we&#39;d have the technology we have today, or the understanding of things we have today. </p>

<p>No I am not, will look into it. </p>

<p>Religion honestly if you ask me, is a load of hogwash, designed to fill a void of knowledge with superstition and general hocus pocus, all for men with no qualitative talents, to elevate themselves above their peers. Back in the day for example, why have to farm if all you have to do is preach rubbish and everyone pays for you? Why have to do any work at all if you live on the alms of everyone? This evolved into controlling others as the person who started the religion basically spun a story; and everyone became desperate for &quot;the next part&quot;, not so dissimilar to today when a good author publishes a book and we all go &quot;sequel please!&quot;. Only they weren&#39;t so civilized back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kayjay, you&#39;re getting downvoted and I don&#39;t know why, but I agree with you and this Schumann resonance thing is filling me with dread, not optimism. </p>

<p>This quote from the article &quot;particularly during moments of high anxiety, tension&quot; caught my eye. With all the hysteria over Trump in the USA, the UK has its own doom porn in the shape of Brexit, mainland Europe is worrying about immigration and Islamification and our MSM is ramping up the hate, fear and confusion. Yes, we&#39;re all immune to it and I&#39;m happy to see that so many of you think this Schumann thing is heralding something good. But we&#39;re in a minority - so many people trust the MSM and believe it and I&#39;m afraid it might be their energy that&#39;s ramping the resonance up and that can&#39;t be good can it? Loosh farming, anyone? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accepting that it would be impossible to &quot;propaganda your way out of a propaganda psywar&quot; gives a person very limited options. One could either commit themselves to educating others, somehow obtain power enough to make changes themselves, or just roll over and accept defeat.</p>

<p>I think that there is value in fighting propaganda with meme&#39;s. Fair trade and the various slogans of the counterculture (turn on, tune in, drop out) would be examples of successful memes (success in their ability to propogate and force a response from TPTB). I don&#39;t think that any of these memes have done much more than propagate though. Fair trade has largely lost its meaning and is a slogan used by all kinds of people with all kinds of different implied meanings, and has been co-opted into a marketing tool.</p>

<p>I think one of the bigger problems is the degree to which the current political narrative has obscured the real central issues. Many of the problems of capitalism are the result of imbalance between the power of ownership and the worker. There are a number of ways to change that dynamic, but the current dialogue doesn&#39;t have time to talk about it. The conversation often gets limited to unions, and then falls largely along traditional political divides. Unions are NOT perfect, just as corruptible as any seat of power, and often the worker does not see or want what is best for the firm. <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/nummi">If you are a 100% pro-union kind of person and knee jerk disagreed, please give this podcast a listen. It&#39;s a fantastic story about a joint factory opened in CA by GM and Toyota.</a></p>

<p>I do personally think that receding power of unions in this country is a bad thing and I anticipate that changing direction as more of the country feels left behind by a smaller portion of very well off. At least I hope so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly do not know. It could be anything, I guess. I did not consciously change any habits at all. I smoke weed pretty much nightly, and one night within the past month or two (I wish I would&#39;ve written down the date) I got the munchies as usual, but I craved fruit and vegetables instead of pop tarts and chips ahoy. And it&#39;s been the same ever since.</p>

<p>I used to eat pizza and fast food as often as I could without feeling guilty. Now I&#39;ll choose raisin bran over fruity pebbles. For apparently no reason. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve felt an incredible amount of mental clarity and &quot;oneness&quot; recently too that I&#39;m confused about. Problems are easier to view inside my head, and therefore easier to solve. My priorities are straight as an arrow. I feel a new kind of love for my wife that I&#39;ve never felt before. I don&#39;t care about stupid shit anymore. I literally feel wiser. The petty bullshit in life takes up zero space in my brain now. </p>

<p>And it all happened just like the flip of a switch. On a day I can&#39;t remember for a reason I&#39;ll probably never know. But I&#39;m not gonna complain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we were smart, we&#39;d restrain ourselves from executing them. We can exploit their self-serving nature. They have a lot of knowledge about what has been going on behind the scenes with ET/ED interactions. There is a way to get them to inform us.</p>

<p>Give them a healthy yet uncomfortable prison cell isolated from their comrades. Then after a month or so, tell them that they can get better conditions if they can give or lead us to sufficient truthful evidence of what has been going on. As they corroborate each other and/or evidence collected corroborates them, we can align and give them better cells.</p>

<p>Killing them is stupid and savage. We should reflect their other attributes back to them. They selfishly exploit others. We should exploit their selfishness for selfless ends, the education of our species. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To kill them would be to participate in the same energy-frequency that they love. Any sign of negative emotion is what they feed off of. So, execution would, somehow, perpetuate their existence.</p>

<p>Their truest form of torture, I really believe, would be for us to hug them, tell them we understand their actions because they exist on a more dense frequency plane and are not as gifted/blessed as we humans, put them in a cell, feed them, clothe them, and kindly ask for their assistance in retelling history all over again from an honest beginning. Not that we can trust them...</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure someone/something will make it known to us what has been going on all this time so that the average man who hasn&#39;t been following all this unknown truth can make sense of it without being overwhelmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are quite understandable. Indeed, they are predictable. The more intelligent among them predict the less intelligent to manipulate and control them.</p>

<p>Sometimes killing is justified, but not if they can be imprisoned. The idea is that beings and also collections of beings in a group want an immune system response to deal with parasitic organisms that seek to diminish them. It is not wrong to kill someone trying to kill you. It&#39;s protection of the self. It would be wrong to slaughter them when they have been rendered defenseless and there is an option of imprisonment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh...according to the SedonaAnomalies article:  &quot;When there is a sudden decrease in geomagnetic activity, there appears to be an enhancement of processes that facilitate psi reception, especially telepathy and clairvoyance. Increases in geomagnetic activity may suppress pineal melatonin levels and contribute to reductions of cortical seizure thresholds. Indeed, melatonin is correlated with temporal lobe- related disorders such as depression and seizures. (Krippner)&quot; 
....soooo isn&#39;t that saying (was just one mention of many in this particular article) that the higher the number the MORE depression, seizures, suppression of the pineal gland, etc...<br/>
or rather - the lower the number the more maybe? &quot;enlightened&quot; responses or effects, the higher the number the worse it is for us?? It also goes on to mention HAARP and how electromagnetic pulses disrupt this effect and can be detrimental to us....doesn&#39;t it??<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the answers, but I&#39;d like to give a brief overview of my reasoning and observations;</p>

<p>Humans live on Earth.</p>

<p>Earth rotates around the Sun.</p>

<p>The Sun revolves around a Black Hole in the centre of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Energy &quot;transfer&quot; flows thus;</p>

<p>Black Hole &gt; Sun &gt; Earth &gt; Humans.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We can thank our physical existence to the Black Hole, as it holds the astronomical bodies in equilibrium.</p>

<p>We can thank our Sun for giving us energy to be alive.</p>

<p>We can thank our Earth for being in a proper distance from the Sun, letting life prosper here.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Earth resonates at a given frequency which correlates with the geometric configuration of the Solar system, which lies within the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Energy resonance on Earth has been stable for a very long time, as electromagnetic energy and Earth&#39;s orbit has been relatively stable for an equal amount of time.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Electromagnetism; the magic element.</p>

<p>It links all phenomena together, from micro to macro.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What factors can cause a change in Schumann Resonance?</p>

<ol>
<li>External factors, like;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>The Solar System is in a new region in space with different resonance and energy patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sun&#39;s output has changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Electromagnetic &quot;pollution&quot; comes from elsewhere - hence this post;</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Can humans cause change in the Schumann resonance of the Earth?</li>
</ol>

<p>-If so, how?</p>

<hr/>

<p>In recent years, humans have acquired technology that emmanates electromagnetic frequencies.</p>

<p>Some devices are small, like mobile phones, remote controls, RFID&#39;s and so on.</p>

<p>Some devices emmanates more EMF, like communication towers; Cellphone towers, Airport Radars, Military Installations, TV-stations, Satellites and so on.</p>

<p>But there is a third set of devices that emmanates incredible amounts of energy; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program">Atmospheric Heaters</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=sky-heaters&amp;amp;layersOff=star-wars,haarp,superdarn,digisonde,elf-vlf,elf-vlf-ref,directed-energy,nexrad,sigmet,tdwr,jss,ioos,npn-wind-radar,madis-wind-radar,aeronet,bsrn,esrl,doris">Here is a tool showing most of them</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Nikola Tesla revealed during his research that electromagnetic forces could be harnessed, and utilized on Earth by humans with the proper knowledge and devices.</p>

<p>But his genius revealed a warning also; If the technology ended up in the wrong hands, it would be the perfect &quot;doomsday weapon&quot;...</p>

<p>Why so?</p>

<p>-Because everything is electromagnetic.</p>

<p>When you control electromagnetism, and can control what frequencies they emmanate at, you can cause changes in atomic structures over vast distances.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/nikola-tesla-father-of-haarp-and-electromagnetic-climate-change-reply/">Here is an excerpt of what&#39;s going on</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Biological effects of EMF are well known, and they are not all that good.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Biological-Effects-Electromagnetic-Fields/dp/0849329523">one book</a> that deals with the issue, and I am still trying to get my hands on it. It is one of the main published works on the topic, and used by the military. But as you can see, it comes with a hefty price tag.</p>

<p>(Search for &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/161-2597701-3716356?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;amp;field-keywords=biological+effects+electromagnetism">Biological Effects Electromagnetism</a>&quot; on Amazon to find similar works.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>There are other works, like <a href="http://www.emfresearch.com/us-nmri-studies/">this booklet</a> by The US Naval Research Institute, published in 1972 (pdf download), that gives an overview of some effects discovered back when.</p>

<p>Here is a small list of biological effects for The Curious;</p>

<p>-Confusion</p>

<p>-Chills</p>

<p>-Cramps/spasms</p>

<p>-Mood change</p>

<p>-Memory loss</p>

<p>-Consciousness alterations (Alteration of brainwaves externally)</p>

<p>-DNA disturbance</p>

<p>-Chills</p>

<p>-Metabolic disturbances</p>

<p>-Inhibition of calcium uptake/distribution in the body</p>

<p>-Fatigue</p>

<p>-Shortness of breath</p>

<p>and much more.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Remember the recent story from Australia regarding a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/thunderstorm-asthma-australia/index.html">thunderstorm that caused an entire population to develop &quot;asthma&quot;</a>?</p>

<p>I think you get the picture.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Atmospheric heaters are something very important to include in your data set if you want to understand the big scale.</p>

<p>They operate at various frequencies, but there are so many on Ear5h now, that effects must be present.</p>

<p>From my perspective, thus far, they must play a direct role in OP&#39;s observations of an elevated Schumann Reconance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I should elaborate further, and give even more sources, but I&#39;m on mobile, and it&#39;s getting late here. Please let me know what you think, and if you have more information and/or sources on the topic, please let me know - it is a field of special interest to me, and I am more than eager to get my hands on more data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We recreate the world with our thoughts everyday, life&#39;s a shared dream organized through different levels of intents, a spiritual game (lucifer experiment). Language is an error in evolution, all our science and shit is made up to abuse our fight and flight response and lock us in a state of permanent complacency. The idea is we never escape the web of thoughts until we die. Probably everything we&#39;ve ever been told is a lie, it&#39;s to create cognitive dissonance so we lose all sense of intuition and allow our minds to be molded. They wanna use google as our only source of information, where we believe google over our own collective consciouness, mandella effect is a made up thing to &quot;read/write&quot; our thoughts. Tavistock&#39;s gotta be hoarding some badass technology we don&#39;t know about. All this predates even our creation of language, I think they used ge·ma·tri·a to create all of our languages completely on duality, to polarize our minds so we never realize our true powers. It&#39;s all possible because of how fast atoms move, space/time can be read/written just like a program, what we see is basically projecting space/time from our third eye through a dense material, our &quot;merkaba&quot; which makes up the context of our environment at any given moment. It&#39;s just like electricity flowing through different densities except space/time instead lol. Anyways I&#39;m pretty high but that&#39;s my take, cheers all, exciting times appear to be ahead.</p>

<p>Also, I &quot;woke up&quot; in 2015 and my mind has been taking in everything like a sponge! I can&#39;t seem to read and research enough on certain subjects! It feels wonderful too!

<p>Examples are the 13 (12+1, the Serpent is missing )signs of the Zodiac, the gods of Greece, the creatures in ancient Egypt, the characters of Norse, Oriental and Indian Mythology, Christianity and it&#39;s angels and Jesus&#39; diciples and much more.</p>

<p>Every culture in history has had their own interpretations of these psychological traits, and often correlated an animal, a fantasy creature and so on to make it symbolically easier to understand the relationships these play in life.</p>

<p>These installations operate mainly in the ELF Band (Extremely Low Frequency), VLF Band (Very ...) radio and KHz band though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between 32 - 100hz is Gamma brain waves.
 Benefits of Gamma</p>

<p>People with very high levels of gamma activity are exceptionally intelligent, compassionate, happy, and have excellent memories and strong self-control. IQ scores of people with high gamma wave activity are correspondingly high.</p>

<p>High gamma activity also corresponds to a state of peak performance. Elite athletes, top-notch musicians and high achievers in all fields produce far more gamma waves than average.</p>

<p>The benefits of producing the gamma frequency are:</p>

<p>Increased memory recall (the 40 Hz frequency is known to regulate memory processing); people with high gamma activity have exceptionally vivid and rapid memory recall.</p>

<p>Increased sensory perception. Senses are heightened when the brain produces gamma waves. Food tastes better; vision and hearing sharpen; sense of smell becomes more powerful; and your brain becomes far more sensitive to all sensory input. This makes for a much richer sensory experience and a better perception of reality.</p>

<p>Increased focus; but this enhanced focus is not necessarily aimed at one individual object or task. In the gamma state, your brain is able to process all sensory information faster and more fully with greater sensitivity; and combine the whole scenario into a highly memorable experience. People with high gamma activity can recall everything about any memorable event – the food they ate, the music they heard, the conversations, the names of people they met, the air temperature, etc.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable properties of the gamma state is the processing speed: the brain is able to process incredible amounts of information very quickly, remember it, and retrieve that memory later.</p>

<p>People with high gamma activity are naturally happier, calmer and more at peace. This is Nature’s best anti-depressant (people suffering from depression typically have very low gamma activity).</p>

<p>Gamma waves are present during REM sleep and visualization.</p>

<p>Compassion comes from a feeling of one-ness with all creation. This is the “feeling of blessings” and ecstasy that accompanies high levels of gamma brainwave activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m betting that in a year and 4 months (around June 2018) it will double to around 64hz. I think it&#39;s a progression that people are calling the quickening were the frequency will double each cycle and each cycle will be half as long as the previous one. So by Feb 2019 we could be in uncharted territory of brain waves around 128hz, then 4 months later in June around 256hz. Two months. August 512hz. Beginning of September 1024hz. Middle of September 2048hz. September 22nd 4096hz, 26th 8192hz, 28th 16384hz, 29th 32768hz. Wouldn&#39;t that be a wild ride? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that is pretty suspect. I only came back to this thread for an update as most of the live streams weren&#39;t showing past 40 yet it was clear that the Schumann frequency was consistently going way past 40 for several days.</p>

<p>Hopefully, they only took it down so that they could update it but this topic generated so much heat it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they took it down permanently so that people wouldn&#39;t have access to this information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if collectively humans could influence these readings. I hate to simplify it this much, but what would happen if a significant portion of the world gave 5-10 minutes dedicated to prayer, meditation, intentional thought... call it what ever you like, on a specific day. Picture &quot;the wave&quot; at a sporting event, globally, with humans setting a positive intention. Would there be a quantifiable difference?</p>
