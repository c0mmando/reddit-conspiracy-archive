    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;conspiracy&quot; is that the media and power structure points at these backwards religious fundamentalists and declares they are the &quot;threat&quot; to freedom, (requiring a multi-trillion dollar unaccountable taxpayer funded global military industrial complex to fight)</p>

<p>While religious supremacist scum from all of the Abrahamic control cults are happy to use violence against their adversaries they are not able to change national policy or monitor all of your electronic communications. They are often utilized by the rogue states as a bogeyman front to forward the will of deep state actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fighting a war against something that isn&#39;t a sovereign nation is actually pretty ingenious when you think about it. TPTB rewrote the playbook with that one. Anyone that has lost everything, their family, their home, their livelihood, and their last resort is to strap a bomb to themselves or point a gun at a soldier, or make a roadside bomb, that rage is tangible. But in the end they&#39;re just another dead terrorist. And we can sweep from country to country <del>looking for them</del> destroying everything in site and no one bats an eye. That 9/11 was so damn believable. I&#39;m sure there are plenty that question it but when you talk back to a country who&#39;s military is equal to the whole worlds x2 and is about to bolster it some more, you know when to stand down.</p>

<p>What can we do anymore? Hope for a quick death? Because if there is a god we are just as much responsible for it than the leaders that pushed it along. Gotta pay them taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I aint buying it. I call out the media daily on FB and people give me backlash for supporting Trump. </p>

<p>Seriously, FUCK Trump for putting my friends and family in tough position with this &quot;Ban&quot;. I am not opposed to the suspension of immigrants from these countries, but violating US constitution by banning Visa and Green Card holders and also not giving Dual Citizens enough time to denounce one of their passports is fucking stupid as fuck.</p>

<p>Fuck the MsM, Fuck the Establishment, and finally Fuck all of Washington and Wall Street. Protests are a good start but protesting the right reason is what we need. Protest the corruption not Trump, protest the injustice served upon humans around the world by the Presidents of America, not Trump.</p>

<p>I am ready for a general strike as well as that is the next evolution of a protest!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seen that and knew it wouldn&#39;t stand, but doesn&#39;t change that he actually did what he did causing panic and also hardship to some people stuck in transit. Sure it was a small number, but fuck that should never have happened.</p>

<p>I agree with a ** temporary** ban on immigrants from &quot;Terrorist Nations&quot; but this is such BS! Saudi not on the list, Qatar, UAE, Pakistan (I&#39;m Pakistani). He pretty much banked on the previous administration. He wants to put a ban on immigrants from &quot;Terrorist Nations&quot; fucking do it right.</p>

<p>My point about the general strike is not to go against Trump but against the shitty system we have in place and the fucking establishment. There are enough people who are now awakening to how fucked shit is and be honest with yourself, Trump aint saving nobody and aint fixing shit. We will continue bombing countries, we will invade more countries, and the common citizen of the world will continue being fucked. </p>

<p>Truly think there is a shift happening overall and media is doing whatever it can to curb this shift as they know it won&#39;t benefit them either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. This Trumpism is happening throughout the Liberty movement. Pro-war against ISIS in the ME (did we forget who is behind 911 and islamism?), pro-Israel (&#39;cuz the UN is against them), pro-military (&#39;cuz we need to be strong to defeat the globalists). Same regurgitation of the old &quot;big government is okay if it&#39;s our guy running the show&quot;.</p>

<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYJR-_ZxOao">surreal Alex Jones / Ron Paul interview.</a> Ron Paul keep making judicious, sceptical comments about Trump, AJ is shilling hard for statism/war. AJ&#39;s concluding comments at the end are epic.</p>

<p>At 23:50 AJ says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s the <strong>man</strong> to do that, and give us the <strong>new american millenium</strong>. Not the new american century. Now that&#39;s the plan. It&#39;s moral. It&#39;s strong. It&#39;s extremely virile, and male. And it&#39;s total America!</p>
