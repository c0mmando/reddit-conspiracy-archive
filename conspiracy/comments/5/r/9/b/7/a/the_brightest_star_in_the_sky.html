It&#39;s in the west. So, I&#39;ve been sort of monitoring that star for quite some time now. And it&#39;s ALWAYS in the same position. Like, ALWAYS. I&#39;ve been watching it every day for like a month and it hasn&#39;t moved. The Moon changes place, the sun change place, the Earth rotates and spins but that star is always in the same position. Why is that? I don&#39;t really have that much knowledge on stars and the skies e.t.c Is that normal? Have you ever noticed the start I&#39;m talking about? </p>

<p>I&#39;m always so fascinated when I see a bright star and it turns out to be Mars, Saturn, Venus, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, but the &#39;north star&#39; now would actually have been a different star then, because of the precessional movement of earth on its axis. Here is a quick explanation from NASA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North remains north regardless of which star marks it, the rest of the sky, however, changes over a period of thousands of years. If you were to stand on the Sphinx&#39;s head 8000 years ago and looked due east you would have seen a completely different constellation to the one you will see today. The pyramids and Sphinx are arguably aligned to how the sky looked thousands of years before the generally accepted date for their construction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not noticed it. I live in Houston, Tx, where the light pollution is so strong that we are lucky to see more than 7 stars on a given night.</p>

<p>If what you are describing is always in the same position, it sounds like the only thing it could be is a satellite (in geo-synchronous orbit). Try taking pictures of it, and/or doing so through binoculars or a telescope. Enlarging that image digitally could give you a better idea of what it is. </p>

<p>Limassol (not sure if you are near it) is a major shipping port-of-call (I was there on a US Navy ship back in 2001). It would make sense to me that it would be under constant surveillance (for the purposes of tracking trade and/or smugglers).</p>

<p>At any rate, if it is <em>the brightest</em> and always in the same place, <em>somebody</em> else in your area has probably seen it and posted about it on the web.</p>

<p>I am not a UFO guy, but I am interested in Cyprus. Maybe it&#39;s because I never got to get around and explore the place. I wonder what Greek-Turk Demographics and relations look like now. I imagine that getting screwed by the banks might have done some things to bring people together, but I know nothing of the place, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I do live in Limassol. And you are right, the economic crisis and getting screwed by the Bank did brings us a lot closer. That&#39;s why we always find solutions to our problems. We are a very small community, so when crisis strikes, we help each other and we manage to overcome a problem. But the Greek-Turk issues are getting heated up again. The Government and Europe is pressuring us into a solution, when most of the people don&#39;t want one. It&#39;s a very vague situation. </p>

<p>I did get to visit Greece and Turkey on that deployment. I knew that the two nations were not particularly fond of one another; but, from my ignorant American perspective, minus religion and language (two big differences, I know) Greeks and Turks seemed much more alike than not.</p>

<p>Is it common for Greeks and Turks to marry in Cyprus? Do you find yourself embracing aspects of the other culture (not sure if you are Turkish or Greek)? Do you find that Cypriots of your generation get along better than what you know of your grandparents&#39; generations? Do you know when your first ancestors made it to Cyprus?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Greek-Cypriot. There has always been tension between Greeks and Turks. It all goes way back to the Ottoman Empire. Turkey always had a very similar mentality like Germany. They have always wanted to grow as a power, take over as much countries as possible. Constantinoupoli IS Greek. Agia Sofia IS Greek. Just like they did my country in 1974, where they invaded us and took half of the island. We are basically a divided country. We don&#39;t have communication with the Turkish-Cypriot part of the island. The big issue right now is Turkey. They are pressuring us into a solution and a merge of the two sides, because of the oil that was found in the Cypriot side of the island. They desperately want profit of that and that&#39;s why they are trying to force a solution, and one that benefits THEM and not us. On one hand, i do understand that the general Turkish population should not be blamed for actions of passed Presidents and military, but at the same time, would I want to live in MY country alongside Turks? With a possibility of a Turkish president? Absolutely NOT. It&#39;s basically similar as the race issues in America. Blacks VS Whites. But in this case, Whites are Turkey and Blacks are Cypriots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your insights and experience!</p>

<p>Over here, race relations vary from one part of the country to another. This is one reason why I am very proud of my hometown. In Houston, we have people of <em>many</em> nationalities and ethnicities, not just living in the same city, but living together in the same neighborhoods. Our issues in Houston are much simpler, since there aren&#39;t the grudges over loss of family members or property in our recent memory.</p>

<p>I wonder if the people in power (in Cyprus) benefit from the polarization of the population. I also wonder if it is common (or even possible) to venture over to the side controlled by Turks. Do you, or many people that you know speak Turkish? I imagine (but don&#39;t know) that there would be at least some communication and commerce between the two sides. If you don&#39;t feel like talking about it anymore, that&#39;s ok; but, I am enjoying learning about your perspective. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can still go to the Turkish-Cypriot side, but we must present passport. There are boarders now. I only know very few people who speak Turkish. Yeah, there is some sort of communication, but nothing major. Basically, we live our lives and they live theirs. Our problems aren&#39;t even with Turkish-Cypriots. It&#39;s with Turkey, since they want to benefit from the situation. </p>
