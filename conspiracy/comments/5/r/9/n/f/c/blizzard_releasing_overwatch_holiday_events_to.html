    <div class="md"><p>Okay okay I see where you&#39;re coming from now.</p>

<p>But picture it like this; the event was already running 3 weeks. If they made it last any longer, everyone would have it and it wouldn&#39;t be worth anything. Multiple short events are good for a games economy, especially with things like skins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not suggesting that they make the even last longer but the ration of Holiday skin to everything else that can drop is simply ridiculous and i think it is a way for blizzard to cash in on the cosmetic market.

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be stupid of them NOT to release Holiday Skins and allow for people to buy the boxes? It&#39;s supplemental income that goes to development to help keep the game alive, while bringing in new players, and keeping the old players around..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i understand that. What im getting at is for each holiday skin there are 6-13 victory poses, 9-32 sprays, 6-13 voicelines which makes the chance of getting the skins super low. An im thinking blizzard did this on purpose knowing it would cause the skin rate to drop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they did, not really sure what the conspiracy is behind that? </p>

<p>They&#39;re looking to make supplemental revenue on low chance, legendary tiered skins that are available during limited times. It pressures the person into buying the boxes during the Holiday events in order to gain the skins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>RNG is a core feature of most of their product line: Diablo, WoW, and now Overwatch. It&#39;s like a staple of Blizzard. </p>

<p>My guess is that the numbers would show that RNG and the &quot;Gambling&quot; feature ends up returning more profits over time. When you have someone who wants that ONE ROADHOG SKIN but has to buy 50+ boxes or achieve enough coins to purchase it outright. Don&#39;t forget that coin feature exists to allow for those who have gone through the RNG boxes to be able to buy that one skin they yearn for. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found the best way to handle this is simple: Complete your arcade dailies. Hold off on buying skins until the last day of the holiday. Hold on to your coin for those skins you really want. (I straight up bought the new Roadhog skin, since I main him.) Yet I&#39;m still sitting at 12k coins for the next skin that really catches my eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is one way to go about it. But they are also creating a false market for all skins account. An overwatch account with all skins and sprays will be able to go for pretty penny in awhile. similar to how Geared wow accounts went for alot back in the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that an Overwatch account with a bunch of skins and sprays is comparable to a Geared WoW Account. </p>

<p>This is coming from a person who had one of those WoW accounts that could have easily sold for 800-1200 dollars on the MMO market. </p>

<p>The WoW Accounts, we&#39;re talking about years of investment, hours and hours into the game and the character just to make it better, bigger, stronger, etc. Especially when you consider that most of the PvE gear back in the day was achieved through countless raids and winning loot over many other people in 40 man raids. </p>

<p>I really doubt there&#39;s much of a market for an Overwatch account with skins that are nothing more than vanity items. Even if there is, it&#39;s niche, and the price wouldn&#39;t go to high. </p>

<p>I dont think the accounts themselves are worth alot but more so the time for the skins, coins, level, and SR make the accounts more valuable. As the price for ELO and SR boosting continues to move up and gain traction so will the price of accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the holiday season.  Halloween, thanksgiving, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Valentine&#39;s Day.  You know you do NOT need to buy extra loot boxes, right?</p>

<p>They need our money because they make insanely good games and that costs money.  The servers they operate on are amazing performers, those cost money as do the huge Internet pipes.</p>

<p>This is a wild thread.  it is like a conspiracy for 14 year olds.  :)</p>

<p>Btw, what level are you and what is your main?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a jerk above.  Sorry.  This sub has been seeing some crazy threads posted pro or against trump and I kind of reacted to you like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you this: among all the software developers in the world over time, Blizzard has survived and thrived where others have failed.  They make insanely good shit, have been for ages.  I can&#39;t think of one crappy release.  </p>

<p>That ability is grandmaster level game programming.  Awesome games that have amazing playability for months or years and reasonably priced.  Instead of charging everyone $100 for the game, they charge less and instead let some people pay more by buying loot boxes.  I&#39;ve paid $80 to get 100 a few weeks ago.  Didn&#39;t get enough legends but I am okay with it.  Not going to buy more for a while.</p>

<p>Peace brother.  Sorry again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good bro!    </p>

<p>Blizzard does make a good products, And microtransactions are a thing. but $80 for 100, when it should have just been 2.99 per legendary skin. It just is odd to me they are using a lottery (RNG) for paid content which sometimes can yield all duplicate sprays, rather than a normal pay for this market.      </p>

<p>Once again your cool with me bro. also look up &quot;The Death and Return of superman&quot; and &quot;Justice league Task force&quot; Blizzard has some blemishes </p>

There is actual discussion going on besides all of that crap, but shit like this doesn&#39;t help at all. Just filter out and ignore/downvote if you don&#39;t like what is being presented.

    <div class="md"><p>um....ok???</p>

<p>How was anything I said even close to conveying pro-trump talk? I was referencing there being posts with discussion on this sub not relating to politics, and that somehow means I&#39;m from <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>? </p>

<p>Like seriously, what are you smoking? I&#39;m honestly confused at your tactics. You complain about trump/ctr shit, when I tell you there is more stuff to this subreddit than that, you accuse me of the same shit you say you hate. </p>

<p>What is going on lol?</p>
