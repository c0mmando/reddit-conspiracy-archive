      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, what evidence can we reasonably expect police to release to the public less than a week after a mass shooting occurs? Can you cite examples in the past of police releasing the kind of evidence that would convince you this early? Or do you think literally every mass shooting in history was a fake?

       I expect more than he posted anti feminism, pro trump, pro le pen stuff on social media... the entire thing seems politicalized and unusual.

       I could just as easily say that conservatives want this to be Muslim-on-Muslim violence so they can profile Muslims and repress them more. Anything to make Muslims look more violent is like raw meat to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's irrelevant though. Future scenarios I don't like don't impact how I interpret present events.

       Muslims are more violent than conservative white men, thats a fact... and 3 days have gone by and no evidence has been presented... release the video... tell us how he got the AK47... where is the AK47?

       The story is extremely simple and plausible. The kid confessed to it. His online activity matches the profile of someone who'd do something like this. Islamophobia is the highest it's been since 9/11 in my opinion. His college roommate corroborates his radicalization.

       Do you want fingerprints and CCTV footage? Police don't release that stuff right away, they ever do. You're looking for a fire when there isn't even smoke.

       I am looking for more than what he posted on social media or who his friends were... can you imagine a world were that was the only requisite to being a serial murderer. There is strong appetite right now on the left for a white supremacy islamophobic crime (because they're rare, with many proven hoaxs). In my opinion it's far more plausible that a known rival mosque shot up the place... and it was covered up to fit political agendas

       First: horse shit. There are many of them. Hoaxes get reposted 1,000 times over because the right wing wants to act like they're all hoaxes, but the hundreds that

       It doesn't mean something is fishy because you are confused and haven't made an effort to grasp the situation.

       It is common for there to be conflicting reports as a dramatic story is developing. The investigation is still ongoing, detailed evidence will be presented in court on February 21st.
