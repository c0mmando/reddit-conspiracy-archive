    <div class="md"><p>Currently, 36% of Americans believe in UFOs (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/21216-americans-ufo-belief.html">http://www.livescience.com/21216-americans-ufo-belief.html</a>), in the 1950&#39;s &amp; 1960&#39;s many people in the US thought other planets could have life on it in our solar system (In the 1950s, cults grew up around various people who claimed to have had contact with aliens, usually Venusians or Saturnians, although some turned up from Clarion, the twin of Earth that was hidden by the moon).  A lot of people were less educated than they are today (In 1959, only ~9% of the population had a college degree, that number is now higher than 30%).  Also, in 1966, 96 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll had heard of UFOs and 46 percent of them believed UFOs were real. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dean-aliens.html">http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dean-aliens.html</a>) So there are about 10% fewer people today who believe in UFO&#39;s than did in the 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty well accepted that Area 51 is where they keep the flying saucers for reverse-engineering, right? What if I told you that the origin of this story was something called Project Have Doughnut? That&#39;s a pretty suggestive name, don&#39;t you think? What if I told you that Have Doughnut involved transporting an Above Top Secret aircraft across America in the dead of night? What if I told you that that aircraft was a MiG obtained from Israel when an Iraqi fighter pilot defected in 1968? What if I told you that this Soviet made aircraft was reverse-engineered and tested at Groom Lake at the height of the Cold War and the results were the discovery that American losses in Vietnam were not the result of superior aircraft technology but better training which resulted in the so-called Top Gun school? </p>

<p>Area 51 was a facility set up by the CIA, before being passed on to the Air Force, to test top-secret aircraft like the U-2. It was a spy facility for testing spy planes set up by spies whose job it is to lie. Why is it that all of the &quot;most trusted&quot; sources of information for the government covering up contact with extraterrestrials are former (and sometimes even current) members of the military or intelligence services, and why have none of them been charged, let alone imprisoned or suicided, for leaking the biggest secret in the history of humanity, a strategic secret so enormous it makes nuclear weapons look like feather pillows? </p>
