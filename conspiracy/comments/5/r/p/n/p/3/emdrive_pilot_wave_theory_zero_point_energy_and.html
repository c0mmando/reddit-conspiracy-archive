        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys</p>

<p>You may have seen me around here introducing people to the recent developments in unified physics that prove we live in a fractal holographic universe. I run <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> - and you guys always seem receptive to the latest developments in this area, so I figured I&#39;d throw this up.</p>

<p>I wanted to write up a post detailing the latest on developments in theory behind how the EMDrive works, and how it fits into a unified physics framework.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go through the most high level explanation of unified physics -</p>

<h1>Basic Unification Theory</h1>

<p>The vacuum is full of energy, it is a superfluid lattice of light. It is unperceivable unless it is spinning, which is what we see as matter. Matter is space spinning, and space is ground-state light. </p>

<p>Mainstream physics predicts that the vacuum should be absolutely <em>teeming</em> with energy, on the order of 10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3</sup> of space. This number is extraordinarily high and so it has come to be known as the worst prediction of physics, the vacuum catastrophe. This is simply because we don&#39;t perceive this energy --- I don&#39;t have to explain to you guys that perception and reality are two different things :p.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t perceive it because it is in a geometric ground state, a geometry that expresses no vectors of force in any direction. This geometry has the capacity to shift, and thus become polarized or active, making it perceivable. The dynamic is similar to the &#39;time crystals&#39; articles that have been floating around. </p>

<h1>Holography</h1>

<p>So - if we take this vacuum energy, which is made up at the smallest level by something called planck units, which have a definitive size, mass, and time as a fluctuation of energy, we can prove the proton is holographic.</p>

<p>If you simply divide the proton by these vacuum fluctuations size and multiply by a vacuum fluctuation energy, you end up with the mass of the observable universe inside of each proton - the proton has a holographic representation of all protons. </p>

<p>Precisely 10<sup>55</sup> grams worth of vacuum energy fit inside the proton, the mass of the observable Universe.</p>

<p>You can then derive the rest mass of a single proton by applying the holographic principle, which postulates that the surface of a black hole can encode the volume. Since the proton has this immense amount of energy, we can treat it as a black hole and apply the equation.</p>

<p>When you do this, by dividing the surface planck units by the volume, and multiply by the planck mass, you yield the rest mass at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>What this is stating, plainly, is that each proton has physical access to the information of the entire Universe, but only a very tiny slice is expressed locally as mass, the rest is non-local.</p>

<p>This is because these surface plancks are terminations of wormholes that connect to all other protons. All protons are entangled through this wormhole structure of space, validating another theoretical concept in physics called EP=EPR, which states rather than entanglement being &#39;spooky action at a distance&#39;, it is simply caused by physical wormholes in space.</p>

<p>These wormholes are possible because of the massive amount of energy in empty space - it essentially turns our Universe into a giant singularity (or Bose Einstein Condesate for our physics guys) where instantaneous information transfer can happen across spacetime - in essence, macro quantum entanglement across scale.</p>

<p>At the most basic and fundamental level of reality, you are <em>touching</em> every other point in the Universe. </p>

<h1>The EMDrive in Unified Physics</h1>

<p>Recently Aerospace America released another article that details how they believe the EMDrive may work.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with the EMDrive, it is simply a microwave magnetron inside of a closed can, turn on the microwave and you get thrust, which seemingly violates our laws of physics, because there is no force being pushed out of the engine, there should be no force vectors (i.e. a rocket only moves because of it&#39;s exhaust, no exhaust, no movement).</p>

<p>However, we just have to change our perspective, and that&#39;s what the Aerospace America article postulates.</p>

<p>If the vacuum is full, and entangled, and electromagnetic waves can interact with it, what&#39;s happening is the magnetron is creating a density gradient in the field, just like a boat propellor does in water, and the EMDrive is literally <em>pushing against the quantum vacuum</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Here is thier explanation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the physics behind the EmDrive, White and his team speculate they may be seeing a manifestation of what’s known among physicists as a quantum drive or Q thruster. Such a thruster works on the well-accepted principle that <strong>empty space is not a vacuum but is frothing with fluctuations in quantum fields, with pairs of virtual particles perpetually forming and mutually annihilating.</strong></p>

<p>Based on an interpretation of quantum mechanics known as pilot wave theory, these vacuum fluctuations can be thought of as a dynamic medium that guides, or pilots, individually observed, “real” particles. And as a medium, the quantum vacuum’s constituents can interact and exchange momentum, not unlike a fluid, or a plasma.</p>

<p>As White sees it, the EmDrive can leverage electromagnetic fields to couple with the quantum vacuum and induce a slightly preferential flow in it. “A terrestrial analog to think of is a submarine that sits in the water,” White explains. “It takes advantage of the fact it’s embedded in its propellant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceamerica.org/Documents/Aerospace_America_PDFs_2017/February2017/Feature1_FuelFree_AeroAmericaFeb2017.pdf">article</a></p>

<h1>So what&#39;s pilot wave theory?</h1>

<p>You may be familiar with the copenhagen interpretation of QM, wherein we have all of these paradoxes like light being both particles and waves, the weirdness that comes out of it such as multiverse theory and quantum immortality - because of experiments like the double slit.</p>

<p>However, there is another completely logical, completely rational interpretation of QM that gives all of the same &#39;answers&#39; as the Copenhagen interpretation, without any of the paradoxical weirdness - and it&#39;s called Pilot Wave.</p>

<p>Pilot Wave postulates that what we are seeing with particle/wave duality is simply a <em>particle that makes waves in space.</em> Sounds too simple, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmC0ygr08tE">Here</a> is a video of someone re-creating <em>all</em> of the weirdness of the double slit experiment using <em>oil drops on top of a vibrating bath</em></p>

<p><strong>Why the fuck aren&#39;t we taking pilot wave as fact?</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s because it necessitates something that is very uncomfortable for physicists, and that is inherent non-locality. Essentially, for pilot wave to work the way we imagine it might, it means the entire UNIVERSE needs to be entangled with itself.</p>

<p>Well - thats what unified physics is finding - the entire universe is entangled and fractally self-referential, it is holographic - the information of the entire thing can be accessed no matter which particle you peer into.</p>

<p>And this is most likely the nature of morphic resonance, mystical states, occult ritual practice, etc - the information of the whole is encoded at every point in space.</p>

<h1>Zero Point and Antigrav</h1>

<p>The EMDrive is, in essence, an anti-gravity device.</p>

<p>There are other scientists who have had similar experiments in modulating gravity through spinning electromagnetic fields, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Tajmar">Martin Tajmar</a> who was able to create anti-gravity through spinning superconducting ceramic, this is in effect the same dynamic as the EMDrive - you are spinning EM fields that end up creating a spin in the quantum vacuum, which creates a pressure/density difference, allowing antigravity effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Following the work of Podkletnov, physicist Martin Tajmar, a professor of space propulsion studies at Dresden University of Technology, produced anomalous inertial effects (generation of small amounts of thrust or momentum) by spinning superconductive tori, as well as spinning superfluid helium. In the experiments performed by Tajmar and his research team, spinning superconductive rings and superfluid helium (both at a temperature of 4 kelvins), produced an acceleration in a laser gyroscope positioned above the apparatus (but not in direct contact with the apparatus). That is to say, the laser gyroscope itself experienced a minute acceleration in the same direction of rotation of the spinning superconductive discs (gyroscopes are used to detect accelerations and changes in orientation)</p>

<p>Interestingly, the effect only occurred when the superconductors and liquid helium were spinning in a clockwise direction, but not counter-clockwise. <strong>Tajmar has theorized that in the Southern hemisphere the counter-clockwise direction should produce an acceleration in the laser gyroscope in the direction of rotation of the apparatus while no similar acceleration will be observed for the clockwise direction of rotation, as occurs in the Northern Hemisphere. This is an important detail, as it is absolutely consistent with Haramein’s amendment of Einstein’s field equations where torque and Coriolis effects are considered. Tajmar’s experiment therefore confirms that the structure of spacetime has Coriolis dynamics present due to fundamental torque as the result of a gradient in the vacuum energy density producing the gyroscopic rotational effects of a body, such as the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make no mistake about it, our understanding of unified physics will catapault us into the next evolutionary stage of humanity. We&#39;re talking wormhole traversal, antigravity, zero point energy extaction - it goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weve had this convo before, and dont play dumb. Haraheim is very controversial especialy because he has no actual results to show for all the money he goes around and raises. Anybody who has actually spent more than 5 minutes with this theory knows that Haraheim is one of those new age snake oil salesman. The theory he is spouting is true but the science he presents and his little institute are complete frauds. How do I juggle that? Its not like he actually invented the theory, hes just trying to present science to back it up and to fundraise for his institute. Again, Im sure you know this, and it isnt the first time Ive said it to you, definitely not the first time youve heard stuff like this about Haraheim. Its hilarious to claim hes tapping into ancient knowledge and secrets yet at the same time try to claim he came up with this theory. If we found out God was real there would still be charlatans twisting the truth to make their own buck. Dont be naive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I actually studied QM under one of the lead professors working on Pilot Wave Theory (Antony Valentini). He wrote an incredible book detailing how DeBroglie (and Einstein, who supported DeBroglie), were largely ignored at the Solvay Conference in 1927 and the theory went largely unnoticed. The simple fact that it explains the particle&#39;s trajectory in the double slit experiment is fascinating enough from an observational point of view. </p>

<p>Have you personally worked on this theory above? I have some questions about mathematics behind the beginning half of your post. Are there any papers we can read? Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That last paper is heavy as hell. Can you translate it into layman&#39;s terms? </p>

<p>Are they suggesting that consciousness/memory/life is essentially a side effect of this universal quantum entanglement? </p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t really follow but this feels important... are there any common analogies that could help someone understand this? I followed the anti-gravity idea of the EmDrive in your post (the density gradient analogy was helpful)... but I&#39;m not sure how we go from that to <em>consciousness</em> and <em>memory</em>. </p>

<p>How does this play into the idea of multiple dimensions outside of our scope of experience? Or does it do away with that idea altogether? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes - very close to this. Essentially the entangled nature of the Universe creates a feedfoward / feedback loop that engenders complexification as a natural consequence, eventually leading to conscious awareness. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Does away with it in the current sense of a multi-dimensional / parallel Universe theory, however it does add depth to <em>our</em> Universe - the holographic singularities in each atom for example, can be vast planes of energetic interaction and even disembodied energy signatures/patterns we may view as conscious...</p>

<p>Could you expand on that?</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s silly,  but my mind has been kicking around the idea put forward in one of the Podesta emails of zero-points energy and &quot;extradimmensional beings&quot; that want to share the ZPE technology with us. I&#39;m not usually one to stray from &quot;known science&quot;, but ever since that email my mind has been wandering all over into the possibilities and it turns out that at the bleeding edge of science, there are theories that may support that sort of thing... so, are these theoretical &quot;deep energy signatures&quot; something that could be understood as similar to &quot;extradimmensional beings&quot;? Or would that idea be inconsistent with what you are laying out?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers btw! </p>

<p>These have had many names - archons, dmt entities, angels, etc. These can be experienced without doubt on high doses of DMT, a natural neurotransmitter.</p>

<p>It is of my personal belief that DMT allows one to get a wider read on these holographic singularities, allowing interaction with these energetic patterns of light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi d8_thc, </p>

<p>Thanks for the interesting info. I am somewhat familiar with Haramein&#39;s work, specifically I have read his papers on the holographic mass of the proton and electron. I thought you&#39;d be interested in Dewey Larson&#39;s Reciprocal System (RS) theory. The idea of the RS is that the universe is fundamentally expressed as motion, and that space and time are the basis of both the physical and metaphysical universe. In this theory space and time are reciprocals of one another, and linear progression of space and time results in light. Angular progression results in matter (ie spinning space like you mentioned). You can construct the entire periodic table of elements using 3 numbers that represent the rotational motion of light in three spacial and three temporal dimensions.</p>

<p>This theory has a number of conceptual advantages. For instance, it has a natural explanation for the apparent weirdness exhibited by quantum mechanics, specifically the wave-particle duality. In this theory there is space/time which is 3d space + 1d time (ie our physical universe) and there is time/space which is 3d time + 1d space (the metaphysical world, or spiritual realm). Particles exhibiting wavelike behavior are motion in time/space, with measurement devices acting to project this motion onto our local space/time coordinates (resulting in the &quot;collapse of the wavefunction&quot; into a particle like motion). More info on this <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Quantum%20Mechanics%20as%20the%20Mechanics%20of%20the%20Time%20Region%20(KVK,%20Nehru).pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>Larson was able to use the theory to make some stunning theoretical calculations, as seen in his book <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Basic%20Properties%20of%20Matter%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Basic Properties of Matter</a>. Among the most notable was his abillity to calculate the masses of the fundamental particles and all the elements from first principles, no need to use a measured charge radius as Haramein does in his paper. (see his book <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Nothing%20But%20Motion%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Nothing But Motion</a> pgs 205-208). For a more updated calculation of proton, neutron, electron, positron, and other masses see B. Peret&#39;s paper <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Subatomic%20Mass%20Recalculated%20(Peret,%20Bruce).pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>For an understanding of atronomy and cosmology, see <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Universe%20of%20Motion%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Universe of Motion</a>. Note that using this theory Larson predicted the existence of quasars 3 years before they were first detected.</p>

<p>I think it could be fruitful for those in the community studying unified physics theories to study Larson&#39;s work; I think he provides a framework that could yield substantial theoretical progress on better understanding current problems in physics and possibly better understanding consciousness and life (Larson goes into these topics in his book Beyond Space and Time). In fact, I think combining Haramein&#39;s ideas on the holographic universe may lead to an understanding of the biological life unit (ie bioenergy aka prana or chi in Indian / Chinese traditions, see daniel&#39;s paper on this <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Homo%20Sapiens%20Ethicus%20(Phoenix%20III,%20Daniel).pdf">here</a>). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, awesome comment!</p>

<p>Can I ask if you got into Larson due to reading about it in the Law of One? Noticed your name :).</p>

<p>It sounds like it would mesh very well with Nassim&#39;s theory, definitely fills in some gaps - for one regarding the conceptualization of time which I feel lacks a bit in the theory.</p>

<p>Personally, I interpret the holographic mass singularities at the heart of particles to be time/space - absolutely analogue to the astral plane - I also believe consciousness has the ability to access this singularity and this may be what the mystical experience is all about.</p>

<p>This gives me a lot to think about re: relative motion and time, as inside of these singularities there is no relative motion because it is a superfluid self-entangled system (kind of the Interstellar 4d black hole singularity type thing)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a cool fact - if you blew up a planck spherical unit (of which 10<sup>60</sup> &#39;planck sphere bits&#39; fit inside the proton) to the size of a grain of sand, the proton&#39;s relative size would stretch from here to Alpha Centauri - imagine filling a sphere of that size with grains of sand - that&#39;s how many bits of information fit inside the proton. :). Mindblowing.</p>

<p>Each proton contains a Universe within itself, substructures and geometries, I see no reason why disembodied consciousness&#39; of pure light-energy, entities, etc could not sustain themselves in such an environment.</p>

<p>Trying to wrap my head around this, does it have relation to DeBrogile Pilot Wave?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, I&#39;ll have to check that sub out! </p>

<p>This does have relation to the pilot wave theory; from what I understand of it the waves would be motion in time/space. I&#39;m still learning RS theory, it is taking alot of unlearning old concepts from my physics training. So I could be off in my interpretation of pilot wave theory within the RS framework. If you are interested in asking questions to experts on RS, there is a community of researchers at <a href="http://reciprocal.systems/phpBB3/index.php">http://reciprocal.systems/phpBB3/index.php</a>. Those three books that I linked are basically RS 101 so I&#39;m working through them at the moment. </p>

<p>I was introduced to Larson through the Law of One stuff. Speaking of that, there are many interesting clues Ra gives about understanding the nature of energy - for example when he talks about the pyramids and the spiraling energy that is created from the pyramid&#39;s shape. It acts as a resonating chamber of sorts. Basically this holographic vacuum energy that pervades our reality as discussed by Haramein doesn&#39;t have directionality to it, in general. But the pyramid shape engenders this upward spiraling motion. I know Haramein has done alot of work on sacred geometry and this sort of thing, I need to read more of his stuff!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is two-fold</p>

<p>One, the conical shape of the cavity helps with creating a pressure differential on the wide vs narrow side of the cavity</p>

<p>Two, the effect is so small in this configuration that you need <em>extremely</em> precise experimental setup and measurement to detect it. </p>

<p>Q: thinking of aperiodic structures, such as Penrose tiles. Would it be possible to make an aperiodic structure that followed a time cascade?

    <div class="md"><p>So glad I randomly dropped acid and came across Alan Watts before reading a physicist confirm these findings. Not sure my ego could&#39;ve handled it. What a time to be alive. </p>

<p>Everything you&#39;ve ever seen, ever known, is literally 1 single entity. And that entity is you. That me feeling is the universe -- the divine -- experiencing itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to farsttidr he&#39;s just mad that his ideology of an inherent probabilistic nature of reality might not be correct after all...</p>

<p>I think that the reason we evolved into such large organisms, i.e. Collections of particles is because at the microscopic level atoms and compounds are too strongly influenced by these aforementioned fluctuations so the grew to a size that wouldn&#39;t be affected by them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what we observe from experience and conforms to particle physics.</p>

<p>Farstridr, you are on all these QM pilot wave Reddits talking Down to people because you think nature is inherently probabilistic, probably because you spent years studying QM and when you reached the conclusion that nature isn&#39;t deterministic, you rejoiced and loathe anyone who doesn&#39;t understand it like you do. We get it, people are all stupid because they think reality &quot;should be what we see and it isn&#39;t&quot;, but when some new evidence, and it is experimental provable evidence, that nature might not be so after all you go on a witch hunt and verbally attack others. Don&#39;t get mad that you might be wrong, challenge your views once more and keep learning.</p>
