       I would say no, mostly just based on how mental disorders and disabilities were treated back then, I feel like they would lack the knowledge or whatever to find out marijuana could do that to your brain.

       I do believe this. The kind of place your mind can go on drugs like LSD is very dangerous to the powers that be. Watching commercials still gives me anxiety even years after trying it, I can't unsee it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed is illegal because of how insanely useful it is along with that. You can get high, treat illnesses, build things. It's a super plant that's easy to grow.

       I think so too. The reason is always money or power or both. The guy that funded the anti Marijuana campaign in the 30's had ties with the DuPont family which, as you know, is a chemical industry powerhouse. Also, I think that the cotton industry also had a big stake in making hemp illegal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In fact, creating public hysteria over smoking marijuana was simply a smokescreen for Hearst and the wealthy DuPont family to prevent the cultivation or importation of hemp products into the United States. The DuPont’s held many lucrative patents on chemicals used in manufacturing plastics, paper, and paints that could become valueless if hemp products and hemp oil derivatives became widely available. But how could they prevent this harmless weed from making their billion dollar patents worthless?

       The control of minorities and current Big Pharma benefits of the classification of marijana are "happy side-effects" for the rich and powerful.

       And the white people called it cannabis, used it in tincture form as medicine. Lobbyists from the cotton industry and lumber industry wanted to abolish the hemp industry.

       They used the hot topic of the day (being racist) to push their agenda through social engineering.

       So you're right about them banning marijuana to suppress minorities, but that was only the official story.  They also banned the well known and trusted products: cannabis extract and hemp.

       Here's what happened to me. I wrote the piece in 2006, after the majority of what I experienced subsided, due to me not using marijuana anymore. It was a time of reflection and trying to catalogue what I had went through.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, one hit of THC, and I'm transported right back there. It shakes me to my core. I was completely sober for 10 years, but last year in 2016, I tried it twice, on two separate occasions, with friends out camping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure enough. It happens every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a 28 year old male, born and raised in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a very young age, I have had many adults compliment me on my maturity. "You're very mature for your age, so well spoken!" Time and time again, as far back as 6 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many times I can recall strangers or friends / acquaintances of my parents stating "Your son is an old soul."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a naturally gifted communicator and have been since as young as I can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've even recalled in one instance, that I was described as being on my last run. This life, being my soul's "last and most important cycle, to learn or experience something never before occurred, in human history."
      </p>
      <p>
       That always confused me, because I thought "Well of course... Because no one can predict the future, and everyday is new... So we ALL are experiencing something that has never occurred before... No matter what. It's called "Today".
      </p>
      <p>
       But as I have grown and experienced more in this reality, I realize that it is the vibration / frequency of our present and future, that my being wishes to experience and learn from. This is why I am here. Why we all are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why am I beginning my reply like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to inflate my ego or appear to be more than I am. I am sharing some information about my life experience, in my perceived reality, that has attributed to why I believe there are those of us who achieve a higher vibrational frequency and those who do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to share a large bit of writing here, because I feel it is important to share at this moment, seeing this topic pop up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It catalogues an event in my life that I believe was a channeling experience. It was from the ages of 15-17 roughly, from 2003-2005. There are many more instances and experiences I have had, but this was the first, and only one I have ever put into the written word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have carried this with me for my entire life, and still maintain the ability to access this stream of consciousness. Regardless of what main stream science may say about what I experience, I refuse to accept their labels. I am a very successful individual with a marvelous family, and beautiful partner of 7 years. I earn a very great living and have manifested a position where I can work from home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I have painted a small picture for you, as I lead into the piece of writing that begins my journey into the world of the occult and hidden truths.

       Hm, now that you mention it, I think I had an experience like this too? I was relaxing one afternoon, eyes closed on a couch, and I nearly fell asleep. However, before I could sleep completely, a voice like the one you described (deep, bass-like voice that vibrated within your entire body, yet also had a calming aspect) said, "I'm here." I remember this quite clearly, but I've never told anyone about it until now.

       I am not trying to scare you. I promise. Chase that voice. Chase it. Try very hard to get back there. Get back to that place where you could hear him. I am not joking. THAT right there is the real conspiracy. I promise you.

       How do you know these experiences weren't manufactured by man and technology? I've hear the opinion that God would not contact someone because it makes people susceptible to believing an impostor. The "if you heard him, it's not god" argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to muddy the waters or cast doubt. I guess if the message is aligned with what you believe God would endorse it doesn't matter anyway.

       Thanks for the advice- I've been trying (meditation, etc.). I understand why some skeptics wouldn't think it's real, I almost couldn't believe it myself, but if this is the way to reach something, it will be worth the doubt in the end.

       We are one. You just put my entire life experience into words lol I've been getting in tune with my vibrations recently too and I believe I'm an empath and clairaudient. I've been experiencing certain things that are hard to explain to the average reader, and once I started looking into indigo children and channeling, a light bulb went off. It all made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only started looking into this about 2 weeks ago and you're the 4th person I've come into contact with that's brought this up. The first was a guy who told me that psychic abilities run in his family, and he was trained from a young age to learn how to channel them properly. He said he can literally smell death when it's near for people and that it smells sweet.. he has such a strong connection with the afterlife and told me some crazy stories. But the most uplifting was that this is normal for a lot of people and we're drawn to one another unknowingly. I think everyone is capable of achieving these capabilities...some of us were just born with a more natural tendency to embrace them. Why would we have a brain that was only capable of using 10% of its capacities? We are capable of unbelievable things and TPTB have indoctrinated so much of the population and brainwashed them to laugh at the mere suggestion. I wish they knew what they're missing out on :/

       Hey bignuke87! I have nothing to hide, and don't see the problem. 90% of anyone reading my comment will dismiss it as "crazy person" chatter. Those who do read it, and connect with it, may take the leap and engage in communication with some one who extended the olive branch.

       In my opinion that is definitely one of the reasons.  You'll come to realize that when talking about these conspiracy topics to people in person, it is usually those that do not smoke pot who instantly reject and dismiss our ideas and thought processes.  Marijuana expands your mind and allows you to rationalize with ideas and topics that are widely unfathomable to the majority.

       Don't imagine complicated  plot in the process that made marijuana illegal. There was little to no thought process about the  situation It was simple greed by the cotton and lumber industries killing off a superior competitor  aided by  racism of the most extreme sort
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are  quotes from  the man who  convinced the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, these  were  the winning arguments against pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harry S. Anslinger, our very first drug czar, on the need to make marijuana illegal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most marijuana smokers are Negroes, Hispanics, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death -- the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.

       I think the only reason I've been "awoken" is because of marijuana. It slowed my thought process enough to shift my thinking in terms of spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shift geared my brain toward the logic of the natural logic of of the universe. So, I got a math degree, applied that logic and thinking to everything I already loved doing and found that everything comes down to a replication of certain patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the patterns we find in nature, i.e. Fibonacci sequences from sunflower buds, they make their way up into human interactions. These patterns are in our structure of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let natural logic be disregarded by popular misinformation. So pot and psychs teach you to be still and listen.

        Psychedelics, of which marijuana is one--albeit a mild one--breaks mind controll

       Since the main activity of governments is
       <em>
        perception management
       </em>
       through marketing, propaganda, mind control / tv-film "programming", psychedelics are literally more toxic to them than plutonium and more dangerous to them than the nuclear bomb

       Strangely enough, Cannabis is simultaneously a hallucinogen, anti-psychotic, depressant and stimulant.  It's a weirdo.  I think the anti-psychotic feature is why some people like to smoke cannabis before tripping on other psychedelics notably mushrooms

       Hahaha no way weed is used as an anti-psychotic with shrooms. Lets just say it
       <em>
        massively
       </em>
       potentiates it- a lot more visuals and color in those visuals.
