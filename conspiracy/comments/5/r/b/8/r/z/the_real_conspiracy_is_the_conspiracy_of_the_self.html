        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Suffering is the neurotic manifestations that occur with living under the illusion that you are a separate &quot;Self&quot; instead of your true existential nature, which is that you are simply transparent awareness. A conscious witness manifested in a human body. </p>

<p>The body has thoughts and emotions that occur, but those are just phenomena that you fundamentally have no TRUE control over. They are temporary, fleeting, and many times irrational to the reality of the presented situation. 
Suffering comes from attaching your sense of identity and personality to these passing phenomena by assuming that your thoughts and emotions are who you are. Because you have no control over your thoughts and emotions, you can never be at peace because you are hostage to every thought and emotion that comes careening into consciousness. Suffering can end when you embrace your true nature--that you are the nothing more than the witness, pure consciousness. 
Taking this birds eye view of the human experience eliminates your suffering as you able to simply embrace the thoughts and emotions as they arise. Watch them, experience them, allow them to move through you--but don&#39;t identify with them or think they are &quot;You.&quot; You allow them to control you by being perpetually lost in thought. There is no &quot;Self&quot; inside you, just a very powerful mind trying to keep you alive.  </p>

<p>When you get a nasty text, that Fight or Flight response that gets triggered--Did YOU trigger that or did it just automatically arise as an ego defense, a relic of evolution that is there to tell you to RUN when a bear is about to eat you? </p>

<p>So what&#39;s a better approach? Be a slave to every wave of emotion and thought which arises (and thus prolong the suffering)...or be the witness that refuses to trade one&#39;s inner peace for anything? </p>

<p>Experience it for what it is, but don&#39;t get carried away in the story. Thoughts and emotions will cease to have the power over you they do now. </p>

<p>Peace is possible without religion, but Western culture brainwashes us to believe that we are separate special snowflakes, thus furthering and bolstering the ego and self-concept, creating more division and separation from our true nature which is that we are nothing more than transparent awareness, pure consciousness. This realization brings true inner peace in a way that nothing else can, but western culture preys and profits from our fears and egos, thus furthering the illusion of a separate &quot;Self.&quot; Please CMV, as I have experienced this first hand after suffering for many years, hitting rock bottom in my personal life, and then discovering meditation.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CYV? Okay. </p>

<p>All you&#39;ve done is say: &quot;your self is not y, it&#39;s x.&quot; You didn&#39;t demonstrate that the self is a fiction, or illusory, you simply said, &quot;the self is not your thoughts or emotions.&quot;</p>

<p>Funny, because virtually every psychologist, therapist, and psychiatrist that I worked with as a child (with OCD) through young adulthood basically told me the same thing: &quot;you are not your thoughts or emotions, and you <em>can</em> control them, and how you react to them.&quot;</p>

<p>Most philosophers working on the problem of identity also do not identify the self with your thoughts and emotions either. Oh, and the eastern philosophical traditions you&#39;re imitating? They would tell you that in saying this: &quot;Understanding this is what it truly means to be &#39;awake&#39;,&quot; you really haven&#39;t understood at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is your naive epistemological understandings and your use of &quot;evidence.&quot; Not everything can be proved with empirical, physical evidence. For example, you can&#39;t provide empirical evidence for the propositions, &quot;non-skeptical external realism is true,&quot; &quot;I have free will,&quot; &quot;there is a self,&quot; &quot;there are infinitely many primes,&quot; &quot;scientific realism is true,&quot; &quot;[metaphysical] materialism is true,&quot; etc.  You also can&#39;t provide the kind of evidence you&#39;re asking for when it comes to laws of logic. The list goes on. </p>

<p>To even suggest that there is a spatiotemporal self that is &quot;riding around <em>in</em> your body&quot; speaks to even <em>further</em> naive interpretations on your part. I&#39;m sorry, but your post is sophomoric philosophy. Downvote if you want to, but I didn&#39;t downvote you for ironically claiming to be awakened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To wake up from the illusion of a separate self is the most transcendent experience one can have. Was it not Maslow who stated the highest attainable goal is Self-Transendence? </p>

<p>While I am impressed by your ability to weave spatiotemporal into conversation, you completely miss the mark by conflating self-realization with philosophy. Philosophy is mental masturbation, what I am describing can only be experienced through intense investigation. Hard work. Breaking through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy is that it technically takes no work at all.  I&#39;ve read several books over the last seven years or so on this subject, including Tolle&#39;s masterpiece.  The one that I&#39;m rereading right now was the one that pointed out that it takes no work, because no matter what, you&#39;re always already there (&quot;The Lazy Man&#39;s Way To Enlightenment&quot; by David Bhodan).  He also suggests that if you ever come across a person claiming to &quot;be enlightened,&quot; you should politely smile and walk the other direction (there is no &quot;me&quot; who can be enlightened, enlightenment is always present and available).</p>

<p>Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see this post on this sub.  It&#39;s been my focus of study for some time.  It&#39;s easy to get dragged back into ego identification, stuff like this helps keep me guided to the source.  Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is even if consciousness in its purest form is impersonal, we only experience life through one body, our own.  We can&#39;t but naturally hope for positive things to happen to the one person in the world who&#39;s eyes we see through and who&#39;s every moments we experience.  Therefore you have self-interest, the desire for pleasure, the avoidance of pain.  Then once you move in  the world you realize that others in the world want these things too but that often resources are scare and there is competition and winners and losers.  Add to this biological needs and desires and it isn&#39;t truly possible imo to become &quot;self&quot;less.  In fact most of the famous gurus in history have quite the checkered past off camera.  I think the best approach is to allow the self to exist and all it&#39;s fluctuations but loosen your grip on it&#39;s materiality through constantly realizing the way it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. There is no doubt we are a unique iteration of this shared consciousness. But realizing the ego is the source of our suffering is paramount. All of our neuroticism Is ego-driven. Once we observe and forgive the ego for just doing its job, the suffering ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post! Attachment leads to suffering and is an ego defense mechanism, including wishing for &#39;good&#39; things to happen to this meat body. Seeing things as good or bad could well be a form of attachment. All forms of attachment can be reduced with conscious intent which is practiced widely in eastern cultures. This seems to go against the grain of western cultures as attachment is greatly valued by many in them. Much love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite stories of enlightenment, and I forget which guru told it, but he asked a butcher for &quot;the best cut of meat&quot; and like any savvy street merchant the butcher replied &quot;they are all the best cut&quot; and that was the guru&#39;s moment of realization. However, it&#39;s clearly better to be in xyz ideal situation verses being tortured to death or something terrible like that. So the Truth is ultimately a paradox, as it is with the self, that it is BOTH TRUE that &quot;no cut of beef is any better than another cut,&quot; but also that some situations are clearly preferable to others, both for ourselves and for the world. And of course this is how we live our lives and constantly make decisions.  Wiithout this sense of preference we wouldn&#39;t have any incentive to basically do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive learned the vast majority of this very concept through various sources. I basically have no ego now which has been amazing. However..</p>

<p>My anxiety gets so bad in troubling situations (generally involving other peoples suffering and wanting them to get better) that i get physically sick. I get the pewps and puke u name it.. horrific. Ive never been able to control it, only valium has ever helped. Breathing and meditation does nothing. </p>

<p>This concept has helped me with every other aspect of my life. Even if my mind appears calm my body goes NOPE.</p>

<p>So how do you let it all wash over you when its more other people suffering in a situation you don&#39;t know the outcome?  Bah i dunno i should probs go to an anxiety sub lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch out for science too. Science does not accept Consciousness yet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like they are blind to it. They will not integrate it. This will be I bigger challenge than dealing with tptb. Tptb are fucked. Look at this sub. They are fucked.</p>

<p>We are awakening. We need to work together to build a better perception of our world. Science is in the way. That bullshit like big bang and Holofractals. Nice little geometries. With no consciousness. Because science has no idea what it is.</p>

<p>Science is also just a somewhat mirror image of religion. Religion does not accept consciousness of self either. Science and religion both are In The Way. We don&#39;t evolve. We don&#39;t go to heaven or hell. A of these theories we are fed from religion and science are Not True. Religion and science both perceive through a distorted lens and make theories and never factor the human beings consciousness into it.</p>

<p>They have no idea what the Subjective is. They think it&#39;s an objective thing that creates everything. That is not True. </p>

<p>The mind of the person and what it can do are not in science or religion. The mind can dream. It can imagine. It has telepathy though hardly anyone uses it. It has empathy that should be used more. We are not taught how to use are minds. We are taught to believe theories from belief systems and those beliefs themselves are not True.  </p>

<p>We have to change. We have to become Self Aware. Self awareness is knowing the subjective. Knowing and experiencing the subjective. There is no science for that. Religion never tells you to imagine, they don&#39;t want you to imagine a world without it. </p>

<p>Both religion and science will not tell you what you are and what is happening right now. A Shift in Conscioussness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have effectively decided that the only way to live my life is to discover myself by searching and understanding every inch of my consciousness within the context of its environment. </p>

<p>The physical world is too evil and perverted to derive any significant spiritual meaning from. Physical pleasures are great, but given the world they exist in I cannot rely on them for a life of purpose. </p>

<p>So meditate for 30-60mins per day and I separate myself from the physical. And by doing that I have actually found a purpose in life. A purpose that all humans should realise - that we&#39;re but fleeting spirits existing in this world, given the chance to understand ourselves and each other. It&#39;s truly a holy gift which I intend to make use of. We&#39;re so bombarded with consumerist stimuli that we&#39;ve lost ourselves. Most humans don&#39;t even know what they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not &quot;YOUR&quot; conciousness. You ARE the consciousness.</p>

<p>Realising conciousness isn&#39;t the point of being human. Being human is only a journey for conciousness. You are explaining the light from a shadow&#39;s perspective, instead of explaining the shadow from a light&#39;s perspective.</p>

<p>The big part is the question, what is the purpose of the journey, if there is one. This is obviously where religion seeks to give answers (not however, the dumbed down version of religion we have today tho). I have no idea if there is a purpose and what it is. I have my theories, but they are as good as any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many regurgitated &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;new age&quot; beliefs in this, and they all revolve around the same belief: Oneness.</p>

<p>That somehow, everyone is a shared consciousness experiencing itself as unique &quot;iterations&quot;, and then of course that the &quot;ego&quot; is our &quot;false sense&quot; of self and is the cause of our suffering and thus negativity.</p>

<p>The belief in &quot;oneness&quot; is quite simply, insanity in its absolute highest form.</p>

<p>The entire premise of &quot;oneness&quot; is that be it all life/consciousness, or literally everything, there is only one thing, which is always made out to be consciousness, and therefore God (or the other silly names &quot;spiritual&quot; people use like source, the creator, the great I am, etc.). Since all conscious beings, and/or everything is that consciousness (God), that of course means you are too. But the first of <strong><em>MANY</em></strong> problems arise because you cannot be anything else but you, because you certainly do exist, because if you didn&#39;t, there would ne no consciousness and therefore nothing would exist, so you wouldnt even be able to go on reddit and talk about this.</p>

<p>Since you are you, and since you are simply a unique &quot;iteration&quot; of this consciousness, that means that regardless of any other contradicting belief you might have, you are that consciousness, and that consciousness is you. It does not work one way only where it is you but you sre not it, it is a completely 2 way street, you are it and it is you. 
You exist, &quot;as consciousness&quot;, because again, you couldn&#39;t even write this stuff on reddit if you didn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Since you are it and it is you, and since it is all consciousness and/or everything, that means that at the end of the line, you are all consciousness and/or everything. It cannot be a one way street because you exist (because you are able to write this all down), therefore since you exist, and this consciousness (God) is everything, you are that consciousness (God). </p>

<p>There is also the issue that this turns God into a universal, which means it is something that applies to all things in a category, and in this case, it applies to all consciousness/conscious beings and/or everything else. Universals cannot ever (which means never) exist in a selective manner, meaning there can be no degrees to the application of the universal, because universals are singular and apply to all things in the category equally. That means there can be no such thing as selective oneness, where we&#39;re just part of some unified consciousness but not completely it. And because you exist, &quot;as consciousness&quot; (because you wouldn&#39;t be writing these things if you didn&#39;t exist), that automatically means that all consciousness and/or everything is you and <strong>ONLY</strong> you.</p>

<p>Now already there are incredible contradictions (they all point to the same thing) that you might notice, with the main one being that <strong>YOU</strong> can to apply anyone, and thus everyone, reading, and because <strong>YOU</strong> exist &quot;as consciousness&quot; (because you couldn&#39;t read these things if you didn&#39;t exist), that automatically creates multiple versions of a complete universal, because whoever is reading is that consciousness (God) because you, the reader, certainly exists. This means it is saying that there are multiple everythings, which simply does not make sense or work in any reality ever because everything encompasses <strong><em>EVERYTHING</em></strong>  (that word means literally all things and that there is nothing that is not in that category) and is thus singular, so there CANNOT be more than one everything. </p>

<p>So that right there is enough to completely destroy any notion of &quot;oneness&quot;, or &quot;collective consciousness&quot; ever, and I would go into every other impossibility if I had room in this post, but I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But it is impossibility upon impossibility, etc,</p>

<p>All of the contradictions and impossibilities further prove, as objective truth, that oneness is the absolute most insane concept anyone can ever think of and is, quite simply, <strong><em>not real</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Now since you are unique, and you have an identity (a name, likes/dislikes, desires, a body, certain colors on your body like hair, eye, skin, language, family, habits, talents, etx.), you are <strong>far</strong> more than just consciousness. And since oneness is absolutely irrevocably crazy and impossible in every way, this notion that the &quot;ego&quot; is your separate sense of self and is the cause of your negativity is also irrevocably crazy and impossible in every way.</p>

<p>Everything that I have shown and explained to all of you in my reply to this completely insane post comprises of 3 main things:</p>

<p>1.) all the obvious evidence</p>

<p>2.) all of the connections between everything</p>

<p>3.) logic that is used to order those connections in the correct sequence</p>

<p>These 3 things, and using them, literally enable you to find the objective truth, and to completely free yourself from beliefs about reality (which are all forms of insanity because they do not use those 3 things and do not work in actual reality, and are therefore essentially not part of reality itself), which in turn enables you to not only spot the many many many many many many various forms of insanity on this planet but to also understand and appreciate exactly why and how all of that insanity is actually insanity.</p>

<p>the most pervasive, and all encompassing form of insanity that is common to literally almost everyone on this planet is the belief thst negativity is part of the natural state of things. Quite simply, it is not, and can never be. I am not going to go into detail as to why or how that is the case because I am short on room, but I am going to link many links that do go into extreme detail about everything.</p>

<p>But to preface what I&#39;m about to say, the negativity you and everyone else experiences is outside of the realm of negativity being anything but negativity because no one has learned the lesson that negativity isn&#39;t part of the natural state of things. So since Noone has learned that yet, any and all negativity you experience is simply negativity, and isn&#39;t doing anything positive for anyone.</p>

<p>Now the reasons you, and everyone else are/is intrinsically negative in the first place is again because of the belief that negativity is part of the natural state of things, and also because everyone, including you, has been conditioned through other beliefs and various forms of negativity (which is simply negativity to everyone) by others and the system of control, domination, and oppression that is part of all aspects of life on this planet.</p>

<p>This system of control is based around negativity and is centered around propagating and perpetuating it everywhere it can. This is because those who the system belongs to (the elite), believe more than anyone else on the planet, that negativity is part of the natural state of things and are more attached to it than anyone else, and thus they literally feed off of it.</p>

<p>The elite, as a group, have been this way for millennia and their origins go back before &quot;recorded history&quot;, to a &quot;mythical&quot; place they have done so hard to keep secret and fictionalize, among many other things.</p>

<p>That place is Atlantis, and it is the key to destroying the elite&#39;s system of control, so it is the absolute most important topic anyone could be talking about, especially on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to post a methaphor, which will ultimatelly be a bad metaphor that doesnt prove you wrong, which you will quickly realise if we are on the same page, but provides a good starting point for further discussion.</p>

<p>So imagine the &quot;oneness&quot; is your normal everyday light emiting from a lightbulb. This is the null point of existence, pure conciousness. Now in that context what is a laser? It is the same light being concentrated and emited in phase trough a device which &quot;narrows&quot; the oneness into a point. Lets say that in terms of concioussness and not light, this device is the brain. Does this, in your view, allow for oneness to exist and operate at the same time as individal &quot;you&quot; (which is obviously in this analogy the concentrated light- conciousness in phase)? </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>If we are one the same page you will realise this is a really bad analogy that only proves your point, but is a good starting point for discussing the point you made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have run out of room, so I will reply in 2 replies, <strong>please reply to reply #2</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS REPLY #1, PLEASE REPLY TO REPLY #2</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Yes, in that analogy the lightbulb is where the light comes from yes? And if the oneness is the light, and since it comes from the lightbulb, that would mean that the lightbulb IS the light, and that everything is the lightbulb and the lightbulb is everything, including the lasers, because the lightbulb represents that consciousness, i.e. God = You. </p>

<p>There couldn&#39;t even be anything, even concepts, except the lightbulb, so even consciousness itself and the concept of oneness itself, as well as existence/non-existence and possibility/impossibility, are also you. </p>

<p>That leads to another fundamental impossibility that adds to the list of impossibilities that come from &quot;oneness&quot;. Universals cannot exist at the same time for the same category, meaning something cannot objectively exist and not exist at the same time. If unicorns exist, then they exist. If they don&#39;t exist, then they do not exist. Unicorns cannot both objectively exist and not exist at the same time. </p>

<p>The same thing cannot literally be existence and non-existence at the same time. It simply does not, and cannot <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> work in any reality or any form of reality ever (this means at no point ever could this ever work or function in any way under any circumstance).</p>

<p>The same thing applies to possibility and impossibility. They cannot exist at the same time while applying to the same thing. And the same thing can <strong><em>certainly</em></strong> not literally be both possibility and impossibility at the same time. That could also never, ever, ever, ever work in any reality <strong><em>ever</em></strong>.</p>

<p>These things would literally break reality and you cannot even form thoughts about what a broken reality would be like, because all of these things are completely built into reality and the way you understand and appreciate existence. It&#39;s literally impossible to contemplate things that are so insane that they break reality, like there being more than one everything, or possibility, impossibility, existence, and non-existence all being the same thing.</p>

<p>In oneness, everything becomes one thing, so every concept, idea, word, thing, verb, adjective, EVERYTHING, no longer exists. That includes meaning, context, variation, understanding, appreciation, knowledge, information, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, thinking, thoughts themselves, feelings themselves, etc. </p>

<p>&quot;Oneness&quot; is entirely, absolutely, completely, utterly, 100% insanity and <strong><em>is the single most insane thing anyone could ever believe.</em></strong></p>

<p>Oneness is not real, so that means its opposite, separation, is real, and is what actually objectively exists. God is separate from us, and we are separate from each other and everything else. It can only be this way because oneness in <strong><em>any</em></strong> form, and when applied to any category, automatically destroys everything in that category except the thing that all of those other things are.</p>

<p>Things, however, are infinitely connected and interconnected, and so very deeply so, and that means that connections are everywhere. Connection <strong><em>does not</em></strong> mean that they are the same thing, or even part of the same thing. The things that are connected are individual points, and are not all part of a single point, even if those points create geometric shapes and patterns. The connections are lines between the points (things), and they do indeed form shapes and patterns, but are also so numerous and groups of connected things are connected to other groups of connected things, etc. and it becomes so infinitely complex. </p>

<p>This infinite complexity applies to things like math, geometry, music, language, etc. and these things are also infinitely logical as well. These things are also infinitely varied, with an infinite number of possible words in language, an infinite number of possible sounds, melodies, and rhythmic patterns in music, an infinite number of possible shapes and applications of these shapes, and literally infinite numbers!</p>

<p>Reality is infinitely varied, complex, and logical, and this completely, non-negotiably points to an intelligence that was able to create all of this in the way it is. Intelligence points to something that has consciousness. That means this thing would be God. And because reality is literally infinitely varied, complex, and logical, that would mean that God would be infinitely intelligent.</p>

<p>To posit that all of those things, and reality, simply happened by chance and formed from nothing whatsoever, is almost as insane as &quot;oneness&quot;, and actually is the highest form of mental gymnastics there could ever be, especially when one has simple knowledge of those things like math, geometry, music, language, etc.</p>

<p>It becomes the absolute most extreme example of willing ignorance and blindness there could ever be. But while it is willing, it is really not conscious, because beliefs about reality and negativity, <em>and the belief that negativity is part of the natural state of things</em>, keep one unable to become conscious of this willing ignorance and blindness.</p>

<p>Willing is not the same as conscious, because no one else is making you choose to be ignorant and blind (you are doing it yourself, thus you are <strong>willingly</strong> doing it, free from anyone literally controlling you and making you do it), but you are essentially not aware that you are actually doing it, nor are you really aware of it itself (the ignorance and blindness), nor are you aware of why you are unaware, and so much more. </p>

<p>Insanity itself means that whoever is insane is not <em>actually</em> aware that they are insane, because if they were aware that they were insane, they would be aware of the insanity, and that would mean they would be aware that what they believed <strong>was</strong> insanity, and thus wouldn&#39;t be insane. But insanity comes in so many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many, etc. forms and there are multiple forms of insanity that humanity currently believes as truth that even if they become aware that one thing they believe about reality is insanity, if they believe in any other form of insanity they are still insane, and thus they have to be able to see <strong>all</strong> insanity for what it is, and realize that everything they believe about reality is insanity. </p>

<p>Personal preferences do not constitute beliefs about reality, and since those are the only beliefs that actually matter (since they continue to keep humanity the way it is), they are the only ones that will come into discussion. If you believe that ketchup is better than mustard, and you are adamant about it, then that is completely fine and more power to you, because it stems from personal preference, and thus subjectivity, and is <strong>exactly</strong> the type of thing subjectivity should be used for. I go into subjectivity and its equal importance with objectivity in one of those links, so please read that link in detail, and reread it.</p>

<p>Now all of those who have downvoted my previous post, and who will downvote this one, are absolutely insane, and are not aware that they are insane, because the only reason anyone would downvote that is if they disagreed with it, and that would mean they have a belief about the objective truth that it is itself simply a belief. </p>

<p>To downvote the simple, logical truth that there plainly and simply <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> be more than one everything means that they are so insane that they actually believe that an absolutely impossible and broken reality that could not ever work (it goes against the structure and form of reality itself), even though language (the word everything, in its purest form, means <strong>all things</strong> ever, anywhere, at any time, in any form) shows the fundamental and unfathomable absurdity of such a thing.</p>

<p>And undoing that insanity and curing it all starts with undoing a single, solitary belief that negativity is part of the natural state of things. This belief, and the (seemingly) pure negativity that comes along with it, prevents one from using the mental faculties of taking into account all of the obvious evidence, making all of the connections needed between everything, and using logic to order those connections in the correct sequence to find the truth. </p>

<p>Once you&#39;re able to do these things, then you are able to finally begin to understand and appreciate everything that I have talked about. And there is a shortcut for all of that to happen. My posts are that shortcut, because essentially nowhere else will you find posts like mine that show and explain as much as possible within reason in as extreme of detail all of these things, and why/how they are the objective truth. Subjective experience is absolutely needed to learn that crucial lesson and be able to do these things, but reading my posts, and interacting with me provides such an experience.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s akin to humanity being in a continuous nightmare that it is unable to wake up from, and keeps believing it has woken up, only to realize the nightmare has not ended. And then someone <em>actually</em> wakes up, and they <em>actually</em> know that they&#39;ve woken up, not simply believe that they have. And that person knows exactly how and why they woke up, knows exactly how to help the rest of humanity finally wake up, understands and appreciates just how supremely important it is that the rest of humanity wakes up, and has the upmost desire to help humanity wake up from the nightmare. </p>

<p>But that person also understands and appreciates that obsession with a cause stems from belief and thus knows that priorities are in order. And since that person knows that the nightmare absolutely will end (because there are other beings constantly visiting humanity that have also woken up from the nightmare and will not let the nightmare become so bad where its irreversible), that person knows that they simply don&#39;t need to devote their entire life to helping everyone else wake up. They can work towards that goal at their own pace, and because they are still learning too (learning never stops), they hone and refine their methods over time so as to be most efficient as possible (efficiency means both as thorough as possible, while being as fast as possible, with thoroughness taking upmost importance over speed).</p>

<p>So that person will live their life, free from the nightmare, and help everyone wake up at their own pace, because its completely ok, and actually better, that they do so.</p>

<p>In conclusion, please read all of those links <em>in detail</em> and reread them again so you can begin to understand and appreciate <strong>all of it</strong>, and then interact with me (as in reply to me, message me, etc.) so I can further help you (within reason) understand and appreciate everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post has a good intention, but, unfortunatelly suffers of the same mistake of which we accuse science of making (or rather the whole western materialist/causalistic mindset). We rightfully accuse science of unfoundedly negating any spiritual or conciouss element of reality in favor of the deterministic/materialistic and at its core atomistic view of reality.</p>

<p>You have gotten too far in the other direction, while correctly framing the emotional and thought making phenomena as a part of this world, not the &quot;esoteric&quot; one, you deny this part of reality the importance it inherently has. </p>

<p>You should not look to discredit or dismiss your toughts and emotions, even if they induce suffering, because they are there for a reason. The problem comes when you identify yourself with it, which is the ultimate fall of the western civilization and probably most of the world by now. In that sense, you, meaning conciousness, identify your self with the &quot;materialistic&quot;, with the vessel, in essence with the body. While it is easier to distinguish yourself from the body, it is harder to do so from your operative mind, your ego. In philosophy this is called entrapement in the ego (note im not a native english speaker and am not sure what the proper english term is).</p>

<p>By ignoring and dismissing the ego you are doing a disservice to yourself, because you are not seeking the reason why ego induces suffering. You are running from the problem, essentially, instead of fixing it. </p>

<p>Do you really think that we are here to dismiss this existence, go meditate on a mountain every day for the rest of our life and not engage this world or our pysical body? That is the ultimate destimation of the view you presented. You may be right, however i dont agree. Ignoring the ego will never bring you happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post! Attachment leads to suffering and is an ego defense mechanism, including wishing for &#39;good&#39; things to happen to this meat body. Seeing things as good or bad could well be a form of attachment. All forms of attachment can be reduced with conscious intent which is practiced widely in eastern cultures. This seems to go against the grain of western cultures as attachment is greatly valued by many in them. Much love!</p>
