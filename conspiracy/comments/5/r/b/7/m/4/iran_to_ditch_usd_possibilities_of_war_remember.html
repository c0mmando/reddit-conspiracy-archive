      <p>
       Many foreign governments hold onto USD in order to buy oil, if other countries start following suit it could lead to the devaluation of USD. Iran plans to ditch USD...
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait!
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember Iraq - Sadam threatened to value his oil in EUR as a reactionary measure against US intervention
Remember Libya - Gaddafi wanted to price his oil in gold-backed African currency
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the Iran Deal
      </p>
      <p>
       If we believe the maintenance of the Petrodollar was a huge incentive for many of the US interventions over the past 20 - 30 years, what Iran is doing could allow us to gain further insight into what the deep state desires, as we have evidence (From HRC/Blumenthal emails) that the deep state wanted to maintain USD as the standard. Will there be war with Iran to prevent this?
      </p>
      <p>
       We already saw what the CIA did to Iran in 1953, let's see what happens now

       The media is setting Trump up to be the biggest scapegoat in history; they keep painting him in a poor light at this point, why not paint him worse? Take advantage of the situation the election brought, never has the country reacted this negatively towards a US president. Use Trump and have him take the blame for some new war, some new intervention, the people already hate him, it wouldn't make much difference if they hate him more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the perfect president to have start another war, and as we know war = $; remember the military-industrial complex, and even more recently the intelligence-industrial complex

       The real power above the level of President. I always smile when people say 'Obama did this!' and Trump did that!'. They just read the scripts from the real bosses and remember JFK.

       I doubt Trump gives a damn, "scapegoat" or not. If he gets billion dollar reconstruction contracts, or some of the money from arms manufacturers, why would he give a damn about what the plebs say about him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every US Puppet in Chief will have their war, it does not matter if people hate him. Both parties are the same and the Americans are unwilling to vote for 3rd parties... plus the 3rd parties are clowns. One always have an "Aleppo moment", while the other raised more for the recount than campaign.

      <p>
       War will never stop, and things will never change for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, he can order the CIA to kill the 13 families and we'd be done with all this nonsense. Unfortunately, this is not as profitable and he's likely in cahoots with them anyway. Why would he piss off his billionaire friends and associates for "the people" anyway?

       Change will only come when the masses are awake. The American masses have been sleeping while being an absolute jingoist for over 200 years, supporting the wars and mass murder all over the world.

      <p>
       Change will only come when the same masses call for an end to the Federal Reserve, execute the 13 families, execute the banksters that scammed the masses, execute the traitors that sold the country, execute the war criminals (including politicians and veterans, CIA, mercenaries) that fought the wars, etc.

       Trump is attuning the public to war in Irak, presumably "against ISIS". In reality it will be to undermine Iran's influence in its Shiite neighbor. Thus he will be doing Netanyahu's bidding. The whole Trump-Putin connection is devised as a smokescreen to the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">
        Trump-Netanyahu connection.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Netanyahu also wants to bomb Iran, and Sheldon Adelson
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCW4IasWXc">
        wants to nuke it.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there is a high probability IMO that Trump and/or Netanyahu start a war against Iran.

       The move simply and firmly puts Iran on side with Russia and China where those two have mutually agreed to use their own currencies on any oil and gas purchases between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have of course been stockpiling gold which may mean that they're actually using gold backed securities or certificates that can be periodically exchanged for gold for those transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran, of course, sells the bulk of it's oil to China so it's offensive and unnecessary for either of them to have to use US currency for those transactions especially with the kind of open hostility that shows through on any pronouncements or comments the US government makes about either of them. If China and Russia are willing to pay Iran in gold and vice versa there can be no legitimate objections to it. It's quite simply the best and most fair form of exchange that there is and it's only a matter of time before the entire world gets back on that bus and on with real life rather than one that is driven by completely worthless paper in the hands of a consortium of  charlatans and con men trying to buy up the world with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go to war with Iran and you'll have to go to war with Russia and China as well while the entire world would rather drop the petro-dollar altogether than go that far to try and save it which is precisely what will happen if things start to look like they're headed that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       While no one is coming right out and saying it, beyond admitting that the entire western banking and financial system is in critical condition, is that it not only can't be saved, but shouldn't be saved because it's the corrupt and criminal activities within and between the banks and financial institutions themselves that have brought the crisis about. So it will be necessary for any financial reset to work that government banks, not private ones, restore confidence in their individual currencies by issuing and using gold or precious metals or the most stable commodities they possess to back certificates for all international transactions.
