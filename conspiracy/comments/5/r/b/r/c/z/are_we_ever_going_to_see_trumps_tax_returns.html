       I'm not sure its actually relevant but it was brought up multiple times during the election. It was also said multiple times that his reason for not releasing them (being under audit) did not make sense. Does anyone know why it might be a big deal?

       Well alot of people wanted access during the election, but i dont know if this was just media bloodhounding. There are concerns about conflicts of interest. Corporate manipulation of government is a problem in America and it was the only issue he really seemed dodgy on during the election.

       You should.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Inauguration Day, Trump apparently filed his candidacy for 2020. Beyond being unusual, this opens up the ability for him to start accepting “campaign contributions” right away. Given that a sizable fraction of the campaign funds from the previous cycle were paid directly to the Trump organization in exchange for building leases, etc., at inflated rates, you can assume that those campaign coffers are a mechanism by which US nationals can easily give cash bribes directly to Trump. Non-US nationals can, of course, continue to use Trump’s hotels and other businesses as a way to funnel money to him.

       I am neutral as well.  The presidency actually has much more limited power than anyone thinks.  But the liberals won't let this go until they find out he gave 50K to Putin for his birthday.  THEN they will have him!!

       It is very relevant, otherwise he would have released them, as he said he would "happily" do. If revealed, we would know who he is in debt to, if certain vodka-producing foreign powers (not Poland) have contributed to his coffers, and get a better picture of the enormous webs of potential conflicts of interest that will mar his presidency...all doubts which could be calmly resolved if he would release them. He said he would about a hundred times, then Kellyanne Conway said last week, of course he won't.

       They may be leaked though, who knows. They will never voluntarily be released, and this should be a very concerning thing.

       A few possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. Something really bad is in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. Normal billionaire stuff is in them that will fuel a media frenzy even if it's not particularly bad by billionaire politician standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may hold out on releasing them or release them at a useful time. They might get leaked to someone and released to the public asap. Or they might get leaked to a partisan and released at a useful time.

       Nope.  Whatever is in them disqualifies him from being president,  and his supporters would rather people stay ignorant.  Thats the only way their cult can succeed.

       His tax returns are literally nothing more than a talking point to stir people up.  Neither the Democrat or Republican or shadow elite or George Soros, or anybody who matters, give a literal shit about his tax returns.  The tax returns are a great little media device to stir some shit up in the public, and they were sort of fun to bullshit about during the debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there something amiss with his tax returns?  I bet.  Does anybody besides the public really care or plan to do anything about it?  Probably not

       Just had a thought. They will probably wait until they start to revise the tax code.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they are ready they will release them. The MSM and people will go ape shit because he probably pays little to no tax (maybe even got a refund).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they will say - look the system is rigged! We need to change the rules!
      </p>
      <p>
       This will force the establishment's hand to pass whatever tax legislation Bannon and Mercer have planned.

       and suppose he dd ...  and it shows he payed 0$ of tax last year and the last 20 years. what would that prove? except the fact that american tax laws are vague and meant for people like trump? just because he has a good accountant means he did something wrong?
      </p>

       i mean, would tax the shit out of the rich but first fix your laws, fire congress or whoever is writing them and get new irs inspectors after you send these to gitmo for betraying their country.

       No we wont...and the only thing you would find in there is things like "he didn't pay much in taxes due to loopholes" or "he isn't worth what he said he is worth"...
