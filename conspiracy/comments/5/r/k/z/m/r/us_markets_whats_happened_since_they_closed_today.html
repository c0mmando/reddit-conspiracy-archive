        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today was another insanely manipulated day on Wall St. I don&#39;t even know where to start but I&#39;ll try to make this short and sweet. </p>

<p>All you need to know is that US (and other) markets are propped up on algorithm traded space-cash, cognitive dissonance and media oversight. This isn&#39;t a secret. Markets and equities have been overvalued for a long time.</p>

<p>Earlier this evening transcripts were &quot;leaked&quot; from the WH around the same time that market futures started to retreat. They&#39;ve retreated more significantly since. </p>

<p>If (when) the market drops tomorrow I&#39;ll be shocked if the intrinsic weaknesses of the market gets any meaningful widely disseminated press. &quot;Trump chews out Australian and Mexican PMs causing markets to retreat&quot; is a headline everyone can understand and get pissed about. </p>

<p>The &quot;leaking&quot; of the transcripts and the timing makes me raise an eyebrow too. The way that markets have set themselves up over the last days, weeks, months, hell even years... has culminated in a precarious market positioning that is crowded on the long side.</p>

<p>Are those transcripts usually made public? If not I&#39;d say the smart money is on them being leaked intentionally. </p>

<p>We shall see... had to put it out there though... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While markets were open, yeah it was biz as usual (highly manipulated). When they close though index futures (DOW, S&amp;P500, etc), Forex futures(currencies) and commodity futures(oil, gold, etc) Are traded throughout the night (also Asian markets are open which have an impact). Everything I mentioned is down. Pretty significantly as I type this. So if you have long term investments or trade during the day and overnight futures trading goes south... you can end up being screwed in a big way with no way of knowing (if you&#39;re sleeping) or no way of stopping it because markets aren&#39;t opened until 9:30a (pre-market at 6a if you have access but still you&#39;re going to take a hit)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well markets usually go up and diversification helps mitigate potential downside. Most people pay someone else do it for them. Most people also (pay to) get screwed up the pooper pretty good once every 8 years too. It&#39;s a wealth concentrating machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the dollar crashes, the could mean serious supply line disruptions. You should have 3-6 months food and water storage for an event like this, especially if you like in a big city where just-in-time logistics predominates.</p>

<p>In order to protect your stores, bullets is also very important to have. In addition, liquor and medicine is great to have around and is very good for bartering.</p>

<p>Thinking longer term, having silver, gold, and bitcoin will probably be invaluable once the dust settles. They are also very good to have in the case we go through a slower, less sudden devaluation of fiat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The PPT if anything will slow the crash so that Warren Buffet and his buddies can optimally short the market all the way down. Buffet bought $12B in stock after the election. He will sell what&#39;s now $16B at the top and hoard the shares available to sell short in to the dive and come out with $12B on top of his original $12B. Real American hero. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Central banks around the world are buying US equities. The Fed won&#39;t admit to it but you can be sure they are printing space cash and giving it to the likes of Deutche Bank, Credit Suisse, Central Bank XYZ, Carl Ichan or whoever the fuck will buy as many Goldman shares as it takes to throat punch the bears and jack the market 10% in 3 months. At least 16 CBs gave up on low yield treasuries a few years ago. In 2008 you were a tinfoil hat wearing lunatic suggesting that CBs were buying equities. Now the wsj runs articles about it. </p>
