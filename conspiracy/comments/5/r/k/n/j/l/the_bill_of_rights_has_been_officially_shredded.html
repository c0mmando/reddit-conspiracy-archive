It turns out that it’s one of the greatest foundations upon which the United States’ edicts of liberty rest upon.  Without it, you pretty much <em>have</em> no rights in America.  The <em>entire</em> Bill Of Rights save one inconsequential provision is entirely nullified if you allow the state to imprison you without just legal cause.</p>

<p>And oh yeah.  By the way, that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what&#39;s happened.</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus has been <em>entirely</em> destroyed.  Watch the video <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15220450/ns/msnbc-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/t/death-habeas-corpus/#.WJKwWrYrK4B">here.</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  My red pill was realizing a few years ago that I may have had ET contact experiences when I was younger - and coming to the topic of &quot;conspiracies&quot; from that particular angle - so quite a FAR different red pill altogether.  I was never <em>eeevver</em> politically oriented or ever interested in politics my entire life.  Still stray pretty far away from a lot of it actually, so there&#39;s a lot I simply don&#39;t focus on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a <em>lot</em> more politically conscious now, but it actually doesn&#39;t have anything to do with any <em>direct</em> interest in the political machinations of TPTB as much as it has to do with an investigation into how and why they suppress their knowledge of the existence of ETs in the cosmos, this galaxy, this solar system, and on this very planet from the human beings on Earth.</p>

<p>Depending on the subject, my eyes are anywhere from “very much open” to “still closed”.  That’s the case with everyone.  Anyone who thinks differently, simply isn’t thinking.  So (again) what’s your point?</p>

<p>I completely agree, but you made this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re telling people their eyes aren&#39;t open while you&#39;re eyes have apparently just been open themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the total inconsequentiality of it seemed to indicate to me that you came here only to make empty, uselessly argumentative points.</p>

<p>You initiated a completely unsolicitedly comment from the very beginning when you first said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re the one who didn&#39;t realize this had happened until almost 20 years later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds pretty damn aggressive and unnecessarily argumentative to me.  So that&#39;s why you got the previous &quot;Good boy&quot; response.</p>

<p>If you really are interested in coming on here and being on the same team and working together, then I certainly am too - but it seems you have to give a bit more thought to how your own comments are coming across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the internet.  It&#39;s Reddit.  We&#39;re using textual communication where inflection and intention are often extremely difficult if not impossible to properly discern.  You&#39;ve never responded to any post of mine before as far as I can tell.  People often use the word &quot;friend&quot; in a sarcastic manner under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Given this context, it is absolutely not unreasonable that this first statement on your part was discerned as initial snarky sarcasm preceding an attempt at a snide comment.</p>

<p>It seems apparent that there has been ample amounts of misinterpretation that has taken place on <em>both</em> of our parts.  I was wrong, you were wrong.</p>

<p>So now.  I&#39;m okay and ready to get past this misunderstanding and moving on to something more constructive at this point if you are.</p>
