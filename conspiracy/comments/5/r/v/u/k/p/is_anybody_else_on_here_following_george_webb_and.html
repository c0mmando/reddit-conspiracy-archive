    <div class="md"><p>This literally explains how upper echelon elite worldwide can be complicit in this thing - when I read those accusations being made by 4chan leakers, i didnt understand how or why that could be possible - but im literally seeing it unfold in this investigation.  You are correct; this is very heavy stuff.  I have an open mind, yet even I want to grab my head and rock back and fourth in my chair</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - but I skipped way ahead to day 100, I think, where he changed the name of the series.  Its like, just mind blowing.  It explains the whole battle over sanctuary cities, immigration, high crime/mortality rate cities like chicago that the gov wont do anything about, and shady foreign involvement in places like Haiti, Libya ect.  Im still trying to sort it out myself - rewatching them a second time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s nothing like George Webb, but Here&#39;s what I have to offer:</p>

<p>Trumps top economic advisor Steven Feinberg. I want to point out that the clintons and Feinberg are close too, George Webb does the work on this.</p>

<p>Feinberg owns Cerberus. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus_Capital_Management%20http://i.imgur.com/5HdPg7b.jpg">Cerberus owns dyncorp.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xTJe3F9zmvg">Dyncorp trafficks children.</a></p>

<p>So trump has had several pedo island visits and his top advisor is THE guy who sets up brownstone operations. </p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t know, brownstone is the killing of children. They do it on a sacrificial stone, they shit their pants when they die. BROWNSTONE.</p>

<p>While they don&#39;t still kill them as offerings on stones, the name stuck.</p>

<p>On to Steven Feinberg. He own dyncorp as established above. Dyncorp is the CIAs hand that gets the children and takes pics of them with politicians and cops, ducking.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is one of my older visits, people have pointed out that:</p>

<p>We have no proof trump visited pedo island. </p>

<p>And I think that&#39;s all from what I recall.</p>

<p>The proof is in the butlers ledger. I believe trumps name is on the list. And like FAA flight registration of something like that.</p>

second - thats not what a brownstone operation is.  At least according to what i saw in george&#39;s presentation or a search online.   Where did you get that info from?  Seems like purposeful disinfo</p>

<p>You can just google &quot;Epstein flight logs&quot; on google images and see them. I watch George Webb too and never have I heard him claim Trump flew on his jet, and even if he did there&#39;s absolutely no evidence of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this. Is he should have stopped at day 91 when  they found Braverman and started over. Hes kinda letting hillary off the hook. Also my biggest problem is if Obama was mad about the gas attacks why didn&#39;t he stop this? Obama could have put hillary in jail instead he campaign for her </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By all accounts he IS cia.  His real father was Frank Marshall Davis, an African American Communist and pornographer. Obama&#39;s mom was a cia honeypot.</p>

<p>Google images &quot;Frank Marshall Davis&quot; and plan to be amazed. Then, find &quot;Dreams from My REAL Father&quot; -- gets into EVERYTHING, his entire history, cia, Saul Alinsky, Bill Ayers, you name it.</p>

<p>The &quot;born in Kenya&quot; thing was a misdirect, feign on the birth certificate. It was always about who his actual father was. That&#39;s why Trump could push and push the birth cert thing, then one day declare that BO was born in the US. Period.  He was&#39;t lying because both things were true. The bc was forged but not where he was born, who his real father was.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Going deeper down the rabbit hole, the next question is who are Sascha and Malia&#39;s real parents?  How about Obama best friends from Chicago Marty Nesbitt <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/Nesbitt-Marty-and%20Malia.jpg">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/Nesbitt-Marty-and%20Malia.jpg</a> and his wife Anita Blanchard, MD <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/Nesbitt-Anita-and%20Sasha.jpg">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/Nesbitt-Anita-and%20Sasha.jpg</a>?</p>

<p>But but but, there are lots of photos of the Obama&#39;s as a family when the girls were little.  True, and I photoshop for a hobby and I could do a better job than was done on ALL the photos the Obama&#39;s individually and it as a family.  Their ENTIRE story from top to bottom is pure fiction.</p>

<p>Why would those people give up their daughters?  I can think of 1,000 reasons.  Those girls were still always around them and - if you could help the first Black person to become the US President, who knows what you might be willing to do. Maybe those two are also cia, were threatened (least likely but who knows) - or they&#39;re all satanists linked together by that. </p>

<p>98% sure Obama is gay.  Michelle is the beard. Whether she is trangendered or not, I haven&#39;t a clue. Their wedding photos also bad photoshopping.</p>

<p>It is really SO easy to fool us!!  We can&#39;t even imagine it. We think, &quot;But I&#39;d never do something like that.&quot; True, but they&#39;re not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a few tidbits to ponder.</p>

He&#39;s all right letting Hillary off the hook just to make it all stop, which makes sense to me, pardon all of them if it means the machine that funnels children, organs, and money to the wealthy stops, and all the information is open for everyone to see. And yeah, Obama&#39;s probably in on it too, he had no problem dropping bombs and flying drones. Brownstone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great- thank you.</p>

<p>I have to ask... lets say a war broke out between countries/organizations/private armies ect as a result of this; this is similar in effect to the holocaust if all true (testing viruses on swaths of people, human trafficking for sex and organs; this is literally the holocaust).</p>

<p>Based on George Webb&#39;s players who are involved in this, what would you say the &#39;teams&#39; would be?  Would American military be opposed to the trafficker regime under Trump? I imagine the Vatican army would be fighting to defend the dyncorp side, along with whatever armies the CIA/clinton regime are in charge of.  What other countries would join in on this?</p>

<p>This is the most logical build up of events I&#39;ve seen that could lead to a world war.  If this conspiracy implicates multiple governments, the war is basically a battle of good (countries/armies that want to stop this) vs evil (governments commanding armies that are implicated).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the LEAST religious person out here,  after following this for years and asking myself the same questions,  it&#39;s UNbelievable that a few weeks ago I came to the conclusion that this really is a battle of good vs evil.  I have this overwhelming desire to run out and buy a crucifix!</p>

<p>For awhile,  I thought all of this was was the result of psychopaths bubbling to the to top all around the world.  But when Pi z@g @ te  broke and I realized that Satanism really existed in the western world and that the scope of it was global and so widespread in even small communities, I finally got a clue. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that most people are regular with a few Satanists floating around.  It&#39;s that most people are Satanists with a few regular people floating around.   </p>

<p>The scope of that satanism makes my blood run cold. Thank god for at least some people on reddit or I&#39;d be more terrified and freaked out than I am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean, but in my opinion, all of the satanism stuff is equally as fabricated as the positive religious stuff (like catholicism or islam), all of which to keep people and their minds busy and filled with nonsense.</p>

<p>They probably do worship something higher, but it is probably something rooted in science / energy; the satanism shit is just a good way to throw us off the scent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t &#39;feed on fear&#39; in the theatrical vampiric sense - but fear &#39;gives them power&#39;, figuratively speaking.  They do terrible unimaginable things to strike fear into their opposition.  This fear seizes people who have a conscience - if you fear them, you will not fight back, and you &#39;give them all the power&#39;.  Its all parables</p>

<p>Read my thread &quot;The Good Word&quot; - this is a war with literal sociopaths.  Systematic psychopathy.  Anybody who isn&#39;t one of them is enslaved by them (through lies/deceit/illusions (us)) or through blackmail (their cronies/peers).  </p>

<p>They are the opposite of us.  Its a ying &amp; yang.  People have to realize that Ted Bundy exists on a MASS scale; they aren&#39;t just one in a million.</p>

<p>Good people build kingdoms and get preoccupied developing science/tech and having imaginations; and bad people slowly contaminate the system over loooong periods of time while the good people are preoccupied.  What the bad people lack in imagination, passion and brilliance, they make up for in patience, cunning and deception.  The bad people slip their way into every single crack of business, banking, entertainment, religion and government.  By time anybody catches on, its usually too late.</p>
