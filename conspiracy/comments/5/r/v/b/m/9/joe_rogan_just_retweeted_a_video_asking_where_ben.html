<blockquote>
<p>Considering the widespread attention that segment got, especially in the alt-right sphere, and the fact that the story had nothing to do with Atlanta, it seems as if Swann was given a missive by the stationthat he needed to delete his website and social media accounts if he wanted to come back, as he was placed on hiatus after the segment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/cbs-anchor-who-defended-pizzagate-conspiracy-has-shut-down-website-social-media-accounts/">http://www.mediaite.com/online/cbs-anchor-who-defended-pizzagate-conspiracy-has-shut-down-website-social-media-accounts/</a></p>

<p>This led me to a very interesting article </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story seemed to be less targeted toward the CBS46 audience and more to his national audience on his separate Truth in Media website, where he often questions mainstream media’s take on various stories. Swann was hired in June 2015 by CBS46 but was able to keep his Truth in Media site, which the Daily Beast noted is linked to a Republican political action committee. The Daily Beast also noted that he had worked for Russia Today, a Russian government funded media operation, and a radio network that the Anti-Defamation League has criticized for featuring anti-Semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The new ownership of the UFC wants to change things up, they&#39;ve hinted at it. It&#39;s not 100% but it&#39;s ultimately a dumb decision. Joe brought a lot of people to the sport, and I don&#39;t know who could do a better job as a color commentator. However, he definitely has opened up to more intense subjects recently, and this podcast was an eye opener above all else. The above comments are all correct. </p>

He&#39;s openly said numerous times the only reason he stayed was because of Dana and has hinted more and more that he prefers to do fight companions. 
Also he signed a short term contract, only does main events (not fight nights) and will not travel outside of the US for the UFC. 
Atleast that&#39;s what I remember hearing in one of his podcasts </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Everyone has their flaws.  I’m not sorry I can’t see past his, however, because A) what I’ve seen of him has shown me that he’s little more than a spitting loudmouth, agent provocateur asshole that knows little other than yelling as blatantly as he can.  That’s annoying as fuck and nothing I feel is worthy of giving my attention to.  Additionally B) there are many other sources that are far better than him.  I’m not losing anything by not paying attention to Alex Jones.</p>

<p>I didn’t watch any of it.  It’s Alex Jones.  I am repulsed by him.  He’s literally poison to watch.</p>

<p>Sounds like they had a good interview then, and I’m glad for that.  I’m glad many perhaps got some good out of watching it.  Again, however, I’ll simply get my info from better sources other than him.</p>

When asked, he would know exactly the keywords to google to get the right article/evidence. </p>

<p>If it were simply Joe and him, minus the fucking weed and booze (the tangents were frustrating) and Joe would just slow him down and prove each claim slowly and really make him analyze his thoughts, it would be incredible. Every time Joe challenged him Alex gave him the sources. My only reservation is when anyone, not just him, talks about having &quot;high level informants&quot; it&#39;s easy to just throw that out there to cover up any ramblings. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  This is true.  However, to have trouble speaking concisely in a “nice pretty sentence” is a far, FAR cry from being incapable of blabbering as loudly and obnoxiously and offensively as you can when you open your mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know he can go on long explanations and it can get challenging to follow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It’s not about that.  At all.  I have zero problem following long-winded, complicated explanations.  I live on complicated, long-winded thought patterns.  I have a degree in Philosophy, so my mind is geared toward them.  It’s about his being a loudmouth asshole.  I was able to tell pretty much from the first moment I saw/heard him <em>many</em> years ago (half a decade or more perhaps) that he was a loudmouth agent provocateur - and that was before I even knew what an “agent provocateur” was.</p>

<p>I saw him and immediately thought “Blach.  This guy’s here to piss in the water.  No thanks.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the things he says line up and do check out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s cool.  I have too many other sources that have much better information than he does to bother listening to him, however.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like that show was a good, helpful presentation then.  Glad Rogan was able to make that happen.</p>

<p>And I’m glad you took no offense at anything I said. :)  That makes me feel good since I certainly didn’t mean anything in any offensive manner.  Cheers,</p>

<p>Can you explain this number to me and provide a source? I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re necessarily wrong I&#39;m just curious what &quot;90 million downloads&quot; actually translates to in terms of listenership because I have a really difficult time believing that <em>90 million</em> people are individually downloading listening to JRE if that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>Worse than bad. It was telling. It was nearly proof that he was nothing more than controlled opposition to move things leftward. If he was for <em>real</em> -- or if he had the balls it took to be an actual world leader -- he&#39;d not have endorsed Clinton. End of story.</p>

<p>Why people still support him after that stunt is absolutely beyond me. Completely blind.</p>

<p>??? I&#39;ve been a Trump supporter for a VERY long time, I believe he&#39;s the real deal in defeating globalists.</p>

<p>I would die before voting for a socialist or giving them a dime by my own free will.</p>

<p>That is what I&#39;m betting Trump is doing. We&#39;ll see if he&#39;s for real or not, but he was the only <em>possible</em> anti-establishment choice.</p>

<p>Hey guys, everyone is asking if things are OK. They are. I will be heading back to CBS46 on Monday but there are going to be some changes. The biggest one will be that this social page will go dark f/n on Tzuday, Feb 1. We&#39;ve been building this project for 6 years and those who have come to know me.. I hope you have also come to trust me.</p>

<p>A lot of his opinions are obviously things that you need solid proof for, though. Like stuff he says about other dimensions existing that we&#39;re currently living in and liberals having solved AI. </p>

<p>Very few people in general believe what Alex said and there&#39;s certainly no evidence for any of it.  Yeah there&#39;s a few billionaires working on trying to prove the simulation theory but to exaggerate into what Alex said is purely fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it often depends on the tone of the podcast and the guest as well. I was a bit disappointed as well, it looks like Alex Jones was ready to go deep so Joe got a bit excited with Eddie and thought, &quot;Let&#39;s get high first and then go real deep,&quot; but as is often the way with weed and booze, the idea of what it will be like doesn&#39;t match the reality and they all just got a little sloppy and less engaging, in my opinion anyway. Might have been more manageable if it was only the two of them, but Eddie lost the plot.</p>

<p>Huh?  He literally flop flops on topics all the time.  Did you not listen to the moon hoax clip or watch his show trying &quot;debunk chemtrails&quot; with known shill Mick West?</p>

<p>Things he used to be adamant (and well articulated) about he now says &quot;he&#39;s too stupid to understand&quot;.  Of course he talks about some legit stuff (I&#39;ve gained a lot of insight when I used to listen to him years ago) but he changed at some point and his shilling has increased.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t listen to him I&#39;m just pointing out that he has agendas and you should be aware of it.  </p>

Joe used to have an open mind and knew the moon landing was fake.  He pointed it out with facts and logic.

<p>No I don&#39;t remember.  Joe laid out facts and articulated why the moon landing was a hoax and he never explained why he completely did a 180.  Please be specific on how Neil (your appeal to authority) &quot;dressed him down&quot;.  Neils proof that we went to the moon is &quot;because they had enough fuel to get to the moon&quot;.  Are you serious!? that is the best &quot;scientific proof&quot; that we landed on the moon??</p>

<p>How is he under-educated on the topic when he articulated many valid points and facts previously?  He&#39;s obviously more educated than most on the subject.  The  &quot;we&#39;re too stupid to know so don&#39;t research it&quot; bit is a over the top obvious controlled opposition move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep! I&#39;ve watched them! Or most of them at least. My feeling is that epistemologically, we need to be humble about the level of certainty with which we rely on theories. Beyond the obvious ranges in quality of information, it is necessarily the case that everything we understand is perverted by the lense of our perceptions--biases, misunderstandings, even our sense&#39;s base imperfection at measuring the world around us. </p>

<p>Joe Rogan is advancing alternative theories all the time--he&#39;s <em>not</em> saying the moon landing was 100% real and everyone who believes it&#39;s a conspiracy is a moron--he&#39;s actually totally leaving room for the possibility and giving a platform for the compelling bits of evidence to reach an audience. </p>

<p>His reservation is an acknowledgement of the fact that he does not have the authority to say with certainty, because he, as do we all, comes from a place of ignorance. That, in my view, is an appropriate way to discuss ideas about which you aren&#39;t certain.</p>

<p>People like Alex Jones, who--feel me on this--I have grown up with and have lots of appreciation for--talk about under-evidenced ideas (many of which have truth to them) in a way that is less credible because he overstates the certainty, editorializes over-ambitiously, and ends up being way off the mark a lot of times.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m overlooking something though--totally open to counterpoints and the possibility that I am incorrect!</p>

<p>So you watched him get a mainstream network show and the first episode team up with known mega shill Mick West, that literally &quot;debunks&quot; any and every conspiracy?  Joe then came to the conclusion that chemtrails are bs, basically because Mick said so. It was ridiculous and cringy.  Anybody that watched it rationally, could see it was a hit piece. </p>

<p>I agree, but what does that have to do with Joe dismissing all of his valid points and becoming &quot;too stupid&quot; without explanation?  He is apparently too stupid to examine the moon hoax now but he is smart enough to dismiss chemtrails as bs, hmmm..</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You could say this about almost anything or subject though.  Are you suggesting that we are all so ignorant that we are not capable of researching topics and coming to valid conclusions?  Should we just have the mantra of &quot;we are too ignorant to figure out truths for ourselves&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That, in my view, is an appropriate way to discuss ideas about which you aren&#39;t certain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure but the point is he was certain before (and very articulated if you listen to the clip I linked).  When Neil De Grasse Tyson came on his show he didn&#39;t bring up any of the great facts and points that he had in the past and basically said he was too stupid to know.  Neil&#39;s proof that we went to the moon is &quot;because they had the right amount of fuel to get to the moon&quot;.  Glad that amazing insight changed Joe&#39;s mind, lol.  Even Joe&#39;s good friend Eddy Bravo called him out on air on this.  Joe never explained why he made such a drastic change on the subject.  Maybe if Joe could articulate why he now dismisses all of the previous evidence that he was so passionate about it would make a little more sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People like Alex Jones</p>

<p>Alex is over the top obvious controlled opposition.  Anyone that has research this subject matter for any length of time knows this.  Joe and Alex have been good friends for many years.  Joe is basically a more sophisticated  version of Alex.  Joe talks about great subjects and has good discussions but the above examples are what I&#39;m talking about.  He has millions of listeners and can easily sway opinions.  That is what controlled opposition does, they talk about many legit subjects but then subtley change their view on important subjects or &quot;debunk&quot; hot button issues.  Chemtrails are something that are observable and obviously something real.  Him &quot;debunking&quot; them should set bells off in the mind of anyone that is critically thinking.</p>

<p>I research subjects thoroughly before I draw any conclusions.  If you have properly researched the moon landing at any depth you will come to the conclusion that the evidence supplied by NASA that we landed on the moon is a joke.  It can be proven false in so many different ways.  Have you researched the subject thoroughly and found that there is sufficient evidence that we went to the moon and NASA hasn&#39;t been caught in numerous lies?  Again, go listen to Joe Rogan lay out why &quot;there is no way that we went to the moon&quot; before he completely flopped on the subject and tell me he doesn&#39;t make a good argument, far better that &quot;we&#39;re too stupid to know&quot;.</p>

<p>People that get so big they have there own network tv show are not allowed to talk about everything they might want to.  So I would say there are all controlled to some degree, at that level.</p>

<p>What? Why do you think he&#39;s necessarily &quot;compromised&quot; by &quot;Hollywood&quot; somehow? He&#39;s most famously known in Hollywood as a character actor of bit parts and as the host of an embarrassingly popular game show; he&#39;s pretty goddamn low on the totem pole of Hollywood &quot;elite&quot; and he&#39;s not really actively apart of it or has any stake in it at any given time (and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not enormously popular but I don&#39;t know how much one would consider UFC part of &quot;Hollywood&quot;). He&#39;s made his living doing stand up (i.e. working outside the Hollywood system) for most of his career and now his podcast. There are plenty of ways to be an independent entertainer/performer and not have to answer to corporate interests/control and stand up and hosting your own podcast are pretty much how he&#39;s able to say whatever he wants at all times.</p>
