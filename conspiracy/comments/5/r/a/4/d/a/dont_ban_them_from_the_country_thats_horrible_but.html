    <div class="md"><p>Obama&#39;s administration probably selected these 7 countries because they have such a high level of instability that the government doesn&#39;t have any amount of control over a significant portion of their citizens. As a result, it is <em>impossible</em> to screen the people that come in. A refugee from all of these countries (except for Iran) could as well be a guy who beheaded 50 people and we would have no way to know.</p>

<p>Why would Saudi-Arabia be included in the list? The SA government is the government on this planet I&#39;d like to see deposed the most, but it is a fact that SA is probably the most stable country in the region. If anyone dared to support ISIS there, he would immediately be thrown into a dungeon and get tortured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These seven nations were not chosen at random. They were all singled out as exceptional security risks in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015 and its 2016 extension. In fact, President Trump’s orderdoes not even name the seven countries. It merely refers to the sections of U.S. Code that were changed by the Terrorist Prevention Act:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we did ban all countries it would be less of an issue morally, but also untenable because rich people want to have the freedom to migrate and bring family and friends, etc. The seven countries banned were all the poor ones. Which is the real purpose. And hey, if reactionary bitches would admit that, I suppose I&#39;d have less of a problem with it. But if you pretend it had anything to do with Muslims, you&#39;re just as bad as the liberals under Obama have been for the last eight years. Intellectual and moral cowards, lazy and liars. Which is of course true for those who support Trump, just as it was for Obama&#39;s supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you don&#39;t really have to repeat yourself at all, because nobody&#39;s listening, particularly anyone who&#39;s dictating policy.</p>

<p>But I think you know, or should, that nothing&#39;s going to be &#39;fixed&#39; ever again. The species is undergoing a revolution that will render these arguments moot before we get anything sorted. Technology is largely responsible for the current strife, from the ease with which we can annihilate civilians in far off lands, to the technology used to surveill and select targets. You know Trump&#39;s supporters would never stop short of extermination of their enemies if they could get away with it. And after that they will select new enemies, because the killing is about profit. And the supporters will say &quot;no immigrants until we exterminate this next group of vermin.&quot; And so on, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Unless he were stopped. Which would lead to the permanent crushing of the Republicans. Either way success leads to failure, because the American dream was killed by the deep state, and we&#39;re watching the death rattle of two competing parties who don&#39;t know they&#39;re dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have even taken part in that silly game myself. I was no fan of Obama, even though I voted for him twice. But I often felt compelled to defend him because alot of the criticism was not valid or just plain silly. He is coming for your guns by staging school shootings, hes a closet muslim that will impose sharia. My boss at work told me racism didnt exist anymore, except Obama is racist against white people. Meanwhile Im still waiting for our troops to come home, the wars to end, and the bombs to stop dropping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really believe that the provision of this one link actually answers the accusation of hypocrisy?</p>

<p>1) Compare the size of the protests.  The anti-drone protests were tiny.  Minuscule in comparison to the immigration protests.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8diQyIKjh0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8diQyIKjh0</a>
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/01/a-weekend-of-protest-against-trumps-immigration-ban/514953/">https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/01/a-weekend-of-protest-against-trumps-immigration-ban/514953/</a></p>

<p>2) compare the media coverage of the protests.  There was hardly any for the anti-drone activists.  Do a google search.</p>

<p>3) Compare the tone of language used to describe Obama vs Trump.  Obama used executive power to MURDER innocent people without trial - US citizens.  Trump used it to deny ingress to the country.  It&#39;s obvious that Obama&#39;s actions are morally WAY worse.  Murder is - last I checked - pretty much one of the worst things you can do.  A murder victim has no recourse.  And yet - it&#39;s Trump who is being described consistently as a Fascist that is destroying the democratic institutions that govern the country.  Obama is never talked about in those terms.</p>

<p>4) Finally - the hypocrisy of Liberals doesn&#39;t justify Trump&#39;s policies - but it does undermine liberalism as a genuine and viable political alternative.  Since - if someone like Hillary and Obama is the alternative - then we are still getting murderous a-holes that like bvpassing congress and centralising executive power - and using that power to do horrible, horrible things.</p>

<p>This failure of liberalism to present itself as a genuine alternative politically strengthens Trump.  Thus the hypocrisy absolutely needs to be challenged.  Yet folks like yourself absolutely refuse to engage in any critical scrutiny in this respect whatsoever.  You find one link on the internet and think that satisfies any decent amount of due-diligence - and then don&#39;t hesitate to insult and belittle those who offer this criticism.</p>

<p>So folks like myself who fucking hate Trump are livid at liberals like yourself who are creating a political reality that practically hands power to Trump on a platter.</p>

<p>And the biggest irony of them all is that the only thing you really need to do in response to this is just say:  well - you know, fuck - we really should have been tougher on Obama for that.  And with that simple response you present liberalism as a consistent and authentic alternative that anyone with a conscience could get behind.  But nope.  That&#39;s too much for some reason.</p>

<p>Gives me a sad.  It really does.</p>

<p>I have said that we should have been tougher on Obama, the problem being I was to busy defending him from bullshit attacks, hes a muslim, he wasn&#39;t born here, etc. I believe it was in this thread.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You are really running circles to blame liberals and liberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before you get all huffy about being blamed for Trump - remember where this conversation started: with you trying to pretend on the flimsiest and most lazy pretense of evidence that there was no liberal hypocrisy at all.</p>

<p>Did you address my criticism of your original claim at all?  Of course you didn&#39;t.  And without doing that due diligence - you still want to reject what is an obvious consequence of that hypocrisy:  that people would come to lose faith in liberalism and turn to that which would punish liberals for that hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Well - you haven&#39;t at all defended your claim that this hypocrisy is real.  Do you manage then at least to challenge the logical connection I make between that hypocrisy and Trump&#39;s rise?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know damn well the president Mccain or president Romney would have kept dropping bombs just like Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep - they are just as responsible.  More so - in a way - since it was their party that provided the vector for Trump&#39;s nomination.  But I&#39;m not having a conversation with a republican neo-con.  I&#39;m having a conversation with you.  So my opportunity here is to promote your growth as a human being.  When I get an opportunity with one of them - I assure you I&#39;ll go for it.</p>

<p>Secondly - conservative failure does nothing to absolve liberals of their share of the blame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We did have a very viable option in Bernie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually - Bernie came out in support of the use of drones.  But beyond that he was very scant on detail when it came to foreign policy.  I really don&#39;t know if he would have been better than the status quo on the issue of bombing people.</p>

<p>Besides that - wasn&#39;t it democratic voters (i.e. supposed liberals) that didn&#39;t vote for him enough in the primaries?  Either that or he was fucked over by the DNC (i.e. more supposed liberals).</p>

<p>So yeah - umm... why aren&#39;t you more angry at liberals for this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but people like you that like to use words as scare tactics, words like liberalism, socialism, scared people off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;d like to judge me on the basis of what I&#39;ve contributed to this conversation - rather than just assuming?  I can assure you - my judgements of you are based entirely on what you&#39;ve said here and nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have said that we should have been tougher on Obama</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well good for you - genuine kudos.  And I mean that sincerely.  But it&#39;s a pity you ruin this admission with the excuse that you give immediately following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the problem being I was to busy defending him from bullshit attacks, hes a Muslim, he wasn&#39;t born here, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a bizarre excuse.  So imagine there is a guy on trial for mass murder.  You&#39;re in the jury - responsible for determining his guilt or innocence.  You actually think he&#39;s guilty.  But then you overhear one of the other jurors accuse him of being something dumb - I dunno... a Vishnu worshipper.  And this juror sure can&#39;t stand the sight of Vishnu worshipers and won&#39;t shut up about it.</p>

<p>Do you think it makes ANY sense in that context for you to defend this guy against the heinous charge of Vishnu worshiping?  That would be as mad as the person who was  obsessed about the question of his Vishnu worshiping in  the first place.  You think he&#39;s guilty of mass murder.  Why on earth would you care that someone had accused him of this dumb accusation?  Why would you spend energy defending him?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the weirdest excuse from an Obama supporter I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you have no excuse for not getting behind liberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally do believe in liberalism.  There just aren&#39;t many people around who seem to genuinely embody it.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Existence is holographic, which means identity and intelligence is holographic as well - which, in turn, means that the personal consciousness we think is so unique to humans...is not really all <em>that</em> unique at all.</p>

<p>Many things (if not all things really) have consciousness.  It&#39;s just often a consciousness that functions on a wavelength or a vibration that we&#39;re not really equipped to properly interpret as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not about being anti-war/anti-Muslim.  It&#39;s about being anti-<em>Trump</em>.  You have to understand it that way.</p>

<p>Clinton didn&#39;t get in.  Soros lost tens of millions the moment Trump got elected.  Clinton is Soros&#39; puppet.  She would have done whatever he wanted.  She&#39;s a war monger.  She would have plunged the <del>country</del> planet into WWIII w/Russia and China, which would have made Soros a LOOOOT of money arming, supplying, aiding, and abetting <del>both sides</del> every side.</p>

<p>Trump beat her, so now Soros be <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ui8uMcTVrLk/Sy8rEx7M4gI/AAAAAAAAAbU/VRhnCrrH4lo/s400/fuuuu10.jpg">like...</a> and is doing everything he can to simply take him the fuck down and out in the hopes of putting someone else in.</p>

<p>Soros wants him out so bad that he&#39;s willing to take five steps back (funding women&#39;s marches and the type of protests that claim to be against what he otherwise finances - i.e. war) just to take ten steps forward (making the individual who&#39;s putting a <em>big</em> ass wrench in his total war machine look horrible in the eyes of the generally ignorant public and replacing him - i.e. Trump).</p>

<p>The militant/terrorists groups are created and funded by the the same U.S.M.I.C. that subsequently ends up bombing them &quot;In the name of freedom!!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Well...if it&#39;s &quot;our&quot; government, then we elected them.  I know we really didn&#39;t, but we need to put them in check if they&#39;re doing shit in our name that we don&#39;t agree with (and they most certainly are).  We don&#39;t and we haven&#39;t been doing that, so a lot of the blood that they spill does in fact end up being in our name.  Many of us don&#39;t like to admit that and we say &quot;I didn&#39;t vote for these assholes!&quot; and I get that.  I didn&#39;t vote for them either.  However, they <em>are</em> doing this shit in our name and we&#39;re not doing nearly enough to stop them from doing it in our name...so in a certain sense, part of the reason our communities have to pick up the pieces is because our communities are at least in part responsible for allowing this piece of shit government to continue wreaking havoc on a global scale...in our name.</p>

<p>Of course.  Doesn’t matter though.  It is in fact in your name to everyone else that isn’t you and who’s not an American and who looks at what <em>your</em> and my and our country is doing “in our name”.</p>

<p>I certainly don’t agree w/what the U.S. is doing by far.  Am I a U.S. citizen, however?  Yes.  Could I fault any foreigner for saying <em>”Your</em> government sucks?”  No.  Not really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is in no way shape or form a government run for the people by the people</p>

<p>Correct.  Absolutely so.  What I said above still applies, however.</p>

<p>We can’t selectively take advantage of the benefits that a country provides and then disassociate ourselves from it when they do something we don’t like or agree with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is in the name of an abstract concept of &quot;America&quot; that a large number of citizens don&#39;t even sympathize with.</p>

<p>Also don’t disagree with that either.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So then we need to come together and stop letting it tell the world it represents us.  We need to come together and STOP it from representing “our will” to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If they take the money you pay them, whack somebody, take that murdered person’s money, cut you in on a piece of the booty they made from that job, and you subsequently end up living a comparatively affluent lifestyle because of it? and you then start getting kind of used to that comparatively affluent lifestyle and start having less and less of a problem with that “protection money” you now keep giving them?</p>

<p>Then yeah.  You’re an accomplice.  You might not be the one pulling the trigger, but you’re aiding and abetting and making the crime possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, and I understand it, but you simply cannot shift the entire blame upon this other force entirely.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that the citizenry need to all stand up and be wiling to <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a3/22/48/a3224894ef4939ec2bdb7ff0a9f92ead.jpg">be the fucking frog.</a></p>

<p>When we all become willing to come together and work toward our collective liberation and become willing to all &quot;be the frog&quot; to make that collective liberation happen, then I can almost guarantee you that there will be no more storks attempting to take advantage of us and use us as their fodder - because there are more of us than them and, collectively, we are far more powerful than they are.  Until we are ready and willing to do that, however, the storks will continue to use us as the fuel they need to power their war machines of hate and deceit and murder.</p>

<p>And yes.  We are indeed the fuel for that machine.  This has been my main point all along.</p>

<p><em>We</em> are the fuel.  YOU are the fuel.  I am the fuel.  Even if we say &quot;Sheeit.  It ain&#39;t <em>my</em> war machine.&quot; it&#39;s still happening in our name and on our dime and it&#39;s still using <em>our</em> work and <em>our</em> effort and <em>our</em> fuel to power it...so yeah.  It&#39;s ours.  We keep it alive.</p>

Distract from the myth at home that new-liberals must tell themselves to sleep at night and the world goes crazy.  They are unable to process the truth about the national security complex, drone assassinations, and the violations of the Constitution and the CIA&#39;s charter.  The hardest thing to do is actually look in the mirror.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh...This is the exact same video that&#39;s in the OP, broseph.  Apparently all you did was read the OP title and decided to comment with the link you sent.  And that&#39;s cool.  I understand that.  I often simply read the title only and comment without bothering to read the title subtext.</p>

<p>However, A) the OP title subtext is literally ONE sentence.  It&#39;s not like it was a wall of text.  You could have read that.  Also, B) if you would have read that short sentence in the OP subtext...then you might not have commented by posting THE <em>EXACT</em> SAME VIDEO that is actually already <em>in</em> the subtext of the OP itself. lol.</p>

<p>All good though.</p>

<p>Shows that we&#39;re at least both on the same page. :)</p>

But I often felt compelled to defend him because alot of the criticism was not valid or just plain silly. He is coming for your guns by staging school shootings, hes a closet muslim that will impose sharia. My boss at work told me racism didnt exist anymore, except Obama is racist against white people. Meanwhile Im still waiting for our troops to come home, the wars to end, and the bombs to stop dropping.</p>

<p>If I own some slaves, and then I go slaughter an innocent child one day... are the slaves now the murderers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they aid and abet you and make your practices possible and without them you wouldn’t have been able to do what you did?  Then they’re accomplices.  If they give you money and support you, they’re going to prison as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think about the logic behind saying that it &quot;is us&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am.  I very much am.  This is why I’ve said what I’ve said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a government that exists within the confines of the same geographic location that I am involved in, and am at times extorted by through taxes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you do it - among many other things for them.  We all do - or at least most of us do.</p>

<p>It’s important to recognize that we’re not victims to anywhere near as great an extent as we might like to think we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Mafia comes to my business and makes me pay protection money, then they wack someone who was well liked by the community, am I now somehow responsible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they take the money you pay them, whack somebody, take that murdered person’s money, cut you in on a piece of the booty they made from that job, and you subsequently end up living a comparatively affluent lifestyle because of it? and you then start getting kind of used to that comparatively affluent lifestyle and start having less and less of a problem with that “protection money” you now keep giving them?</p>

<p>Then yeah.  You’re an accomplice.  You might not be the one pulling the trigger, but you’re aiding and abetting and making the crime possible.</p>
