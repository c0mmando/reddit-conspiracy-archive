        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw someone post something about muslims wanting homosexuality to be made illegal in the west and I saw some things that really concerned me so I&#39;m posting it here, as someone who has been in the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; for a long time.</p>

<p>What is going to happen by demonizing Islam is an idea called &#39;The clash of civilizations&#39;. It began as an overt action during the Bush administration. A neo-conservative, neo-straussian ideal. A conflict between the so called &quot;Christian West&quot; and the Islamic East.</p>

<p>In brief the idea is that in order to create a cohesive, stable society, you need an outside enemy to fight - in this case Islam. We have set up Islam as that enemy, and the victims of our foreign policy are reacting in a predictable manner, and this reaction is framed as the actions of a mad ideology hell bent on our destruction. Well I can tell you that any motivation for our destruction may or may not have existed before we took overt action against multiple nations in that region - but they definitely exist now.</p>

<p>Sharia law may happen in their home countries, but quite frankly fuck them, who cares what happens in their home countries at their own hand, as long as we aren&#39;t responsible they can suffer for their own idiocy. There&#39;s nothing we can do about people&#39;s opinions here, be they religious or secular, other than to use the tools provided in this free nation, that being freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Anything else is an a front to their religious freedom and against what this nation stands for on a fundamental level. You can turn around and say &quot;They are infringing my freedom to be gay!&quot; by wishing that homosexuality were illegal but quite frankly they aren&#39;t. They have opinions, but they are opinions that will NEVER be implemented in this society because its an anathema to what we stand for. It isn&#39;t illegal to want homosexuality to be illegal. It isn&#39;t illegal to hate homosexuals, homosexuality or religion or religious people. It is illegal to act in a violent manner on that hatred and they can use whatever influence they have to try and make the tenets of Sharia legal... but its never going to happen - because it runs contrary to the very foundations of what this nation stands for.</p>

<p>There is an increasingly dangerous trend in the conspiracy community of anti-Islamism. It&#39;s esspecially concerning because 15 years ago we were largely well aware of this agenda. Now it seems we&#39;ve slowly fallen right into the trap we tried to warn people against. The plans of &quot;the powers that be&quot; that they wanted us to act on 15 years ago, but were wary against. And by the way, Stephen K. Bannon has also espoused the ideology of Leo Strauss - so you can expect to see a massive campaign to sway peoples opinions towards the demonization of Islam. The only difference between now and 15 years ago was that then, just after 911 - places like Infowars was central to countering these dangerous ideals... now it seems the tables have turned and places like Infowars are a festering nest nurturing these ideas in the conspiracy crowd.</p>

<p>You wanna know why there is a global jihad? You wanna know why there is any Islamic threat to speak of where there wasn&#39;t before? Its our actions.</p>

<p>Go look at a list of terror attacks in Wikipedia and see the frequency spike to ludicrous levels AFTER our occupation of Iraq began. Look at testimony from top intelligence members in the UK and US including members of parliament in the UK - Al-Qaeda didn&#39;t exist. It was a phantom created out of thin air for us to fight and we actually created an enemy with the terrible things we&#39;ve done in the name of fighting this phantom. Torture, holding people without trial, mass murder, indiscriminate killings, funding lunatics, sparking sectarian conflict. Its no different than every time I hear someone talk about the dangers of Sharia law in the west. THERE IS NO FUCKING DANGER. The only real danger is the panic fomented by hyperbolic morons who I honestly believe want to see a conflict.</p>

<p>There will continue to be terrorist attacks. They won&#39;t stop until we&#39;ve long left the middle east and we&#39;ve stopped succumbing to fear. Fear is the control mechanism of the elite and the powers that be and with that they can easily turn us against each other. Religious against secular, rich against poor, left against right. Remember that these are plans that are well documented and have been established as a goal for over 40 years. Ask yourself this - who benefits from a terrorist attack on American soil? Is it some poverty stricken 3rd world nation full of agrarian brown people or is it the elite establishment who gains more power every time it happens?</p>

<p>If you consider yourself an enemy of Islam just remember that in this country you are free to be so and people are free to hate you for it. As long as they don&#39;t threaten you or hurt you physically - its all gravy. It may not be the best tasting gravy, but its edible and we all get to eat it. You wanna change their minds? </p>

<p>Use the tools this nation provides you to change their minds and speak to them, other wise go about your life and resist the urge to fall for the wiles of these terrible social engineers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the enemy we all had to fight was our own failings? And we actually evolved spiritually and intellectually as a species? I&#39;m tired of just seeing that on Star Trek. And not those new Illuminati Star Trek movies directed by the Fast &amp; Furious guys. One where all humans, everywhere, can make a choice to be evil. And that life should be out avoiding and teaching others how to avoid that choice.</p>

<p>Yahudi&#39;s greatest lie is &quot;no one is better than anyone else and we&#39;re all equal.&quot; Sure. And someone who can&#39;t multiply six times nine in their head is no worse at math than I am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether you believe someone is equal to you or not - it is their right to make choices in their lives that make them better or worse off. </p>

<p>As long as it doesn&#39;t physically harm you - that&#39;s their choice to make.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve said opens up a much larger discussion about meritcracy, the foundation of the American nation, equality and all sorts of things HOWEVER what I said above sums up, ultimately the point I&#39;ve tried to make.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you think of them, or what they think of you - as long as they don&#39;t harm you or you harm them physically, continue to think badly of each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The essential danger is individuals conspiring to enact the Yinon Plan. America is Lenny in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and does the wet work. Like Lenny we&#39;ll be shot in the back of the head in a riverbed, having served our purpose. Believe me they kiss our ass while holding their noses. Concerted efforts of monied men who hate most of us is the over arching danger. Rather than &quot;forces&quot; we should be identifying individuals, use the surveillance state for some good, turn the eye on them. Clean up the 911 conspirators, have the show trials. Disassemble all the totalitarian &quot;Patriot&quot; crap and agencies. Make them get honest work, re-institute the Constitution. Of all the trends I see, the Nationalistic trend is the most likely to result in a rebirth of Liberty and Justice and Freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the same post you say freedom of speech is our greatest strength and we should accept it from all ideologies while also telling me I shouldn&#39;t demonize and criticize what I see as a dangerous and spreading ideology because doing so is harmful. </p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance, the level of naivety, and the complete lack of scope in the incorporation of data in this post is simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. 15 years ago millions of these people weren&#39;t colonizing our countries. Even today nobody cares if they have sharia law in their country if they want it. We don&#39;t care if they live in those countries peacefully (we the people not we the government). We don&#39;t care if they build mosques in their countries. We don&#39;t care if they pray 66 billion times per day or play their calls to prayer at 66 billion decibels around the clock... as long as they do it in their country. </p>

<p>The argument you&#39;re making is very similar to any native Americans who welcomed in the European colonists, and it&#39;s naive to believe that Islamists want to be westerners anymore than Europeans wanted to be natives.  They don&#39;t assimilate. They colonize and spread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having the ability to say what you want, doesn&#39;t mean you should.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with what you say, I have as much right to explain that grievance as you had to make that grievance to begin with.</p>

<p>We all have the right to criticize ideas... that is the marketplace of ideas that the United States provides. </p>

<p>There is no western country even remotely at threat of facing Sharia law. Not one. The vast majority of people coming to this country who are muslim are peaceful. They have as much right to build mosques here as any christian who wishes to build a church, or any other religion that wishes to establish their places of worship. That is a fundamental tenet of the United States enshrined in the constitution. You may use your freedom of speech to petition against this right of course - but remember that in order to make a constitutional amendment you will require the vote of 2/3rds of the states to ratify - and good luck trying to remove or alter the 1st amendment. I&#39;m from Europe, the supposed hot bed of muslim take over (according to the most hyperbolic western accounts) there is no problem, there is no threat. Its&#39; fear mongering of the worst kind and I would expect more from the supposed land of the brave in its reaction to that fear mongering.</p>

<p>I will say this - what do you propose is a solution that conforms to the rights enshrined in the constitution? Or do you suggest that our principles be shed in favor of the illusion of security &quot;in this unique and different era&quot;? Because I will tell you now that we stood by our principles as a nation in the face of NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST for 50 years, incidentally criticizing a government that exhibited many of the sins we openly express now... and did not budge. </p>

<p>Are you going to suggest that Muslims will one day out breed the secular west? Because that&#39;s patently nonsense. As education and quality of life improves, the influence of religion and birth rates decrease. The very nature of coming to this country ultimately harms the future of that religion in the long run - why do you think so many radicals see the western system as a threat? Because they know their time is limited, relatively speaking. And I use the term threat loosely here, because the fact is THEY are not a threat to the west... not a single bit. </p>

<p>As I said we face nuclear annihilation and remained steadfast in our beliefs and yet shed everything when a band of nitwit terrorists ram some planes into buildings. Had terrorists got hold of nuclear weapons and used them against every major city in this country IT STILL WOULD NOT THREATEN WESTERN CIVILIZATION... and yet that capability will never exist and yet our reaction to the slightest attack is always irrational and murderous and only serves to further fuel terrorism.</p>

<p>We have a choice - we live in fear or we face those who seek to hurt us with brave resolve. &quot;So you want us to just take it in the ass?!&quot; No - I want us to be the better people that we believe we are. When we turn around and act like barbarians in the face of their barbarism we become terrorists ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re attacking a strawman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have as much right to build mosques here as any christian who wishes to build a church, or any other religion that wishes to establish their places of worship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Foreign nationals really have no rights to build mosques in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m from Europe, the supposed hot bed of muslim take over (according to the most hyperbolic western accounts) there is no problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are numerous incidents of threats from immigrants. The Cologne New Year&#39;s Eve incident comes to mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its&#39; fear mongering of the worst kind and I would expect more from the supposed land of the brave in its reaction to that fear mongering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever the opposite of fear mongering is, you&#39;re doing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will say this - what do you propose is a solution that conforms to the rights enshrined in the constitution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t guarantee any rights to foreign nationals through the constitution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because that&#39;s patently nonsense. As education and quality of life improves, the influence of religion and birth rates decrease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blacks have been in the US for centuries and they are still disproportionately poor. There&#39;s no reason to believe these immigrants will fair better. This is a matter of opinion though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you going to suggest that Muslims will one day out breed the secular west? Because that&#39;s patently nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>White people have far lower birthrates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very nature of coming to this country ultimately harms the future of that religion in the long run </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science has shown that the 2 and 3rd generations are generally more religious and conservative then the first generation immigrants.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a choice - we live in fear or we face those who seek to hurt us with brave resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If brave resolve means importing them to our country and giving them welfare then I&#39;ll defer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we turn around and act like barbarians in the face of their barbarism we become terrorists ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bombing them with drones is barbaric. Protecting our own citizens is civilized common sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d also like to make it crystal clear, that while we are panicking over the minuscule threat of radical Islamic terror </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the only one panicking, and it&#39;s over the fact that a few thousand people can&#39;t enter a country of which they are not a citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CREATED THIS THREAT IN ORDER TO CONTROL OUR REACTION AND STEER US IN A DIRECTION THEY DESIRE. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are also the ones importing these people into our countries and you&#39;re helping them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who constitutes a muslim? People who say they are? People that come from specific regions? Where are those regions? What percentage of muslims does a country have to have to enter the ban list? How do you deal with people from countries that aren&#39;t predominantly muslim, that don&#39;t identify as muslim but come originate from the ban list? </p>

<p>Ultimately this system is still super easy to work around if you are determined.</p>

<p>And it seems you only read the first question consisting of two words. So i&#39;ll reiterate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know how are the terrorists and who aren&#39;t? Extreme vetting? That doesn&#39;t sound like a ban, that sounds like vetting.
You absolutely cannot stop someone determined to do harm. You can&#39;t even mitigate against terrorism like that - if someone is determined. And blanket immigration restrictions aren&#39;t even going to dent the risk in the slightest.

    <div class="md"><p>Much Respect. Growing up Muslim in America, I was never taught about Sharia Law. I attended weekend school at the mosque when I was in grade school. They taught us about the 5 pillars, stories of the Prophets, and moral lessons from the Quran. My own parents taught me to have morals, do good and focus on school. Believe that we don&#39;t have an agenda for Sharia or are concerned with turning America into Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>P.S. Screw KSA + Abd Al-Wahhab. If you don&#39;t know about Wahhabism and how Al-Saud was put into power of the Arabian peninsula -- then I suggest you do some research. </p>
