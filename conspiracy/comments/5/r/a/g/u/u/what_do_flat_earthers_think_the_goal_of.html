<p>Your response was great. I just hate how everyone is so afraid to just take the viewpoint of a Flat-earther for a second and see a possible reason like this.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>In my philosophy and critical thinking courses, what you&#39;re referring to was known as intellectual charity.</p>

<p>The ability to listen to another&#39;s point of view, see the situation from their side, and withhold your own personal biases. </p>

<p>Take note, biases are never gotten rid of. We all have them and use them constantly. But for this instance, it&#39;s important to realize any potential biases you may have, and figure out a way to look past them for the moment at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are your beliefs rational? There exists no picture of the Earth that is not a composite or that hasn&#39;t been edited in some way. No rocket blasting off looking back showing true curve. All video with curves are from fisheye or wide angled lenses and this can be tested by viewing the first launches showing nearly zero curvature and with weather balloon launches, neutral lens, showing zero curve. </p>

<p>Not only that but evidence used to &quot;debunk&quot; like &quot;if we lived on a flat earth the sun would go away from us at sunset&quot; ....it does. Literally does. In Africa and other places u can watch it &quot;set&quot; but it never really does. Just disappears in the distance. Also, everything APPEARS to drop (go below the horizon) as it moves away. It&#39;s perspective. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced on any shape of the Earth but I just offered up falsifiable evidence that can be tested which would make anyone who does that and decides it&#39;s flat, smarter than someone who thinks it&#39;s round because they were told that in school. </p>

<p>The fact that you believe every picture of earth is edited is kinda crazy, honestly speaking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak for myself: The idea of there being nowhere to go. Think of the allegory of the elephant who grows up with his foot shackled. When he is a baby he is too weak to break free. By the time he is an adult he could easily break the chains, but he has internalised the idea of captivity, and so doesn&#39;t bother trying. There is many &#39;earth ponds&#39; scattered across the vastly larger ice-covered planet. Each of them being a group of continents swimming in an ocean, surrounded by an ice wall. I also believe the UN (covertly) is in touch with the heads of government of other &#39;united nations&#39;. Aliens and UFOs are real in the sense that it&#39;s simply other humans who evolved on neighbouring &#39;earth ponds&#39;. This is what Juncker meant in this address: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9pby3pyxuE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9pby3pyxuE</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on flat earth theory, but I&#39;ve become skeptical enough that I am researching it with an open mind. Should it hold up to scrutiny, the above hypothesis would imo be the most likely scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it doesn&#39;t directly. I just imagine the UN doesn&#39;t want rogue civilians inspired by alien contact fantasies flying out in planes. Travel by water is less of a concern, but by air apparently is a big deal. Although I know there&#39;s tourist sightseeing flights, but they never fly &#39;across&#39; antarctica, they only fly in a U pattern, touching a border of it. It&#39;s a bit absurd until you start researching it via the right sources. There&#39;s tons of disinfo garbage put out there with the explicit intention of mudding the waters and turning off curious people. Eric Dubay is the one who got me interested.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been around to witness the entire conspiracy - the way you have your question worded there&#39;s almost no way to answer this without speculating, which is something I don&#39;t generally like to do.</p>

<p>But when people in authority positions are lying to you consistently, they&#39;re trying to control you.  That much should be clear.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you&#39;re new to the idea of the flat earth, you should first investigate all the details before you expect to find out a &quot;why.&quot;  Running around asking &quot;why&quot; before you figure out exactly what has been lied about or what the lies actually are and who was doing the lying - well, you need to think of yourself like a detective.
