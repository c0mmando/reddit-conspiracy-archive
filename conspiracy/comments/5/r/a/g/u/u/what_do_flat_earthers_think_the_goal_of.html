       The ones that take it seriously act as if they are onto a secret conspiracy, I've never heard thrm say end goal, but once they latch onto it, they bite hard.  So odd, even with good evidence against, they will find another YouTube vid to support their perspective.

       Almost every ancient religion, including Christianity, depicts our world as a flat enclosure.

       Possible conspiracy: by lying to us about our true origins, we fall farther and farther from our true path, and closer to the wrong path. Wolves leading the lamb to slaughter type of deal.

       Your response was great. I just hate how everyone is so afraid to just take the viewpoint of a Flat-earther for a second and see a possible reason like this. Like you said you're just observing and don't hold the belief but even rationalizing it, people associate you with it and craziness.

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my philosophy and critical thinking courses, what you're referring to was known as intellectual charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability to listen to another's point of view, see the situation from their side, and withhold your own personal biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take note, biases are never gotten rid of. We all have them and use them constantly. But for this instance, it's important to realize any potential biases you may have, and figure out a way to look past them for the moment at hand.

       Some of the claims out there:
      </p>
      <p>
       The contained Earth is like a reality TV show for the rest of the universe, but the actors can't know they are in it. Sort of like the Truman Show + South Park.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is like a prison, zoo, Hell, Purgatory, or experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion was right all along and the people can't know this, at least not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Misleading people about the size and shape of the Earth covers up the existence of extra continents.

       Why are your beliefs rational? There exists no picture of the Earth that is not a composite or that hasn't been edited in some way. No rocket blasting off looking back showing true curve. All video with curves are from fisheye or wide angled lenses and this can be tested by viewing the first launches showing nearly zero curvature and with weather balloon launches, neutral lens, showing zero curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that but evidence used to "debunk" like "if we lived on a flat earth the sun would go away from us at sunset" ....it does. Literally does. In Africa and other places u can watch it "set" but it never really does. Just disappears in the distance. Also, everything APPEARS to drop (go below the horizon) as it moves away. It's perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not convinced on any shape of the Earth but I just offered up falsifiable evidence that can be tested which would make anyone who does that and decides it's flat, smarter than someone who thinks it's round because they were told that in school.

       I don't know why you flat earthers always attempt to steer the discussion into an argument about intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you believe every picture of earth is edited is kinda crazy, honestly speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even without going to space, the world CAN be explained in a spherical model, while it CANNOT be fully explained in a flat Earth model.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does the flat Earth model explain various climates? Or something as simple as the difference in rotation of water in household appliances depending on your location on Earth?

       The psychopathic, sociopathic elite aren't reasonable people. They don't think in the same rational way we think. IMHO it's all about control. Control the minds of people. Make billions off the space programs and space research. Gatekeepers to knowledge keeps them in power. I wouldn't look at it as a goal, but more like the ultimate deception to keep us under their methods of mind control.

       Sure, they've been successful at controlling the masses because they've been in power for generations. Their success has nothing to do with their rationality.

       Almost a trillion dollars has been spent all-time on the NASA budget alone. Besides the federal reserve banksters profiting off of all the US treasury bonds from the creation of that money to begin with, where do you think all the money goes? It's certainly not benefiting society with advancements in science and technology when you open your eyes to NASA's fakery.

       If u need a "why" just look at the lengths u are going to convince yourself or others the Earth isn't flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do u honestly KNOW it isn't? Have u seen it from space? No. U don't know anything. None of us do. We only know what we observe and that's a fundamental aspect of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       If u knew this you'd know there are experiments that seemingly falsify globe model. Yet also some which make Flat Earth hard to model as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just choose not to know since u don't? But instead u are full of arrogance. Things u don't know u believe u know fully. Logic and reason is out the window. U are told something therefore u know, therefore u are smart, therefore everyone else is dumb.

       I can only speak for myself: The idea of there being nowhere to go. Think of the allegory of the elephant who grows up with his foot shackled. When he is a baby he is too weak to break free. By the time he is an adult he could easily break the chains, but he has internalised the idea of captivity, and so doesn't bother trying. There is many 'earth ponds' scattered across the vastly larger ice-covered planet. Each of them being a group of continents swimming in an ocean, surrounded by an ice wall. I also believe the UN (covertly) is in touch with the heads of government of other 'united nations'. Aliens and UFOs are real in the sense that it's simply other humans who evolved on neighbouring 'earth ponds'. This is what Juncker meant in this address:

       I'm not sold on flat earth theory, but I've become skeptical enough that I am researching it with an open mind. Should it hold up to scrutiny, the above hypothesis would imo be the most likely scenario.

       Well it doesn't directly. I just imagine the UN doesn't want rogue civilians inspired by alien contact fantasies flying out in planes. Travel by water is less of a concern, but by air apparently is a big deal. Although I know there's tourist sightseeing flights, but they never fly 'across' antarctica, they only fly in a U pattern, touching a border of it. It's a bit absurd until you start researching it via the right sources. There's tons of disinfo garbage put out there with the explicit intention of mudding the waters and turning off curious people. Eric Dubay is the one who got me interested.

       Ofc not humans in the literal sense, but humans as in 'our equivalent' species that occupied and capitalised on the evolutionary niche of 'intelligence'. However since the neighbouring earth ponds wouldn't be subject to wildly different laws of physics, it's probable that whichever species occupies that niche and develops technology won't look completely bizarrely different to us. Ofc again, pure speculation.

       Any time anyone lies to you, they're trying to control you by your access to information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like I've been around to witness the entire conspiracy - the way you have your question worded there's almost no way to answer this without speculating, which is something I don't generally like to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when people in authority positions are lying to you consistently, they're trying to control you.  That much should be clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you're new to the idea of the flat earth, you should first investigate all the details before you expect to find out a "why."  Running around asking "why" before you figure out exactly what has been lied about or what the lies actually are and who was doing the lying - well, you need to think of yourself like a detective.  If a detective shows up to a gory murder scene, they would not be able to find out "why" the crime was committed until they figured out exactly what the crime was and all the details.

       First of all, I did answer your question.  I said if you're being lied to, someone is trying to control you.  I'm aware this probably isn't the kind of answer you wanted, so I elaborated as to why that was the answer I gave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you it's foolish to try to understand why you've been lied to until you study what you've been lied to about :)

       Any sort of brief of concise answer I try to give you is just going to seem absurd because you're asking for a short easy answer to a very complex problem that's taken hundreds and hundreds of years to develop - and you're not aware of the context.

       No, I don't want a short answer. Make it as long as you need. I want to know how all world leaders throughout history worked together to maintain Thai facade, an explanation for how seemingly mundane physics that can be explained with the spherical model can't be explained, and any other information you can provide me.

       Except all you ever do is sit inside your echo chamber and never, ever accept anyone else's evidence. It is only ever the evidence that you bring to the table that is to be supported. You claim to be reasonable and logical yet you will fly in the face of logic when you begin any kind of discourse with anyone who disagrees with you. Whether they insult you or not. You always ever deny everyone else any say.

       Almost a trillion dollars has been spent all-time on the NASA budget alone. Besides the federal reserve banksters profiting off of all the US treasury bonds from the creation of that money to begin with, where do you think all the money goes? It's certainly not benefiting society with advancements in science and technology when you open your eyes to NASA's fakery.

       Any time anyone lies to you, they're trying to control you by your access to information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like I've been around to witness the entire conspiracy - the way you have your question worded there's almost no way to answer this without speculating, which is something I don't generally like to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when people in authority positions are lying to you consistently, they're trying to control you.  That much should be clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you're new to the idea of the flat earth, you should first investigate all the details before you expect to find out a "why."  Running around asking "why" before you figure out exactly what has been lied about or what the lies actually are and who was doing the lying - well, you need to think of yourself like a detective.  If a detective shows up to a gory murder scene, they would not be able to find out "why" the crime was committed until they figured out exactly what the crime was and all the details.

       Your response was great. I just hate how everyone is so afraid to just take the viewpoint of a Flat-earther for a second and see a possible reason like this. Like you said you're just observing and don't hold the belief but even rationalizing it, people associate you with it and craziness.
