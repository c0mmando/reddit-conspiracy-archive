<p>Holding mods accountable for the actions if the community would have made sense several years ago, however they can be easily compromised as shown in the flood of new mods to major subreddits since last year, and the evidence of sleeper mods on Voat (a separate platform, but evidence of similar strategy). A single hacked/bought/sleeper mod account can bring down a subreddit or  steer it towards a target narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What? R/altright posted a link to a bounty site to dox the dude that punched Richard spencer. The admins had them remove, and put a soft ban on the site in question.
R/altright mods then manually approved the site posting, and stickied it, in order to attempt to raise thousands of dollars to dox and assault the dude. That&#39;s why they got banned, period.

<p>Secondly, this is bullshit logic: </p>

<p>&quot;As long as they are banning the people who don&#39;t share MY point of view, I&#39;m fine. Because fuck them&quot;</p>

<p>The alt right isn&#39;t hated because they have ALTERNATE VIEWS. They are hated because those views they hold are in themselves hateful.</p>

<p>But please, explain to me why we should defend someone&#39;s right to call for genocide and ethnic cleansing, and more specifically why reddit should give those views a platform? If ISIS set up a subreddit here calling for Jihad against the West, would you support their right to exist? How about if ISIS tried to do the same offline in the US?</p>

<p>How is fixing an entire continent &#39;hateful&#39;?</p>

<p>That being said, I agree with your sentiment. Banning stuff is counter-productive and ill-advised in a business sense. I like this slight variation of your quote:</p>

<p>Supporting government eavesdropping because you have nothing to hide is like saying you&#39;re against freedom of expression because you have nothing to say. I think Snowden said that.</p>

<p>On the front page right now is an infographic about how 6 media companies control virtually everything we see on the television and movie screen. Yet no one observes that every single one of these companies pushes an anti-racist, pro-race-mixing, anti-white narrative? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the alt-right guys buy into the mainstream narrative on one hand - 19 Arabs did 9/11, one lone gunman shot JFK, etc. - and the people here buy into the mainstream narrative on social issues: racism is bad, all races are equal, anytime more than 2 white people gather and talk about their shared interests they are <em>NAZIs</em> and <em>racists.</em></p>

So just <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a>, 75k Users (Let&#39;s assume that they are all Paleoconservatives, which is not true), that&#39;s 1% of Reddit.

<p>So yea, saying that 90% think is wrong isn&#39;t bad. Look at Obama&#39;s NSA scandal: 40% Approved the NSA&#39;s entire system, considering that Reddit is mostly young people (Very liberal) it&#39;s PRETTY FUCKING SAFE to say that yes, only 10% of Reddit approves it.</p>

<p>Try going to any subreddit and saying that the PRISM program was 100% right. Instant downvotes.</p>

<p>Instead of be googling what Literally means, you should LITERALLY try looking at statistics for once and use critical thinking, otherwise you&#39;re LITERALLY just another sheep following the mentality that &quot;Everyone associated with right-wing is always 100% wrong&quot;.</p>

But they get up in arms about a legitimately creepy group of people having their creepy board banned from a website. I&#39;m not a fan of censorship especially considering some of the dark subs you can find here but I&#39;m not inherently against refusing to normalize hate speech. It led to mass lynchinhs in this country and I think it&#39;s somewhat clear what alt right was or the type of people it could attract. It sucks if it was just outsiders posting to purposely get the sub banned, but I just don&#39;t feel that is the case. And comparing this to government spying is kind of a stretch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utterly disagree. </p>

<p>For you to say that:</p>

<p>&quot;Banning people who call for actual genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder&quot; is equal to &quot;banning anyone who disagrees with me&quot; </p>

<p>Is... well it&#39;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>disingenous</li>
<li>bad-faith participation</li>
<li>a false equivalency</li>
<li>a total strawman fallacy</li>
<li>reduction to absurdity</li>
<li>a &quot;base rate&quot; fallacy</li>
<li>an &quot;argument from ignorance&quot; fallacy</li>
<li>a &quot;Begging the question&quot; fallacy</li>
<li>a &quot;false dilemma&quot; fallacy</li>
</ul>

<p>Infact it&#39;s like, a whole 60-70% of all fallacies listed on the &quot;list of informal fallacies&quot; all at once. </p>

<p>tenbux says the OP doesn&#39;t respond, because I can prove every word of what I just said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what OP is saying is that it words equate words... They never planned to meet to carry out these atrocities. Speech is speech and action is action. If they did nothing physically to further the idea that their words were nothing more than just rhetoric and banter.     </p>

<p>By the same logic the (i&#39;m not linking these subreddits) KKK, Any of the pro-ISIS,I_hate_muslims, niggers, whites_only, and million other hateful subreddits.        </p>

<p>So while the post may be &quot;Disingenuous&quot;... the other fallacies you&#39;ve pointed out are not present, because he is not engaging in an argument merely stating an opinion.. However... I will call    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fwiw, here&#39;s an anarchist lawyer&#39;s perspective (i don&#39;t claim to speak for any other anarchist or any other lawyer).</p>

<p>from the lawyer in me--there is mo right to freedom of speech, press, or association in interactions btwn private citizens or private organizations. the right only applies to interactions btwn the govt and the people.</p>

<p>this has been true since the 1st amendment was ratified.</p>

<p>the only recourse btwn private citzens or private organizations is the golden rule of anarchism--the right to opt out. if you want to change reddit, don&#39;t patronize it. take your business elsewhere. starve the beast.</p>

<p>a sub, likewise, has no obligation to suffer posts it doesn&#39;t want to read. again, opting out is the only option if what you want to discuss is not what the sub wants to discuss. no one should be required to listen to someone else say shit they don&#39;t want to hear.</p>

<p>the law does protect people from not being allowed to opt out of private relationships, except with children, who are allowed to be xaptivez f all sorts of adults and organizations. most anarchists i&#39;ve known, believe, like me, that self determination and the right to opt out applies to children as well.</p>

<p>anarchism doesn&#39;t say everyone gets to do and say anything they want to anywhere they want to do it at anytime they want to do it. </p>

<p>it says everyone has the right to self determination and the freedom from being forced to do and say anything they do not want to anywhere they do not want to be at anytime they do not want to do it.</p>

<p>anarchism says we all have the inalienable right to opt out and to have our desire to opt out be respected. it also says we do not have the right to force others to opt in.</p>

<p>reddit has gone to hell, as has google, as has just about everywhere else on the internet--the internet enclosure movement is almost complete. however, the solution is not to bitch about it and throw a temper tantrum, it&#39;s to stop enabling it. as long as you participate at reddit, you are a collaborating and tacitly consenting. i accept my complicity...i don&#39;t have anywhere else to go...</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think aaron would be turning in his grave over the current state of reddit, he had to have known what would happen when it was sold to conde nast. i think he would be turning in his grave at people putting up with it and not leaving to start a new community. </p>

<p>on the internet, as opposed to real life, this is still possible...for now at least.</p>

<p>believing one has a right to force their will on anyone else is the first of a thousand steps to tyranny. always. however, a group of like minded people wishing to affliate with each other unmolested, without molesting others, is not exercising force but simply mutual self determination. if you don&#39;t like the group, you don&#39;t get to change it, you get to leave it.</p>

<p>the amish, the only successful anarchist community in the world today, is a perfect example. they don&#39;t want to change america, like other fundamentalist religions, they just want to be allowed to be themselves. they do not force anyone, esp their children, to be a member of their community, but they reserve the right to require those who do not like their community to leave--yet the door is always open to return. they have no punishment--confess and you are forgiven and that is that. they have no formal leaders, only a group of elders, who primarily guide to seek consensus. they are a mutual aid community that is non-monetized in their intra-group relations. when someone needs a barn, they gather together together to build it, free of charge. when they need to buy new land to establish a new community, they pool theur mo ey and buy it as a group. they travel to almost all natural disastor areas to help rebuild.</p>

<p>they are not perfectly anarchist internally of course, their families are rigidly hierarchical, for instance but they illustrate the opt out principle perfectly--even wives may leave their husbands, as long as they leave the community all together. however, they may also return, no questio s asked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We got along just fine before Reddit and we&#39;ll get along just fine without them. They need their users more than we need them. The fact your defending censorship of speech anywhere is a testament to your character. Thanks for the ad hominem attack though, would of expected nothing less. 💋 </p>

<p>“Nationalist Socialist”, call yourself what you, are a racist fucking pig. </p>

<p>There is no room for hate within a movement that is to succeed.</p>

<p>Lol, no surprise you’re dumb as fuck, your “movement” is based on hatred of “the other” you dumb fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A movement must be with like minded individuals that respect others opinions, but want their own justice without intruding on the liberties of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck, you’re dumb. Nazi’s do not respect the Liberty of others you moron, nor other opinions, Nazi’s burn books, they call Art “degenerate” <em>nothing</em> about Nazi’s respects others.</p>

<p>The only place for a Nazi is in a fucking grave. </p>

<p>Just like our Grandfathers did to your piece of shit heroes of Nazi Germany, wiped those scumbags out, those drugged up Nazi cowards who lost and lost and lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it&#39;s not that hard of a decision. I&#39;m disgusted by most of what was posted on the sub but couldn&#39;t care either way if it existed or not, it&#39;s a forum and if I don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t have to read it. But ask yourself to anyone questioning why it was banned, &quot;If I ran a website, would I let people place bounties on others there?&quot;</p>
