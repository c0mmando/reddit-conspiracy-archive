        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People are angrier with Trump for imposing a visa ban on Yemen than they ever were with Obama for bombing and killing Yemenis and backing a barbaric Saudi war that pushed parts of Yemen to the brink of famine. </p>

<p>They&#39;re angrier with Trump for imposing a temporary ban on Syrian refugees coming to America than they ever were with the Obama policies that helped rip Syria apart and saturate it with weaponry and which created those refugees in the first place. </p>

<p>They&#39;re angrier with Trump for his Mexico wall than they ever were with Obama for kicking out more Mexicans than any president in history or with Hillary for voting for the building of a 700-mile security barrier between America and Mexico -- you know, a wall. </p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre. Obama is a saint even though he caused mayhem, and Trump is a fascist basically for saying: &quot;Oh shit, there&#39;s mayhem.&quot; If you adore Obama then I&#39;m sorry but you have forfeited your right to be taken seriously on Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is certainly a double standard but largely because it&#39;s all the media has pushed for 8+ years. A 20yo has basically heard how great Obama is from MSM since they were 12. Not to mention the stigma of being a dissenter in high school etc</p>

<p>A lot of programming to undo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read the article?  The ONLY country that Trump had any role in bombing was Syria.  Every other country listed was attacked in the final days of OOba!A and before the Innaguration except for Yemen, which the article made clear was ordered by Obama&#39;s general and Trump didn&#39;t sign off on.</p>

<p>What a horrible fictitious title.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we believe that the u.s. slash c.i.a. Are arming moderate rebel (terrorists), and that false flags are the s.o.p.; and if we believe trump knows this as well, then it seems he logically did the first thing he could do to keep these c.i.a. assets over seas.</p>

<p>I mean: where are the c.i.a. regime change assasins, when you need them?  Trump may have just prevented them from entering.</p>
