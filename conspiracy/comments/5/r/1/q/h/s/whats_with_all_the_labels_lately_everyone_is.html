       I'm just tired of all this crap, apparently these days if you black and/or Muslim its OK to be racist, if you a woman it's OK to be sexist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet if you agree with anything that Trump says you automatically a Extreme right, Republican, sexist racist pig etc... If you disagree with anything you labeled as DNC, Leftist, Liberal, snowflake etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to the days where you had the right to your own opinion, why are we being categorized to fit into these political movements when most of us don't fall under any of these categories by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a power play guys! we cant fight them when we too busy arguing with each other.

       Yeah a house divided against itself can't stand
      </p>
      <p>
       The current status of the sub is interesting. I personally noticed the change around last Thursday, it seems almost overnight the sub was flooded with a lot of politics, especially the Donald stuff; at the same time all discussion in the new section was being downvoted if it was remotely legitimate. I believe it's an astroturfing attempt to paint us as FE and Archon truthers (personally both theories are pretty fascinating but imagine how the public views that) to delegitamize our real investigative sourced discussions on other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible these pro trump users are paid for, separate from the_d user to divide this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to remember that conspiracy is beyond any political barriers. That is why I'm weary of anyone bringing politics to this debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the best way to not be infiltrated is to work towards unity and stay consistent with board culture ( though that may work better on 4chan)

       Yeah ultimately what they have to be going for is general confusion where no one is ever really sure what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be difficult for a newcomer to this sub to educate himself given the wildly varying opinions around now; itd be hard to pin down who we really are as sub. I've only been here since mid election but can see a definite change in board culture (as some complain) especially within the last 2 weeks

       I like people that ramble, I know more often than not it's an actual human being I'm talking to. You're right about general confusion, we see a quote about that being passed around every few weeks here.

       Indeed with all the intruders that are not here for healthy discussions. I'm of the opinion that there is a way with words. I'm willing to debate any subject with anyone that has a differing opinion, but it must be based in reality, or at least in the realm of possibility. Spouting non-sense about Russian hacking for example. I think everybody knows at this point Podesta wasn't hacked but phished, yet when the topic is brought up you get a flock of people telling you about how the bad commies are there to get ya.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been active daily (lurking mostly, commenting if I have something worthwhile to say I guess) and following many topics and learning about theories I had never heard of. I went wide and large, I read the stuff on Trump too. The content on Trump is barely notable. There is some worrying over some of his picks wondering maybe if he is establishment. But there's also loads of other stuff he hinted at that give me some hope.

       It irritates me too sometimes. I'm defiant by nature so when somebody tries to put me in a box I'll do everything possible to stay out of it. Being able to be categorized and put in a box isn't cool, yo!

       Yeah I agree that if you've been here even a little while you can grasp the general consensus on most issues. Particularly the emails and Trump. Those emails and what they contain are a conspiracists wet dream (from Aliens to Za)and I believe the general consensus on trump is kind of 'wait and see' he may or may not be with the establishment but so much has happened in a week we have to catch up. I looked into some of his cabinet and it is a little eyebrow raising but yknow...Cautiously optimistic. worst case scenario he's the status quo

       The globalists who run our world know exactly what they are doing. You are right with divide and conquer. Identity politics go a long way. It's also a big part in marxism which a lot of them love.
