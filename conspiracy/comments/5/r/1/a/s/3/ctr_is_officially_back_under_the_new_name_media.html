<p>Re-uploaded for those who can&#39;t access scribd or want to download a copy: <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?cx6pqjz1do1uxcg">https://www.mediafire.com/?cx6pqjz1do1uxcg</a></p>

<p>The PDF appears to be a high-definition scan of a paper document. It&#39;s professionally edited and typeset, definitely above the quality of a typical hoax or manufactured leak. The tactics described therein are similar to those known to be used by CTR, but grander in proposed scope, and there are many new directions taken. For these reasons, I&#39;m inclined to believe the document is genuine.</p>

<p>Main points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Media Matters and its affiliate Shareblue plan to become the reference point for liberal news media, especially online</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, they plan to provide their own &quot;research&quot; to friendly media outlets to push liberal narratives</p></li>
<li><p>At the same time, they will try to censor non-aligned outlets, including by having Facebook, Google and Twitter penalize them</p></li>
<li><p>They will also heavily push the &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; angles to discredit non-aligned outlets</p></li>
<li><p>They intend to deploy social media analytics to catch developing stories as they emerge and direct their shill armies, called &quot;truth squads&quot; (not even kidding), to shape the narrative; this will be done via their proprietary tools and communications network, so it will appear to the outside world as if a genuine grassroots movement is happening</p></li>
<li><p>their 2017 budget is $13.4 million, with 81 staff</p></li>
</ul>

<p>CTR was originally <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/21/hillary-pac-spends-1-million-to-correct-commenters-on-reddit-and-facebook.html">spun off</a> from American Bridge.</p>

<p>Although the FEC filings for dissolving the PAC have been released, it&#39;s probably safe to assume American Bridge is doing the work based on the memo:</p>

<p>Honest question: is Trump now considered part of establishment politics? Obviously as president it&#39;d be weird to not consider Trump as establishment, but it seems many people still consider him as some sort of outsider. I&#39;m curious when that&#39;ll change, how long it&#39;ll take till everybody sees Trump as central political establishment figure</p>

<p>Do you really believe you can win the presidency of the United States with only 20-25% of voters voting for you?  He may have lost the popular vote, but it&#39;s mathematically impossible for him to have lost it by only getting 20-25% of the vote, meaning Hillary getting 70%+ which gives 5-10% to 3rd party candidates.  No fucking way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand what he meant.</p>

<p>If we have 100 people in the USA eligible to vote. Only about 60 of those will actually go out and vote. This is because we have about a 60% participation rate for elections.</p>

<p>So, out of those 60: 31 voted for Hillary 29 voted for trump. (About).</p>

<p>So, now you go back to the original number of 100:</p>

<p>Out of 100 people, 60% voted, out of which about 50% went for trump = 29 people / 100 people.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people just mess up the math. I love numbers so I went into the hole pretty deep after the election with what demographics did what.</p>

<p>I believe this commenter, in the first line, &quot;Half the country did not vote for him&quot; possibly meant &quot;half the country did not vote&quot;</p>

<p>making the next part &quot;less than half of those who voted actually voted for him&quot; make sense.</p>

<p>he really should have said, and this is what I believe he/she meant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Half of the country did not vote <del>for him</del>, and less than half of those who voted actually voted for him. This translates to like 20-25% of eligible voters voted for him So, much less than &quot;half the country&quot;</p>

<p>No. It is a dichotomy. The fundamental dichotomy. You cannot have both. If you believe that, you default to aiding the Establishment and harming the anti-Establishment movement.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t support the Clintons and oppose the Establishment. Or support the Fed and oppose the Establishment.</p>

<p>The false dichotomies are as follows:</p>

<p>Republican vs Democrat. 
Blacks (or any other minority) vs whites. Rich vs poor. 
Urban vs rural. 
Red vs blue. 
Your professional sports team vs the rest or your favourite team to hate. 
Liberal vs conservative.
Communism vs capitalism
One race against another race.
One country against another country.
Men against women and vice versa.
etc.</p>

<p>There is one global dichotomy.</p>

<p>Like George W. so succinctly put it:</p>

<p>&quot;Either you&#39;re with us or you&#39;re against us&quot;</p>

<p>He was talking about the New World Order. Despotic global govt by force of arms. With that declaration, he and Obama have kept us at war for 16 years.</p>

<p>Either you&#39;re for war and global governance, or you&#39;re for freedom.</p>

<p>What do you say to those who find many of Trump&#39;s policies morally abhorrent?  To me, saying both candidates are equally bad is a false equivalency.  Several of Trump&#39;s policies went against the ideals that this country was founded on as well as being morally abhorrent.  To me, voting anti-establishment, exclusively, while believing that would mean I&#39;m either irresponsible and inconsistent in my beliefs or I never really cared and harbor a juvenile (juvenile in that it wouldn&#39;t happen under the watch of someone that I see as the establishment) &quot;burn it all down&quot; attitude.</p>

<p>I formed my views from listening to Trump speak so writing it off as ignorance of media bias would be useless.  His speaking as well as Pence&#39;s history and views forced me to vote against Trump as opposed to actually voting in favor of anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, that explains it.  If you truly believe that then you&#39;re part of the problem with this country.  The right already views the left as actual enemies of the state while being ignorant of their views and vice versa.  When I say ignorant, by the way, I mean that both groups just repeat talking points from their respective talking heads instead of taking the time to understand other points of views.  Those that call people &quot;shills&quot; instead of addressing the content of posts are no different than the SJWs that call people racist or sexist for disagreeing with them.  The hilariously sad part is that neither group recognizes this.</p>

If you think the most powerful people on earth, who&#39;s only goal is to acquire more power, are suddenly content with what they have once they reach the 1% then you&#39;re very naively mistaken. Trump always had a minor role in the establishment and now he wants more by destroying the Clintons. Ofcourse you can view this as a good thing as the Clintons certainly dont serve the needs of the American people, but it&#39;s not a given that Trump will use his newly acquired power for anything but himself. </p>

<p>Just because the mainstream media is against him now doesn&#39;t proof he will do good nor that we should trust him. Take Fox News for example, it&#39;s the biggest MSM channel in the US. When they attacked Obama did that mean Obama was an outsider? No of course not. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. Sorry for the aggressive questioning, but it&#39;s easy to get bogged down into debates on specific details, so I wanted to know whether outside of finding my reasoning insufficient there was something else people are noticing that makes them doubt this is genuine.</p>

<p>Because it throws people off. The argument becomes, &#39;no, you did&#39; rather than focusing upon the original point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think all politicians are bad people, including saint bernard (with the possible exception of ron paul and dennis kucinich, but even with them wariness is still warranted).</p>

<p>it is indisputable that brock, regardless of name, has a paid troll brigade. we know this from his own mouth.</p>

<p>it is indisputable that today, like the dirty dossier day, this sub was innundated in vistors and posters, most of whom have never posted here before, some who have posted only in foriegn language subs before. the majority of these newcomer&#39;s posts focus on one of three memes: </p>

<p>isn&#39;t it more logical to just assume the official narrative of X is the real one?</p>

<p>i think trump is a bad person and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is just a pro-trump echo chamber.</p>

<p>this sub is crazy-town and everyone who posts here is an idiot. and a trump supporter.</p>

<p>the resonse to the first is--why are you here if you are looking for confirmation of the official, military-industrial-media complex narrative? </p>

<p>there are people here who believe the earth is flat and that the rothschildren are literally lizards and that sandy hook was a hoax, as was the boston marathon, and that our govt is solely responsible for 9/11. and that we&#39;ve had aliens in the deep freeze for 75 years.</p>

<p>i believe we live in a 2d holographic universe, that lincoln was killed in a false flag conspiracy by the radical republicans and that booth was a patsy, and that jesus was a myth who never existed at all and that christianity is just pauline mithraism.</p>

<p>given that, does it seem that unresonable that people here might doubt the motives of johnnie come lately poo-pooers descending on mass?  is it unreasoble that people who question everything under the sun and beyond, will queztion you too?</p>

<p>there are just as many people here who&#39;ve been saying shut up already about trump and fuck off back to <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a>, however, these same people also note that the period between the election and inauguration seemed dangerously close to becoming a CIA coup,  dead set on WW3. </p>

<p>these same people note that the MSM is fanning the flames of hysteria by pretending that trump is deviating greatly from obama, which is simply false. his deviation is primarily one of style and transparency--trump is guache and doesn&#39;t have the sense to keep the unseemly shit the govt does on the down low. ironically, cheeto hitler is extremely responsive to public outcry, amazingly so. he&#39;s already backtracking on moving our embassy to jerusalem, and instantly back tracked on visa/green card holders.</p>

<p>the response to the 3rd johnnie come lately meme is that if you think this sub is a joke and we&#39;re delusional idiots, fuck off back to whatever sub you came here from.</p>

<p>Simple. While obviously there is support for Trump out there and on reddit, the number of those opposing Trump is greater than the number of those supporting Trump. Half of Trump voters were &quot;never Hillary&quot; voters. The further away from the election and Hillary we get, and the more dangerous ineptitude we see from Trump, the more those &quot;never Hillary&quot; folks begin to turn on Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The brigading is only a cover for the fact that the reddit administration has been compromised.</p>

<p>They on multiple occasions deployed specially-implemented code to suppress the trump sub specifically, and since this indicates motivation there&#39;s no reason to assume it hasn&#39;t been employed elsewhere to manipulate the discussion.</p>

<p>Reddit seems almost specifically designed for manipulation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZunZuneo">it wouldn&#39;t be the first time</a>) but the presumption of external manipulation is a perfect smokescreen for <strong>aggressive</strong> internal control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Algorithms aren&#39;t perfect. Digg was heavily brigaded by corporate shills before all the political shills made it a game today.</p>

<p>It also works both ways. <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a> was exploiting the algorithm to flood <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with spam posts, actively brigading, begging for votes and abusing stickies. Much of it against reddit rules, but reddit couldn&#39;t crack down because they would have been attacked for violating their free speech.</p>

<p>The algorithm was changed to counter <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a>, but as a bug in the algorithm because it is supposed to be about <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> of Reddit. Not just <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a>.</p>

<p>The algorithm works by allowing only a few posts make the front page from each sub and mostly just long lived top posts. <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a> is none of this. If they wanted to be on all longer than they would need to focus on a few posts and maybe expand outside of one sub.</p>

<p>Though, reddit has always been supremely liberal. It&#39;s not just shills but many of the users that actively fight you here, speaking to those of you from <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a>.</p>

That&#39;s one area where I have trouble believing he&#39;s strategizing carefully towards a positive end. I can&#39;t see any benefit in stooping to the level of insulting a popular actress, for example, even if she did make critical remarks. He&#39;d have a lot more people on his side if he behaved in a more dignified manner, especially now that he&#39;s won the election-- during the campaign you could still excuse his more immature antics as PR strategy, but now I can&#39;t see how they&#39;re of any benefit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ever think that maybe it&#39;s because the majority of us hate trump?  He is a piece of shit, a conspiracy magnet, a taste for totalitarianism, and is very obviously copying the playbook from early 1930s Germany, which is clear even with a 10th grade level understanding of history.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t throw out logical fallacies and bullshit to push your agenda.  You can fool your echo chamber but he rest of us are waiting to dance on your metaphorical corpses when this comes crashing down in your face.</p>

<p>A lot of people hate Trump, but a lot of others, especially on Reddit, actually do like him. The anti-Trump propaganda on Reddit is so obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you one of the army of Trump-loving &quot;Bernie supporters&quot; that came out of Robert Mercer&#39;s funding efforts?  </p>

<p>If you truly are a progressive, you should be beyond angry at this point.  There is a hypocritical government in power that waves the flag of small government while instituting totalitarian policies.  We have an administration that does not understand that the president is not a king.  He has a chief strategist that, literally two days ago, said in a web video to his supporters that &quot;a very bloody period is ahead of us and we need Christian warriors to bring about the new era&quot;.  He just replaced people who actually know what they&#39;re doing on the NSC.  Speaking of which, there is also Flynn, who was fired for being batshit insane and then celebrated by sitting next to Putin at a Russian state dinner.</p>

<p>So tell me, as a Bernie supporter, which of his policies are you most attracted to?  Is it the corporatism?  Is it the stuffing of self-interested billionaires in the cabinet?  Maybe it&#39;s the ideals of Robert Mercer, the reclusive Long Island billionaire who collects automatic weapons, hates representative democracy, probably follows Dugin, and wants a white supremacist America. Maybe you think Bannon/Conway/Spicer are waging war on information, the media, and critical thought.  Maybe it&#39;s the Sec of Commerce who is anti minimum wage and outsourced thousands of jobs in his career.  </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m really curious how a Bernie supporter can seemingly ignore everything Bernie campaigned on and can shift support to someone who is completely and utterly diametrically philosophically opposed.  Please, do tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use an array of emotions for reactions.  Sometimes the situation calls for projecting different emotions.  It&#39;s all about connecting with the audience.  If you&#39;re a psychologist, shouldn&#39;t you recognize that?</p>

<p>Also, while I normally like to be the dry person stating facts and well-reasoned arguments, I&#39;ve been trained out of doing that on this topic.  So apparently the opposition tactics are working.  18 months of saying the same things over and over, and being completely unsurprised the past week when everyone else seems to think these kind of events are new, or &quot;oh wow so he did mean these things literally&quot;, will do that to you.</p>

<p>It is one thing when CNN/MSNBC(Rachel Maddow in particular) is mocked by the right. It is a different matter when you have a significant percentage of the left that lost all respect for you.</p>

<p>Even if there is still a lot of people who watch these shows, I bet a significantly smaller percentage of them trusts those shows as a definitive source on any matter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s exactly unorganic that no pro-Republican stuff makes the frontpage. I&#39;ve been around here for a few years and at least to me it always seemed that reddit was generally pretty anti-Republican</p>

<p>Before Trump: what were the most upvoted pro-Republican posts on reddit not involving Ron Paul? I&#39;m honestly asking, because I think the general reddit userbase being quite anti-Republican is actually quite organic due to Republicans generally being associated wirh restrictive social policies and Christianity.

<p>My understanding is most of the people managing their media presence are on a more standard schedule, not uber style, and many of them work in an office setting. I can reach out for more info if your interested but I think almost all there employment is basically a normal job and you&#39;d probably have to live in the DC area.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot of negative aspects to social media presences but I still don&#39;t blame the person filling a job. We&#39;re all just trying to get by in the world and it&#39;s not like they are out to injure people.</p>

<p>Hell if I were to go off like that I&#39;d be going after every factory worker who worked in a car part production facility for playing some role in ruining the environment. Nah.

<p>Eh, I&#39;m fine with the ones that call businesses and I can tell them to leave me alone and take me off their lists, but the ones that call me out of office hours when I&#39;m at home can go and take their phone and shove it.</p>

<p>Sure, they are people, but they are people who choose to interrupt my personal relaxation / social time to try and flog me a product I will literally never, ever, ever buy, instead of calling someone else who has at least ticked a box saying that they are happy for some dickhead to call them while they are eating. Fuck them <em>and</em> their employers. Fuck the lot of them.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve had some bad experiences with telemarketers and I&#39;m afraid that I now respect the entire profession about as much as catering staff who don&#39;t think they need to wash their hands, or people who drive cars while sorting out their appearance in the rear view mirror or watching YouTube on their phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I explain why the new CTR will fail I need to lay out two things so both sides hate me equally and hopefully counter the downvotes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#39;m a free thinking Trump Supporter that has equally good and bad things to say about the president thus far.  My biggest concern of all is he is a zionist.  I despise zionism so this is deeply troubling. </p></li>
<li><p>r/The_Donald is a good place to find the other side of the MSM narrative but its also a hug box and the biggest echo chamber on all of reddit.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now on to 5 reasons why CTR will 100% fail again.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They need to pay people to battle on the frontline. While I don&#39;t believe r/The_Donald or the chans are 100% grassroots I do believe an overwhelming majority of the users are passionate about their role of super troll. They do it for Keks not $$$$.</p></li>
<li><p>CTR doesnt comprehend the lengths the autists will go to win the narrative war. The Autist&#39;s in most cases were raised on the dark net.   CTR is USA the Autist are Vietnam.  CTR is invading their home and the Autist are fighting for something much larger than a paycheck.</p></li>
<li><p>The Autists have figured out the best way to fight micro aggressions and the lefts liberal agenda is to spin the micro aggression back on the user.  They have turned the lefts ability to play the victim on its head. Hashtag and Meme Jacking is real and the Autists do it better.</p></li>
<li><p>81 Paid staff members vs 100s of 1000s code red drinking meme professionals.</p></li>
<li><p>CTR is making the LARGEST possible mistake by making every issue, tweet, statement a mountain when in most cases they are mole hills at best.  The Right did this with Bill and Obama.  They attacked them on everything and when something large and impeachable (bill) comes to light a good majority do not pay attention because they cried wolf for so long.  HRC used that to her advantage in the election.  She made it a point to illustrate how the right has been attacking her family for years and this is no different.  Her supporters were unwilling to look, read, listen or accept truth because they experienced the other side bashing them for years.  Now the left is employing that same tactic. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Um not really. T_D memes only inside that sub. CTR shilled everyware outside. If you don&#39;t beleve CTR wasn&#39;t mistake, look at r/politics. Literally brainwashed. With propaganda. Actually i dont beleve there is hope. Masses are becoming more and more stupid. Now imagine kids of these brainwashed idiots after 30 years. Imagine world then. The reason i believe in Trump is because he is ONLY HOPE. Yes only. He is not perfect. He is far from perfect. But he is different. Maybe he will do a good job and next presidents will not be able to undo the good things trump will have done. Revolution is impossible. People are too stupid. That&#39;s why i believe in new world order. When you start to see the bigger picture you become more and more pessimistic. You understand how shitty everything is. And worst are people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure these globalists who brainwash liberals want to make one world government. (they also tried TPP, TIPP, TISA) It is only for control. Its much more easyer to control one goverent than 100 or more. Okay now we got corrumped government. But what about people... look at media, those corrupted idiots and people who believe media. Maybe these shills want to save media reputation. But people - they are idiots. They never will know. Most of people still trust media (they say they don&#39;t, but they don&#39;t factcheck and look for bigger picture). Look what they are talking about wikileaks. Sick. The truth is future people will not be more aware. Those are my thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My second comment was more polite.  It occurred to me that they were basically saying the same thing, so I just pasted it over this one because I didn&#39;t see any point in lowering the quality of discourse with rudeness.</p>

<p>But I see what you&#39;re doing.  Public critics of the new government get painted as pedophiles.  Anonymous critics get painted as shills.</p>

<p>You need to discredit critics somehow, since there&#39;s no defense for what the president is actually doing.  We don&#39;t see the president&#39;s critics talking about disinfo media and nimble america. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessary to make false shill accusations when there&#39;s so much honestly shady shit going around.</p>

<p>But hey, maybe I&#39;m wrong.  Maybe the president&#39;s critics are actually the ones shilling?  Surely you&#39;d be able to tell me which page of the playbook talks about that, right?</p>

<p>Media Matters has already secured access to raw data from Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. We have also put in place the technology necessary to automatically mine white nationalist message boards and alt-right communities for our archive. 
We ill now develope technologies and processes to systematically monitor and analyze this unfiltered data.</p>

<p>Facebook responded to our campaign by achnowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do something about it, we began a dialogue. It became clear from these conversations that Facebook needed our help in fully understanding the problem and identifying concrete solutions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you one of the army of Trump-loving &quot;Bernie supporters&quot; that came out of Robert Mercer&#39;s funding efforts?  </p>

<p>If you truly are a progressive, you should be beyond angry at this point.  There is a hypocritical government in power that waves the flag of small government while instituting totalitarian policies.  We have an administration that does not understand that the president is not a king.  He has a chief strategist that, literally two days ago, said in a web video to his supporters that &quot;a very bloody period is ahead of us and we need Christian warriors to bring about the new era&quot;.  He just replaced people who actually know what they&#39;re doing on the NSC.  Speaking of which, there is also Flynn, who was fired for being batshit insane and then celebrated by sitting next to Putin at a Russian state dinner.</p>

<p>So tell me, as a Bernie supporter, which of his policies are you most attracted to?  Is it the corporatism?  Is it the stuffing of self-interested billionaires in the cabinet?  Maybe it&#39;s the ideals of Robert Mercer, the reclusive Long Island billionaire who collects automatic weapons, hates representative democracy, probably follows Dugin, and wants a white supremacist America. Maybe you think Bannon/Conway/Spicer are waging war on information, the media, and critical thought.  Maybe it&#39;s the Sec of Commerce who is anti minimum wage and outsourced thousands of jobs in his career.  </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m really curious how a Bernie supporter can seemingly ignore everything Bernie campaigned on and can shift support to someone who is completely and utterly diametrically philosophically opposed.  Please, do tell.</p>
