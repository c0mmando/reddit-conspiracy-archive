       I am subbed here and believe the earth is not a sphere moving at 66 thousand miles per hour, i understand there is a subreddit where everyone gets mocked and called names but inst the Flat earth conspiracy a Conspiracy still?
      </p>
      <p>
       my proofs the earth is not a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       1).Midnight sun happens for 3 days straight in Norway and has never been recorded in the southern hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). The earth has never ever been proven to move at all, no instrument in the history of mankind has ever done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3). A simple 23.4 degree tilt causes season changes on the nothern and southern hemisphere but when we are closest to the sun in our orbit we see no drastic change?
      </p>
      <p>
       4). Gavity is still a theory that cannot be proved here on earth, there is no experiments to prove it, just several equations to try and explain it, wouldnt the sun take our moon away once we get closer to said sun?
      </p>
      <p>
       5).No curvature can be observed at any point or place of the earth, even in amature ballons there is no sign of curvature unless the camera has a fish eye lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       6).If the earth is moving at 66,000 miles per hour, wouldn't that mean that once an object leaves our atmosphere we should leave it behind? Im guessing Relativity cannot pick and choose what moves together and what doesnt right?
      </p>
      <p>
       7). Where is the patent for the million mile internet connection that the hubble telescope uses to send us pictures and uses to navigate said telescope? It has been in outer space for over 20 years and no space debree has hit it, no planet like jupiter has sucked it in to its orbit, no malfunctions in freezing temperatures that are way harsher than anything we can experience here on earth?

       It's used for "quick approximations" and "desk calculations". In physics and other derived fields, often one can find a simple model and then add components onto it to make it more and more accurate. Notice their quick approximations also assume an aircraft of constant mass, which is obviously not true as fuel is consumed. I'll get to the rest of your points in the OP shortly.

       Do you get off on just fucking with people, like seriously who asked for your opinion? I dont give a shit what you think and honestly could care less what you think of me, the only reason i am even responding to you is because you are commenting on a post I wrote. Get off your high horse bud, go fuck off somewhere else, i see you definitely have some issues.

       "Inertia" only applies with the "theory of gravity". They should have proven that gravity actually exists, but they haven't because they can't. Tesla, who was brilliant, didn't believe in the theory of gravity.

       Sometimes you need to find the simplest truths, write them down, and build from that.  You aren't very skilled in physics and math, but you don't need to be.  You just need to think how the stars are laid out and who can see which ones.  Then maybe focus on who can see the sun and what parts of the map can not.  Build on simple truths.

       Have you ever been on a airplane that doesn't plane out and fly plane straight until you reach your destination? They fly straight and level for hours without adjusting for any curvature. Everything is programmed to correlate to a globular perspective. The software that pilots rely on is part of the deception. They are flying in circles.

       You just said that the plane would have to adjust for curvature, would they also not have to adjust to fly in circles? And what circumstances would they be required to fly in a circle? You didn't answer my question. Where is the edge, what the counter explanation if the earth isn't round then its flat you say, either we're confined to a finite area that we for some reason can't find the edge of, or there's some kind of force at work that makes the earth behave as if it were round.

       Look at the map I posted. magentic north is in the center (north pole). East is relative to the north pole. So you're going to fly in a circle and finish where you started.

       Aircraft leaving from Asia often ride the jet stream, which helps them save time and fuel. As a result, they fly further north and approach the West Coast closer to Alaska or Canada, and travel down from there. Now on this part I'm just hypothesizing, but it makes sense to get over land sooner rather than later in case of emergencies.

       Because it takes 365+/- days for the tilt to return to the starting position. The earth still rotates about the axis but the axis keeps the each hemisphere closer or further away depending on the position in orbit around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine looking down on the top of the sun. Now draw a circle around it. Label the top "N" and the bottom "S". Now draw slash and circle "ø" at 8 points around the circle, equidistant.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they say the Earth tilts, they don't mean back and forth, but that it rotates on a tilted axis. So you can see from your diagram that for a section of the circle around the sun, one end of the slash is closer, and on the opposing side, the other end is closer.

       I agree with your 3rd point. A slight tilt changes the earth's weather, but when the Earth is millions of miles closer to the Sun in its orbit, Earth's weather is not affected.

       You can be a million miles closer but if something is blocking that sun and shading you then its colder. When you are tilted away from the sun its the fact that you are shaded long enough for it to get cold. The sun needs to hitting the earth directly to warm it. Being close to it but shaded doesnt work. The sun does not warm the solar system.

       There are far more interesting scientific ideas than "flat earth." One example, the idea of intrinsic, quantum redshift (Halton Arp, William Tifft) as opposed to the academic science dogma that redshift always and only equals distance. This idea would obsolete the Big Bang model and bankrupt academic science's undeserved credibility.

       Indeed, there are far more interesting theories than the globe earth. The lie needs to come crashing down so we can make a serious effort to uncover the reality of where we live. Until then, it's just a bunch of common people making hypothesis and doing whatever small-scale experiments they can.

       I wish every flat earther that posts would say what they feel we live on.  If you think a circular platform surrounded by Antarctica, then say it - but then you need to explain how stars in north aren't visible to people in south, and vice versa.

       This is a valid point, but I think you're putting the burden of responsibility on the wrong party. Normal citizens don't have access to the incredible telescopes and other technology as establishment science and even religions establishments (i.e. the Vatican owns the world's most powerful telescope, ironically named LUCIFER.) I feel that there's sufficient scientific evidence disproving the globe earth, and establishment science should be forced to account for this. With all their resources and secrecy they likely know the exact truth. They hold the keys to Antarctica which they keep off-limits except to the elite world leaders. So it's doubtful they'll ever reveal the truth to us, but I find it unlikely that a citizen movement will successfully discover all the truths you're looking for, like the reason for eclipses and opposing star trails in northern/southern hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jury is out for me, but I"m leaning towards the possibility we live under a sphere/dome on a flat plane, and the spherical nature of our sky is what helps persist the idea we live on a sphere.

         You can join a local astronomy club that has telescopes available.  My local club is $50 a year and with that I can use telescopes that can image easily our local planets or deep space objects.

         For anywhere from $1000 to $3000 you can get a good home telescope that also allows you to image planets and deep space objects.

       It is only the north star, and its not visible because of perspective and perspective alone. And the reason i wont say what shape it is is because i have tried to prove it was a sphere not that the earth is flat. I can definitely prove the earth is not a spinning sphere moving at 66,000 miles per hour.

       Anyone who thinks the moon landings were real - at least the ones they showed us - are not paying attention. And if it was that easy to go up in the 60s, we should have been up many times since then, we should have webcams and satellite communication on the moon. We should know way more about it than we do. Instead, we just get more fakery from NASA.

       I don't know the answer, but isn't it possible that NZ is so far away from the north pole that it's impossible to see through the atmosphere? Just because flat earthers don't know how the stars work doesn't discredit the overwhelming evidence debunking globe earth. Not to mention establishment science does a terrible job defending the lie, but people stay ignorant because it's such a massive lie it's hard to overcome one has been lied to their entire life.

       No, it's literally in a position where it's below the horizon. You can see things on the horizon that are not in the same position as they are in the northern hemisphere, because the position on the surface of the earth is different.

       If the earth was flat, how much further could NZ be from the star than any other point on the flat earth? such that you couldn't see it for that reason? Seems unreasonable to me given that you can see other stars of varying brightness and distances, with the distance between the furthest two points on a flat earth being infinitesimally small in comparison to the distance from a star.

       The stars have been proven to all rotate around the northern star polaris, this is a fact, at night if your in the US you can actually record and verify this yourself, this simple action would be impossible on a globe as you would not be facing the north. What happens and can be recorded today should only happen at the north pole and it does not. You cannot see the north star from New Zealand because of perspective it is to far from the center point on what would be a flat earth.

       In the southern hemisphere the stars rotate around Sigma Octanis, the South Star. They do not rotate around Polaris, the North Star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the stars rotate around a different star in the southern hemisphere than the northern hemisphere.

       You won't be able to see the full circle, but if you are standing on the equator you can see both Polaris (North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star - with binoculars) with dtars revolving around them. As you go south Polaris moves below the horizon. As you go north Sigma Octanis dips below the horizon.

       Well regarding the first 4 minutes; Polaris is not exactly over the axis of Earth. It will be closest to the axis in 2102, then start moving away from the axis for the next 12,900 then start coming closer.

      <p>
       Thuban was the North Star 4,800 years ago at the time of the 'Old Kingdom' in Egypt—a period when most of the pyramids were built. The exact pole has crept from Thuban to its present position near Polaris and now is headed toward gamma Cephei, which will be the North Star in about 2,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the North Pole in the sky passes gamma Cephei, it will swing on through Cepheus toward Cygnus, the Swan, where the brightest star Deneb will become the Pole Star, although a fairly distant one, 8,000 years from now. By A.D. 17,000, the pole's circular path on the sky will bring it into the northern parts of the constellations Lyra and Hercules. And by A.D. 23,000, Thuban in the constellation Draco, the Dragon, will once again claim the title of North Star.

       If you look at these images you can tell that Polaris is not exactly at the center of the circle that the stars make:

       From the equator you can see both the Polaris (the North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star - with binoculars). As you look at Polaris (the North Star) you can see the stars revolve around it counterclockwise; at the same time from the same location on the equator you can see Sigma Octanis (the South Star) and the stars revolve around it clockwise. As you go south the North star dips below the horizon. As you go North the south star sips below the horizon. You can see the pole stars below the horizon depending on the tilt of the earth.

       This is absolute objective proof that the Earth is a spinning globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short proof is that if the Earth was flat, everyone would see the same stars. This is absolutely not true. People in the southern hemisphere do not see the same stars as people in the northern hemisphere. Please, you know this is true. Admit it.

       The stars move in exactly how they should in a globe Earth. This video lies over and over again .
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the quick rundown, verify or ignore, your choice determines if you seek truth or follow the dark side.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes 5-6 hours to fly across the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at your favorite flat earth map. Call the width of the USA "one (1) USA unit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the distance from Santiago, Chile (SCL) to Auckland New Zealand (AKL) on your flat Earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distance between Santiago and Auckland on your flat Earth Map is about "ten (10) USA units" as related to the size of the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the USA flight is one unit and the Santiago to Auckland flight is 10 units, that means it would take 10 times the amount of the USA flight time to get from Santiago to Auckland.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the USA flight takes 5 hours that means the Santiago to Auckland flight would take 50 hours according to your flat Earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes Qantas about 13 hours to fly between Santiago and Auckland. That's just about "2.5 USA units" if you look at a globe of Earth, you will see that the distance between Santiago and Auckland is about 2.5 USA width units.

       1) Midnight sun can only happen in the Northern hemisphere above a certain latitude, namely the same angle as the Earth's tilt, ~23.4deg. A quick search for a
       <a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/images2008/world-map-with-latitude-and-longitude.jpg">
        map
       </a>
       shows that there is no continental land mass in the Southern Hemisphere past 60deg. 90-23.4 = 66.6deg; a country would have to be beyond that latitude in order for Midnight Sun to occur. You can likely find links of (at the least) anecdotal evidences that it occurs at Antarctic research stations and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Source? It my knowledge, real aeronautical calculations take into consideration the rotation, and as such are experimental evidences that it does rotate. Similarly the ISS and various space missions. Mind you, I can understand why space missions and NASA-sourced data is not something to be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The difference in distance to the Sun between our nearest and furthest extremes is something like 3% of the total distance to the Sun. Meanwhile a tilt of 23.4deg has a minimum difference of 9% from maximum (at the equator; meaning 100% is when the surface of the Earth at the equator faces the Sun directly, and ~91% during a time of year when that same point is tilted above or below by 23.4deg as in Summer or Winter). This effect becomes more pronounced as one increases latitude away from the equator as it is a cosine function. At 45 deg lattitude the most extreme cases would be 45+23.4deg = 68.4deg, and 45-23.4deg = 21.6 the cosine of which is ~0.37 and ~0.93 respectively. These are effectively measures of how much sunlight is spread over how much area. The lower the value, the more area a fixed amount of light is made to cover. So from winter to summer at 45deg latitude, the amount of solar flux varies from 37% to 93% of what one experiences at the equator in fall or spring (100%).This is far more influential than the variation in orbital distances.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I find people have a hard time really grasping what gravity is for some reason. Gravity is not an equation, it is the thing physically pulling you towards the Earth. The equations come after the fact to try to mathematically represent that which we experience experimentally, all of us, everyday. It is true that it might wind up that gravity is actually some electromagnetic force, but for now it is simply a term used to describe the force that holds everything down. Even those videos describing gravity as a result of density are still talking about some kind of force that necessarily pushes us down; density in and of itself does not pick a direction without an external force like gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) If we've watched the same kinds of videos on the matter, some of them like to freeze the video and draw a line along the horizon to show that it's straight... but in some of them I can see a curve. It's kind of silly as a form of evidence. Again, if NASA sources are discounted then I find it unlikely there is any source I can provide that would be sufficient. One has to get pretty far away from the Earth to really start seeing the curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) It's not only things touching the surface that are going at rotational velocity. If you throw an object up it still has that speed; there's nothing, no friction, to slow it down because the atmosphere too has that speed. I can provide for you the equations of motion that would determine how much force upwards would be applied to an object as a result of rotational speed, but I assure you it's far less than the force of gravity. Gravity is about 9.8 m/s
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       the force resulting from rotational speed (yes, the speed is very high, but this point is notwithstanding) is about 0.0009 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       at the equator. Gravity is about 10000 times as powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) It's not an internet connection since it predates the internet as we know it. It's radio signals, like the kinds that have been around for over 100 years. Back in the day radio waves were used to transmit TV signals too; no hard connection required. All other orbiting bodies, including the moon, are too far away from its orbit to drastically interfere.

       The
       <em>
        scale
       </em>
       , the
       <em>
        size
       </em>
       of a thing is important. If one has little understanding of the magnitudes of things, then everything seems like it might be on equal footing. Some things have such a minute influence that it may as well not be there, and there are some calculations that are useful to treat in that manner, at least initially. Sometimes in physics and engineering, one does both the basic, and then the more advanced calculations, but if the change between the two is small enough (like 0.0009 compared to 9.8) then it is simply discarded, but the calculation is performed nonetheless in order to determine the scale of its impact.

       Your concept of scale is off. The Earth is almost 25,000 miles around, which means that 90 miles is about a third of one percent, or .36% to be more precise. The curvature would not be so extreme as to obscure objects under "miles of curvature". In addition, you can see objects from further away if your vantage point is higher, and doubly so if they are tall as well.

       Don't even try, they stop responding once they can no longer use one of their default responses in an attempt to disprove whatever you say but never answering the things they have never have answers for. Every time someone mentions that their concept of scale is off after they use the Hawaii example they never dignify it with a response.

       So questioning that we live on a flying sphere at millions of miles per hour without a single proof of said movement is bullshit? Do you know the stars have been Proven to move instead of the earth? I bet you didnt think that was ridicolous bullshit right?

       Lots of people believe it. The amount of flat earth content has exploded, and sure there's disinformation in there, but there's an overwhelming amount of evidence and scientific experiments debunking globe earth theory. People who say flat earthers are shills or it's a psyop aren't looking at the big picture.

       Well i know it is like speaking of santa clause or mystical creatures or even worse, the only question is why is no one even looking into it? There is no proof that your hurling through space at 66,000 miles per hour, on the contrary there have been studies that show that the stars are the ones that are moving and not us.

       I found like 3 people on here who were actually willing to address your post without belittling you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently watched the documentary "The Principle". It's very interesting when you learn that we can't prove we're not the center of the universe. I'm not saying the world is flat or round, I wouldn't be so arrogant to assume either.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't like to discuss it because to even entertain the idea is to admit that you've been duped and lied to your entire life and that you fell for it. Much easier to call everyone an idiot. I find the flat earth movement interesting because it shows just how many people don't buy into the official story and don't trust the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holographic universe theory seems to be the newest idea to pop into the science world. I'm willing to chat about any of this stuff if you want to PM. Otherwise good luck on your endeavors.

       Thanks a lot stranger, and yeah speaking of the shape of the universe is technically not allowed anywhere even where conspiracy theories are discussed. In short i havent seen the documentary you speak of but im thinking its the one with Michio Kaku where he later says that what he says got taken out of context, anyways will check it out today or tomorrow possibly.

       Yeah a whole bunch of the scientists later went on to say they were taken out of context. Which is strange because Michio Kaku doesn't say anything beyond what he always says. Someone up top didn't like the Copernican theory being challenged.

       If you liked The Principle, you should definitely watch Journey to the Center of the Universe. It touches on much of the same principles but IMO in a more interesting way. The holographic universe theory is also very interesting to me.

       The reason it's not taken seriously is because there are hundreds of equations in physics to prove we have a round earth, but none to prove we have a flat one. 
All the misconceptions flat earthers have can be explained be being educated on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe the flat earth theory is a psy-op to either discredit real conspiracies or to make conspiracy theorists look foolish.

       All it did was a stick 2000 years ago and the sun. 
I don't get it that earthers with smartphones and computers even in their fridge , do not understand that there is no need to believe.

       Lern geometry and do the erastothenes test. It takes six months and u have evidence.

       Mathematical theory is not science. Mathematicians can create crazy complex models of a fictional universe that checks out on paper, but not in scientific reality.

      <p>
       Discovering that there's absolutely no evidence of any measured curvature, and we can see much much further than we should if we lived on a ball, that's what did it for me. All the NASA fakery was icing on the cake.

       The earth can’t be a flat plane, because we’ve measured its curve. You, too, can precisely measure (and assign a number to) how much curvature, without having to estimate things with ships over the horizon, or trusting NASA not to lie to you!
      </p>
      <p>
       First, picture a regular ball.  If you pick a spot on the ball, you can trace a line a quarter of the way around, turn 90 degrees, trace another line a quarter of the way, turn 90 degrees, and trace a line a quarter of the way around, you’ll end up back where you started.
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Spherical_trigonometry_basic_triangle.svg">
        Here
       </a>
       is a visual.  You just made a triangle with 270 degrees!
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is round, you can do the same thing on it as well.  Go from the north pole to the equator, a quarter of the way around the equator, then back to the north pole.  If the earth really is a sphere, you’ll always be going straight, and always making right turns, but you’ll still end up where you started.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I’m not rich enough to do that, and I doubt you are too.  So we can do it on a smaller scale.  You can pick ANY 3 point on the globe.  The farther they are the easier it will be to measure, but any local hills, mountains, or tall buildings will do.  So, now that you have your land marks, you can use a theodolite or other surveying equipment to measure the distances and angles to the other two points.  From this, you should be able to construct a triangle.  You’ll find that your triangle will be slightly larger than 180 degrees (the bigger your triangle, the more it will be over).  If you’re really hard core you can use

       <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalTrigonometry.html">
        math
       </a>
       and figure out the whole triangle with only a part of it actually measured.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually how people were able to precisely measure the curvature of the earth for centuries before GPS and other such systems became available.

       So where is the scientific study? I know it is said we have done this but where is the peer reviewed study of measuring the curve?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know some people have used these to measure and found out that the earth didnt have curve.

       The problem is that most of this was done about 250 years ago, so it's a little hard to find people devoting their time in the last 50 years to something so definitively settled.  If you want to go straight to the horse’s mouth

       In the almost 16 years since 9/11 literally 1000s of architects, engineers and physicists have stepped forward to point out the gaping holes pin the official story…but in the 100s and 100s of years since the realization that a spherical Earth its not the centre of the universe not one…let me repeat that…NOT ONE physicist, astronomer or any other scientist has stepped forward to refute a spherical Earth.

       Not one? Are you being funny here? Literally thousands have done it, hell even Nikola Tesla the worlds smartest man by all accounts didnt believe in Gravity and said  this "Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."

       Without Gravity there is no spherical earth, no gravity = No orbits, no reason for sun and moon to be at that distance, no way to explain why the atmosphere doesnt get sucked into the vacuum, no way to explain how the ocean doesnt fly off into space, no way to explain how people in australia are upside down and also get rain in an upsidedown fashion, they give you an equation which the simple man cannot understand and tell you that it does all the magical things it does without ever proving it. Hell, density alone disporves gravity, everything heavier than air falls down because of its weight, lighter things like helium rise because it is lighter than air, if you blow a dandelion it will float for a couple of seconds before falling because it is just barely heavier than air, all FACTS not some bullshit THEORY which they cant even explain.

       I dont know, that is what mainstream media tells us, i mean its pretty much fact to you isnt it? Yet i can guarantee you dont even know what the equation to gravity is, yet youll sit here defending this so called Gravity without any FACTS whatsoever. I would love if you could give me one fact man, just one to show me how gravity works, i mean last time i checked it was still a theory no?

       I never proved flat earth, read the post again, i can prove to you that we are not on a sphere yes, matter of fact this whole thing is about the earth not being a sphere. Now since im sure you believe in a sphere earth im sure you would have at least one fact to back up your belief right? No strawman argument here, you want to defend gravity so im giving you a chance to prove me wrong, if im just stupid and dont understand gravity, presenting facts will always change my mind no matter what. I like everyone else believed in a spherical earth, saw that there is zero evidence for said  earth and changed my opinion.

       There are many scientists who did not accept the spinning ball theory. Watch Eric Dubay's videos. He quotes these scientists and he discusses their experiments proving that the earth is not a spinning ball. There is not one scientist that has proven the Earth is a spinning ball. The burden of proof is put on the spinning ballers. Extra-ordinary claims demand extra-ordinary evidence.

       1) Yes it has.  In Antarctica.  No other land in the Southern Hemisphere is far enough from the equator.
2) Just so, so many experiments and observations have shown that the earth moves through space.
3) How could be we "closest" in our orbit if the earth doesn't move, Socrates?  Anyway, the sun's energy doesn't have such a warming effect when it arrives at an angle compared with head on.
4) The sun would take our moon away, but if we were that close to the sun we'd be eaten up too.  The sun is really far away.  Gravity is not open to debate.  The astronauts dropped a feather and a bowling ball on the moon, and they fell at the same acceleration because of the lack of air resistance.  If you don't understand why then I don't know what to say to you.
5) Curvature is observed by everyone all the time.  It is the reason we have a horizon, and why the horizon gets further away the higher we go.  Otherwise we'd see to China with a powerful enough telescope.
6) Relativity doesn't have anything to do with it.  Well, it does have an effect but I'm not going to bother explaining why, not to you.  We bring objects through space with us because of gravity, which you don't believe in.
7) Science is pretty amazing isn't it?

       I scoffed at FE when I first heard of it. I didn't give it 1 single second of thought. Then one day when I was looking for an image of the earth, I could not find a single raw photo. This led me down a rabbit hole of me trying to disprove the FE, to which I could not do!

       I don't have all the answers, but I see deniers questions like "the stars blah blah blah", which tells me they don't understand the theory and are just like I was when I first heard about it.

       If you're claiming the earth is flat, id be able to see them with a telescope/binoculars then. You need a better argument

       you would be able to if you coud get past the smog, air, water, and pollution thats in the air. Islands in Hawai are seen from 100 miles away without a telescope, and remember that they say ships sail over the horizon because of the curvature which is easily proved false with a camera and zoom.

       Lots of people believe it. The amount of flat earth content has exploded, and sure there's disinformation in there, but there's an overwhelming amount of evidence and scientific experiments debunking globe earth theory. People who say flat earthers are shills or it's a psyop aren't looking at the big picture.

       Well i know it is like speaking of santa clause or mystical creatures or even worse, the only question is why is no one even looking into it? There is no proof that your hurling through space at 66,000 miles per hour, on the contrary there have been studies that show that the stars are the ones that are moving and not us.

       Me too.  It has enough believable items that it makes you wonder, like the 6mile long canal test.  But when you really think about it, it was a flawed test, due to refraction.
