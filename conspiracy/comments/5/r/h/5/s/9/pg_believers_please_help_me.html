        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off .... I&#39;m a believer that DC does have a Pedo problem.  History has proven Pedos lurk in the DC shadows (Hastert, Epstein  etc.) That being said I&#39;m having a very hard time believing a DC Pedo ring centers around a fucking pizza parlor.  I wanna believe.  I&#39;m trying to have an open mind but what I need is actual real tangible evidence.  </p>

<p>Please reply to this post and provide 1-3 pieces of real actual evidence that would prove your case, or at the very minimum be enough to get a search warrant issued. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in circumstantial evidence. Im talking about actual evidence that would be valid in a court of law or at the very minimum be enough to get a search warrant issued. </p>

<p>Is there a witness to any of these claims(even 1)? Is there a victim that has come forward and claimed CPP or JA are ring leaders of pedo ring or have been a victim of JA? Is there any DNA evidence? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in circumstantial evidence.  I need something that stands on it&#39;s own. PLEASE HELP ME.  I want to believe.</p>

<p>I keep reading about mountains of evidence and how this is all being covered up.  All I&#39;m looking for is 2-3 pieces of actual evidence so i can buy in 100%.</p>

<p>Please guide me and others like me by presenting 2-3 pieces of actual evidence so we can all get on board and fight this pedo ring together.  We are stronger together and can bring it down. </p>

<p>SPEZ: Waited two hours for even one piece of evidence connecting JA or CPP and havent received any. I do see the downvotes coming in though.</p>

<p>This is why it isnt taken seriously.  You shut down people wanting to believe because you cant provide any fucking evidence that can stand on its own.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure anyone believes it CENTERS around a pizza parlour. The evidence points to Alefantis being one of many players who involve themselves in trafficking and who happens to do so with, not just a pizza shop, but several other businesses besides as a front for his activities.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not the central focus and certainly not the biggest of the people involved.</p>

<p>Bigger connections - The Clinton Foundation and dealings with Haiti.. Laura Silsby..Dyncorp to name a few.</p>

<p>check this out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2MA5Ha9XmE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2MA5Ha9XmE</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what people want when it comes to asking for victims/witnesses. Victims are silenced. Those that are living have severe dissociative issues and if you don&#39;t understand how that is used specifically to stop the victim from speaking, do a little research on DID and MKULTRA. Furthermore, victims of ritual and sexual abuse have been coming out for years and years telling everyone this is going on at the highest levels and No One Listens. It&#39;s now a more public notion than its ever been and people are still apparently not willing to go back and listen to their testimony and rethink their dismissal of it. A victim has actually come forward directly due to the pizzagate investigation, however. Her testimony was posted to r/conspiracy a month or so ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Like I said in the 1st sentence I already believe Pedos in Washington are a problem.  Your video link confirms that for me.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m looking for though is not a general example of it existing but rather proof PG is real.  CPP, Besta, JA, David Brock, etc.  This conspiracy started and surrounds around the Podestas and CPP so I would like evidence pertaining to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is ample evidence that Podesta is involved with occult practices by his own emails/images. Take a look at what this man and his kin like to hang on their walls.</p>

<p>scroll down this page for a succinct presentation of images and connections related to Alefantis and the Podestas: <a href="http://pizzagate.com/">http://pizzagate.com/</a></p>

<p>I would say, though, that above Alefantis and Podesta, Hillary Clinton is the most implicated persona of all in Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one piece has to stand on its own because there are numerous pieces...and that becomes the point at which an investigation becomes the rational thing to do.</p>

<p>I would not just call that weird art. I think most people would agree that those are obviously disturbing pieces that clearly depict children being bound or restrained and tortured and most of them are nearly naked. Podesta also displays photos of naked teens in his home.</p>

<p>We have the infamous spirit cooking email, a close relationship to a woman known for performance of occult ritualistic acts, torture and mutilation (it really makes no difference if its called art.), and a photo of Podesta displaying symbols drawn on his hands in a gesture that&#39;s also an occult reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spirit cooking email in particular what exactly do you think they are talking about?</p>

<p>From my understanding Ibramovich has an art installment called spiritcooking. Its weird but it doesnt involve kids and if they were really going to do occult shit would they allow cameras there to film it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spirit cooking is an actual occult ritual. The mechanics of that ritual are outlined by Marina Abromovic here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TYhBbQBpnI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TYhBbQBpnI</a></p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t expect rituals that are presented in a public format as &quot;art&quot; to include pedophilia, would you? This is illustrating the fact that there is a certain interest and practice of dark occult belief systems amongst the elite.</p>

<p>Again &quot;weird&quot; doesn&#39;t describe what she&#39;s doing there. What she&#39;s doing is using blood, semen, breast milk, etc in what is clearly an actual religious practice that is meant to call on entities (whether you believe in them or not is irrelevant) that are evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who say it revolves around a pizza shop(s) are the ones trying to discredit it without actually digging into the real circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Theres no smoking gun yet.</p>

<p>If you want to look at the piles of circumstantial evidence, go on the pizzagate page on voat.</p>

<p>If you need examples or proof that pizzagate is possible, there are big lists of both democratic and republican and hollywood sex offenders / pedophiles.  Ive seen people compile them.  Ranks easily as high as senate and congress in many instances.</p>

<p>If you need some perspective, I look at it this way: lets say you are running an operation and you maybe want to pull some shady / illegal maneuvers (which we know that the Obama/Bush/Clinton admins have, and I&#39;m sure it goes back further but Im not good with history so i wont comment).  You need people working underneath you who you KNOW will play ball.  You can&#39;t afford to hire a mole.  So what do you do?  Well, you insert people into positions that you have power / blackmail over.  People that are at a low, yet this is a chance for them to be safe with a perversion and also be rewarded for it with money and power; all they have to do is play ball.  Simple - round up a few pedophiles (or people with other various discreet criminal backgrounds that haven&#39;t been convicted of anything) and insert them into key strategic powerful roles.  Before you know it, the administration would be teeming with sex offenders.  Now you establish a code of silence.</p>

<p>A lot of people get lost along the way because its portrayed as some sexual satanic cult of devil worshippers - no!  I think these are just every day pedophiles, who were already pedophiles before they got inserted into power, and they are just taking on these roles and being blackmailed.  All the satanic crap is just an attempt to delegitimize the logic among the general public</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you are saying.  My issue is PG isn&#39;t or at least hasnt been presented as a non partisan search for truth in DC.  It is and has been since the beginning a Clinton smear job (I fucking hate that bitch btw) that has focused tons (id say majority) of energy focused on JA, CPP, etc.</p>

<p>The reason people cant get behind it is because it has been a hodge podge of wild accusations thrown at numerous people without any concrete evidence.</p>

<p>It feels a lot like a witch hunt.  Imagine if you were the parent of that little girl who was taped to table.  These PG guys have basically tried to character assassinate her parents.  And for what.</p>

<p>I know pedos thrive in washington.  I&#39;m just looking for one real piece on evidence JA or CPP is associated with it.  Just one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there were any smoking gun verifiable evidence, we would no longer be in the investigative stage (but if there is something legitimate, then the intelligence are already several steps ahead of the public).</p>

<p>I agree; it absolutely is not limited to democrats.  Like I said, people have compiled lists of both republicans and democrats who have been publicly wrecked for this sort of thing.  In fact, I think the Boys Town scandal was strictly republican.  The only reason pizzagate started out as a partisan HRC smear job is because the name and movement exploded from Podesta&#39;s emails.  You will always have people who try to use it as a partisan weapon - but yea, the reality is that this has probably invested the whole system over the course of several decades and administrations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert on PG or politics or history.  I&#39;m just trying to be fair and relate all the info and perspective that I have collected ever since I saw that first &quot;pizza&quot; email and started doing my own minimal research.  Hopefully I was somewhat helpful to you, but yea I am looking for answers just like you are</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man.  I just don&#39;t like that the PG believers are unwilling to defend their position or are able to with evidence that stands on its own.  Worse yet is all the innocent lives these guys have character assassinated.  It&#39;s gross to go on a witch hunt like this and turn peoples lives upside down over bi-partisan hackery.</p>

<p>Just look at this thread.  Im pretty sure CTR shills arent DV it.  Who does that leave?</p>

<p>All I asked for was ONE piece of evidence that stands on its own that implicates JA, CPP etc and not one person could provide that.</p>

<p>The stuff you talk about I believe is true. The deep DC pedo stuff its there for sure but this PG shit is a distraction to discredit anyone bringing up DC pedo shit in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree that its been about a Clinton smear job. Those that first came together to investigate pizzagate came from all walks of life...its primarily the way its been presented by the opposition that ties it to an alt-right conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Many cases of Republican involvement have been presented to the public as evidence this is rampant in government but the reason this currently deals with the set of people it does is because these are the people we have been given evidence on through the leaked emails. Trust me, we&#39;re willing to work with evidence on anybody who&#39;s involved no matter what label they wear.</p>

<p>Here is what I think as to why he is on that list.  Which BTW makes a whole hell of a lot more sense than he is the pedo master.....</p>

<p>JA is on the list because a combination of two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He was dating a guy that has MAJOR MAJOR influence over the media (Brock not on there because that exposes him as a propaganda piece).</p></li>
<li><p>His Pizza joint is one of the most popular places for politicians to go to for a quick bite and discuss business off the books.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Brock isn&#39;t on the list because he is suppose to be a secret arm of propaganda for the democrats.</p>

<p>Again. I believe there is a pedo ring in DC. What I&#39;m saying is PG, JA, CPP is just a distraction to keep us uninformed. It&#39;s a classic misdirection and pysops. All the people ruin g innocent people&#39;s lives are ruining public perception and keeping people away from the real evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, this isn&#39;t distraction, it caught them off guard.  They were running sloppy knowing Hill was due for coronation, and a few things slipped that shouldn&#39;t have.  It has been unraveling since.</p>

<p>Pgate isn&#39;t the whole story, but it is a good avenue in, a hole or weakness.  There may be 100s of nodes to this.  As stories come out of other nodes like LA being taken down (or at least a layer there), things will weave together to other nodes.  These people travelled and intermingled.  </p>

<p>No, each bit of data gets it closer to the real evidence, and this is actually increasing and expanding public perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, people are not claiming there exists &quot;mountains of evidence&quot;. There are plenty of dots which are connecting and that is exactly how any investigation is built.</p>

<p>Second, Victims are victims without a voice for a variety of reasons. Besides threats, age, drugs, language barriers; there&#39;s a form of <em>conditioning</em> where the victim has no concept of normal...then there&#39;s CPS, FBI, street cops, detectives, judges that are involved, who may cover up or are <em>removed</em> if they don&#39;t want to play the game.</p>

<p>My sister went with her fears, concerns and then she proceeded to gather evidence. The more push back she experienced the more <em>unstable</em> she was painted by authorities and then even family.</p>

<p>We may never know all the facts because according to her all of her <em>evidence</em> was turned over to the police. It disappeared. In time, she too disappeared. I have no <em>proof of life</em> for my baby sister.</p>

<p>My personal exposure to &quot;investigating&quot; began in the &#39;90&#39;s . The &quot;evidence&quot; we were looking for never involved symbols or food. We were scouring for body identification, birthmarks. All of this after and because the authorities were not helping. </p>

<p>Perhaps the FBI/authorities knew of these <em>symbols</em> or food items that would have made her search easier, successful. I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>My nieces were toddlers when they were taken across the border. Toddlers are not very conversant. They can be appeased with a toy, a comfort item like a blanket, candy, ice cream. Take them into an environment where their native language isn&#39;t spoken around them and you&#39;ve immersed them even further.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a mess. It&#39;s the very darkest and our healthy minds and contented lives do not want to be disturbed. </p>

<li><p>Ive seen on voat, r/The_Donald and here numerous people claim there is mountains of evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Ok I can understand that. What about a witness then?  What about an angry politician that wants to bring the house down? Not even someone that is seeking to gain financially?  Now I figure you will say they are afraid for their lives which I understand but then I have to ask why is David Seaman still alive.</p></li>
<li><p>Sorry to hear about your sister and family.  I agree there is something going on in DC like I said from jumpstreet.  My point is if people really want to be taken serious then lets move past PG, JA etc. and start our focus on people we might actually be able to find real evidence on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This isnt taken seriously because its a joke, a rubblerouse, a partisan attack, witchhunt, mob etc.  I&#39;ve waited 3 hours and still NOT ONE person has provided one piece of solid evidence surrounding PG, JA etc.</p>

<p>there&#39;s plenty of research, documentation and carnage to consume.</p>

<p>Go for it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your search for &quot;actual evidence that stands by it&#39;s own&quot;, but this whole story it&#39;s (so far) something completely different. the fact that it all started from an email leak and from that a group of individuals made a huge effort on research that lead to what we know now, it&#39;s very different than an official investigation that points to find a smoking gun to be used in court. 
but so far what do we have? MSM not talking about it and the spread of the &quot;fake news&quot; that (pretty much) every head of state wants to fight over the <a href="http://www">www</a>. if all of this is real, and if all of this is just a part of what it&#39;s happening, there&#39;s so much dirt to find out.
when I&#39;ve approached PG I was also looking for evidence &quot;to make sure I&#39;m not a simple minded dude that could believe anything&quot;, but now I realize it was a shocking reaction for what I saw, I was unable to believe it could be so easy to get along with this for those people, now I simply accept that this was probably one of the most important redpills ever (for those who choose it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please watch Alex Jones on Joe Rogan. He basically says exactly what I&#39;ve been saying since PG broke. PG is a pysops distraction to discredit the real pedo ring in DC.</p>

<p>I believe there is a pedo ring I just don&#39;t believe JA, CPP and all the innocent InstaGram posts are part of this master pedo ring.</p>

<p>Stop feeding the pysops by feeding into PG. Change the name and start looking at the elites not some pizza parlor.</p>
