    <div class="md"><p>Baselessly accusing specific people or entire swaths of people as racists who disagree with you or who are problematic to you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lost count a long time ago how many times I&#39;ve seen &quot;Trump supporters are all racists&quot; - ok, so half of the country are all racist.  Anybody who Trump associates with is a racist.</p>

<p>As a country, we agreed racism is bad.  Over the course of the late GW admin and the entire Obama admin, people learned that you could ruin peoples careers or their public image if they said something a little edgy, or if they criticized minorities AT ALL, or even just made a general observation regarding social constructs that brought ethnicity into play.  If you labelled somebody a racist for something that they said, you now were able to have power over them in some way and you could totally delegitimize whatever they stood for.</p>

<p>It was perfect- the left had the minority vote AND they could weaponize racism to keep their opponents mouths shut.  And a huge portion of the public ate it up because the &#39;holier than thou&#39; mentality is easy to get caught up in, especially if you align with the political view; but lets face it, we&#39;ve all said some edgy shit in our personal lives- we aren&#39;t all racists.  People are generally tolerant.</p>

<p>I am happy to report (nay- over-joyous) that this race baiting bullshit is coming to an end.  Calling somebody a racist just does not have the same power that it used to have.  Its almost laughable.  And honestly, its sad, because they gave a bad name to true racism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply, I can&#39;t claim agreement but I do understand what you are saying and maybe even a bit of the why. </p>

<p>I am mostly curious about this,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because they gave a bad name to true racism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you mean by the statement; it is the phrase,
&quot;true racism,&quot;   I might need help with, but based on your comment  and that phrase I will guess this.</p>

<p>You think too much discussion is made about what you are viewing as casual remarks based on broad social generalizations and sometimes called stereotyping.  </p>

<p>I believe those kinds of comments get the spotlight because they are considered to be demeaning, disrespectful, humiliating, etc, etc, by the people belonging  group that has been labeled as and are called stereotyping because they are not supported by standardized research.</p>

<p>I also believe that kind of stereotyping is often a product of  bigotry based on sex, religion, and race or cultural origins.  </p>

<p>So what is, &quot;true racism?&quot;</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/The_Watterboy.html">The_Watterboy</a> 2017-02-01</p>
    <div class="md"><p>What I meant by &quot;true racism&quot; is: genuinely making disparaging remarks (for example, blatantly calling a black person a nigger in the context that they don&#39;t see them as an equal or meant as a direct insult) or taking prejudiced action (not hiring, not offering equal opportunity, depriving things from people that should be guaranteed, just because of their race, ect) against others.</p>

<p>The big issue that we run into as a culture is that the second bit (the action of deprivation) is a legal matter, and it is basically measurable- if it falls between these lines, it is discrimination or a hate crime ect.  But the first issue requires some level of common sense; its a grey zone, and you have to judge it situationally, on a case-by-case basis.  You need to know a bunch of facts and context to fully determine if it was a &#39;racist&#39; statement; and even then, I believe you are protected under free speech to insult somebody by calling them a nigger, for example.  But - simply saying the word nigger does not make you a racist; its all about context.  and we have been grappling with that concept as a culture, because the word is powerful and has history.</p>

<p>This is just one of the many words though.  When you consider that fact that minorities could consist of anybody of any culture, religion, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity (except &#39;white men&#39; as the left would say, which ironically enough, actually IS racist the way white people are being demonized publicly right now lol) things get extremely complicated, and the window of interpretation gets wider and wider, and it becomes easier to attack somebody&#39;s credibility for literally anything they might say as a social observation.</p>

<p>So - the left saw this, and capitalized on the power of being able to control this narrative.  To be fair, its probably not just the left, but for the past 8 years, majority of the perpetration has come from the left.  I&#39;m worried that the right will adopt this strategy now that they are in power- a sort of similar situation is that SNL writer who got fired for making a comment about Baron Trump.  Its not QUITE the same thing, but a similar gist (using people&#39;s speech to persecute them, even though we have freedom of speech).  I actually support Trump and think its stupid to attack his kid; but I don&#39;t think she should have lost her job over it.  Its a baad precedent to follow, and detrimental to us as a culture, regardless of political affiliation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a weapons demonstration for the people of the planet with top secret clearance. NG got a team of highjackers together via Anwar al-Awaki. They all meet in West Falls Church. Once the highjackers took over the cockpits NG remote controlled the airliners. 3/4 hit what they were supposed to. All the targets will still destroyed because the planes were just smoke and mirrors for the classified tech used that day. Dr Judy Wood pretty much got it right except she couldn&#39;t cite the weapon used because classified weapons aren&#39;t on Wikipedia. </p>
