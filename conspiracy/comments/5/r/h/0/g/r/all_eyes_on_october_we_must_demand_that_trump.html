        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">475</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/edgarallenbro.html">edgarallenbro</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Folks, here&#39;s the cold hard truth about whats going on in today&#39;s confusing world of politics.</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s inception, the CIA has served the interests of elites over the needs of the citizenship. This marriage of military intelligence operations and business is properly referred to as a &quot;Deep State&quot;, an organization within the USA that holds the real reins of power.</p>

<p>This Deep State has organized coups, started wars, and assassinated dissenters to establish a global empire that benefits only the rich and powerful.</p>

<p>JFK recognized this and tried to dismantle the CIA. He fired it&#39;s director and many underlings who he believed were working against the interests of the American people.</p>

<p>So in 1963, he was assassinated. Most evidence points to this assassination, which was blamed on a patsy, to really having been carried out by members of the Deep State, most likely the former CIA members fired by JFK working with the mafia. The answer is not certain.</p>

<p>Since then, the threat of assassination by the Deep State has loomed over the head of every president we&#39;ve elected, and they&#39;ve bent the knee and done what was wanted of them.</p>

<p>In 1992, Oliver Stone&#39;s film &#39;JFK&#39; and public demand triggered a renewed congressional investigation into the JFK assassination. This investigation revealed that it was indeed NOT the work of Oswald the lone gunman, but an actual conspiracy. However, they did not release the full details of their investigation. Instead, they deemed them a &quot;risk to national security&quot; and sealed them to be released in 25 years.</p>

<p>And now 25 years has passed. These documents are set to be released in October 2017. They contain thousands of pages of secret CIA files that would completely erase the public trust in that institution and in turn, our entire government.</p>

<p>And so the deep state is in a panic. They have reigned for over 50 years, and now their reign has an expiration date.</p>

<p>And this panic is why the political climate is where it is right now. They have been manipulating the stream of information so that the only general consensus is that everyone is angry and confused and no one knows what to believe. They want to fill the news with so much bias and outrage that if these documents are actually released and they prove the CIA assassinated JFK, no one will believe it, or worse, they simply won&#39;t care.</p>

<p>It is up to the president whether these documents actually get released. Trump is the wild card. The choice of whether or not to release these documents will be his bank bailout moment.</p>

<p>Even if you think these documents will prove the opposite, that JFK was NOT assassinated as part of a conspiracy, you should be fighting to make sure they are released, so that the truth wins out in the end.</p>

<p>All eyes on October. Do not lose sight of whats important. It has been more than 50 years, we cannot continue to let the answers be withheld.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roger Ebert once said about this film: &quot;One might feel sorry for George W. at the end of this film, were it not for his legacy of a fraudulent war and a collapsed economy. The film portrays him as incompetent to be president, and shaped by the puppet masters Cheney and Rove to their own ends. If there is a saving grace, it may be that Bush will never fully realize how badly he did. How can he blame himself? He was only following God&#39;s will.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Family of Secrets - The Bush Dynasty, America&#39;s Invisible Government by Russ Baker gives a lot of hints of what will remain missing.</p>

<p>You can find their FOIA request of what is official still not released here:</p>

<p><a href="https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/view/record?objectId=090004d280af239b&amp;amp;fromSearch=true">https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/view/record?objectId=090004d280af239b&amp;amp;fromSearch=true</a></p>

<p>Devil&#39;s Chessboard by David Talbot.</p>

<p>Both bring up issues with the known documentation that is still yet to be released:</p>

<p>While if you really want to go down the rabbit hole look at this CIA study on what they were willing to admit they were hiding two years ago in their &#39;Studies in Intelligence&#39; series article:</p>

<p>DCI John McCone and the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy</p>

<p><a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB493/docs/intell_ebb_026.PDF">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB493/docs/intell_ebb_026.PDF</a></p>

<p>The Mary Ferrell organization still has a running list of things missing, including the testimony that G.H.W. Bush gave to the Church Committee Hearings along with several other more interesting documents... However the group does good work but is infiltrated with intelligence types of all types and M.F. herself was an OSS Society member.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I can&#39;t believe people think that our government would murder it&#39;s own presidet but not go into wherever the fuck these files are stored and change them.</p>

<p>Do you understand that the CIA had a hand at killing him. They don&#39;t just keep a report admitting to it.</p>

<p>&quot;We the CIA conclude that we the CIA assassinated the president..ooooooooops&quot;</p>

<p>Sincerely,
The CIA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if it was Russia? How do you justify not doing something extreme in those circumstances, and doing something extreme would have risked the world being destroyed by nuclear war. I have no idea who is behind the assassination, but if I President in 1992 and found out it was Russia I would have sealed the records for at least 25 years. In the current political climate, with Russia being accused (falsely IMO) of political interference I&#39;d probably seal the records for another 25 years if I were Trump. At the end of the day though no matter what those documents say the CIA had the power to influence them in any direction they chose. My guess is that the reason so many accusations have been thrown at Russia recently is to create a climate in which the documents (which in this scenario say Russia killed JFK) can not be safely released. The CIA (again, in this scenario) don&#39;t want the documents released because they would not hold up to the sort of scrutiny that an internet connected world can provide, perhaps putting them firmly in the frame as not only the assassins but the only organisation capable of subverting the findings that say Russia did it. All just conjecture though, I&#39;m only thinking out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be aware that if you get what you ask for there will be major unintended consequences for that. </p>

<p>I have one theory on what may happen from that.</p>

<ul>
<li>For one there may be a crash of the economy and two complete chaos. The chaos won&#39;t be on martial law level but you may not recognize daily life anymore. </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s bad enough we&#39;ve got the online and IRL hands of control all around us. Now imagine that being made worse by people realizing (if it is implicated) the CIA has been merkeling people since the 60&#39;s.</p>
