       You guys are a buncha fucking pussies don't be such a baby that's how you don't get paranoid. If that podcast scares you, you've got way bigger shocks coming than that bro. That podcast was high on the podcast scale yes, but that's the world we live in just relax they're people like you and me, for now.

       Surely this isn't a serious post. But this might actually be a 14 year old girl or something. Which would be hilarious, but probably not the best way to address this pussy's concerns.

       Meditation and good weed. The best thing about bullshit on the Internet is that it can easily be vetted within minutes by just doing some good ol online digging.

       PizzaGate is a realllll deep rabbit hole and once you connect a certain amount of dots it becomes pretty clear this isn't just a 4chan hoax. The most concrete evidence is the emails themselves.. They are 100% verified by a google encryption watermark left on every gmail email. The emails speak for themselves.

       Podesta's art in his office depicting ritual human sacrifice got me, along with the police rendering of child abductors that "weren't" him and his brother and the scarring on his hands from cutting himself ritually.

       I think you read his post wrong. He's talking about the Rogan Podcast with Jones. They got into pizzagate and eventually brought up that video of the the band with the Tranny playing at comet pizza. Joe proceeded to play the video where the tranny says a few things some guy says "He fucks kids!" or something. The tranny replies "high I think that was his manager" in a sarcastic tone. The crowd jeers and hollers back "noooo" to which the tranny replies "Oh... Well... We all have are preferences!" She then chuckles in a sinister manner as the crowd proceeds to erupt in laughter along with her.

       Read things with an open mind and a skeptical attitude; meaning be willing to accept something that sounds crazy, but absolutely fact check everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will find that the conspiracy lot are mostly a pretty logical bunch.  Be aware that many strategies by those wishing to cover things up involve disinformation and even feeding false stories to convolute the real evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to not getting bummed while going down rabbit holes, just try to set time aside to indulge in positive things and the company of good people you enjoy being around to remind yourself the world is not all bad.

       My personal goal is simply to get as close to the truth as possible, while understanding there is no Truth and there is no Truth worth getting riled up into a killer frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance, it seems like a very simple, easy goal. How hard can it be to find the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that most of the information easily available is designed to keep you from finding the truth, and that finding the truth will break you, completely and utterly, if you are not already broken in some way. The truth will destroy you and everything you love, if you let it; but even so, there is nothing more valuable; nothing else matters more than the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your eyes are open to the truth now, even if it's maybe just a tiny crack. Welcome! and I'm very sorry for your loss. Nothing will ever be the same again; you can't go back.

       The goal is always truth. We are philosophers of sorts. It should never be about partisanship. Ever. If everyone on this sub passed along info to one other person that helped them start to see through corruption, the number would grow exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, i do my best to fact check as many big  main stream media stories as possible. When i hear family or friends regurgitating the "official narrative," i state the facts and point them to my sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when finding news sources, try to find out who is signing the paychecks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above all else, see this journey of discovery as positive. Don't get bogged down by negativity. You'll learn things that will make you sick, but you will go forth armed with the truth and that is exactly what those pulling the strings don't want. They want people dumb and oblivious. They'd rather you watch your favorite TV show than read what happened in the world that day.

       To become knowledgeable with truth and have a real understanding of how the world really works and what was hidden in history that the Elite didn't want the general population to know or understand. They don't want people to rise up. They want you to think we are a great country and could never do anything wrong to hurt anyone. That we have good values and could never be dirty, when in reality every government has the possibility to be dirty and always have secrets from the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't go around correcting people though, telling them they are constantly wrong but rather have a calm debate with others. Nobody likes being told what to do or how to learn but others don't seem to realize that that is entirely how the education system brought them into the adult world. You were told to read a certain subject and if you didn't agree with the books or questioned it, you were told you are wrong.

       Check out the 100th monkey effect. The more consciousnesses that are aware of truth, the more consciousnesses will eventually become aware of truth. How? What we are, fundamentally, is energy. That which can neither be created nor destroyed. The world is more magical, more spiritual, than our generation has been groomed to know. We can pass information along through the energetic frequencies our consciousness manifests. So, by being a truth seeker and going down the rabbit hole with a strong heart and resilient mind, we are doing our part in waking up the world. Once the entire world is aware of the truth, we'll kick the doors down of the elite cabal and make this world beautiful again. That's my reasoning. Cheers, brother

       Just research as much as you can about it.  Research perspectives that veer not only toward what you think is the case, but
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       what you think is the case.  Look at all sides as much as possible.

       That's a really wide, open-ended question.  You're going to have to be more specific.  Paranoid?  About what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, we live on a fucked up planet.  It's ruled by forces that do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       really have our best interest in mind.  We are slaves to them.

       Sucks, but ultimately it doesn't matter because this body is only a temporary vehicle anyway.  Good life or bad life, the vehicle's eventually gonna wear out and be gone regardless.  The part of you that
       <em>

       that physical vehicle, however, doesn't wear out as easily, and that part continues on, so, again, what's there to be paranoid about?

       So you’re paranoid that you won’t be able to tell the difference between facts and misleading information.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not being paranoid.  That’s being unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with being unsure.  Just, again, research and research some more.  There’s a lot of confusing and misleading information where it regards covert (and even overt) data on this planet.  That’s pretty much the way it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still trying to find out what you’re paranoid about, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you paranoid that some sources might be giving you wrong information on purpose perhaps?  If so, then let me assure you:  You
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       .  Some sources are definitely in the business of muddying and confusing the waters.  That’s why you, again, research and research some more.  Look at at many different sources as possible regarding any one topic and continue to keep your options open even after it seems you have a pretty good handle on what exactly’s going on in any one issue.

       I can tell you from personally researching and following it myself that once you go down the rabbit hole and start to find more news reports of things that have been released in the news but suppressed by the mainstream and not widely talked about will lead you to an internal conflict that will be difficult to deal with and accept because you will not be able to understand how something like this is possible how something like this is so widespread and the things that they do and have hidden from normal people are so unbelievable that you will have a very difficult time accepting it.  you will get angry you will get sad and what you do from there will be up to you the rest of us have chosen to fight and to dig deeper knowing that the rabbit hole gets much much darker many choose to get out and stop looking because it's very difficult to handle and absorb what you find out just know that it's OK to stop researching and to go back to your normal life.

       My favourite source on what has been going on behind the scenes is this guy Donald Marshall who claims to be an illuminati whistleblower.  He says he is regularly taken to a VIP cloning centre against his will, and passes on a lot of insider knowledge on his forum accessed through this website:  astral7ight.blogspot.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very farfetched from our reality but the more I read his stuff, the more it seems to check out.  (If this guy is a psyop--which is possible-- then it's a work of genius.)  According to Donald Marshall, Alex Jones and Joe Rogan are both down with the illuminati and attend the same VIP cloning centre.  Jones and similar others are feeding the public some truth, but it's controlled opposition.  "They say what they're allowed to say".

       My general understanding is that the illuminati leaders want one world government.  (So basically they are globalists.)  Celebrities including journalists are not going to reveal their involvement with the illuminati .  They could be killed.  The illuminati is kind of like the mafia.  Once you're in it, you can't get out (although many want to).  They are allowed to hint, to keep things interesting.  So you will get some but not the whole story from Jones and co.

       You have to understand, it's not so simple. You can't even begin to depict all of the major or minor players and links between corporations and states. Then we get into the variety of agencies, the spies both government and corporate (don't forget the religions and cults)
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of players on the global stage. Some stay out of each others way. Some good people, some bad, evil, power hungry mother fuckers. Plenty of people don't like each other. A lot of factions with varying degrees of influence and agendas.

       Take everything that comes out of Alex Jones' mouth with a grain of salt. Some of the stuff he says is somewhat plausible, but I find the majority to be unsubstantiated, and he's all over the place with his thoughts - zero logical consistency. He's on the cusp of psychosis IMO

       He's been going down the rabbit hole for longer than most, and far deeper. He has cultivated deep contacts for a very long time. TPTB constantly twist his words, and depict him as crazy.

       The masses think he's insane because he believes insane things; things like reptilians, clones... in my opinion what separates logical truth-seekers from the tinfoil hat types is shit like that, I personally believe in aliens, but I'm not about to claim someone's an alien just because he's a fucking weirdo.

       Even the part about Google AI being able to create neural networks? He sounded like a mad man. Also, it's convenient for him that all his supposed sources are dead because now no one can call him on his shit. InfoWars is not actual news, they hear things and run with them - they don't analyze and investigate stories in depth before releasing it to the public. I like Alex Jones because he's entertaining, but 90% of what he says is pure BS.

       You know artificial neural networks for AI are a mainstream thing right? Scientists have been working on them for a long time. Self-driving cars use neural networks to identify lane markings and red lights. Google uses it for image identification. Neural networks are basically algorithms that mimic our brain processes, and that "learn" over time through repetition. It would not surprise me at all if Google was developing a secret AI behind the scenes.

       There isn't a lot to be paranoid about. Question everything and don't listen to everything you hear. Your paranoia is a self-induced feeling. I definitely became extremely paranoid once Wikileaks confirmed way too many conspiracies. I researched history, politics, recent wars, etc. like crazy. I'll be honest, I did have quite a mental breakdown. I wasn't sleeping right, I was skipping meals, I was excessively drinking/smoking weed. I just could not stop researching where we live and how we got here. I felt so confused that everything I had learned in life from school might be more than just a white lie. I tried to talk to coworkers about it and they kept telling me to just ignore it and live my life. I was shocked nobody wanted to learn what I was learning and just accept that "Crazy shit happens and that is why we have Trump". They didn't want to learn how we got here like I did so I had to go back to my rule "Don't walk politics and don't talk religion, that's how you keep your friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that I oddly agreed entirely about Alex Jones, is that honestly to know what he knows, it is and can be based on your wide collective research on what there is to know about our world and the possibilities that everything isn't absolute and defined as complete fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we have hundreds of thousands of scientists that do come up with the same results but there are many people who still question how sure they are and how definitive they are in being correct. There are way too many people who don't question everything because they say "I'm not a scientist but since they have a degree and do this as their life work, it must be true".
      </p>
      <p>
       For all of the history of humanity, scientists have always been corrected or proved wrong. It isn't likely that it does still happen today and it really does.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of resources out there that helps you understand everything. Wikipedia is a good source, regardless of everyone telling you it isn't. There are thousands of Youtube links that are documentary snippets or people just reporting conspiracy facts/stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a wild ride of knowledge ahead of you but take only as much as you can, don't make it become an obsession and take over you. Even if you do come to conclusions about certain subjects, always have the open mind that you may be wrong and so may be the subject you are understanding.

       Stop being a pawn of the MSM's grand game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to opposing viewpoints (MSM on one side, alternative media on the other,) Tell your well-meaning friends to fuck off with their opinions about where you listen to your news and gather your own info, make your own fucking opinion from the two, and then point everyone you know in the direction you think the truth lies. You'll be well ahead of the game.

       Just chill and take it slow. If you get overwhelmed, move on to lighter activiti9for a few days. Eat and sleep healthy, and your mind will be more up to the task of researching these sometimes DEEPLY disturbing rabbit holes. Also, be careful what you repeat to every day people as you could come off as paranoid, do the home work and you'll see... a lot is out in the open these days :(

       Alex Jones is a divisive figure within the "conspiracy" community, if you want to call it that. I'm not going to say don't listen to him, but if you do, just research anything he says yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a much better person for getting started is James Corbett of
       <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com">
        www.corbettreport.com
       </a>
       . He meticulously references all the sources he uses, produces great content that covers a variety of topics, and presents himself in a very professional manner, not fear-mongering like Jones.

       Same way you'd solve any crime. Most of what we talk about here is simply the investigation of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask questions like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there evidence?
Is there destruction of evidence or a mysterious lack of evidence?
Who would benefit?
Is there a historical precedent of this happening?

       Another good podcast that will really get you going is
       <em>
        Those Conspiracy Guys
       </em>
       . 2 sometimes 3 guys shoot the shit and cover most of the conspiracies you can think about and even some sillier ones like Bigfoot. They try and keep an open mind and they discuss all the possibilities even if they're outrageous.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the ones I personally enjoyed was the Atlantis one and Simulation theory. In the Atlantis episode they tied together Atlantis with Hitler and the fourth Reich, with the symbol of the swastika, with hollow earth, with Noah's flood being cause by melting ice and finally the polar shift that happens ~13k years or so which is coincidentally around as long as we have been around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really good stuff. I know you guys would all love it.

       Note that this is Platonist thought, it is absolutely not new, and I have invented nothing in that regard. It has been forgotten because we live in a mechanist/materliast paradigm, but it is very old wisdom, which recently science has given credence too.

       How do you follow a conspiracy if you want to look into something?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Google is not your only friend, there are many trusted sites/youtubers/forums/podcasts which you will start to get to know the longer you are on r/conspiracy, soak up as much information and use it to form your own opinion.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Following one specific conspiracy is hard becuase sometimes no new information is presented on the subject for a little while so you can either investigate yourself by searching links between money exchanges associated people/companies/locations etc... and sharing your finds with the community or keeping an ear open for any mentions.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       How do you know what to follow?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Well this is mostly preference and belief tied into actual evidence, if you've managed to form your own opinion about a specific conspiracy and have a vested interest in the outcome then it should be one to follow, it's really hard to follow a conspiracy you just not interested in for some or other reason. My example would be "Flat Earth theory" to me it doesn't matter whether the earth is flat or not, even if I found out this were true tomorrow I'd probably just be like "Oh, ok." then keep doing whatever I was doing.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       How do you keep yourself from becoming paranoid?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         This depends on your personality, there are some fucked up theory's you'll find and if you just believe them all at face value it will drive you insane. the best way to think about it is am I doing anything that can put me in harms way? if the answer is yes then are you ready to face the consequences?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The way I personally keep myself from becoming paranoid is be as healthy as I can be, avoid dealing with global corporations as much as possible and exercise every day (A healthy body leads to a healthy mind). Besides, when the zombie apocalypse starts you want to be able to run faster than the people around you. ;)

       Don't worry. Yes, there is so much stuff out there that it maybe daunting on what to look at first. The good news however is that ultimately it is all connected so you'll get around to everything - from Pizzagate to Paleidians eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not going to point you to documents and say "read this" because that ends up feeling like school study and might not interest you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find one or 2 topics that interests you and look into them. There will be somethings in there that catch your attention either in a good or bad way. It doesn't matter. Look up information on those until something else intrigues you and continue.... and continue. No matter how far off your 'bullshit meter' just continue and consume the information that stands out. It makes the learning process fun because it is what you want not what you are forced to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another note is dismissing a topic because you think you know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been into conspiracies for a long while and started to look into Flat Earth last year... not because I believe it, but because it would be narrow-minded to simply brush it off without at the very least understanding the arguments put forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have both sides of an argument, even for something you currently think is crazy &amp; ridiculous, then you follow the path which resonates with you. That's it.

       Pick one that bests interests you and just throw some hours in.
      </p>

       Remember: Even if it's all proved to be false - absolutely everything - you have expanded your knowledge on almost all topics and you have developed as a person to have an open-mind.

       It's honestly really hard not to become paranoid, or at least feel the anxiety from it all and the sense that there is this weight on your shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can recommend is to continue researching on your own path, follow what interests you and what your gut tells you. After a few years I thought I had put it all together, and here I am like 6 years later looking at it all again with fresh eyes, thinking I finally have it figured out. I'm sure I'll look back again and have a new perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things can get negative, just remember that you are searching fro truth, and that is light and love. If you keep at things with an open, yet critical mind, and remember what you read (even from years ago, sometimes you will go on a google search for hours trying to dig up that thing you remembered reading about just so you can look up names and tie things together from something you just read).
      </p>
      <p>
       The way it all comes together is really far out. Both Alex and Icke kind of refer this is as the penultimate conspiracy, and I feel the same. I can't help but think we will learn more as we go though.
