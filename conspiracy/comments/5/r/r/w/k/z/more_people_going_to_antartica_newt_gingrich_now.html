       You know how Australia is filled with all kinds of weird animals that don't exist anywhere else? Well in Antarctica there is a land mass under the ice and as the ice melts away it reveals all kinds of new archeological and animal records we never even dreamt of before. People wanna check that shit out.

       To give em credit, it is a nice place to visit. I know because I've been there. Twice. Its special, unspoilt, raw, naked, beautiful. I'd live there full time if I could.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're free to prove me wrong though. I think Mc Cain visited when I was living/working down there. Something to brag about I suppose. Heck, I'm doin it right now because the place is that awesome and special.

       If they made a "large announcement" it would have to be "folks, we officially melted the icecaps and we need to stop using fossil fuels today."

       US economy is so heavily dependent on the fossil fuel economy (petro$) that it would cause complete financial ruin for not only the US but also their trading partners (aka the whole world).
      </p>

       Fossil fuel divestment and the green economy should have started way sooner, now it's too late to do it without fucking everything up.

       the reason they're not saying anything about what's happening in antarctica is that they dun goofed and would have to admit the climate is indeed fucked and both Dems and Reps did nothing to prevent it.

       There is absolutely NO way of teaching someone how an economy works through Reddit. Specially if they THINK they already know how it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's DEFINITELY not my job to do so. If this kid wants to maintain his wrong view on this because he has absolutely no clue how an Economy works, he can. If he wants to learn, he also can.

       You're not right. The American dollar is tied to international oil prices. This was an attempt to make the dollar more relevant in a global economy which is made up of rubles, francs, British pounds, etc. You ever wonder why England doesn't trade oil in shillings? Or why Mexico doesn't trade oil in pesos? Wonder these things. Then look them up. Then be a dick on the internet.

       Something never mentioned these days is the leaked information of maybe twenty years ago involving Antarctica and salt.  It was very weird and vanished from the news almost immediately.  Apparently, salt was being taken to Antarctica.  Reason never specified.  The reports claimed even workers in Antarctica were carrying as much salt as they physically could.  Even their pockets were filled with it when they landed to replace outgoing workers

       what makes you so sure? How can you be sure about anything? The fact that there is life in this universe, or even a universe itself it pretty strange. Maybe there are demons and maybe there are not, my point is you have no clue.

       I would caution against grounding yourself in science. Logic for sure and fact is subjective, the truth is understood by all. Don't use science as an excuse to not ask questions. Our math and science dead end when it comes to our true nature

       Science is asking questions.

       Sceince is observing some phenomena and then figuring how that phenomena happens.

       Is our current understanding of the universe perfect? No, of course not. But I think the study of astrophysics, chemistry, biology etc. has brought us closer to that understanding than any religion or belief in the super natural.

       He defended Paul Ryan's repeated sabotage, released false statements about President Trump dropping the "drain the swamp" saying.

       I'm certain Newt Gingrich is a double agent who is doing everything he can to mess with President Trump while simultaneously trying not to destroy his own career in the process. He's walking a thin line.

       I wonder if it's related to the fact that one of the wards for spirits is salt and Iron. Salt acts as a barrier but if they're carrying it in their pockets, I'd venture that throwing it at shit would be as effective as whacking it with iron

       There isn't one. Somebody else posted this link to a Hannity radio show where Gingrich makes a comment jokingly something about penguins. I believe that is all it is. I wasted half my lunch looking into this bs. Annoying.

       Can sum up my perception of what the bots are saying for you all since I've read every webbot report and paid attention to this Antarctica stuff in them since early 2K.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an ancient civilization under the ice. It's human, not alien. It's connected to the later Vedic/Indus Valley civilization. The Discovery as it's called will push human history and civilization much further back in time, possibly as much as 500 000 years(for moderne humans, homo sapiens, not first civilization). They were atleast medically and philosophically very advanced. We will find actual books presumably written in something like proto-sanskrit and be able to read their own words. Their philosophy will have a profound, deep and long lasting effect on humanity, discribed as giving us back our self-confidence and positivitity just in time for a challenge period of climate change, economic turmoil and Change in general. Later more evidence of this civilization will be found in Ireland(describe as deep caves exposed by erosion in seaside cliffs), Australia(caves exposed by major earthquake), and India(cities under water off coast).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, evidence will be found that ice ages can happen much more quickly than we have previously believed and these people who were possibly the ancestors of all of us(ponder the scientific implications here) were basically flash frozen like so many of the frozen mammoths in Siberia found with fresh flowers in their stomachs.

       You can buy the sauce on halfpasthuman.com, but before anyone starts accusing Clif high of being a money-grabber please note you can send him an email and ask for a free copy and he will send it once the most current report is about a week old. He is a good guy.

       If Antarctica specifically is your kink then the latest report has a lot, as does Januar and December. The Antarctica subset has grown at an exponential rate since the fall, which in my experience points to it getting closer to consensus reality, ie the point where everyone, not just us awake folks, become aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If more of you have this kink we can try to lobby Clif via Twitter to make an Antarctica pack with all the reports of interest available. I want try to get him to do an Antarctica specific report as well, as he has done for Market and Bitcoin/Gold/Silver before(hint, BUY anyone of those three and you'll be grinning constantly in a year or three, set's for silver gold parity in price and BTC at 80 000 chinese monies, where the currency of valuation is a big hint to the cause of the value, ie total turnaround from china's government and chinese adoption of BTC as reserve currency).

       Now if these peoples were in Ireland, India and Australia chances are good for some rosetta Stone type finds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, proto-sanskrit was my words based on the connection to Harappa and India, which would not be a direct line by the way. Not saying Antarcticans founded the Indus Valley civilization, but rather Antarcticans settled in cities on the coast of India, these cities were submerged an unkown amount of time later when the northern European ice shelf melted(same period as Doggerland vanished under the waves). Inhabitants of these submerged cities, which likely were located at the delta of the Indus, would have followed the river upstream and inland to avoid the rising ocean and then founded Harappa and the other cities of the IVC. This is why the Indus Valley people's cities display such highly advanced and magnificent city planning. They were preplanned cities, evacuation sites, not organically and haphazardly grown over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all happened longer ago then we are used to thinking in regards to human history. Their language might just as well be indo-european or close to celtic or something completly new.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the bots are adamant that the vedas and the vedic sciences are the closest we currently come to the Antarcticans.

       The reports describe this process like cold air being drawn down from the upper atmosphere, almost at the space boundary. There's also descriptors for snowfall so thick you can't walk through it without collapsing under the weight, not the snow on the ground but the snow
       <em>
        still in the air
       </em>
       . 40 feet of snow in a single night. Glaciers growing daily until everything is swallowed. Crop failures, herds of animals frozen to solid in hours, starvation, pretty "doom" stuff.

       This might reflect actual words from eyewitness reports of the Antarcticans, then translated and published for us to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can also be that we will see this happen ourselves as the bot's seems to think we are heading into a new ice age, rather than a warm period. However, due to how the bot's work, it might all derive from our future emotional reaction to reading the words of the last men in Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also sets pointing to the future South pole ice cap moving into the ocean off one side of the continent just like how the North pole works(ie floating sea ice with no land underneath) until the actual continent of Antarctica is ice free and starts "greening". Funny enough, people will see this on Google Earth. Start tracking the ice shelf from year to year people!

       According to the bots the north pole will move to northern siberia and looking at the globe I guess the south pole then will move to south of and between south america and africa. Not sure on this and the bot's have not given any geographic markers so that's just my guess. The side of Antarctica currently most densely populated by americans, McMurdo and other bases, would be the first to be ice free. Coincidence? According to the bots the western Elite knows this is coming, but it will be China that publicly states it to the shock and horror of the western scientific and elite world. China, all in all, seems to be the dominant power of the future, and sorry to say, but looks like they will be doing a better job of it.

       You know the timeline stuff people talk about? Read the PopWar segment of the report and I think you can see an alternative timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       PopWar is a set thats been there since the refugee crisis began. It describe low intensity three-way civil war in Europe between the "core people movement" ie nationalist europeans, muslim immigrants, and local government. It would be an actual war, fought with improvised weapons and both civil populations would use cheap drones as weapons, guided missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that set has almost no growth, and is rapidly fading away instead of being just on the treshold of manifesting(European, believe me this could have happened in 2016, tensions were insane all over). Instead all that emorionally charged language is pouring into the Antarctica and New Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can actually see a change in timeline right there. We ended up in the bright but challenging sci-fi man to the stars future, rather than racial war, economic collapse, and world war Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cliff High has commented on how peculiar this is in I think the Januar or possibly december report.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says set's thats been there since the beginning(1993) suddenly and inexplicably faded this fall and new sets describing a much much more positive future explode into activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a decision, or a choice, has been made, somewhere or by someone or possibly by all of us, that has literally changed the future.

       I'm not saying there is 100% alien-related shit down there, but just because the government didn't put out a video from their military bases showing you their top secret alien-related research in no way confirms the complete absence of one.

       There is no such things as "aliens".  There is literally no proof for aliens.  Not a single credible shred of evidence, nothing.  There is proof of UFO's, not aliens.  I will say with 100% certainty, it's not aliens.

       "Aliens" is such a loaded term. Highly advanced ancient civilizations, either evolving here and being wiped out or even coming here from another world, is absolutely a possibility. Do I think that aliens landed here in the 60s and have been working with the government ever since? Not necessarily, as any evidence for that is iffy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the idea of some kind of temple, or pyramid, or other monolithic structure being discovered in Antarctica, which pre-dates the oldest human civilization we can even fathom, is 100% a possibility.

       The worldwide monoliths and pyramids and similar stories of star people coming down making hybrids and battling isn't proof? How do you suppose they lifted and carefully placed 200 ton stone blocks precisely linked together? Our culture has been washed down to the point where people believe the false knowledge that has came out in the past 100 years rather than the worldwide knowledge base that there was a world before ours that had highly advanced beings at the helm.

       That could be proof of fallen angels too, correct?  I'm talking hardcore evidence that there are aliens from other planets.  Since we've got so much more tech now, you'd think there'd be more evidence besides ancient accounts and pyramids that are a mystery.

       The recent CIA documents described these "aliens" as having an "etheric body from an etheric invisible realm and they materialize bodies upon entering our vibratory plane". I firmly believe this is fallen angels/spirit beings not physical aliens from another earth like planet somewhere.

       The transcript:
Part of the disks carry crews; others are under remote control.
Their mission is peaceful; the visitors contemplate settling on this plane. These visitors are human-like but much larger in size.
They are not excarnate Earth people but come from their own world
The disks posses some type of radiant energy.
They do not come from any “planet” as we use the word, but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us.
The bodies of the visitors, and the craft also, automatically materialize on entering the vibratory rate of our dense matter.
They re-enter the etheric at will, and so simply disappear from our vision, without a trace.
The region they come from is NOT the astral plane but corresponds to the Lakas or Talas. Students of esoteric matters will understand these terms.

       It's amazing when you find out just how little even the most respected Egyptologists in the world actually know for sure about ancient Egypt and the monoliths. It's like, 90% guessing with a little bit of recorded history sprinkled in for good measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my favorite example. The head of Egyptology in Egypt throwing a temper tantrum when discussing alternative theories about the Pyramids with Graham Hancock. Hilarious.

       There's tens of thousands of whiteness who are credible who have had been cleared by a psychiatrist. Volumes of information about a phenomenon that has been named into several categories of encounters. Your absolution about this is just not credible.

       You're right. I may have been carried away. It is of my opinion after extensively looking into everything, I do not think there is any chance for this being some alien or secret technology excavation or discovery.

       I have spent a ton of time on this and listening/reading pretty much every source or possibility on this and the only logical answer is that this will be a location used to survive nuclear fallout.

        Since 1953, the Bilderberg group has convened government, business,
academic and journalistic representatives from the U.S., Canada and
Europe with the express purpose of exploring the future of the North
Atlantic community. The international steering committee includes Conrad

        On the agenda for the November meeting is a panel discussion of the
U.S. presidential elections and an exploration of the national security
requirements for the 21st century. Among those involved in the
discussion of the latter subject will be former U.S. Sens. Gary Hart and
Warren Rudman, former Speaker of the House
        <strong>
         Newt Gingrich
        </strong>
        , journalist
Leslie Gelb and Secretary of Defense William Cohen. McCain, at the
special invitation of Kissinger, will speak at breakfast Friday morning
and Gore will make a Thursday night dinner address, according to the
agenda obtained by WorldNetDaily.

       Treaties would not be followed if nuclear war breaks out. If we on reddit know that the American elite, who are likely to be the cause of nuclear war, was going to Antarctica to hide, America's enemies would also know and blast the Antarctic circle to hell and back in thanks. There could still be giant bunkers or bunker cities (other than the toxic waste one mentioned), though.

       Sure it's possible but not even necessary because of ensured mutual destruction. With the trillions of dollars the elite has been stealing from the bottom 99% all these years, I imagine whole cities are built underground, with slaves and all, just for the elite. Then, afterward, the rebuilding commences with a smaller, controllable and terrified populace.

       As for those of us without Antarctic cities to protect us: have a basic fallout shelter in the basement, have a few months of food and water, and drink, fuck, and enjoy your life while you can as if apocalypse could happen any day.

       'in theory' it banned it. I wouldn't be surprised if EVERY major potence had nuclear weapons hidden there. Let a kid play Civilization and watch, once they get to the Nuclear phase, first thing they do is set up their Nukes in Antartica. It's isolated, there's no risk of you losing your shit, etc.

       This is all starting to make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia transported something called the ark of Gabriel to antartica in February of last year. The head of the Russian Christian Orthodox Church and the pope meet for the first time in a thousand years and the rumor is the pope gave the Russian an ancient document that detailed a ceremony for the ark of gabriel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Russia does everything in their power to get the Donald elected, because they can work with him. Now Newt is on his way down there, probably to give the president a first hand report of this ark.

       That guy gets so into it, his content is pretty farfetched. Like predicting that Trump is somehow a reincarnation of King Cyrus detail in Isaiah 45. I'll have to book mark this to watch for later.

       I mean, there really aren't any credible sources. It's all conjecture and rumors and leaks. If any of its real, it's being trickled out. And it's one weird game of telephone. So we may all be getting half truths. Etc. but newt going to Antarctica reads to me as if he's going on behalf of the Donald, so he can give him a first hand report on something probably because Donald doesn't trust like...anyone.

       Yeah, wish I had. And I'd cite sources and stuff but most of it is tweets, YouTube videos, stuff people have said on radio shows, just stuff out there in the ether so to speak. I have heard some stuff from people I know about prepping but people are always talking about prepping. Having about a months supply of water isn't a bad idea though.

       It is alarming the high ranking officials and the time lines of events around happenings in Antarctica. The religious visits the political. . Ive seen the American Airforce constantly flying crew in and out nothing out of the ordinary they leave from Christchurch Airport I could also tell you the hotel the american Air force stay at if you wanna chat to them at the bar.. the pole shift is the answer I like the most and these folk may be part of the aristocracy / ancient bloodline families

       Don't forget that Antarctica has over 60% of the worlds freshwater.
I Wonder what would happen if Antarctica was bombed heavily with nukes. Lot's of melting icecaps sounds dangerous.

       This does go along with my theory that they are deliberately melting the ice and have discovered technologies or bodies preserved in the flash freeze that happened after the flood. Very interesting I wouldn't doubt it at all honestly because even the Bible says that "if those days weren't cut short no flesh would survive" so something is going on and we are very near the time of all this taking place.

       I kinda wanted there to be something here but there really isnt. If I was any of these people I would take any excuse to visit antarctica, that would be amazing. If there was anything weird going on, they would go and just not tell anyone.

       I wonder if it's related to the fact that one of the wards for spirits is salt and Iron. Salt acts as a barrier but if they're carrying it in their pockets, I'd venture that throwing it at shit would be as effective as whacking it with iron

       It must be due to the complete and utter lack of supporting evidence. I do think that there are people in the shadow government that also believe in that bullshit, but I equate them with flat earthers.

       good read. I wished he sited sources or gave links to the articles he is referencing for more credibility. as it looks now it could just be a cool story.

       That guy gets so into it, his content is pretty farfetched. Like predicting that Trump is somehow a reincarnation of King Cyrus detail in Isaiah 45. I'll have to book mark this to watch for later.
