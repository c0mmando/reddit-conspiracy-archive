       Because we have actual, documented, serious, international conspiracies on our hands. I left here because it was a ludicrous Trump/alt-right/neo-nazi circle jerk but would love to come back if that crowd has finally been chased out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: if it wasn't clear, I was referring to Russia deliberately destabilizing Western powers by destabilizing the middle East and funding right wing extremists as per their post cold war field manual(sorry I don't have the link, I'm lazy)

       I believe Trump to be the anti christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti Christ will come in and be loved by all the people. This person is hated by all the people, they could vamp him and make him "expose" the corruption, reveal all the cures, drop the bait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the bait drops you know 90% of the public is going to fall for it like cheese on a fucking trap. In 3 years if a massive fake coup is made it could be done.

       You'll find trump has a boundless ego  and will court any chance to gain more control of others.  He will gradually take more interest in doing damage to others.

       Pizzagate is a symptom of a much larger disease. Pizzagate and pedophilia are merely used as the ultimate binding contract. The Illuminati, Elites, etc believe themselves to be a non human species, they have kept technology hidden from us and they have kept us in the dark for a very, very long time.  These Elites basically use us and keep us in the dark to further their own goals (mainly based around transcendence).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look back to Trumps inauguration address, he said we are going to "unlock" the mysteries of space. He didn't say discover because they've been locked away. You should check out the Joe Rogan Alex Jones podcast, it's pretty dope.

       That doesn't explain how he has them shaking in their boots..? I understand all of this, and I have seen the podcast, twice actually. But no one knows if trump is good or bad. He just became chief. Time will tell. Who he has appointed doesn't make him look good though.

       I'm inclined to agree here but I don't think tptb would let that be.. I think trump is a distraction from the shadow gov calling the shots behind the scenes.. I'm skeptical at best. All I know is that we better be ready to stand up for our liberties when it comes down to it. I love this country, when push comes to shove I will fight for it, as we all should, together.

       The Trump echo chamber is slowly being drowned out - but it will never fully die. I've got nothing against his supporters and I, myself, was willing to give the man a chance. Unfortunately, the current administrations tone is becoming more war hawkish everyday e.g. putting Iran on notice, threatening NK, easing Russian sanctions, abusing allies and speaking derogatorily of the UN and NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a few of us that are researching conspiracies related to Trump and his team, which as conspiracy theorists, is our duty - no matter who is in office.

       As someone that did vote for Trump I genuinely believe he is not like the evil elite half of you think he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, his field of business is hotels and properties. Casinos, housing. Nothing inherently bad about that. There are the Hiltons, Marriot Hotels as well that are strong competitors. Of course there are global relations, but I believe this to be strictly business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, he took his name dragged through the mud, shit on, dragged again by almost all media worldwide in his election. Why is this? The global powers and powers behind closed doors don't want him- it's obvious. He poses a huge threat. Clinton was quite literally pushed into competition and strung around like a puppet to bring down Trump, despite not being healthy enough to compose a debate hopped up on meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, he's a bold man and holds his personal views on immigration etc. These seem to be acts of personal interest for him as well as his love for the country (which has gone to shit under Democrats overall- domestically)

       Much better than the alternative so nope. Donald Trump is doing a lot of the things he's promised to do and he's awakening a lot of people to the global conspiracy. Even if he does some questionable things, which I agree that he has, he's done more good for me than harm. I will never regret voting for him. NEVER.

       Give the dude a fucking chance. Yes, there are very suspicious things surrounding him but he hasn't even been in office 2 weeks. That being said, George Webb made some Dyncorp connections with Trump that I'm curious about. I'm sure most people here are aware of the Erik Prince connection too. It'll be interesting but no, I personally have not reached the conclusion he's everything the conspiracy world has fought against.

       I mean that's not exactly what it looks like so far. I'm pretty happy with him up to this point. There's aspects about him and some appointments that I have reservations on but the entire system was against him. That in itself speaks volumes.

       After the speech of his in front of AIPAC, I was convinced he wasn't the saviour. Besides all of his children have Jewish partners.

       The US supports the terrorists in Syria. The US invaded Iraq in 2003. Iraq hasn't recovered and is still "destabilized" by US actions. In fact, a peaceful and stable Iraq would simply ally with Iran. What's the US to do? Destabilize Iraq. Look at Libya. Do I have to explain that one also? You're not even "awake."
