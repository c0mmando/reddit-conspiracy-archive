        <h3 class="title">Military Guy at Gym Talking about Mass Grave Sites he worked on in Desert</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">281</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/mrsnakers.html">mrsnakers</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Was at my local Y and overheard a, well, jarhead kinda guy (huge upper body, shaved head, lots of testosterone) going on and on about radios and getting familiar with them as best as possible right now before we go dark. He keeps going on about some of the fun interactions he&#39;s had and even trying to contact the space station? </p>

<p>Anyways, then he starts going on about being in the desert and the training he was doing. At first, I thought he was talking about Iraq but then it was clear it was American soil. He mentioned working for Homeland security and how they have all these mass grave sites ready to go, makeshift coffins, and how he was doing training exercises involving stacking them together with &quot;body weight&quot; inside them and putting them into these gigantic mass graves. He also talked about a certain solvent they have that turns it all into liquid. They then keep a loose digital signature of who <em>might</em> be in what grave, just so that if survivors come looking for &quot;grandma&quot; they can say &quot;oh she&#39;s over here kid&quot; and point to some agreed upon spot in the mass grave where she&#39;s already become some kinda hardened liquid deep in the mass pit. </p>

<p>He gets up to go shower and I simply said &quot;so when&#39;s the party?&quot; and (also his attitude was very excited, almost stoked) he said &quot;Oh definitely this year, or within the next year, it should have been sooner but it got pushed back a little&quot;. </p>

<p>So of course, I decide it&#39;s time for me to go shower and get into a stall just a few down from him. It was hard to hear some of the details but I heard him go on rants about the Frankfurt school, Project paper clip - that the Third Reich never ended, it simply went underground in America and one of the first major leaders was Prescott Bush and the first official Third Reich President was Bush Sr. He then said that it has since gone international and that the Third Reich now exists throughout the world and that Obama is the first president of the international Third Reich. Fun shit. I really wanted to engage with him but he was entirely solely set on spilling everything in his head to one very quiet dude who simply kept nodding along. </p>

<p>He mentioned that if you are civilian you are probably pretty fucked, unless <em>maybe</em> if you have a security clearance of some kind / use. He said now is the time to learn to be self-reliant and operate hand radios - even though they&#39;ll likely be useless for a while when everything &quot;goes dark&quot;. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t tell if how much he was <em>in the know</em> versus how much he simply put together from being a conspiracy theorist as well. I mean, I agree with some of what he said, but he was so binary and excited about it - why keep talking? He also said &quot;I gotta learn to keep my mouth shut, they don&#39;t really like how dudes like me just talk and talk but the worst that happens is some dude listening goes and writes a stupid blog about it or something&quot; Heh. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#39;re in here military bro, I&#39;d love to pick your brain and take you out for a beer. Sorry I couldn&#39;t keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p><strong>edit 1</strong> There are mass downvote bots on here or just pieces of shit humans (what&#39;s the difference?) literally 20 seconds after posting this, immediate downvotes while I am simply doing some last minute grammar checking. Fucking lol. Please if you are an active member of this community and care about it, make sure you check the new sections frequently and upvote anything that might need attention / love to counter the haters.</p>

<p><strong>edit 2</strong> for the doubters, that&#39;s fine I understand why you&#39;d be skeptical especially just a rando post on r/conspiracy but keep in mind that A. lots of military dudes like this are ego based and love to rant and rant about the crazy shit they&#39;ve seen and B. lots of military dudes like this are also conspiracy oriented / self-reliant oriented / love hand radios and makeshift tech and C. he could have easily been simply part of a Homeland Security training program, that does exist for martial law / mass graves, but that the buck stops right there and he doesn&#39;t <em>know</em> anything more and simply filled in the rest by eating up conspiracies like the rest of us.</p>

<p><strong>edit 3</strong> something else he said that stood out to me is &quot;Remember when ol&#39; Bill Clinton was saying &#39;depends on what the definition of is, is&#39; over the Lewinsky thing? That was him nodding to ISIS&quot; - which I have no clue what that even is suppose to mean as ISIS wasn&#39;t even a thing then and I don&#39;t know what that would have to do with being investigated for a BJ.</p>

<p><strong>edit 4</strong> Just remember one other thing that he said that really stood out to me. He said &quot;it&#39;s not NWO, I mean it is, but it&#39;s actually to create a mega-state out of Israel and transfer the power the U.S. has as the leader of the world to Israel&quot; which is a little different take on the NWO shit than what I&#39;ve read, but makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>edit 5</strong> also said something about us being slaves and the idea of citizen<em>ship</em> itself is actually a big joke to do with us being slaves on a <em>ship</em>. Said our social security cards are actually legal ownership rights and that we&#39;re each worth roughly only $65k to the government, and that it&#39;s chump change for them if a lot of us die. </p>

<p>Sorry I keep randomly remember little bits and pieces, it was very overwhelming after a long day of work / working out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sorry, no clue. He was going on and on about hand radios how radio waves can be tweaked to communicate across the entire planet and even up to the space station, how to get a certification for one(?) something like intermediate, novice, master (? might have misremembered the exact rankings), how you can go down to such and such place right now and get it at a discount and how easy it is to pass the test, he had a book with the answers already in it that he studied / memorized &quot;cus you know you&#39;ll need it when everything goes dark&quot; - that&#39;s when I started thinking oh shit what&#39;s this about - then BAM he&#39;s talking about (huge paraphrase incoming): </p>

<p>&quot;and when we were training out in the desert for homeland, it was so fucking hot, you can&#39;t even imagine how hot it was. Our commanding officer started having heat stroke or something it was so damn hot, anyways, we were loading these body weight coffins over and over stacking them up in these mass graves, you know they got these things locked down and picked out for years, they got more than enough for what they need them for I promise you that, anyways, we&#39;re loading them and our officer is like losing his mind from the heat, and man I&#39;ll tell you, they got this liquid (named some chemical I&#39;ve never heard of) that can just melt right through bodies, the caskets, all of it into a giant liquid and it just goes down into the soil, but they gotta keep some sort of digital signature of who is where just so that when johnny comes up and is like &#39;where&#39;s my grandma?&#39; they can say oh over in plot XYZ so he can go and say good bye&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all basic ham radio stuff he&#39;s talking about.  And, yes, its that easy to talk to a space station like ISS.  The hard part is getting someone to talk back.  Getting into the hobby is easy, equipment can be found cheap and is uber-attractive to DIY types.  The level of electronics skill needed to walk into a Radio Shack and buy parts to assemble a radio from scratch that will communicate with ISS isn&#39;t all that high, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i live in Shepparton Australia. We have a radio station built in the 40s to send moral boosters to the troops in Europe. Our town was selected because of its distance away from a capital city in case it got bombed. The site has still been in operation, connecting 1000s of people around the world. Last week the ABC, who manages the site, turned it off. An ex employee came out to the local paper saying it shouldn&#39;t be turned off as 1000s of people around the world, especially in remote locations, still used the service as their only means of communication with the rest of the world. He also said that the site was not designed to be turned off for long.
I am by no means an expert on radio, but was wondering if this could of been done to prevent communication between civilians, should things &quot;go dark&quot;. Anyone who has any knowledge on this i would love to hear from you. 
The site is called  RADIO AUSTRALIA. </p>

I also was super relaxed / tired from working out and going to my counselor today and unloading a bunch of <em>feels</em> so my mind didn&#39;t feel ready to get deep in the dirt with him but damn I kept wanting to. I&#39;ll be honest though, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s super in the know. If he was, he&#39;d wouldn&#39;t be so outward IMO.

    <div class="md"><p>Frankfurt School brought the idea of cultural Marxism which holds many different ideas. Generally it&#39;s an approach of decaying society through divisions in gender, race, religion, etc... this goes against classical Marxism which considers the true divide being proletariat vs bourgeoisie</p>

<p>Based on how much this guy fear mongers he likely doesn&#39;t understand the true details of Frankfurt&#39;s influence. I&#39;ve studied it for a while and I still don&#39;t fully understand all the details like critical theory. </p>

<p>But it is a great subject to look into and yes it gets deep.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, first, I just wanna say that I neither completely believe or disbelieve OPs story. As with most other conspiracy theories that don&#39;t include some sort of physical evidence, I just sort of file it all away as &quot;totally plausible&quot; until I see some evidence otherwise. I think that&#39;s how most people here probably view stuff like this. Most of us probably wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a lot of this kind of stuff turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Anyway, to my point, I can absolutely see why it&#39;d make sense to some to get rid of the people digging these things so they wouldn&#39;t go around running their mouths. </p>

<p>To me though, I feel like getting rid of them would probably be more of a hassle than just letting the vocal ones sound like crazy people. There are definitely a lot of people, and even a few folks here, that would view this as a symptom of mental illness, exactly for the reasons you stated. Sure there will be some people who will believe guys like the dude OP is talking about, but the vast majority will assume he&#39;s mentally ill, just likes the attention, or that he somehow just misunderstood what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like when people completely dismiss alien abductions or people claiming they know our government knows abductions are happening, because they can&#39;t understand why they&#39;d let people run around talking about all of this stuff. The people who dismiss or question it based on why they&#39;re even allowed to talk about it are answering their own question with their dismissal, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;d almost be <em>more</em> suspicious if no one talked about this kind of thing. I think our military/gov&#39;t would actually receive more attention if they kill everyone who might talk about something. They know most people won&#39;t believe them with no physical evidence, so the problem takes care of itself and they don&#39;t have to come up with excuses to explain to 20 families how their loved ones died everytime they wanna dig mass graves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are crazy! And sometimes bored and say crazy things to see what kind of reaction they get. Not saying that this story isn&#39;t true. I&#39;d just take it with a grain of salt. I do not know a large portion of military people. The ones that I have known, and served, are pretty tight lipped about most things. However; some do share. One guy told me of guarding poppy plants in Afghanistan. No details, other than the plants are pretty. And he felt torn about the situation. This was at least a decade ago. Another person told me of their third tour that led them to Haiti. They were there after the great earthquake that decimated half of the island. Only the poor part of the island. He said he laughs when he hears people glamorizing anarchy. He&#39;d seen real anarchy in Haiti, and &quot;It ain&#39;t pretty&quot;. I remember them saying that during the chaos there were children being stolen. &#39;How did you know they were being stolen?&quot; &quot;They knew. That&#39;s for certain. I didn&#39;t understand, at first. But it didn&#39;t take me long to figure it out.&quot;  This was way before the last two elections. Of course I asked more questions. I got that the cholera outbreak was horrifying. He refused to do another tour after that. I didn&#39;t know the guy. I just met him at a party. Can&#39;t even remember his name. Maybe he was full of BS too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FEMA camps make no logical sense. People held in camps or murdered and liquefied in mass graves can&#39;t buy shit. How will the rich get richer if no one is there to &quot;buy&quot; (using a mortgage with interest) a home? Or the next iPhone? Or whatever distraction is next? It&#39;s far more profitable to keep people enslaved by desires rather than fences. And the elites already have what is essentially a separate society. Even if you don&#39;t take into account secret bases and bunkers, which are very likely, people at certain levels of wealth can buy or charter private planes, afford the best doctors without insurance, live wherever they want - they don&#39;t see us, so they don&#39;t need to enslave us more than we already are. </p>

<p>OP, I know you are just relaying what this guy told you. (Side note: a couple weeks ago, I was at a coffee shop, and this guy who just had that &quot;vet who has seen some shit&quot; next to me was laughing and talking to himself about some military thing in the news. He clearly wanted to talk, but I was not taking the bait. Our government has created a mental health crisis with these folks.) But a lot of people are serious about this FEMA thing and will take this AA gospel. </p>

<p>Douchey military guy who talks like he&#39;s &quot;one of the chosen to live&quot;, I&#39;ve seen/heard many people like him.</p>

<p>Nothing crazy like he is talking about will ever happen, the coffins could likely just be used as a &quot;just in case&quot; scenario, or at worst a eugenics movement, but not &quot;EVERY CIVILIAN IS GONNA DIE!!!!&quot;.</p>

<p>But yea guys in the military exaggerate...a fuckton.  It&#39;s actually annoying to anyone who dealt with shit.  That whistle of a mortar, heh, that had me tense for years.  You can google it, the whistle, not me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you&#39;re saying is they will wipe out 90% of western populations and replace it with billions of cooperative people from Asia and Africa?</p>

<p>Seems like a psychological projection of fear towards the new equilibrium of the world as these other nations gain an economic advantage and developmental edge over the old world.</p>

<p>If I was game-planning this, it would be great rhetoric to scared people into re-armament and prepare them for war. Especially if my robots were not advanced enough to win a land sea and air engagement for me yet. Of course I would need at least 2 decades of preparation and testing these weapon systems in another active theater, bonus points for resisting civilians with small and medium arms in case my original plan for total war collapses. I turn inward to pacifying my own resisting population with the automaton weapons their taxes built.</p>

<p>Except this would collapse western civilization, disrupt the internet, international trade, finance, the energy supply chain, agriculture and food production will have to be nationalized globally, countries will swing far right towards autocratic rule, capitalism will be eliminated in favor of mass social programs for the hundreds of millions of immigrants fleeing war, revolutions will break out in dozens of nations around the globe further plunging normalcy into chaos and destruction, cities will become death traps.</p>

<p>Of course, this is when the &#39;aliens&#39; will show up with their advanced technology and save us, uniting humanity in one giant transitional leadership group and bringing about total peace in perpetuity by disarming us and offering psychological inhibitors towards violence, ensuring total capitulation.</p>

<p>You can easily spot a bad argument (made in bad faith or using poorly thought out scenarios) when you can always have it both ways. Magic requires consent so they must brainwash and control the masses through propaganda, but somehow coerced consent through trickery or misinformation is okay, it&#39;s a technical loophole, because they are evil. Aliens are here to help us, but some aren&#39;t, just so you can cover your ideological bases.</p>

<p>Bad ideas are human ideas are wrong ideas. If our education system was structured towards thinking more and speaking less we would be in a vastly different technological space given the abundance of resources on the planet and the inherent capacity for the average human to make significant change. Sadly we are in an information apocalypse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way they&#39;d let a jackass loud mouth get that deep. There are plenty of conspiratards out there speaking total bullshit just to look cool. Real military guys generally aren&#39;t going to risk court marshal, military prison or worse just for to bullshit at the gym to look cool. If they&#39;re leaking info like this, it&#39;s for a moral reason and more often than not, they&#39;re too old to give a shit. I just don&#39;t buy it. Some meathead cannon fodder boots on the ground marine is privy to information like the third Reich runs America and he can&#39;t keep his mouth shut?

<p>edit 4 Just remember one other thing that he said that really stood out to me.

<p>something else he said that stood out to me is &quot;Remember when ol&#39; Bill Clinton was saying &#39;depends on what the definition of is, is&#39; over the Lewinsky thing? That was him nodding to ISIS&quot; - which I have no clue what that even is suppose to mean as ISIS wasn&#39;t even a thing then and I don&#39;t know what that would have to do with being investigated for a BJ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I noticed that myself, the &quot;is is&quot; being similar to &quot;isis&quot; thing. I think it&#39;s just a coincidence though, can you imagine how weird of a person Bill Clinton would have to be to think &quot;I&#39;m committing perjury right now, let&#39;s also take the time to hint at a terrorist organization that won&#39;t exist for well over a decade while being a pedantic asshole.&quot; </p>

<p>ISIS is also just one of many names for that organization and I think the US government tends to call them ISIL instead. If Bill was hinting, wouldn&#39;t they call the group ISIS? My guess for the nomenclature is that they&#39;d rather call them &quot;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&quot; instead of &quot;Islamic State of Iraq and Syria&quot; because it calls attention to Obama&#39;s failures in Syria. They could also just call them &quot;IS&quot;, &quot;Islamic State&quot;, or &quot;Daesh&quot;, I&#39;m not surprised that a group with so many names might have some interesting coincidences associated with it. Don&#39;t forget that Isis is also the name of an ancient Egyptian goddess. </p>

They&#39;re already killing us off, albeit slowly while trying to implement more policies to reduces us further into abjection with more regulations and taxes. They&#39;ve invested so much of their time and money to slowly ensure that a globalist system takes control, and it has worked quite well. Now with the massive influx of immigrants, climate change fear mongering, and intense political dichotomy and control over media, they can easily guide the first world into behaving how they like. They&#39;re picking both sides and will escalate conflict to produce a Hegelian dialectic solution in which will ultimately benefit this power elite. </p>

<p>It is going to come in the form of a pandemic flu that is entirely lab created. The flu will not be as deadly as we are told but the vaccine will contain ingredients that will mimic the flu and kill you. It will be made mandatory by the WHO and all levels of government. </p>

<p>By the time anyone figures this out everyone will be dead from willingly taking this so called flu shot, or in camps from refusing to take the shot and for &quot;public safety&quot; and everyone else will be either a complicit slave or a fugitive at large. </p>

<p>This is only a theory but if you were an elite who had long term plans for world domination the first thing you would need to do is to reduce the population followed by enslaving the rest of the world because you need someone to go down into that mine and bring out the precious metals and you need peasants to grow your GMO free organic vegetables.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend that got a TBI from an IED in Afghanistan.  He was the coolest, most chill guy I knew &#39;til they were hit.  Came back a different person.  No resemblance of the guy he was before he left.  He LOOKS the same, but as soon as he opened his mouth, you know he isnt the same person.</p>

<p>He says some pretty far out stuff, similiar to this.  Gets really excited and hyper when he talks about it.  Some of the stuff he says are outright lies - he talks about being places he never was, and doing things he never did.</p>

<p>I belive what you heard, OP.  This is a really good post.</p>

<p>Known a person who was involved in Rhodesia as it was called at the time and was involved in mass wipe out of village. He was oxford trained engineer who maintained the equipment for the white people. He was a pisspot who after a few drinks would plainly state that he knew people who would walk by native viliages and spray them with bullets mowing down inhabitants regardless. Would boast Vietnam vets sad stories about the war had nothing on what he had seen.</p>
