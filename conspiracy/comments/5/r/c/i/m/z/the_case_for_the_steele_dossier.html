<p>-a russian ex-kgb/fsb agent Oleg Erovinkin, who was suspected of being Brit spy Christopher Steele&#39;s key source, was found dead of a heart attack in the back seat of his car </p>

<p>The Steele Dossier included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions.</p>

<p>Sorry for formatting, on mobile. Please if anybody has anything else to add, that&#39;d be great</p>

<p>Edit 1; Christopher steele described as “very credible” &amp; “If he puts something in a report, he believes there’s sufficient credibility in it for it to be worth considering. Chris is a very straight guy. He could not have survived in the job he was in if he had been prone to flights of fancy or doing things in an ill-considered way.”</p>

<p>“The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false – completely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He’s not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one: Glencore contributed only 300 million euros of equity to the deal, less than 3 percent of the purchase price, which it said in a statement on Dec. 10 had bought it an &quot;indirect equity interest&quot; limited to just 0.54 percent of Rosnef</p>

<p>In addition, public records show the ownership structure of the stake ultimately includes a Cayman Islands company whose beneficial owners cannot be traced.</p>

<p>And while Italian bank Intesa SanPaolo leant the Singapore vehicle 5.2 billion euros to fund the deal, and Qatar put in 2.5 billion, the sources of funding for nearly a quarter of the purchase price have not been disclosed by any of the parties.</p>

<p>&quot;The main question in relation to this transaction, as ever, still sounds like this: Who is the real buyer of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft?&quot; Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy head of Russia&#39;s central bank, wrote in a blog last week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sold to Glencore. Does that ring any bells?</p>

<p>Shill or not, I will tell you straight up. The bad guys are inside of our government, not in russia. And if, in the future, it should turn out that trump enlisted the support of foreign leaders in order to put an end to this horror show, then I say Amendment, brother. But Glencore is a Clinton front. </p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t vote for trump, but if he&#39;s rotten too, we&#39;re all screwed. We&#39;ve essentially been under the Rule of a single administration since 1988. My gut tells me that trump is an authentic insurgent. And that he has somehow mastered the arts of theatricality and deception in order to put the good guys back on top. Nothing is as it seems, these days. </p>

<p>The secrecy surrounding Trump&#39;s recent  executive  order, indicates to me that he knows who the bad guys are and what they are doing. </p>

<p>What do you think all the secrecy was about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speculate on something that has not happened yet, he needs a chance to actually prove where he stands. His campaign rhetoric pointed towards de-escalation of foreign conflicts, and so far he has been keeping a lot of his promises.</p>

<p>However, using a broad term to describe a security threat like &quot;terrorists&quot; is worrisome, this goes back to Bush&#39;s &quot;war on terror&quot;, this kind of definition knows no bounds, or borders. But, Trump just inherited this mess; what he does with it, is yet to be seen. 
<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/war-on-terror-facts-costs-timeline-3306300">https://www.thebalance.com/war-on-terror-facts-costs-timeline-3306300</a></p>

<p>I think he&#39;s kept more promises, so far than any other president I&#39;ve seen, in recent times. This is an obvious threat to the deeply entrenched status-quo, so their money bought media is continuously pushing back against him. This is why every move he makes is painted in the worst possible light.</p>

<p>Trump is not a fucking wizard, he is not a superman, but he is leader of the &quot;free&quot; world. Whether anyone wants to admit that, or not, it is the case. </p>

<p>To be fair, he has said some worrying things with respect to &quot;going after the terrorists&quot;. However, how you can take this remains open to interpretation, as the real terrorists are worthy IMHO of being wiped out. It&#39;s that I think he understands who the terrorists actually are. </p>

<p>Would you agree that ISIS may be fighting in Syria, against the Al Assad government? Supplied with US weapons and training? It&#39;s really all about the continuation of the petro-dollar, they wanted a fucking pipeline! The USA has lost. They are not taking this defeat lightly.
<a href="https://www.rt.com/business/362279-gazprom-turkish-stream-pipeline/">https://www.rt.com/business/362279-gazprom-turkish-stream-pipeline/</a></p>

<p>Look at Hillary&#39;s covert intervention in Libya, completely destroyed that country. Why? Gaddafi wanted to sell oil backed by gold. Please argue, because it&#39;s really depressing how little other peoples lives matter to this regime change powerhouse. I would like another opinion, that&#39;s not so cold and dark. </p>

<p>It was said Libya was the cork to Europe, regime change IS responsible for the refugee crisis, these people need to be held accountable for their war crimes. They seriously fucked everything up. 
<a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/26/regime_change_in_libya_mirrors_iraq">https://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/26/regime_change_in_libya_mirrors_iraq</a></p>

<p>For the first time I can remember, there&#39;s actually someone in charge with some balls, he threatens their neo-liberalist agenda, but they are not going down without a fight. They will stop at nothing to delegitimize his presidency, people that take this &quot;Trump Dossier&quot; as literal fact, without questioning its motivations are just fueling the fire. It&#39;s obvious what it was meant to do. </p>

<p>Diplomacy is the only way to coexist in this world, the ONLY way forward. We must work together towards common goals that make this existence better for us all and if he wants to &quot;talk&quot; to Putin, is he not allowed to, or something? The free leader of the free world can&#39;t have a phone call with Putin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To stay on point of this post, he can call and talk to Putin all he wants. He needs a helluva reason for ceasing sanctions on them and there is no reason to abandon NATO. Crimea is a part of Ukraine and Ukraine has a right to exist despite what that idiot putin thinks. Diplomacy and completely dropping our allies are completely different things. Russia and america will always be competitive with each other because they are really the only ones who can replace us in our world hegemony</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NATO was relevant after WW2 up until the Soviet Union fell, it&#39;s relevance has diminished in today&#39;s world. Besides being a deterrent factor, of course. You can also argue that it has helped to maintain security. I would not debate that. Do I think it should be completely dismantled, no.

However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable that Trump has asked for NATO members to provide more capital towards their security. Individual NATO member nation-states should be responsible for more of the burden of their own security. If the United States were to leave NATO, there is still 27 other member states to pick up the slack. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s game over for NATO, it just means that if member states are so concerned they will have to foot the bill going forward.

The problem I see with US hegemony is that it has become so perverse and corrupt that it is no longer about what is &quot;right&quot; it has become &quot;divide and conquer&quot; at any cost. This is not right, if the US was really fighting for freedom, I may be able to get behind that ideal. She is fighting for control of all the world&#39;s resources and no longer cares about the cost of human life. Who are the aggressors here, what is right about that?</p>

<p>The Ukraine should have maybe been a NATO member state, if they were so concerned about Russian aggression, do you agree?

<p>Well and that whole 9/11 thing or whatever. Ya know, the only time in history article 5 was actually used. But america is getting screwed? Please. Nato the backbone of the western world. </p>

<p>Are you honestly suggesting that a Russian or even chinese hegemony would be preferable? If you think america is &quot;perverse and corrupt&quot;, what the hell do you think they are? </p>

<p>As far as Ukraine is concerned, if you had read your own source you would know why. They were trying to the best of their abilities to join since the mid 1990s and international politics between USA, France, germany, and russia kept holding it up. 2010 came and their president hinted at nonintergration and their people eventually revolted. its our fault tbh. </p>

<p>But all of this, while interesting, is off topic.</p>

<p>When a few people from a country hijacked planes and flew them into buildings. This means that the USA can start countless wars and murder hundreds of thousands? Regime change fucking everywhere? Or, is it not murder if you are doing it behind a flag?</p>

<p>Baseless wars, based on false intelligence. Iraq was justified in your opinion? How about Libya? Wars that NEVER end. Wars that are based on a term &quot;war on terror&quot; rather than a country. You honestly don&#39;t see a problem with this thinking? This is justified, to you?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq</a></p>

<p>So you are saying without the USA, there would be no NATO? And NATO is doomed? What about the other 27 members? Do you agree they should pay their fair share if they want protection and security, is this not reasonable to you? </p>

<p>Tell me where I said Chinese or Russian order would be better, or stop trying to put words in my mouth of something I did not say. I think you should go back and read again I don&#39;t think you absorbed what I actually said.   </p>

<p>Such a threat to the Ukraine, yet does not join NATO. You would think it would be a priority, if they were concerned.</p>

<p>Relevant quote from article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plans for NATO membership were shelved by Ukraine following the 2010 presidential election in which Viktor Yanukovych, who preferred to keep the country non-aligned, was elected President.</p>

<p>Ok man listen, you are arguing that the usa is corrupt and perverse now and shouldn&#39;t be in charge anymore. Sure. Then you say your not talking about russia or China. Who else is going to? Are all the countries of the world just going to ignore each other, wrapped in bubble wrap, and pretend they dont exist? Should we return to the pre-WW1 era of politics? Every country for themselves and fuck the little guy? Surely you know about the horrors of colonization and the Victorian era? Every major world power has made mistakes, from Rome to france to England, they&#39;ve all committed genocide. my question is do you see a country in a better place to step up and replace us? Because your coming off a wee bit too &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot; for my taste personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, don&#39;t answer any question I asked and point out how I&#39;m incorrect in your opinion, even though your post here is about an &quot;Unverified document&quot;. ie. Trump Dossier. </p>

<p>You continue with this premise that I must think China or Russia would be a better option, does this make it easier for you, to argue or something? I have never said that. Not once. I don&#39;t pretend to offer a solution.</p>

<p>You avoid every hard question I send your way, but expect me to respond? My patience is wearing thin. </p>

<p>Go ahead tell me how killing hundreds of thousands in endless wars is justified when close to 3000 Americans died on September 11th? I honestly want to know.  </p>

<p>Droning people&#39;s families in the Middle East, is going to solve one isolated incident that happened close to 16 years ago? This will solve terrorism? </p>

<p>You have lost more of your freedoms and gained absolutely nothing in return. What a waste of bombs, for what? Sweet fucking nothing. </p>

<p>State sponsored terrorism, is not going to solve terrorism. It destabilizes and leaves these countries in shambles. FREEDOM, woo hoo. What a joke, if only it was funny. </p>

<p>Tell me is entire fucking refugee crisis is because Gaddafi was removed from power? Answer me to why this is right?  Funny you will not respond to these questions, why not? </p>

<p>I just feel like you must live under a rock... Go ahead justify HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS dead for a war based on a term. I&#39;m waiting for you to respond to how this is justified. </p>

<p>Would you say the war in Iraq was justified, even though the &quot;terrorists&quot; were from Afghanistan? Please make sense of this for me, I&#39;m having a hard time grasping how this could be your case. </p>

<p>These are hard questions, and you have not addressed any of them, does it bother you? It weighs heavy on my mind, I feel bad for what things have become, if you can&#39;t admit murdering people is wrong, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t see much hope for you, but I won&#39;t stop trying, man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like the investor is pretty well documented at this point: Glencorp/Qatar. Not Trump. How did Steele get the 19% #? Easy, that&#39;s the amount Rosneft was publicly shopping around to investors. Steele took a piece of obscure but publicly available info and sewed it together with &quot;secret sources&quot; to make it ring true. It&#39;s the same technique that other great Kremlin sage Sorcha Faal uses.</p>
