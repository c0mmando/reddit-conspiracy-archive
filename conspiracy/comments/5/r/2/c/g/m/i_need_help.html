<p>This has to do with child molestation. </p>

<p>The relgiion of Jehovhas Wittneses have been under heat from the government for hiding molesters in there religion. Even more then the catholic church. You can easily find an article by a simple google search.</p>

<p>The australian Royal Commission investigated and found thousands of unreported cases. </p>

<p>I want to tie them to a string stemming from the top going down. But I need you guys to help. Share what you find and stop these molesters from being free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically the Australian government found them guilty of not turning in child molesters. I am wanting to show this is a world wide thing. That due to religious rules. Child molestation is not found out because they purposely make there laws that way.</p>

<p>In there rules when someone comes forward about a molestation, a victim must face the accuser in front of the leaders of the congregation and there must be 2 witnesses before they are investigated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly. The governing body are made up of individuals who know it&#39;s not the truth but have such a following they made the organization piece by piece into a corporation. They even have the logo they advertise for jw.org. The watchtower uses its money to make its property more valuable.</p>

<p>They are built like a corporation. Publishers are the employees that have to go through a interview before they can partake of field service. That is a real thing. You have m/s that are the supervisors and carry out the work of the elders. Then you have the elders which are the managers that are chosen not only on there record of being a wittiness but by how much time they invest in the field ministry. The traveling overseer of CO. Is the regional manager that makes sure congregations are following the rules and they promote more field service time to there visits. Hell they even act like a vacuum sales men.</p>

<p>I feel like the more people they bring in, the more money they get. </p>

<p>My theory is they want to be a strong religion to be tax free but are very much a corporation that uses free labor to make there items.</p>

<p>They use bethel as there base of operations and do not spend a dime in pay for there workers. Instead they make them work long hours with small room and board and they live there working for free. They even have there own fire department. </p>

<p>My theory. They are not a religion but a corporation. They do not want to follow laws of the specific government because they believe they are better at governing with gods laws when they don&#39;t even follow gods laws fully. </p>
