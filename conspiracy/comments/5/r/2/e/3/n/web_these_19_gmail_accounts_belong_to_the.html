       Everyone needs to keep hammering these people and holding them in contempt.

       We can prove he's violated the Federal Records Act.  OK, so who is supposed to remedy this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The new acting Attorney General, Sally Yates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paging Sally Yates.  Paging Sally Yates.  Please step up to the plate. It's time for you to investigate Andrew McCabe.  He's been in gross violation of the Federal Records Act.  The FOI Act, and he's taken QUID PRO QUOs and it's time for you guys to DO YOUR JOB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you.   Do it fast.  Time is of the essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you drag your feet because you haven't been Senatorially approved yet, Ms. Yates, then we'll know you won't have a backbone for this type of job and we'll just think you're Lynch II.   And I'll let you in on something.  Sequels are never as good.

       When they found Weiner's laptop with 650k emails, it took them 9 days to say they went through it and stopped the investigation. Now they're telling us it will take at least 5 years to go through it before they can release it to the public..

       We can't find out what's in them until they release them. So far it looks like they're trying to do as much as they can to prevent their release. Hopefully the new administration will change this.
