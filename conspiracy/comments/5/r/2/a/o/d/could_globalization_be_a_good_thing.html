        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Much has been written about the push towards a one-world system. Ultimate concentration of power, a one-world banking system, RFID chipped citizens and total surveillance: these are scary things and incredibly valid concerns.</p>

<p>But, is it possible there could be unseen benefits from a single world government? I&#39;m merely asking to get an opinion, and perhaps draw some insight into why these people do what they do. Most often we do what we think is &#39;good&#39; and have intentions/reasons for our actions.</p>

<p>I thought about this because recently I&#39;ve been staying in Colombia, in many aspects a third world country. Coming from the US and the UK, there are very visible problems here. Homeless children, mass poverty, corrupt government, and a lack of organization that is not present in the western world. I was struck with a thought while driving through some of these poverty-stricken areas, that perhaps westernization could change a place like this for the better.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

Thing are hardly ever entirely bad or entirely good, despite how the media and the human brain wants us to perceive them.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, concentration of power has always spelled disaster through history. I just want to get an insight into why these globalists are doing what they&#39;re doing. I hardly doubt (despite the narrative on this sub) that they sit around in a mansion somewhere twirling their fingers and maniacally laughing. They must feel in some way that they are doing this for the greater good. My question is, what is that greater good that they perceive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t. Or at least not in the sense you mean it, i.e. they don&#39;t consider that every human being deserves a (second) chance, if they were dealt bad cards in the game of life. I suppose (from the tone of your post) that you feel some sympathy for those homeless children roaming the streets of Colombia. However, in their minds, those kids are simply to be left to their own fate. Some will make it on their own, most not and they&#39;re perfectly fine with this concept. They completely lack what Orwell dubbed &quot;the common decency&quot;. </p>

<p>On a side note, I share your comments and reactions about Colombia, a country I&#39;ve been visiting on a regular basis for the last 15 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can we be so sure how they think and act though? I just feel that even the term &#39;they&#39; is so vague, ya know? I agree that a lot of these institutions lack Orwells&#39; common decency, it&#39;s just there seems to be a discrepancy between the evil&#39;s we see on the news and the general empathy and compassion from people we actually know.</p>

<p>But yea, Colombia is incredible. For all it&#39;s problems there is a freedom and a vitality here that I&#39;ve not found in the US or the UK. Where have you visited?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve visited all the big cities, and mostly the Carribbean coast and Antioquia &amp; Cundinamarca regions. I haven&#39;t visited yet the Amazonas, Narino and Putumayo regions. Beautiful country, breathtaking sceneries and very friendly people (speaking the language helps a lot.)</p>

<p>I consider it to be a perfect example of a Libertarian paradise, with all the advantages and disadvantages this implies. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, people are very entrepreneurial and business-minded (which I consider good). Emerging middle-class with a relatively high standard of living (good). Private schools are available in abundance, but public schools ain&#39;t that bad either (considering the conditions), for those who can&#39;t afford private education. 
Non-existing State presence, except at the level of nuisance (taxes for salaried people, corrupted cops, etc.) 
This is one of the reasons the level of insecurity could be very high (especially in cities), hence the prevalence of private security companies (bad?). Inequalities are horrendous (very bad for a Central European like me.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they have a standard of good and bad, right and wrong. They tend to believe &quot;do what thou wilt&quot;. The objective is entirely self-serving. The fact that they can means they will in every scenario. The &quot;greater good&quot; they serve is the benefit of their own..but not the common people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s just hard for me to imagine individuals of people who knowingly commit these atrocities.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but as you pointed out in one of your previous comments, it&#39;s not anymore particular individuals who are actually taking the decisions, but more often than not, it&#39;s institutions, i.e. mostly corporations, big supra-national organizations, etc. </p>

<p>Individuals are merely easily interchangeable pieces within such organizations. We tend to idealize the role of CEOs (who all have a sense of &quot;ethic/morals/feelings&quot;, etc.) but the truth is that big corporations live a life of their own. When one of them dies, another takes very quickly its place. </p>

<p>In all honesty, Capitalism isn&#39;t inherently a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; system. It&#39;s simply a system that&#39;s self-adjusting to reach its greater stability and growth rate (because that&#39;s what it&#39;s been made to do.) 
Sure, that rate of growth could be slowed down by individuals taking &quot;actions against it&quot;, but time is of no importance to ideas and concepts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the final judgement ultimately relies on the needs of the many. If there would to be a collapse in civilization due to climate change and food shortage, then yes a globalized effort would be required.

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s an unpopular opinion here, but I think globalization is ultimately the end-goal of mankind, right? The main problem with it in  its current form has more to do with the negative effects of things like capitalism when combined with human traits like greed and corruption. This tends to push things towards concentration of wealth/power and further fuels the class divide.</p>

<p>But I think globalization is inevitable in some sense, as that&#39;s where technology is pushing us...interconnected worldwide networks of communication which helps us towards our goal of global empathy/understanding for one another. Power structures have always used things like nationalism, religion, ethnicity, etc. in order to divide us and push us towards war/conflict through fear. Our goal should be to eradicate those things so they can&#39;t be used to divide us by the powers that be anymore.</p>

<p>Globalization WILL be a good thing once mankind is ready for it. Unfortunately, we&#39;re still so far behind on so many levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS is what I was looking for. Exactly the thought that I was thinking but couldn&#39;t articulate. If you look at the trajectory of mankind, since before the Stone Age until now, there has been a steady trend for unification of tribes, counties, countries, and eventually entire continents. I think that the doom &amp; gloom aspects are very real, and you&#39;re right that humanity in it&#39;s present state will likely use Globalization as a means to exert control for money &amp; power. But I also have to believe that it is possible to have a truly unified world where all our resources are concentrated for extraordinary projects that could only come from centralization.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that the only way we, or any intelligent life form, could become a spacefaring society is to have centralization of decision making and resources. I mean, you never hear bout planets in Star Wars having anything other the one-world governments, do we lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about this before. </p>

<p>There are projects that mankind will only be able to accomplish through the unification of resources and centralization of the best minds of our entire species. It would truly be something to behold, and maybe something we can&#39;t even realistically fathom. </p>

<p>I also agree that any truly spacefaring species would&#39;ve had to found a way to unify resources from their home planet, perhaps even other planets, before traversing the depths of our Universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most recent push toward globalization started with colonialism.  I would argue that the first world war was actually the genocide of indigenous populations for profit by the western European states starting in the 14-1500s.  This however was of course only piggybacking on the earlier precedent set by the fourth crusade that was carried out at the behest of the Venetian merchants who made the ships and weren&#39;t paid in full for their handiwork.  As a result the christian crusaders set out to sack Constantinople (a christian city, albeit full of eastern instead of latin christians), effectively getting rid of the middle men between the Venetian merchants and the luxury goods that were coming from the orient.  Peppercorn was being sold in italy for 180 ducats, in India the same amount of peppercorn would go for 3 ducats. </p>

<p>This control of markets and resources was what both World Wars were fought over.  The same can be said about every conflict post World War II.  Globalism was, and thus far has been, a push to control the world for the economic benefit of the few that have the means to &quot;buy in&quot; so to speak.  </p>

<p>However, there have been a few good things to come from the global trends, such as the spread and adoption of GOOD ideas, its just a shame that the bad ones are focused on.  For instance, after both world wars there were immense pushes by the people to make those wars stop.  After the first war there was the league of nations which failed, and the Kellog-Briand Pact that effectively outlawed war as a policy tool.  We know that worked so well because there wasn&#39;t a second war. /s
After the second war the UN was created, this time unlike the efforts prior, the UN security council was created to act as the teeth on the tiger, only instead of a tool to democratize and equalize based on the rhetoric of &quot;Self-Determination&quot; it was used as a tool to legitimize the resource extraction and smaller scale genocides by the &quot;good guys.&quot;  </p>

<p>I believe that we as a species, if we hope to survive, will have to be party to such supranational organizations, I just don&#39;t see them being to the benefit of us all when there are an elect few discussing and engineering their uses and policies.  Right now is an interesting time because our legal system, in the US and internationally has outlawed the worst things that are happening.  but the masses are too stupid to rise up and hold people accountable.  Every war that the US has been involved in since world war two has been in violation of the treaties that we are party to, and as such are in violation of Article 6 of the Constitution.  Of course after the Nuremburg trials, everyone in the entire chain of command is liable for the crimes.  but as Smedley Butler said, War is a Racket, and the US was the prostitute of business long before those agreements were made, so most people aren&#39;t even aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At its core, <em>globalization</em> simply refers to the rate of globalism. The very fact that this is frequently misunderstood to mean much more shows exactly how over-saturated the term has become. <em>Globalism</em> refers to the global integration of society, which is really what this discussion should be about.</p>

<p>An excellent way to understand the pros and cons of globalism is to understand the impacts it can have on language. One very well-understood interaction between globalism and language is the formation of a <em>lingua franca</em> within an integrated society. On a worldwide scale, a global lingua franca could open the flood gates for cultures and ideas to be shared all over the world (which is very often considered a great benefit of globalism).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is no nation we inhabit, but a language. Make no mistake; out native tongue is our true fatherland.&quot;</p>

<p>— Emil Cioran, Romanian philosopher</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, globalism could fasten the extinction of dying languages and, by extension, a significant amount of society&#39;s shared culture. When some information is diffused, other pieces of information become forgotten; language is no different. This memetic behavior of language allows for the transplantation of one language&#39;s words and phrases to another, evolving the target language, and, more dramatically, the ability for a lingua franca to replace a native tongue.</p>

<p>Yes, globalization—not the &quot;type&quot; that advocates the chipping of people with RFIDs—could very much be a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly the type of thought and discussion that I haven&#39;t seen talked about. It&#39;s so welcome, mainly because it&#39;s an idea that is filled with hope and promise. Yes, there is cause for sadness in your hypothesized world, loss of language and culture would put an end to a uniqueness that perhaps we will be the last to know.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;d give anything to get on a time machine and see the types of things humanity could create with unified resources and a shared language between all humans. Would division be a thing of the past, would there be wars, would we be more compassionate and empathetic? Sometimes I think we spent so much time fear mongering on this thread, and I get that the intention is to spread awareness and I&#39;m thankful for the level of information I now have. However, sometimes I worry that we are manifesting this apocalyptic narrative into reality through our constant worry and obsession with a very bleak future.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re talking about is completely different from globalization.    </p>

<p>A single, lone government having domain over the world is a terrifying thought.  Even if it were founded upon the ideals of the global citizen there would still be nepotism, influence peddling, corruption, and abuse.    </p>

<p>Globalization as it is today is centered on the reality of the longstanding interdependence between countries and corporations.  The stability of the international economy relies on these relationships.  The fragility is an issue, but the thought of being held hostage is what concerns people I think.</p>
