       I'm always wary of posts that get gold on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been keeping tabs, it usually happens as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) non-subbed user discredits the sub for being pro-Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       2) non-subbed user discredits the sub for being a shell of itself
      </p>
      <p>
       3) non-subbed user discredits pizzagate and wonders why the sub doesn't care about the "real" conspiracies about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only organic ways I've seen gold exchanged on this sub is in random comment threads where a user goes out of their way to provide sourced information -- and that doesn't happen often.

       Just something to point out, not everyone that comes here is subbed. I like conspiracies, but I don't really care to see the same pizza gate stories popping up three times a page on my feed. I am also not a shill even though I generally have a liberal and devils advocate approach to things.

       Yup! I un-subbed multiple times and re-sub when whatever I don't agree with stops spamming my personal frontpage.

       Seeing CTR SHILLS! and Pizzagate every two threads isn't for me. Same for the 'Sandy Hook Era'.

       Nice troll, it is his money and success that is the reason you can trust him. He has given up everything he has ever worked for and his families safety to help save America and the world from the globalist that you are working for.

       Usually I notice a huge increase here after a major terror attack or world event happens.  I don't know of any such events transpiring today, but there's now 4600 people here, 4 times as many as usual.  Wonder what they're all doing here.

       No, I did. I just wouldn't expect that event, with a relatively small number of casualties, to draw 4 times the normal amount of people here.  Not trying to take anything away from the people who died, but compared to other attacks, the death toll was small.

       We've been living in Orwell's 1984 pretty much since 1984, the world's elite with the help of the CIA and the elite owned media (News and entertainment) has brainwashed everyone into railing against their own interests. 
 Have you ever seen the media fight so hard for one side, an honest politician like Bernie couldn't get a fair chance. Now the left elite are trying to convince everyone that Trump is ushering in the Orwellian era while we've been living in it most of our lives.

       This is true. Bernie was treated extremely unfairly and lost the primaries because it was stolen (literally voter fraud/election fraud).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Bernie had won, I wonder what we'd be seeing, probably the same treatment as Trump, but different words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine Bernie would have been ridiculed and sabotaged behind his back by the CIA (like Carter was).

       I'm here saying Global Warming is a scam. 9/11 was an inside job. ISIS was created by the U.S. intentionally. GWB was a pedophile. Pizzagate is real (and harkenes back to the GWB days). The major profit center for the CIA is the American drug market. Afgainstan was conquered for the poppies.

       I never said that. I simply listed the narratives that keep popping up. The shills post essentially the same thing, worded slightly differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for finding out about Trump, but when shills keep coming and saying "let's investigate him, he's probably a pedo (but Pizzagate isn't real), also he's a Russian agent, and this sub has become T_D," it's obvious.

       Well, he's certainly sympathetic and an admirer. Either of these qualities would be grounds for heavy suspicion for any American only a decade or so ago. Personally, I'm okay with improving relations. I think a lot of our hatred of each other was based in misunderstanding.

       Clinton is almost certainly done with politics. At least on the national level. If NY wants her back it's up to them. Trump on the other hand is a very hot topic. He usually can only make it 8 hours  or so without saying or doing something weird that can be discussed. Seems like the only time it's quiet is when he's asleep.

       He is using twitter to talk to you because the media lies and spins everything against him. There is no Muslim ban, he is doing extreme vetting on the 7 nations  Obama listed as threats to America in 2015. Wake up and think about what is going on.

       Hard to combat an enemy that can edit live video to show empty bleachers and streets along the way where Trump walked for the Presidential Inauguration. It sure added credibility when one of the medias undercover operatives Tweeted an altered photo of the crop using the Parks Service's account.

       its because it was mentioned in a popular thread (on politics or news, can't remember which one). it was discussed how this has plainly been overrun by Trump supporters, which I wholeheartedly agree with. that comment brought people like me - who used to come to this sub to read about those preventing a free America/world.
