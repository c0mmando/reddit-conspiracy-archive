    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always wary of posts that get gold on this sub. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been keeping tabs, it usually happens as follows:</p>

<p>1) non-subbed user discredits the sub for being pro-Trump</p>

<p>2) non-subbed user discredits the sub for being a shell of itself</p>

<p>3) non-subbed user discredits pizzagate and wonders why the sub doesn&#39;t care about the &quot;real&quot; conspiracies about Trump.</p>

<p>The only organic ways I&#39;ve seen gold exchanged on this sub is in random comment threads where a user goes out of their way to provide sourced information -- and that doesn&#39;t happen often.</p>

 Have you ever seen the media fight so hard for one side, an honest politician like Bernie couldn&#39;t get a fair chance. Now the left elite are trying to convince everyone that Trump is ushering in the Orwellian era while we&#39;ve been living in it most of our lives. </p>

<p>I&#39;m here saying Global Warming is a scam. 9/11 was an inside job. ISIS was created by the U.S. intentionally. GWB was a pedophile. Pizzagate is real (and harkenes back to the GWB days).

Well, he&#39;s certainly sympathetic and an admirer. Either of these qualities would be grounds for heavy suspicion for any American only a decade or so ago. Personally, I&#39;m okay with improving relations. I think a lot of our hatred of each other was based in misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Not when the propaganda is lies.</p>

<p>Try this out and see if you agree: &quot;Even if the 9/11 attacks were co-opted by elements in the U.S. Government, if terrorists were in someway responsible, don&#39;t you think we should bomb Afganistan and plunge the world into a decade of war?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the point of the narrative push. They push a narrative to cause division within the user base and to bury real information.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not the issue. The issue is she needs to be held accountable (as do the rest of her company).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Even if the 9/11 attacks were co-opted by elements in the U.S. Government, if terrorists were in some way responsible, don&#39;t you think we should bomb Afganistan and plunge the world into a decade of war?&quot;</p>

<p>Only if we can restart the Afghanistan heroin flow and maintain it at an extremely high level. The livelihood of the Afghani farmers is more important than the lives of American addicts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm.  I have been graphing data on this sub for a while now.  These spikes in logged on users usual correspond with waves of shitty polarized political arguments in comments and unusual surges of upvotes and/or downvotes for certain topics.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait for this sub to get back to normal, I miss it :-(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its because it was mentioned in a popular thread (on politics or news, can&#39;t remember which one). it was discussed how this has plainly been overrun by Trump supporters, which I wholeheartedly agree with. that comment brought people like me - who used to come to this sub to read about those preventing a free America/world. </p>

<p>put your efforts towards things like exposing child trafficking or the American people being subjected to a puppet government.</p>

<p>this sub wastes so much time up its own fucking ass its relentless. wanna stop CTR/T_D/Soros/Koch/Voldemoort, deal with the issues they create and don&#39;t allow yourselves to get distracted.</p>
