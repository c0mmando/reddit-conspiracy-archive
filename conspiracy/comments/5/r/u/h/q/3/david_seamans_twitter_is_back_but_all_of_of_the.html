<p>If you didn&#39;t see his feed last night, he was tweeting up a storm about an incoming partial disclosure in Antarctica. Why would he delete his account and then reopen it a few hours later, losing all of his followers?Thoughts?</p>

<p>Listen to his multiple appearances on the Joe Rogan podcast, he&#39;s shiftless &amp; unreliable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I have been wondering.  If you got yourself into serious trouble for publishing the truth, perhaps you could cut a deal to get yourself out of trouble by publicly stating your belief in some very farfetched theory--<strong>thereby discrediting yourself but saving your neck.</strong>  It&#39;s like pleading insanity.</p>

<p>I often wonder whether David Icke&#39;s apparent public belief in the existence of shape shifting aliens is the reason he is able to accuse the British royal family of being murderers and paedophiles and survive unharmed.</p>

<p>Another example: that rapper B.O.B. has exposed illuminati cloning centres in his twitter, but he kind of negates that important disclosure by banging on about the earth being flat.</p>

<p>DS going full &quot;muh blue avian aliens&quot; seemed out of character, and makes me a bit suspicious.  (But OTOH maybe he has uncovered evidence of their existence.  In which case, cool!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and think this is true with almost all that get a big enough following.</p>

<p>In my opinion the other tactic TPTB use is bringing someone in that is considered a master in the field. TPTB did this to Joe Rogan on his podcast when they had Neil Degrasse Tyson talk to him because of his previous thoughts about the moon landing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRUMt7n_U7k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRUMt7n_U7k</a></p>

<p>I think in B.O.B&#39;s case I think he did want to have a discussion about the earth being flat. He was met with ridicule instead. 
The internet asked Neil Degrasse Tyson to get in there and tell him what&#39;s up. </p>

<p>Here is an article from the one our favorite MSM sites with a write up of the events on twitter and what happened after. Neil had this to say on The Nightly Show. </p>

<p>&quot;If you want to think the world is flat, go right ahead. But if you think the world is flat and you have influence over others, as with successful rappers, or even presidential candidates, then being wrong becomes being harmful to the health, the wealth and the security of our citizenry.&quot; </p>

<p>Raising his voice for the kicker, Tyson added: &quot;Issac Newton, my man, said, &#39;If I have seen farther than others, it&#39;s by standing on the shoulders of giants.&#39; Can I get an amen?!&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;So that&#39;s right B.o.B -- when you stand on shoulders of those who came before you might just see far enough to realize the earth isn&#39;t f**king flat.&quot;</p>

<p>With a deep breath, Tyson paused before adding(CNN had &quot;added&quot; had to fix it lol) his kicker: &quot;And by the way, this is called gravity&quot; before dropping the mic.</p>

<p>Your move, B.o.B.
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/entertainment/neil-degrasse-tyson-bob-flat-earth-twitter-spat/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/entertainment/neil-degrasse-tyson-bob-flat-earth-twitter-spat/</a></p>

<p>It worked and got laughs because the majority of people think gravity is a fact. I laughed at it for a different reason because gravity is not fact. Neil choose to use pseudoscience to try and prove his point. Pseudoscience is just another form of control. I like to call it the new religion.
<a href="https://ncse.com/library-resource/gravity-its-only-theory">https://ncse.com/library-resource/gravity-its-only-theory</a> </p>

<p>I think the world and all the things in it should always be questioned. That&#39;s the beauty of science you never know when some new little fact might come along that changes the entire discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pretty obvious to me that Seaman was literally obsessed with and obsessing over every last little detail of the PGate affair as it unfolded. </p>

<p>Anything but cool, collected, and matter of fact about any of it. He was constantly freaking-out and boiling-over about it. Far too intense and personally involved with the story for anyone that either claims to be or wants to be a professional journalist. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t keep your own personal feelings out of any story you shouldn&#39;t be covering it. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not trying to minimize the seriousness of the circumstantial evidence or the need for it to be taken seriously and seriously investigated but all the more reason to keep your head and wits about you and be deadly serious in how you present that information and those facts to encourage as much support and get some real public pressure behind getting that done.</p>

<p>I think this guy&#39;s actually had and is still suffering from a nervous breakdown, become unstable, and may be complicating that with drugs that he seems to not just generally know about but speaks of more from the standpoint of being a user in his ramblings.</p>

<p>The bit about aliens, Antarctica, etc. is also directly connected to Podesta&#39;s interest in that which he went overboard and over the top about and then deleted. What I&#39;m suggesting is that he isn&#39;t just damaged goods but very likely was right from the beginning.</p>
