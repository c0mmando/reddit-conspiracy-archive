        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At the present moment, these are the only submissions from subreddits with fewer than 5000 subscribers on the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> top 100:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/I899VE7.png">n. 6 on the frontpage, 4373 subscribers</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZYHI21i.png">n. 9, 4829 subscribers</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1efJe2F.png">n. 31, 4176 subscribers</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7g73Les.png">n. 91, 1136 subscribers</a></p>

<p>A few simple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>each of these submissions recieved more upvotes than there are subscribers in the subreddit, in some cases over 3x as many (accounting for the fact that they&#39;re ~75% upvoted); that&#39;s perfectly possible once you reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and external votes star pouring in, but <strong>how did they reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>even allowing that it might happen by a stroke of luck or sudden spike in popularity (for example, thanks to a large subreddit linking to them), <strong>how did that happen 4 times in 4 hours (the time difference between the youngest and oldest submission) to 4 different subreddits, all coincidentally belonging to the same galaxy of anti-Trump subs?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> algorithm was <a href="https://archive.fo/OGyRh">changed</a> so that multiple popular submissions from a single subreddit are penalized while individual submissions from less popular subreddits are boosted: <strong>is there an organized effort to flood <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> by spreading anti-Trump content over many smaller subreddits? and, if so, who is organizing it?</strong></p></li>
</ul>

There are those who prescribe to the jews are evil theories, his 2 older sons married jews, his daughter married a jew and converted. We have yet to see for the two youngest, but he is very much connected with the jews. Globalist could have planted trump, to do their bidding in the open, or hillary to do it subvertly, but get it either way. I don&#39;t believe it, but it&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think an arguement could be made that as posts hit a certain threshold and gets bumped to be visible, people that aren&#39;t subscribers upvote it. With that said, Reddit put themselves in a position where they lost faith among their consumers. Less than a month ago they manipulated a post from the Trump subreddit to have 0 upvotes, despite having tens of thousands minutes before. This is clear vote manipulation by SOMEBODY. Who? We can only speculate. With Reddit admins and their CEO being outspoken Trump critics, to the point that the CEO itself admitted to editing Reddit comments against Trump, it&#39;d be incredibly naive (perhaps intentionally naive) to pretend they wouldn&#39;t also prop up anti Trump posts as a way of promoting their opinion.</p>

<p>For months, Trump&#39;s subreddit was criticized for being too polarizing, which I agree with to an extent. Some posts are certainly annoying. However, the anti-Trump subreddits are equally guilty of this and in response to punishing Trump&#39;s subreddit for being on the front page too frequently, they&#39;ve now done the exact same to the other side but without the punishment. If anything, there&#39;s signs of helping them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The manipulation is so obvious that not very many people are going to fall for it. In fact, Ive noticed that people that were probably not pro trump before have had enough of it and are starting to defend the guy a little just because the anti trump shit is so over the top.</p>

<p>The strategy will back fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty well known that the majority of Reddit is left leaning, I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s a conspiracy afoot as much as there are people who don&#39;t like DJT and will upvote anything negative. Remember what r/all looked like during the primaries? Pro Bernie anti Clinton covered the front page, during the election it was pro Clinton anti Trump...Why wouldn&#39;t it remain anti Trump after election?  </p>

<p>There have been a few positive stories, the LGBT one recently and TPP was mostly positive.  </p>

<p>But be ready for it to continue, the voting majority on this site will dislike Trump for everything he does.</p>
