        <p>
         each of these submissions recieved more upvotes than there are subscribers in the subreddit, in some cases over 3x as many (accounting for the fact that they're ~75% upvoted); that's perfectly possible once you reach
         <a href="/r/all">
          /r/all
         </a>
         and external votes star pouring in, but
         <strong>
          how did they reach
          <a href="/r/all">
           /r/all
          </a>
          in the first place?

         even allowing that it might happen by a stroke of luck or sudden spike in popularity (for example, thanks to a large subreddit linking to them),
         <strong>
          how did that happen 4 times in 4 hours (the time difference between the youngest and oldest submission) to 4 different subreddits, all coincidentally belonging to the same galaxy of anti-Trump subs?

       Because Reddit admins want Trump to be impeached. Who can blamne them? He is just a Rothschild/Russian/Clinton pawn. Though, their attempts are futile as getting rid of him will only install the closet homosexual VP - Mike Pence - who will bring back slavery and lynchings for the LGBTQ community and other minorities.

       Trump supporter, and you can read my history I defend him all the time. There are those who prescribe to the jews are evil theories, his 2 older sons married jews, his daughter married a jew and converted. We have yet to see for the two youngest, but he is very much connected with the jews. Globalist could have planted trump, to do their bidding in the open, or hillary to do it subvertly, but get it either way. I don't believe it, but it's possible.

       It is the height of intelligence to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it. I agree those connections are suspicious. Time will tell I suppose. I'm not a die-hard, but it was easy to go from socialist to trump supporter after what HRC and the DNC did to Bernie. Then I got hard red-pilled on Obama and the Dems BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point being.. the establishment is trying so hard to stop trump that it is pretty hard not to notice the endless lies. Maybe it's controlled opposition... But I doubt it.

       Open your mind a bit son. Trump's been friend with the Clinton's for decades. They attended to of his weddings. He donated large sums of money to Hilary's campaign in 2008. Bill Clinton spent many hours on the phone to Trump convincing him to run.

       Well then, if "the height of intelligence to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it", why are you so defensive towards my ideas? I'm just try to move away from the popular opinion on this sub that Trump is the yanks saviour. Away who runs for office - especially someone who is a billionaire, never done an honest days work in his life, bragged about getting a small 1 mil lone from his dad, a reality tv star, brags about sexual assault, bragsabout ripping off workers, brags about not paying his taxes - does not have the interest of the common man in his heart

       I noticed this too. It's obvious and concerted. Welcome to Media Matters, American bridge, democracy matters, and shareblue. The propaganda engine is in full motion. It's surprising how propaganda is coming purely from Corp controlled sources instead of Govt.

       You will always notice if you are paying attention. Just ask yourself "Why is this here?"(Upvote manipulation)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Who is this written for?"(selection and confirmation bias)
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is the creator trying to push or ignore?"(writer bias, reader bias)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Where was this produced?" (NYT/WP/AP/CNN/FOX/Huff etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Read sources on both sides to try to filter bias. Remember to pay extra attention to any fringe ideas getting huge push-back. Where are they telling us to look, where are they telling us not to look, what are they completely ignoring etc etc.

       I think an arguement could be made that as posts hit a certain threshold and gets bumped to be visible, people that aren't subscribers upvote it. With that said, Reddit put themselves in a position where they lost faith among their consumers. Less than a month ago they manipulated a post from the Trump subreddit to have 0 upvotes, despite having tens of thousands minutes before. This is clear vote manipulation by SOMEBODY. Who? We can only speculate. With Reddit admins and their CEO being outspoken Trump critics, to the point that the CEO itself admitted to editing Reddit comments against Trump, it'd be incredibly naive (perhaps intentionally naive) to pretend they wouldn't also prop up anti Trump posts as a way of promoting their opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For months, Trump's subreddit was criticized for being too polarizing, which I agree with to an extent. Some posts are certainly annoying. However, the anti-Trump subreddits are equally guilty of this and in response to punishing Trump's subreddit for being on the front page too frequently, they've now done the exact same to the other side but without the punishment. If anything, there's signs of helping them.

       The manipulation is so obvious that not very many people are going to fall for it. In fact, Ive noticed that people that were probably not pro trump before have had enough of it and are starting to defend the guy a little just because the anti trump shit is so over the top.

       It's pretty well known that the majority of Reddit is left leaning, I wouldn't say there's a conspiracy afoot as much as there are people who don't like DJT and will upvote anything negative. Remember what r/all looked like during the primaries? Pro Bernie anti Clinton covered the front page, during the election it was pro Clinton anti Trump...Why wouldn't it remain anti Trump after election?
