    <div class="md"><p>Well how about a grass roots effort actually hold politicians accountable, a la Tea Party efefort. </p>

<p>I never said forget, its a fact of life that private political organizations who get their money from large multinational companies will do what it takes to maintain those interests. The Republicans tried their damndest but they had a primary system which negated opposition to the forerunner (that will change) unlike the Dems who wanted to limit what a Nadar could do so they installed their current primary system. </p>

<p>TLDR; Thats the system we are in today, if you want change stop depending on other people to bring it about for you </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about expand your voting interest outside of donkey or elephant. You are still stuck in red vs blue settling for whichever candidates those two produce. Vote for an independent. Complaining about which candidate the dnc chose is a waste of time. They are a corporation, a private, independent organization. They literally are in the buisness of making money via bribes and offers of power. They sell political power and we are the idiots who freely hand it over. They sell to the highest bidder. They don&#39;t care about you. They care about one thing and that&#39;s money. They are a multi billion dollar company that produces NOTHING. You want to work for The Company (aka CIA, they are The Company) you gotta sell your soul and put on a masterclass act of theater.</p>

<p>The more attention you give them the more power you give them. With no spotlight they have no power to sell. Ordinary common folk like you and I don&#39;t buy power. You already know what kind of people buy politicians.</p>

<p>Get it out of your head that these people at the DNC care about you and look at it for what it is. Do you still care about it being rigged or are you pissed that you got played?</p>

<p>Its okay, nobody is blaming you and you shouldn&#39;t feel bad about yourself. You were taught your whole life this is the way it was. But you are here now, and tat is step 1. Step 2: do you still want to play their little game of red faction vs blue faction like you are playing TF2 on steam or are you going to be part of a solution to do something about it?</p>

<p>What you say is possible. Just the same, it&#39;s an opportunity to hold him <em>accountable</em> for not fighting corruption. If you really believe that Trump is your enemy, prosecution of CF and Dyncorp will be the easiest way to prove it to the American people.

    <div class="md"><p>You make a valid point.  Trump campaigned on a lot of things which I personally consider batshit insane, but has been tossing EO after EO out to make them happen, or at least to get the ball rolling (I still hold doubt that this wall thing will actually come through, let alone within his term or financed in a way that isn&#39;t just tossing more debt on the pile).  </p>

<p>However I don&#39;t believe that a president has the capability to force prosecution action, as opposed to ordering an investigation.  Could be just plain wrong, or could be weaseled in on technicalities.  Personally I think it would set bad precedent to have major elected officials campaigning on a basis of pursuing legal action specifically targeting their opponents, but that&#39;s a whole different discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prosecution of the Clinton Foundation and Dyncorp for corruption and crimes against the people of Haiti is the <em>easiest</em> way to keep Trump accountable. Check out George Webb&#39;s videos or read articles about Dyncorp&#39;s activities over the last decade if you aren&#39;t sure what I&#39;m talking about. If he doesn&#39;t shut the trafficking networks down, then you have room to say that he is in on it (or protecting its proprietors).</p>

<p>Perhaps Hillary herself had no idea of all of the shenanigans that were pulled through the CF and State Dept during her tenure as Secretary (WJC&#39;s past relationship with Silsby&#39;s New Life Church seems to reflect otherwise). Shedding light on the situation will provide answers to this question. More importantly, it will stop the commodization of human beings disguised as humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>Trump has at least one major Dyncorp appointee to his cabinet (Gen. Kelley, DHS). This scares me much more than the idea that he might say or tweet something that offends people, or his derailing of previously laid war plans with Russia. I am also concerned that the timing of these war drums will coincide with interest rate hikes that are already planned this year (and will utterly destroy any remaining notion of the &quot;Great Recovery,&quot; which has been nothing but a shell game fueled by cheap credit). I have a bad feeling that new US military engagements in the MENA region might continue to appear. Knowing about Dyncorp&#39;s activities in Libya and Syria will be another key to keeping accountability on the new administration.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have checked your comment history to see if it was even worth mentioning this to you. So many trolls and shills abound - constantly reminding me of Upton Sinclair&#39;s famous quote &quot;It&#39;s difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends upon not understanding it.&quot;</p>

<p>Outside of that mis-attibution of Upton Sinclair&#39;s quote I agreed and understood the point you were getting at. A few years back I almost took a sysadmin job with Dyn, because that&#39;s what I actually do for a living not shilling for some bullshit company ruining my damn Internet experience, after seeing the child molestation and trafficking case on the Internet about Dyn I declined, plus they wanted me to go to Iraq or they wouldn&#39;t hire me and I didn&#39;t like that they tried to foist that on me. Additionally this was when ISIS was just grabbing headlines and I saw the writing on the wall with that as well and wanted no part of it. </p>

The reason I called you out is there is a fuck ton of &quot;let&#39;s get back to Hillary&quot; posts and concern trolling post calling for &quot;unity&quot; but also for denouncing &quot;shills&quot; and then pointing towards left leanings as the shills, and all of these posters have post histories of being r/the_Donald users.  All in all I&#39;m questioning the motives and timing of these possible concern trolls and the timing of the new influx of anti-Hillary stuff, especially since we should now be looking at plenty of Trump related conspiracies that are very relevant, yet we are not.

<p>Being insulting doesn&#39;t win arguments on this sub.  </p>

<p>As one of those &quot;spewers&quot; I could write a book on why she should be in jail.  Many others could do the same.  I don&#39;t get this intimation of people who want her locked up as being half-wits because you wrongfully assume justice against hillary is being for trump as a false-equivalency, and furthermore, people who have had gripes about the Clintons, I guarantee you that they have a much greater width, depth and breadth of understanding of history than anyone who is going to bring tired shill-sounding adhoms to a conversation in order to attempt--in an extremely infantile and foolhardy, anti-intellectual way--to try to shut down the conversation or discredit it, in a manner that harkens to the JTRIG powerpoints we&#39;ve all seen by now.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve made myself abundantly clear to you and anyone that would attempt to do the same in the future.  W&#39;e&#39;re not putting up with this level of argumentation that&#39;s a covert way of trying to take a shit on us for talking about history that belongs to both you AND me.  And that somehow we&#39;re all al bunch of fucking halfwits because we happen to know MORE than you do.  </p>

<p>ANd that we can&#39;t complete thoughts because YOU are a shitty skimmy reader with a reading comprehension of zero</p>

<p>And that we&#39;re all mindless the_donald Trump supporters because we want Justice for a person who sold OUR secrets to our adversaries and YOU are the one with black and white thinking skills and can&#39;t manage subtlety or nuance in any way....I mean in ANY way at all...</p>

<p>And that somehow you think it&#39;s acceptable to call Trump a nazi because YOU are the authoritarian..</p>

<p>This kind of thing.  Please disregard if not applicable to you and your circumsatance</p>

I&#39;m not sure he would condone it...I think he campaigned on it because that&#39;s what people wanted to hear.  I don&#39;t know if Sessions will want to go after her either...</p>

This is based on the FBI anon post that ended up being mostly true - where he said &quot;if we were to prosecute now - literally everyone would go down. There&#39;s not a clean person in the administration&quot;. So what would be the first step to prosecute on that level? Get rid of everyone that had ties to the Clinton Foundation.

<p>i&#39;ve read this before, and it&#39;s as underwhelming now as it was then. for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian intelligence agencies have <strong>allegedly</strong> recently digitally broken into four different American organizations that are affiliated either with Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party since late May. All of the hacks appear designed to benefit Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations in one fashion or another. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, a generation later, a digital break in to the national headquarters of one of our two major parties by a foreign adversary in order to leak information that benefits the other national party’s presidential candidate seems to be just the normal course of doing business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>note the ol&#39; switcheroo -- what is an allegation at the beginning of the piece is received truth by the end. i&#39;ve seen absolutely no evidence that the wikileaks material originated from russia, and neither have you. is it possible that russia was responsible? certainly. there are innumerable possibilities, and it is salutary to consider them; on the other hand, it is equally salutary to consider probabilities. &quot;possibility&quot; does not equal &quot;plausibility,&quot; &quot;plausibility&quot; does not equal &quot;probability,&quot; and &quot;probability&quot; does not equal &quot;certainty.&quot;</p>

<p>even granting that trump <em>may</em> have unsavory financial ties to russia, the same is <strong>indisputably</strong> true of [the clintons(<a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/26/peter-schweizer/fact-checking-clinton-cash-author-claim-about-bill/">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/26/peter-schweizer/fact-checking-clinton-cash-author-claim-about-bill/</a>) and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">john podesta</a>, which makes this quote from the piece you linked all the more [seth] rich:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response, Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign manager, [the aptly named] Robby Mook, issued a statement: &quot;<em>Donald Trump has a responsibility to disclose campaign chair Paul Manafort&#39;s and all other campaign employees&#39; and advisers&#39; ties to Russian or pro-Kremlin entities, including whether any of Trump&#39;s employees or advisers are currently representing and or being paid by them.</em>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i will further note that the material you linked to is an opinion piece written by a member of the old guard of the political establishment (the same political establishment which was fanatically opposed to trump&#39;s candidacy from day one), not an investigative report by an independent journalist. i am not engaging in the rudimentary logical error that is the genetic fallacy -- his arguments might very well be true, but do merit heightened scrutiny.</p>

<p>that said, the piece seems to be little more than tenuous speculation and evidence-free assertion. a final quote from the linked material:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to Trump and Russia, the truth may take awhile to emerge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>indeed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Trump/Russia bullshit is specifically designed to distract from the DNC/Hillary corruption.  It also has the effect of poisoning the well and muddy-ing the waters against any future prosecutions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m awed at how well its working.  My roommate spends 4-10 hours a day listening to NPR, CNN and MSNBC.  Those are his only sources of information.  Our politics are almost identical and we were both Bernie supporters.  But now, he&#39;s gone full on-board the <strong>OMGTRUMPHESONASTY!!!1!!!</strong> train.  Its bizarre.  Its like watching someone willingly be manipulated into madness.</p>

<p>I keep pointing out that all the outrage and passion being generated for various issues was curiously absent during the Obama years.  He rages about Trump setting us back on fossil fuels but is totally oblivious to Dem silence on DAPL.  And pulling out of TPP is somehow irrelevant now.  We&#39;ve had the same hack/leak/Seth Rich conversation 5 or 6 times since the election.  Its a little bizarre to watch the face go blank for a split second and then hear a pre-programmed reply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not always about what came first it&#39;s more about what is interesting at the moment. </p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s corruption would be the hot topic if she won. After all, the President has enormous power. A corrupt politician in power is definitely something to focus on. </p>

<p>Since Trump won his possible ties to Russia are obviously more important than whatever Clinton has done.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s influence is pretty much over in politics. Sure it might be fun to have a good old fashioned witch hunt and  find satisfaction in bringing her to some kind of justice but is that really a good idea since the biggest threat to America might be the guy in the White House? </p>

The investigation will take time to gather proof and many people are scared of cooperating and the fallout will be devastating. This is the biggest story of our time and I think for the people to be as one, it must be told and most importantly proven so that all the people that are blind to their crimes can unite and move forward under the current President. I think there is a genuine debate going on with TPTB as to weather we should be told of the extent of the situation. We already have a general idea but the waters may be even more murkier than we have imagined, especially within the CF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It blows my mind that there&#39;s good evidence linking the kremlin to controlling the current president with oil money bribes and blackmail but for some reason all anyone wants to talk about is a story that&#39;s 6 months old (and now barely relevant to the current power dynamics) or a hair-brained attempt at linking a pizza place to satanic murder rituals. </p>

<p>Why is nobody talking about how well the Steele dossier lines up with Rosfnets 19.5% stake going to an anonymous shell corporation in the Caribbean? There&#39;s just so much juice to that story and it&#39;s nowhere to be found here which is exactly what I&#39;d expect to find at the front page of this sub. It&#39;s a textbook conspiracy filled with spies, election tampering, assassinations trillions of dollars in dark money and two of the most powerful men on the planet!</p>
