<p>You Sir, underestimate the entire social fabric of  our society today. It is not whether something or certain facts are undeniably true but whether by social cohesion you can make even the most absurd lie replace the Truth because ost people are incapable of free thought, they are like cattle moving with the herd without an individual thought, period. There is no room for the truth in our society no matter how many facts or evidences you to show people. Exhibit A: 911</p>

<p>911 blew open  all conspiracies- it was now evident you could brainwash billions of people, even defy all natural physics and Science. If there is a scientist who believes the 911 official story then by that he/ she just nullified major portions of thermodynamics, physics and chemistry. Yet nobody bats an eye. The whole expensive demolition industry would be dead overnight if you could bring a building down with few gallons of kerosene in just over an hour.</p>

<p>The question becomes what else is a grand fraud? the space program, perhaps??</p>

<p>Sadly, most people I encounter today are incapable of this.</p>

<p>If they don&#39;t believe even the minutest detail of an idea, they instantly reject the entire thought.</p>

<p>The truth is hardly ever self evident. Arriving at truth often involves entertaining uncomfortable ideas, following threads of suspicion, and untangling webs of deceit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just too much work for most people today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are honestly not a very big part of my pervue. Along with CTR/shills (a word I truly am tired of seeing and am sorry to use in the post at all), I should have included the plain old ridiculous/inflammatory users who post hatespeech or absurd claims in the absence of any evidence.

<p>I&#39;d respectfully request those next time you come across a post like that just to see what happens. You just may help someone realize something they didn&#39;t know before or even learn something yourself.

<p>And again, we&#39;ll see. Trump has followed through on all his promises so far. I&#39;ll be quick to jump ship if it becomes apparent he&#39;s a sellout neo-con. But the evidence isn&#39;t there right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. </p>

<p>I really WANT to believe Trump is the champion of the people against globalist domination. But, this last move, lifting restrictions on banking institutions, doesn&#39;t seem to fit that narrative.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s a move that creates an environment for something in the future?</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask this sub, is there anyway you can see lifting these restrictions as a prelude to ending the FEDERAL RESERVE?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, we know for a fact that people were paid to shill against Trump. This isn&#39;t up for debate. The fact that you can&#39;t imagine why they would do this has nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>There are Russian shills, Turkish shills, British shills, Israeli shills, American shills, Microsoft shills, Lord and Taylor shills, Dish Network shills....and the list goes on. </p>

<p>I post this here all the time, but it seems like most people decide not to read it. I&#39;ll give it another try:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iym08fac&amp;amp;sh=8bcea83c">https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iym08fac&amp;amp;sh=8bcea83c</a></p>

<p>Now that you know for a fact that shills exist and that some of them were paid to be anti-Trump (probably some pro-Trump as well), we can discuss motives and where they might be. </p>

<p>Motive for manipulating Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qwa4m/the_motivation_behind_hiring_shills_to_manipulate/?st=iym9otgq&amp;amp;sh=86ae10fe">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qwa4m/the_motivation_behind_hiring_shills_to_manipulate/?st=iym9otgq&amp;amp;sh=86ae10fe</a> (more info in the comments as well)</p>

<p>Where will you find shills? They will most likely be in very large threads. On Reddit, they will hang out in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and any posts that they decide are likely to be on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> later in the day. It is way easier to control a comments section if you get in there early. Your early comments have a much higher chance of staying on top of the thread than later comments. </p>

<p>This subreddit regularly hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Not only that, even if it doesn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, the top post can still be seen by quite a few people. About 45,000 people per day visit this subreddit, the vast majority of them checking out the top post and the comments there. The top post is fed to the front page of every subscriber. I think it would be worth it to pay <em>at least</em> 1 guy 15 bucks an hour to manipulate all of the largest political subreddits, making their way to this subreddit once they have hit the larger ones, such as worldnews, news, politics, etc. These larger subs can receive traffic of about 200-400 thousand unique IP addresses per day.</p>

<p>Another tactic they probably use (besides manually combing through the largest subs) is keyword tracking. There are keyword alert services that anyone can use to receive a notification any time a specific word or phrase is mentioned on Reddit (or other social media). I imagine that there are shills who literally just sit at a computer all day responding to all of the keyword hits they get (and these are probably given to them in order of importance). </p>

<p>Or....maybe governments aren&#39;t all that efficient. The above is how <em>I</em> would set up a shill network, but we are talking about government shills here. Perhaps they post here just because they have decided that it&#39;s better to go directly after the source--conspiracy theorists. If they can destroy morale here and confuse the subscribers here, maybe we will sit here too busy arguing with shills and spend less time outside of the subreddit. Basically, this place can act as a ghetto. </p>

<p>So, when a person says &quot;I see shills all over Reddit,&quot; are they exaggerating? Maybe not. There really aren&#39;t that many billboards in the world. They aren&#39;t in the woods, your bathroom, the ocean, in small neighborhoods, etc. The billboards are specifically placed where there is high traffic. Although there are a small number of billboards compared to  the amount of space where they could potentially be placed, almost everybody sees a few of them per day. In the same way, although the shills can only spend so much time on so many threads, the vast majority of people might read 2 or 3 manipulated threads per day.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m educated pretty well actually, but thanks for your concern, seriously man this is pretty transparent, when you say &quot;educate yourself&quot; you only mean buy into your bullshit and share the same bubble I live in.

<p>This screams of &quot;my biases are confirmed and you need to follow my lead&quot; no man I don&#39;t and I won&#39;t. You&#39;re not thinking critically you&#39;re just parroting bullshit and reacting.</p>

<p>You need to understand that not everyone that disagrees with you is a shill, that&#39;s censorship, that is a low info non-critical way of thinking and you need to gain some perspective. At this point your side, the Right, because face it you have chosen a side and thus have lost objectivity, has made Brock as much of a boogeyman as Soros. I can agree with you here, fuck Shareblue/CTR/whatever else but also fuck Cambridge Analytica, the company the Right wing uses for the same things, fuck fake news peddlers, and fuck the influx of astroturfing bots and trolls who are doing their best to confuse those who aren&#39;t choosing to broaden their horizons and using perspective to realize that they need to look and triangulate verification of each and every source. </p>

<p>Critical thinking is needed stop trying to push the shill narrative, we need inclusivity not exclusivity, the shill narrative is just another form of censorship and is a push to turn this sub into a safespace.</p>

<p>I want to say &quot;nobody questions that&quot; but I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s true, there has to be some of us that do. Once the CTR news broke it seemed to confirm so many of people&#39;s biases that so many other users on this sub just started calling anyone with different opinions than they shills or CTR, it like exploded over night, I can&#39;t even count how many times I was on the receiving end of that shit just because I lean left in many different ways. So CTR didn&#39;t even really have to even come into our sub to do anything to screw things up, instead the news of them even existing and being hired by Hillary was enough for some of us to turn on each other and the cry of shill went from being something that we only used on each other when we suspected someone of being a government agent on here to anyone that did not agree with them. Also at this point many of us simply stopped using our critical thinking in order to take the easy path, call someone a shill and get out of the debate, rather than sticking with it and debating with the person and seeing if you can teach them something or if you can learn something from them. Overall I think CTR focused on r/politics and similar subs mostly, r/PoliticalDiscussion was heavily Hillary leaning, r/politics at one point was mocking it saying it&#39;s r/hillaryclinton-lite, but as for us, just their existence was enough to get us to turn on one another.</p>

<p>Additionally I love how in every single one of these CTR discussions nobody ever brings up Cambridge Analytica and the similar stuff they do and have been doing for the Republican party for a while now.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No because that&#39;s censorship, and Trump is some tasty conspiracy bait, especially all of the stuff surrounding his cabinet picks, the only way a Trump ban would work and be fair is if we banned the Hillary stuff as well, but either way that would ruin the sub because that specifically is censorship. These topics need to be debated and discussed, we need to look at Rex Tillerson&#39;s connections to Russia, and Trump&#39;s just as much as we need to look at anything to do with Hillary. the conspiracy world should be apolitical, but it often winds up leaning Right to Far/Alt-Right, and so much of that has to do with the sheer amount of propaganda that is pushed by the Right wing, Russia, and the various Right wing conspiracy blogs that just echo what comes from Russia or the Right wing in general. We need to move back to center, because conspiracies come from whomever holds power and right now the Right wing holds the power. </p>

<p>Regardless of leanings or whatever we need to push people to stop self-censoring and crying shill to get out of debating or confirming their biases, we need to encourage critical thinking, debating, and inclusivity.</p>

<p>Well probably because they were unsuccessful, however I&#39;ve looked into them and they weren&#39;t doing the same things that CTR and CA were doing, I think they mostly just redesigned his site and a couple of other things but they never hired actual shills to shill for Bernie. If you have a good source that says otherwise please post it. </p>

<p>There is no alt-left, that&#39;s just a reactionary made up thing to the Orwellian Double-Speak that is &quot;Alt-Right&quot; lets call it what it is, Far Right and Far Left. </p>

<p>As for r/politics I don&#39;t care what&#39;s on there, I probably spend as much time on this sub as that, both are echochambers but this sub is the only one that bitches about the other, and mostly because we&#39;re beneath their notice here.

<p>Also I have no side, I&#39;m never claimed to have a side, I&#39;m a middle of the road kind of guy, and dude seriously the only person pigeon holing me is you. </p>

<p>Like I said I lean left but I&#39;m always willing to hear things out and give my take on what&#39;s said, hell that&#39;s what I was doing by even responding to OP&#39;s post, and I even tried to engage OP but they didn&#39;t bother with a follow up, however in another thread, with basically the same title, I spoke to that OP and we came to an agreement that we both wanted to see the same things in this sub, a move back towards the middle. </p>

<p>Seriously man you&#39;re just assuming I&#39;m the enemy because I happen to also comment in r/politics, that&#39;s a little asinine because plenty of other users here do the same, also I&#39;ve pushed for the same in r/politics, on this account or my main account, whenever I see a reasonable Trump supporter posting in there and everyone jumping all over them. I firmly believe you don&#39;t change someones mind unless you engage them, and that&#39;s my whole problem with the shill thing is it pushes off any engagement, now that engagement doesn&#39;t have to be nice either, but people need to be confronted on their beliefs and challenged and if possible educated, and you can learn something from them in the process, or at least I usually believe I can. </p>

<p>What the hell am I saying that is insane? What is wrong with you man lol. Wow.</p>

<p>I never said you were insane or anything you said was insane. I am talking about the amount of disinformation and fear that is being propagated on this website. For fucks sake stop pretending I am attacking you here. You want a discussion or do you want to be combative?&gt;</p>

<p>Again, I never said you were the enemy. I am just saying that your side of the spectrum are acting a bit crazy imo. </p>

<p>I firmly believe you don&#39;t change someones mind unless you engage them, and that&#39;s my whole problem with the shill thing is it pushes off any engagement, now that engagement doesn&#39;t have to be nice either, but people need to be confronted on their beliefs and challenged and if possible educated, and you can learn something from them in the process, or at least I usually believe I can.</p>

<p>I am willing and do engage in actual discussion when I can find it on here as well. Unfortunately, the reddit mods and admins are doing everything they can to prevent that discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, obviously I thought you were talking about something anti-Trump that sounded insane, and believe me you haven&#39;t even seen me be combative, but I&#39;m sure you could find examples in my post history, like I said my intentions are to be reasonable. </p>

<p>But you have to understand a lot of us who lean left or even sit in the middle of the road think that a lot of what the Right, and especially Pro-Trumpers, are the ones that are being insane, so I guess this is kind of subjective to who is deciding who or what is insane. </p>

<p>Me personally I think the unflinching desire to confirm biases, and jump through all kinds of mental gymnastics to push off dissenting opinion or counter the negatives of the Right or Trump in general is insane. I am not saying you have indicated you are one of those or anything like that, that&#39;s just how I feel about things I&#39;ve seen from a broad perspective of things. </p>

<p>Additionally like I noted the Boy who Cried Shill has also played into a lot of this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the admins, the funniest thing about this statement is outside of dumbass changing comments I have not heard a peep from the admins, yet those users that support the Trump narratives constantly rail about how terrible they&#39;ve been, which to me just makes them look like they have a victim complex. Now there have been subs that have been eliminated, but so many of those that were either were extremely racist or whatever else along those lines, I mean c&#39;mon one of the was r/greatapes (or something like that) which is nothing but making fun of blacks and comparing them to chimps and apes, that shit is terrible in my eyes and I am by far not a SJW. The other one was FPH, and that sub was banned because they were brigading constantly and being dicks in general.</p>

<p>Additionally I know from the other side of things there has been calls for banning r/The_Donald too for the same reasons FPH was banned, yet the admins have shown that they will not, which they shouldn&#39;t, because they&#39;ll just be a cancer somewhere else on the site, at least they have their safespace and can get banned when they&#39;re dicks elsewhere, which kind of isn&#39;t fair since they ban the shit out of any dissenting opinions, hence the safespace moniker, and they can&#39;t be brigaded in retaliation.</p>

<p>Now the mods are another story, some suck some don&#39;t, and some of the ones that suck are legit shills, and there are no two ways about that, even some mods on r/The_Donald have been caught as being shills and selling accounts and what not, I&#39;m pretty sure plenty of other subs are having the same issues, especially the politically connected ones.</p>

<p>Sure, except, history eludes them and they think that all this stuff that is happening is brand new and hasn&#39;t been done before.

<p>I can easily say the same thing about the opposing side. In fact, I guess it is what I just said above in this comment.</p>

<p>Dude, they had a whole blog post the other day where they condemned Trump because of his immigration ban. Many of the well known admins participated in it. They are just as grossly misinformed as the rest of the left. Spez, the CEO of the entire company has a disdain for TD so much so that he has edited peoples reddit comments from the backend. That is on top of changing the fundemental algorithm of the website to keep pro Trump posts off the front page. That is a very dangerous precedent. It is their website though so they can do whatever they want. </p>

<p>Sure, like I said it is their website and the corporation who owns it wants the website to appreciate in value. I would ban those subreddits too. </p>

<p>There is no reason to ban TD. We are not a hateful subreddit believe it or not. Anytime people call us racists and sexists or hateful, I challenge them to find me one upvoted comment or post from today that falls into those categories. It is the 2nd most active subreddit. If they banned us, it would be FPH all over again times 100. Reddit would become unusable. </p>

<p>Secondly, we ban dissenting opinions because:</p>

<p>A: It is a dedicated Trump subreddit. It is a 24/7 Trump rally. If you showed up to a rally in protest with a sign, you would be removed from the rally. Same thing goes for Bernie and Hillary subreddits. They are specifically for support. This is the same reason you can&#39;t go into Iphone and argue why Androids are better or into PCmasterrace and argue that consoles are better. </p>

<p>B. So many redditors or paid shills have such a disdain for TD that they actually do try and sabotage us. They come and post racist stuff and expect to get upvotes so they can look like they proves something. Nope, we do not accept intolerance so one of our mods will ban them immediately. Not worth the time to vet every single nay sayer. </p>

<p>The entire reason TD exists is because you couldn&#39;t be a Trump supporter anywhere else on this website. We were all literally banned and shunned from the rest of the website so we had to make our own community. I can only post in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> once every ten minutes. My main account is banned from there. If we cannot come to their side to chat then why the fuck should they be able to come to our shitpost circlejerk forum and voice their concerns? That&#39;s out man. They made the bed and we are all sleeping in it. </p>

<p>Yea like the entire mod team in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being replaced right before the election. There was even an ETS mod who also modded <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It is a joke. </p>

<p>I think you don&#39;t give people enough credit with this statement, there are many people on the left critical of all of them, especially me, don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Obama, but there has been a whole shit load of shadiness that went down all throughout his presidency, especially his last nod to the snooper&#39;s charter where he&#39;s allowing the NSA to share their data with the other agencies and police. I&#39;m an IT professional with a degree in Information Systems Security, privacy is a huge deal to me.</p>

<p>Believe me I agree, confirming biases is not a one sided thing, everyone from any group or fanhood does it, I&#39;m not going to devolve this into &quot;your side does it more&quot; or anything like that so I&#39;ll just stop at acknowledgement that any group does it and you have to force yourself to separate yourself from it and confirm and verify sources and like my dad likes to use &quot;triangulate your news&quot; basically seeking out three sources from separate sides of the spectrum that confirm the facts in the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is a very dangerous precedent. It is their website though so they can do whatever they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree to an extent but they could have outright banned r/The_Donald by now and they haven&#39;t and they won&#39;t most likely, the algorithm tweaks are mostly to combat the vote manipulation that r/The_Donald engages in to stay on the front page, me I just filter the crap out and don&#39;t even worry about it, except for when it creeps into the subs I actually enjoy being on, like this one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly, I agree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Like I said before in my previous post I agree.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was banned from r/t_d for asking about something that was a current headline and that was before the sidebar rules were changed. I get that it&#39;s a fan sub, or at least it is now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So many redditors or paid shills have such a disdain for TD that they actually do try and sabotage us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well with all of the brigading and other bullshit from r/t_d can you possibly understand why? I mean seriously I&#39;m not sure how much you participated but they took over every Bernie sub post primary loss, they brigaded and attacked r/politics, they brigade anything that is talking shit about them or Trump, that&#39;s shitty and that&#39;s why we hate that sub, and as for shills, like I said not everyone is a shill some people just really fucking hate that sub, or Trump in general, and I said some but more like a lot of people. </p>

<p>Regardless it&#39;s a safespace for the people who bitch the loudest about safespaces, and that&#39;s why that sub is the bane of Reddit while simultaneously being one of the biggest jokes of Reddit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But you also neglect to point out that there is an r/The_Donald contributor that is the mod of r/politics too. r/politics has always leaned heavily left, as has the majority of Reddit, are you really that surprised? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea like the entire mod team in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being replaced right before the election</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also source on this one please, because I know a few people left or were replaced but other than that the mod team stayed fairly intact, but then again I don&#39;t pay attention to the mods all too much anyway, additionally I&#39;ve been banned from r/politics twice myself on my main account, and my previous account before that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean when the goverment of the most powerful country in the world changes hands and people who were on the inside are now on the outside. You probably weren&#39;t here 8 years ago, but when Bush was president this was a VERY left leaning sub, with posts calling for Bush/ Cheney to be charged with warcrimes pretty much every day. When the left took power it gradually shifted to more right leaning. </p>

<p>And now that the party in power changed, it&#39;s safe to assume that it will probably head back to more left leaning. People hear about Trump- Russia connections and they assume this would be the sub for it, because you know, it&#39;s a conspiracy theory. Then when they get here you call them shills and accuse them of being paid...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t both sides be called out? My favorite moment ever on this sub was when a Conspiracy was marked as &quot;Unsupported claims&quot; and more neutral thinking theorists on here were ripping the The_Donald brigade a new ass hole for essentially doing the same thing they accused Hillary of doing. There&#39;s a pretty obvious difference between now and before the election. While I do agree there might be CTR members on here, the biases for both sides show pretty darn clearly when you disagree with their view point. Moron/cuck/idiot etc comes out first and foremost as an indicator that you&#39;re not dealing with someone who is open to actual discussion and investigation. As another lurker, fuck &quot;ShareBlue&quot; and the_Donald. Both of yall can eat a fat dick. The research and discussion itself I believe should be non partisan 😊</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s become quite amusing to watch the OG&#39;s of this sub and the others who do not frequent this sub. I&#39;ve said it before that it&#39;s painfully obvious who&#39;s who in this sub. Mostly, the trump circle jerk is people posting crap about the immigration ban asking why this sub isn&#39;t talking about it. Because it&#39;s not a conspiracy. As soon as anyone mentions the conspiracies that shroud around Clinton or Obama- it&#39;s immediately shifted to &quot;this sub is pro trump&quot; thus the circle jerk begins again. This is one of the benefits of being a long time lurker here. I love the OG&#39;s here, they have produced some amazing content and wonderful insights to crazy ass conspiracies that have been proven (JFK), and the wild unknown (Aliens). </p>

I think they have taken to sending private messages too, so that they can try to derail you in a less-public venue so they are less likely to get spotted. </p>

<p>Sad... they shouldn&#39;t be paid for this... it&#39;s shoddy and obvious. </p>

funny thing though is that imagine that would take a lot of work and they couldn&#39;t handle too many at once. so keep dropping the truthbombs.   and maybe we should synchronise when we drop them.....</p>
