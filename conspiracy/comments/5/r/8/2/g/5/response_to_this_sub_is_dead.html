       So another user who says he's a long time lurker has decided to bail. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because supposedly this subreddit has been taken over by Trump supporters.  They then go on to talk about Nazis and all that other shit.  So I want to take a change to rebut this.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I'm not a Trump supporter. I think he's very polarizing and confrontational. People either love him or hate him, but nobody is able to ignore him. Just my opinion, but I see him as an independent who suckered the GOP and won by running as one of them. I also think he's a distraction. How so?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media go after Trump and a very few of his policies (Wall, immigration) while ignoring the big stuff that's going on. Stuff like a former Exxon CEO for Sec of State... or all the former Goldman Sachs people in his administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       People love associating Trump with Hitler and Fascism. But this is a trick and here's how it's working. First, the comparison itself is a form of deception. People are being deceived into seeing something that isn't really there. The fascism is real, but it's
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       coming from the Trump side. It's coming from his opponents. Yes, that sounds crazy... but it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that the Nazis were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       conservatives. They weren't ever right wing. In fact, they were the exact opposite. They were all about social change. They practiced a union of government and business under government control. They introduced all kinds of social programs and new social attitudes (starting to sound familiar?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the people that are closest to the Nazis aren't the GOP or Trump. It's the politically correct SJW types. These are the people who want a union of Big Business and Big Government coupled with a huge platform of "correct social attitudes" to which everyone is expected to conform. These same people are also incredibly intolerant of anyone who does not conform to their ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where Trump comes in. He's there to serve as a boogeyman. He's there to act as a threat and an opponent. He's there to energize these people into a much more cohesive and militant group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the next 4 years are going to see the social Left go through some serious changes and President Trump will serve as a catalyst. Fascism is coming. But it's going to come from the Left. TPTB want to use opposition to Trump as a means of
       <em>
        accelerating
       </em>
       the rise of fascism while simultaneously acting as a distraction from the real source.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is politics. Nothing happens by accident. If something does happen, you can bet it was planned to happen that way. So when I see a wide variety of people suddenly unifying against a perceived opponent, it makes me think that someone intended things to go this way.

       Don't worry, OGs know this sub has nothing to do with politics and understands there are much greater truths out there than "is this guy a bad guy???".  Just got to keep asking bigger questions, looking beyond politics and peeking behind the curtain.  We must move past politics, we must show people the world is shaped the way it is shaped because we handed over our free will to these people.  Move beyond politics, turn off your TV, and ask a lot of questions

       alot of the time, these lurkers are just people who peered beyond the veil for about a second and think they got woke. ShitPosts like "Trump's a Nazi and here's why..." is a true sign of these clowns.

       There's not so much to question when the answers are right there man, why do you ask for comments about me when I said the user is encouraging people to ask questions, not that I'm the one that always asks, I like this type of encouragement because it reminds me I should never eat whatever they want me to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did you get personal, though? asking for personal comments? We all know that's a stupid technique, I never said anything about me so that's irrelevant, you are only showing your true colors and you should feel bad.

       Obvious fear-mongering seldom works here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not 1975, the cold war is over. The Reds aren't a threat, we don't have to worry about those Commie Rat Ruskies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you are correct, this is a sub for conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Trump is awful is brightly lit and out for everyone to see... literally the opposite of a conspiracy.
So we're disinterested in discussing that here.
We're more interested in the dark, hidden dealings of the corrupt officials. Trump's recent choices in his cabinet need to be talked about here, not Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, we've been shown the Democrats are corrupt liars, willing to ignore their constituents in favour of their personal friends. To the detriment of the entire nation, and almost the whole world. I'm not trying to say the Republicans aren't corrupt in exactly the same way, but the Democrats just recently got Donald Fucking Trump elected with their backdoor, anti-democratic, bullshit shenanigans.
So when these proven liars with an axe to grind and face to save, start to tell me that the guy who embarrassed them is a traitor to his nation and an agent of them Big Scary Reds, without a shred of evidence, mind, it's really hard to take them seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it starts to come off as a conspiracy in and of itself.

       So the fact that a foreign intelligence agency has a file on the leader of one of their rival nations means Trump is working for the Reds?

       The guy's death is definitely shady, and I'd like to know more about it. But that those Commie spys have a file on the President is proof of nothing other than that they were doing their job.
Guaranteed they had a file on Hillary, and on Justin Trudeau, and Theresa May, and all the other world leaders. I can't find all the posts assuring me they all work for Putin as well.

       It definitely is a national crisis. Though, as a citizen of the world, I'd much rather Trump-turmoil contained mostly within your nation, over Clinton-chaos spread over the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those things involve Russia, Putin, or hacking. The fact that he doesn't want to put profitable boots on the ground in Russia, doesn't mean he's a puppet of the Kremlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly though; brainless Hillary-camp Democrats who can't not fall for phishing scams WHEN THEIR INFORMATION TECH PEOPLE ADVISED AGAINST SPECIFICALLY THAT, and manage to leave their highly sensitive business cell phone in a public cab do not equate to a cyber attack by those filthy Commies...
      </p>
      <p>
       We seem to be arguing separate topics.
You seem to be convinced that I'm all pro Trump, and all I'm doing is pointing out that there is no evidence of a Russian connection to the leaked information that showed everyone the true colours of the Democratic party...

       He's making you look terrible, definitely. But that's the thing. He's ruining YOUR country, making YOU look horrible. He's focused on America, rather than the rest of the world. Which is good for us.

       First one is a fair point that I was unaware of.

       As for the second one, the US has been increasing their stockpile since before the anti-proliferation treaty was signed. I assume Russia has as well, because they'd be dumb not to if the US is...
This is no different than Obama or Bush did, or what Clinton would have done. This is a systemic, American political zeitgeist problem, not a Trump problem.

       , I just don't find it likely based on what we've learned. Do you think Russia and wikileaks are working together? I'm still under the impression it was a leak and that the Russian hacking narrative was a last-ditch effort to discredit Trump. I even think it's way more likely that the oil/business deal connection makes way more sense than the Putin "blackmailing" the RNC.

       I think Russia had people leak to wikileaks so that wiki wouldn't know it was them and could say it wasn't

       I don't know why you'd doubt Putin having tons of dirt on the RNC, we know they were hacked, there's a reason it wasn't leaked like the DNC stuff

       We don't

       they were hacked. We don't even know the details of the DNC hack. I continue to believe that Seth Rich or another insider Leaked documents to wikileaks. Not sure how the phishing scam plays into it, but I really think you're giving Russia wayyy too much credit here.

       It's not.  What is behind the curtain? We know politics is a farce. Stick around, there are greater truths to be uncovered.  Politics is the very tip of the iceberg. Who controls our politicians? What's their goal? What are these think tanks working on? Do we play any part in their plans? Can we stop their plans? How do we move away from a government based on hierarchy. If you are stuck on politics you aren't asking enough questions

       We each have two realities. The one we shape and the one we share. When one affects the other, you better look out, because that's outside the bounds of the reality that you're allowed to shape. That reality is beholden to rules and facts, no matter how much you deny them.

       But again, we can deny them. I'm not sure how this isn't a truth.  You are the truth.  You can shape your existence any way you'd like.  If think people are bad and there is no way out,  like it seems you believe, then you have accepted your prison. Spiritual or not, you have a greater purpose than to merely accept your prison

       You can live in your head, but your head lives in shared reality, which can be denied with incontrovertible fact and strong correlation with an absence of credible evidence to the contrary. That second reality has rules that might even govern the first for all we know.

       Have you seen his approval ratings lately? Have you seen how young people voted? Maybe apply metrics to reddit and you'll understand why people have such problems with a guy who chose crowd size and illegal votes to be the two things he talks and cries about most for his first week? Then appoints Bannon in charge of our national security and removes the AG. Those sure sound like topics that would have been discussed non stop under Obama on this sub.

       The same polls that said Hillary had a 98% chance of winning and ohhh yea but "muh popular vote" tell me how numbers work nearly 50% of people who voted did so for Clinton or Trump, the most active sub on reddit is not just a pro Trump sub but the only sub not being heavily manipulated.

       I love how 20 minutes ago I left this comment "Next you'll tell me that 99 to 1 odds mean that the 1 is impossible and long shots are "fake news"" for another one of you folks and you come here using that exact script
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that a 2% chance, is still a chance? That's what a long shot is. That's why when you bet on a long shot you get a higher payout, it's unlikely, but not impossible.

      <p>
       The unlikely happened, do to a few thousand people across 3 states.

       "nearly 50% of people who voted did so for Clinton or Trump"

      <p>
       50% of people didn't vote for either of them? I think you're messing up your words.

       I don't see how anyone can complain in a /conspiracy forum that the biggest Cabal candidate lost. Sure you may think Trump isn't clean either... but the Bushes and Clintons hate him. That should tell you all you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary had won, this forum would just be anti-Hillary. Same difference. We just see her as a non-player at this point. There is still work to do. No one should feel the need to defend Trump's every move, but if you want to cheerlead the Cabal narrative, do it somewhere else.

       You're right. The Clintons shouldn't be let off the hook, despite being less of threat post-election. They are an international crime family and deserve jail for their crimes against humanity.

       I think Melania is from the Czech Republic or Slovakia. They used to be under Communist rule... so there's always some kind of possibility there. But Trump's first wife (Ivana) was from the same country. So maybe he just likes something about the way those women are?

       I am pretty sure they gravitate to r/conspiracy because it provides them a way of attacking and suppression any and all opposition to Lord Trump.

       Ignores the integral nationalism that the Nazis and Trump has engaged in. He paints Nazis of all people as left wing. He believes that civil rights is a fascist platform.

       You're right i guess. Being against something doesn't necessarily mean for the opposite. You post an awful lot and I have better things to do than search through thousands of comments. Almost like it's your job. 🤔

       Original comment claimed that this sub is a Trumpfest. I don't have to be anti-Trump. Just being neutral shows that you can be different without being opposed, or a supporter.

       Yea, it's like random users accuse this sub of being pro-trump but it's just that ACUUSATIONS AND NEVER anything to back it up. I think most veteran community members respect when others provide data to back up their talking points.. Also, as a 5 year community member I'll just say this.. FUCK TRUMP BUT THANK GOD THAT CORRUPT BITCH DIDNT GET IT. Why the fuck are you getting mad about TRUMP when you should be getting pissed at the powers that setup REALITY STAR DOUCHE BAG VS CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT WHORE.

       I believe for one that the US government allowed 9/11 to happen as a pretext to the war criminal invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also intrigued on how the progressive neo-liberals have aligned with the traditionalist neo-liberals and the deep state in their war against a billionaire egomaniac and his right wing hegalianist puppeteer in Bannon.
      </p>

       I am intrigued by a lot of conspiracies, not that I believe that all or even most are true. It allows a more circumspect approach to assessing issues of national  importance.

       It's a bit rich of you to call Trump supporters here Gestapo agents. At worst they are merely dupes, at best they are right to support him. I do lean towards duped, but I'm an unrepentact cynic. You have an interesting perspective but I don't quite see it. Do you agree the neo-liberals and deep state at war with him are also globalists? Are you saying his nationalism is a facade and he's in bed with them not at war? Why do you think Bannon has any power over him?

       Gestapo agents were duped too. They were also fanatical loyalists who attempted to suppress all desenters of the state at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neo-liberalism is innately a globalist economic and geo-political agenda (using its brother, neo-conservatism as its hammer)
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering how much he is attempting to meld in the private corporate apparatuses that run this country with his rule of the state, its hard to tell. At times it looks like there is conflict but at the same time he represents a lot of neo-liberal economic policies, especially on the domestic frontier. Lets see how the next year pans out before I can further go on about that statement.

        It’s just one piece of Bannon’s ideological game of chess, rewiring the media landscape to clear the path for a radical reimagining of conservative politics in line with his own nationalist agenda. The president himself, Bannon has admitted in the past, is just one piece of the puzzle. Trump is a “blunt instrument for us,” Bannon told Ken Stern for Vanity Fair last summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”
       </p>

       Trump is probably no more than a puppet at this point. It is Bannon that raises the alarm to me.

        First, I'm not a Trump supporter...but I see him as an independent who suckered the GOP and won by running as one of them. I also think he's a distraction. How so?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think we need to get it straight that Trump couldn't find his way out of a cardboard box.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a useful tool (fool) of Bannon and Pence, the real power behind the throne. His antics and buffoonery distract us from the real nasty shit those two will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again,
       <em>
        he is not independent
       </em>
       he had the full support of the Republican Party, he ran as a Republican, he is a Republican
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       an independent candidate in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the whole of the GOP, barring a handful of elected officials, is supporting him demonstrates that he is in no way independent. He is a Republican.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally would argue that the idea of him being 'independent' is simply another trick his campaign played on the American people.

       I respect your opinion and it's nicely worded out, I just don't except that this whole trump escapade has been planned, there is just too many pointless events within the narrative for anyone or any organisation to have planned this from the start. Honestly if this was all planned and executed exactly how "they" wanted it to be then I'll just bend over right now and take it up the naught from government coz man! If they are really this well oiled future proofed thinking machine with no weakness then there is no fucking hope for us peasants.

       I agree with the majority of what you are saying here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the left and right are being radicalized. Although the left is more likely to become the fascists, the right is moving right along in lockstep with other extreme right groups in other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the far right that was manipulated into insurrection in Greece and Ukraine, no? I'm not saying the same scenario will play out in the US. I'm just pointing out previous plays in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been saying from the beginning that he's most likely an oblivious tool for the elite. He's being controlled by the same people he campaigned against.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the situation is observed from a distance I see two opposing groups being pitted against each other. Even though Trump is a lightning rod for the left the anger generated is being channeled toward his supporters. It's not enough that the left has to hate Trump. They have to believe his supporters are SUBHUMANS incapable of empathy or love.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supposed "Alt-Right", on the other hand, doesn't have a lightning rod for their hatred any more in regards to a political figure. Obama, Clinton and team are out of the picture. What's left? Those in the media and Hollywood pushing the narrative regarding the perception of conservatives?

       The fact that media does NOT say one good "positive" thing about Trump should be alarming enough. Media is used to rip people apart and suck off their souls while selling corporate products to its viewers.

       These same tards have little understanding of history and what the political goals and ideals of the National-Socialist party was.  Because if they did actually read and understand history, they would find that the Nazi party ideals actually align with the progressive left. Heads would explode.
      </p>
      <p>
       This re-defining of Nazi is classic double-speak and the fools have bought into it.

       Naw. The Nazi only use the National-Socialist as a ruse for their plan of total control. That's why it is so bullshit. The elites are now using the exact same thing to fool the leftist and turn them into fascists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to see a true National-Socialist movement, the Vietnam history is a good start (and I'm not talking about the US propaganda bullshit either, reseach the actual Vietnam history through Vietnamese historian)

       "Because supposedly this subreddit has been taken over by Trump supporters."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only a half-truth. I've been around since 2009, the pre 50k sub days, and I can honestly say this sub is dead now, simply for the fact that we have to wade through so much bullshit to get to the rare good posts that it is no longer worth it. The sockpuppetry really kicked off about 2011, when the tech firms started making it packaged to order, but they kept it relatively low key and focused on front page subs (eg, not this sub as much). They had to wait to get rid of Swartz and take over reddit from the top, and in 2013 is when it really got out of hand, and it has literally been nothing but downhill for reddit and for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ever since. It's not just sockpuppets and shills, it's also just simply about popularity and numbers degrading the state of discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the old text only post days, many of us had discussions here that would rival the best posts on Hacker News. I specifically remember when we passed the 100k sub mark, and this was already becoming an issue and was being discussed. The fact of the matter is that there really aren't that many people who are have expereinced enough of the world, broken through their programming while managing to stay rational (as opposed to falling into the religious trap), so really only a handful (I'd measure it in the few thousands) have the ability to speak on the kind of issues we should be discussing here in any rational and coherent way that is conducive to intellectual discourse that encourages learning and exploration in others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even without the sockpuppetry, we have seen it happen with slashdot, with digg, and many others. Reddit is simply falling victim to the double powwow of whatever name for that phenomenon is, combined with the relatively new tech of massive sockpuppetry and shilling manipulation there is almost no hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foundation of mkultra, the manipulation of phschology for the powers that be purposes, has been cemented firmly in subsequent operation mockingbird variations shifted to take over the distribution of information on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an old school 90's hacker, the thing is that we won the 90's cryptowars and then sat back and all the blackhats turned grey/white and made lots of money during and after the dotcom boom. I think the oligarchy simply underestimated the power of the internet because they didn't understand it... but they do now, and they are about to pull out all the stops because the internet and the power of decentralized communication among the masses is the number one threat to their power schemes, but due to the rapidly evolving nature of technology it has artifically accelerated their totalitarian dystopian plans, and they are being forced to show their hand before they were ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit will fall, it is inevitable. The questions is now, what will take it's place? Voat is not good enough. Some of the blockchain based websites are intriguing but haven't manifested themselves properly yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the beauty is there is a new market about to open up for a good competitor to do it right, and the real discussion we need to be having is how to improve the voting system to prevent manipulations we have seen take over reddit. For example I like the idea of distributing upvotes/downvote ability randomly like slashdot used to, along with mod labelling like slashdot does, or perhaps only allowing limited posting until certain thresholds of community value contribution have been made, things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry bud, I've been here since the old days, and honestly, while I still open new on conspiracy every few days, there is so little substance here the sub is essentially dead, and has been that way for a while, but it is now worse than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, the one thing that could save the sub would be a massive round-table by the mods and the community on how to save the sub with large changes to what they allow. Currently their dedication to so little censorship has become their weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm reminded of the time I setup a website about saying no to censorship, which I put a bb forum up and left it open for all to use. You know what happened? It turned into a spambot home, and all the original discussion was soon drowned out by the spammers and bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, to give a small example, if it were me, I would immediately instate a rule that posts on certain subjects shown to be part of the forum sliding narrative be immediately removed, such as the one line posts that say stuff like "Disprove to me X, or Debunk Y for me, or What do yall think about Z"
      </p>
      <p>
       No spite to the mods, but I have a feeling the mods of conspiracy have probably been slowly infiltrated over the years and are not likley to take the drastic moves they need to if they wanted to save the sub, so once again, we are back at the conclusion that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The influx of trump supporters is but a small piece of the puzzle of it's death, so to simply attack just trump supporters (who aren't actually the problem when it's more the brigading Pedes of TD that are the problem) is to miss the big picture here.

       Thank you for saying this.  I was going to make a table comparing trump and hillary over nazism and I got distracted working on trasncribing George Webb's stuff.  When I get back to it, you''ll see in a nicely formatted table who is the real nazi and it's unsurprisingly hillary.  trump hasn't mass murdered people on at least 3 continents.  Trump hasn't knowingly run a blood mining program to kill all hemophiliac children (eugenics).  Trump has controlled the media and run lie after lie until it becomes true.  Trump hasn't gaslighted the public with lies within lies by hiring people to shape a grand illusion through a network of agents.  While it's true hillary isn't really a socialist, she's actually very provably a fascist corporatist, and while she's running fr office, she's blackmailing heads of state and toppling countries with weapons stolen from previously toppled countries.  Her private army is gassing innocents, splitting up families and selling the women and children into sex slavery.  She's used her vast international powers to extort money from the state to enrich her friends, all the while creating a vertically integrated supply chain of human-rights-free human labor, sex slaves and bioproducts all around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may be a part of this, but he's a passive consumer like so many others involved as investors in the defense industry.  HIllary is directly involved, being that she's a political operative for the CIA, involved in a system that is doing absolutely atrocious things all over the planet and we can prove it, many many times over.  These things I'm saying to you know may sound absurd to you, but there is proof, and though we've only seen about 5-10% of that proof, we have public statements by federal investigators that are telling us that these things are true; and we are correlating them with information by international journalists all around the world; and correlating them with mountains of evidence of the same, collected over decades by intrepid journalists who were harassed, gangstalked and eventually murdered for releasing this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit is about to hit the fan, and it will happen all-at-once.  You will see a sea change of opinion and at that point, they are going to put every CIA and FBI agent in jail and then let them out one-by-one after a detention period.  Who knows what happens to the NSA, but they will probably have half of their toys taken away

       Left wing totalitarianism is when the government controls all means of production of a country, using the control of goods and services to control the population.
Right wing totalitarianism is when government and corporations join to control all means of production of a country, using the control of goods and services to control the population.
A country can only move away from both forms of totalitarianism by  giving more control to the population.

       But I think the real problem is human nature. Some people always want more... no matter how much they already have. Doesn't matter what economic system is in place, these people use whatever advantages they have to increase their control over everybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       All long as human nature drives people to act the way they do, we'll always end up in the same situation... A tiny minority lording it over the vast majority.

       I'm just trying to keep people from redefining things. Both extremes are totalitarianism, and this country has been on the verge of Fascism for a long time before Trump got in office.

       Fascists don't go around saying they want the people to have more guns and be able to defend themselves. Fascists take guns so you can't protect yourself.

       It's still pretty good. Probably some of the people here are shills and those with whatever agenda.

       But this is still one of the few subs left where you get respect for having an imagination, asking questions and forming your own opinion without getting ridiculed and/or censored.

       Well said. I try my best to stay neutral (easier said then done) and I'm noticing big changes in the left. They seem to have adopted this hammer &amp; sickle persona. They've also been easily provoked into violence and irrational behavior over the slightest questioning of there motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems really strange to be honest. I use to consider myself a leftist for a while back when Occupy was happening. Back then the lefts anger was poised towards wall street and the big banks. Now everyone is pissed at Trump and he just got elected for fuck sakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't seem to break this conditioning though. It's like tunnel vision. What's the endgame though? Forcing all these social justice issues down everyone's throats isn't going to happen overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I have to say after watching that mayhem go down on hwndu I noticed a lot of good conversations being had on both sides. Maybe that's what needs to start happening more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any leftists reading made it this far then this is important for you to know this. You are acting like you are incapable of any compromise. By doing this you are dividing yourself from your fellow man. Trump is the elected president. He's doing exactly what he said he was going to do. Tighten security and get jobs back to America. It's been ten days and he's already got more done then Obama did in eight years. Give him a chance.

       Yes, yes &amp; yes have been thinking the exact same thing for some time. The danger lies in the vehemence of the SJW set and the backlash that could come as a result of Trump's actions. That he is supposed to play this part makes his cabinet selection (is that what you call it in US?) much easier to understand. 
That said, I think he'll have to ramp up the intolerance to non-white males if he's truly going to give the SJW set power but maybe he will and is simply working to a timeline.

       Yes. I'm neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original comment claimed that this sub is a Trumpfest. I don't have to be anti-Trump. Just being neutral shows that you can be different without being opposed, or a supporter.

       Not many people seem to be neutral though.
