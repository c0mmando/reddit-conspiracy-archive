    <div class="md"><p>Honest question OP (non-confrontational); Have you ever traveled abroad?</p>

<p>Several years ago, I went through US customs and everyone, including American citizens were walking up to a TSA/Homeland Security agent in a booth, being asked a few questions about their reason for travel, and then positioning themselves so the camera at the booth could scan their eye. This happened in 2010 and again in 2015. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is typical to every airport, but I can confirm this has been happening at JFK international airport for several years and this new bill is not creating this practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is typical for all airports. I traveled to Europe in 2012 and never had to give fingerprints or an iris scan when leaving or entering the country. Just had to answer the questions on reason for traveling. Security was pretty relaxed, they didn&#39;t even catch that I accidentally brought a small pocket knife in my carry on. In fact, I made it all through Europe and back home with it.</p>

<p>Maybe they have been doing the fingerprints and iris scan at the major airports like in NY, LA, and Miami? I really have no idea, just sharing my experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were you only travelling in the Schengen Zone? That would likely have a big effect on the amount of security. Travel between these countries is pretty relaxed. </p>

<p>The bill OP is talking about is US specific anyway but thanks for the anecdote. You&#39;re correct though, I&#39;d imagine these security measures are not part of the typical airport security experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it was only in the Schengen zone. Still amazed that the pocket knife wasn&#39;t picked up. I was sitting on a plane wondering why I couldn&#39;t have nail clippers among other things, but I&#39;m sitting in my seat with a knife.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of talk about this... well, a lot of people <em>mentioning</em> it but very little discussion.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to discuss.  </p>

<ul>
<li>If you travel abroad you will be subject to this sort of thing already.<br/></li>
<li>If you have to work with children, you are subject to this sort of thing already.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two clauses alone cover a lot of people.  It&#39;s not tracking, it&#39;s identification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your assessment. If this was scan the whole body so your physique could he tracked anywhere you travel that happens to have cameras, that would be a different story.</p>

<p>To add to your points, most people requiring a professional license through consumer affairs are already livescanned (fingerprinted for record) i was 15 years ago. This is also not new practice.</p>

<p>The only difference between a passport with your picture (which is scanned and logged during international travel already) is that iris scans and fingerprints cannot be easily faked. If we stuck with passports only, it would still be tracked like it is now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biometric reader thing is more pervasive than they let on and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to track terrorists. I remember way back when Wikileaks first made a name for itself releasing diplomatic cables there was a message ordering all our embassies to scan biometric data of foreign dignitaries as well...My personal theory is that it&#39;s to track the movements of nonhumans living among us.</p>
