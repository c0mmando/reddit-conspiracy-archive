The easiest thing for me to do was just go to my post history and link directly to the Correct The Record announcement which I submitted in a few different subs on reddit. </p>

<p>Low and behold the websites are all gone.</p>

<p>Here is one working archive.org screen grab that stuck around:

<p>just thought this was possibly interesting to some in this sub. </p>

<p>Sidenote: I have also made multiple posts regarding companies that were paid by Media Matters, Correct the Record and American Bridge (among other Brock groups) to Manipulate and direct online discussion/message.</p>

<p>That sub may now be closed so here is a copy of the text/links from this post</p>

<p>Edit: please forgive the tone.  Was trying to write something that grabs attention while offering a sense of urgency and dash of sophomoric humor. And had just got done reading nothing but comments in politics that just said ctr or shill, but nothing else.  And that only limits discourse and feeds the spam type subs. Bit of an info post with some heavy handed venting and just a <em>small dash of foul language</em>, plus actually verifiable connections.</p>

<p>-Apologies. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll show you how to start, its up to you if you want to use it to keep looking. This is just an example, but careful its actually using your brain more than screaming shill shill shill, or getting triggered over some fucking chicken tendies type comment.</p>

<p>Im just tired as fuck of the dumbass accusations that fuck-tards on all sides are just parroting, like some shitty boys choir, singing &quot; A song of shilling, redemption song, all I ever need is to call some one shill&quot;.</p>

<p><del><strong>fuckin links are broken so I need to upload screen shots. Bear with</strong></del> Think there fixed now</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Come the fuck on, actually do something.</p></li>
<li><p>Look through <a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml">FEC records here</a></p></li>
<li><p>You can find <a href="http://i.imgur.com/94kK6FK.jpg">SUPER-PAC info like this</a></p></li>
<li><p>Which <a href="http://i.imgur.com/V2Jl8qq.jpg">allows you to find records like this</a> in the fillings tab</p></li>
<li><p>Which has <a href="http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandCmteFilingsPDFDownload.do?imageNumber=201601319004983110&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pdfURL=docquery.fec.gov/pdf/110/201601319004983110/201601319004983110.pdf">pdf&#39;s like this</a>... in the year tabs <strong>Go ahead and do a ctrl+F for Blue State for example</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you do that then you can see that PACs like Correct the Record pay other companies like ...<a href="https://www.bluestatedigital.com/about">Blue State Digital</a></p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>STFU Southernjeb you stupid paranoid bernie bro, theres no fucking CTR shills on reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, your&#39;e partially right,  B/c CTR (and SUPER-PACS like them) pay other companies to do it for them. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rxTB3DK.jpg">These companies sit around</a> and strategery (<em>wink</em>) how to hit all types of people. Some on reddit, some on twitter, some on facebook. Some through goddamn viral marketing</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bluestatedigital.com/jobs">And they&#39;re always fuckin hiring...all kinds of jobs, some are regular as fuck, others well fuck, you figure it out</a> </p>

<p>Hell, some of em might actually be those fuckboys in different subs screamin </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mah check is late&quot; or &quot;I just triggered 3 more bernie bros and 7 jakes, bonus this week for me, tendies for days&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But its not likely. See the strategy is to manipulate the fucking group. Steer the site or narrative. And they sit the fuck around and plan on how to do this shit. Just get one thing to catch on, this fucking meme, these fucking words, this fucking distraction.</p>

<p>For fucks sake it was right there in the DNC leaks, when their spit balling about bernie being an atheist and not a real jew. Fuckin rumors and distractions. The DNC tried to do that shit through the media, this fucking online shill thing is the same goddamn prinicple.</p>

<p>Is that all this company does. 
<strong>no</strong></p>

<p>They do all kinds of shit, and they damn sure arent gonna fucking post </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Manipulate the fuck out of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></strong>&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On their &quot;about us &quot; page</p>

<p>They do legit shit too, fundraising, messaging, email coordination.</p>

<p>And I can garun-fuckin-tee you that this isnt the only company. This is just one of the &quot;prettier&quot; ones. </p>

<p>Theres plenty others for all types of campaigns, that hire some sad motherfuckers who just need a job/cash, to do this shit. The dont care, they need money. Fuck I was like that too before. You do fuck-ass shit jobs to make fucking ends meet while you look for something better.</p>

<p>All Im saying is, here is one way you can start looking for actual shills. Yall can figure the fuckin rest out. But Im tired of motherfuckers just typin shill and CTR all the while feeding the dumbass narrative that there&#39;s some <strong>paranoid</strong> sore losers about. </p>

<p>Well you know what? My main candidate fucking lost, thats fuckin democracy. (maybe...Kinda....sorta...fuck it.. yall can look up your shit and form your own opinions on that, both on actual winning and the differences between democracy and a republic). My candidate losing isnt why I look at athis shit though.</p>

<p>You know what I dont think democracy is? Manipulating online discourse and perception through dirty fucking tricks, funded by big money and special interests that should never have been involved in the first motherfucking place. Because we are still an &#39;internet young&#39; society, meaning theres still a majority of dumb mother fuckers online that will believe any goddamned thing they see on a website, and cant have the presence of mind to stop and be skeptical. </p>

<p>Oh you know the fuck what? It aint paranoid if it is fucking happening. </p>

<p>Classic example I&#39;ve posted before and will do so again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201604159012556802">$13,000 to Angelo Carusone</a> for digital and online consulting, (same guy who created the massive twitter effort <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/angelo-carusone-media-matters-fox-news-glenn-beck_n_793817.html">to remove sponsors from Glen Beck</a>, the leader of the “Stop Rush <a href="http://action.mediamatters.org/stop_rush">Limbaugh</a> Campaign(that source is the motherfuckers own website btw)” , vice president of Media Matters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock#Media_Matters_for_America">A David Brock creation for ‘news’</a> and a general online attack dog.</p></li>
<li><p>Like at this fucking website... <a href="https://medium.com/@GoAngelo">https://medium.com/@GoAngelo</a>   where he can push this shit out to tons of &#39;affiliates who just have to log in. I mean fuck, once again the DNC leaks talked about &quot;medium&quot; posts in some of their more ass-fuckery shit....well, thats just one way they do it.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Are there shills on reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of fucking course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you going to find them by replying, &quot;SHILLLLL&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>come the fuck on, no you dummy. Shit, short of social hacking some accounts you aint gonna find shit. So do it smarter.  Here&#39;s one way, theres a fuck ton more. Figure it the fuck out.</p>

<p>And if you think CTR is the only one doing this shit then your dumb as fuck. A) theres about 3 other pacs affiliated with American Bridge, at least, that do this shit, and B) both sides of the fucking aisle do it, and these goddamn pacs on every fucking cause.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll call that shit when I see it too.  I just hate David &#39;cum-dumpster&#39; Brock more than most and think ole Hilldawg has some major fucking character flaws to put it mildly.</p>

<p>Plus, ya know <strong>FUCK SUPER-PACS &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; MOTHERFUCK CITIZENS UNITED</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tl:DR</strong> Correct The Record officers were paying themselves from PAC funds and employing h1B visa to hire cheaper labor in the tech sector to do online stuff.....</p>

<p>&quot;Luca Strategy Group, LLC&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Paid $30,000 on 3/31/2016</li>
<li>Address: 3007 19th St S, Arlington Virginia  22204 (its a random house)</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the Commonwealth of Virginia &quot; <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S6079737">State Corporation Commission&quot; records</a> This LLC was incorporated on 3/16/2016, two weeks prior to payment by Correct the Record.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201604159012556802">$13,000 to Angelo Carusone</a> (for digital and online consulting, same guy who created the twitter craze to remove sponsors from Glen Beck, or </p></li>
<li><p>$100,000 to the <a href="http://thefranklinforum.org/media-communication-basics/">Franklin Forum</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any one feel like crowd sourcing this search out and figuring out who got paid $30,000 and why?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> more weird shit, another group with no web page and payments to a house in Virginia</p>

<p><strong>Forward Solution Strategy Group:</strong>
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;vendor=Forward+Solution+Strategy+Group">https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;vendor=Forward+Solution+Strategy+Group</a></p>

<p><a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201604159012556720">Paid: 19092.42 on 3/16/16</a></p>

<p>has no webpage. Payment was sent to a house in Virginia. People who own the house have something to do with work visas and H1B</p>

<p><strong>this company has the same listed address of record as Sky Technologies, Llc which holds 22 H1B visas apparently ALL for &quot;computer programmers or IT positions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.myvisajobs.com/Visa-Sponsor/Sky-Technologies/493075_Salary.htm">http://www.myvisajobs.com/Visa-Sponsor/Sky-Technologies/493075_Salary.htm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now why the fuck is Correct the Record paying these two LLCs at home addresses, and why is Sky Technologies hiring a ton of H1B computer programmers?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>And why is Forward Solution Strategy Group incorporated in Arkansas.</p></li>
<li><p>look it up here: <a href="http://www.arkansascorporates.com/corp/415700.html">http://www.arkansascorporates.com/corp/415700.html</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ohh even more interesting the person listed is none other than the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CORRECT THE RECORD....</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://correctrecord.org/correct-the-record-executive-director-isaac-wright-wins-40-under-40-award/">http://correctrecord.org/correct-the-record-executive-director-isaac-wright-wins-40-under-40-award/</a> </li>
