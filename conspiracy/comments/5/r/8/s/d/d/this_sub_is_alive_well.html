       You may think this is a "conspiracy" sub and lament the recent shift toward more political discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you would be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a "free speech" and "truth" sub which is centered around conspiracies and other open-minded subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because "free speech" is being threatened right now for conservatives, they are coming here.  Because "fake news" is being heavily promulgated right now, people are coming here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means this sub is ALIVE &amp; WELL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the free speech alive, keep the back-and-forth discourse alive, keep
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       Maybe you can feel it, but something is happening in America.  Whether or not you agree with him, Trump is uniting people together under his MAGA ideals.  United people are dangerous people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think The Establishment is
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       pissed off and throwing constant hissy fits?  Because they recognize the danger of a united people and are doing their best to splinter and fracture this unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you agree with Trump or not, he has a cohesive agenda that he is following.  You can see how the unity he's creating around this agenda (again, whether or not you agree with it is irrelevant) is rendering The Establishment's division and control tactics futile.  They must regain control.  Time will tell if they will, but they usually get their way...

       Aren't you making the case for people

       being divided and this idea of "unity" is a fiction you are creating that is not even supported by the evidence you are using?

       The other half of this population

       the travel ban. Isn't this the definition of a divide?

      <p>
       I  guess I am just saying that your argument here is not really very persuasive in support of a secretly unified country that the MSM is just not presenting to us.

       The division is aimed at breaking up this unity

       I pointed out how media is framing the travel ban as this thing no one supports when in fact polls show roughly a 50/50 split which seems to bolster my point of unity.

       weird. When I see Trump's tweets to "haters and losers" and mocking anyone opposed to him (other than putin of course, or duerte) it's his words that divide, yet here you are ignoring them and blaming the media
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like you're just repeating his speech in front of the CIA, where he had paid folks there to clap for him as he lied about his crowd size, lied about time magazine covers, lied about calling the intel community "nazi germany"
      </p>

       How strange that you have to ignore all of his actions in order to defend him

       I hope you right man, from this side of the pond (UK) we only see the SHMEDIA footage and it aint looking like unity from here. maybe you can find us some better sources of footage to go on coz I'd love to believe that the divide and conquer tactic is being used in America

       Oh, I can feel it. There are many people in this sub who think Trump is a plant, or was the plan all along, and while I surely understand why they feel that way, I respectfully disagree. He isn't the savior that his cheerleaders think he is, and he isn't the demonic demagogue his detractors believe. Well, he is a demagogue haha. But we are used to having to read between the lines around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was compelling objective evidence of some of our subjects they wouldn't be conspiracy theories. So, we have to exercise a lot of discernment. And on the subject of Trump I infer from the radical convulsions of the media, a well established enemy of free thinkers, the he is, if nothing else, antithetical to their interests. And in that regard I can at least be positively interested in what he does.  Kind of along the lines of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".
      </p>
      <p>
       But, like all allies of expediency, the sword can cut both ways. And his supporters need to be especially vigilant about what he says and does. And remain as objective as is possible. Because the situation right now could very easily slide into authoritarian dictatorship. Where people will start nodding along to "you have to do the wrong thing to do the right thing".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, despite his obvious subversion by interests of Israel, I think he wants America to be successful. And I think his narcissistic nature, as his reputation is now completely attached to the reputation of our country, can serve us very well here.  But we need to be hawks.

       They wanted to rule over us by the likes of Soros and the Chinese government. And they did for the last 30 years. No more. Our military and the Donald have effectively pulled a coup. Our allies are any one who wants freedom and liberty for their sovereign people. We provide the arms. Our list of allies is impressive, to say the least.

       I could do without the pro-Trump posts. Objectivity is good. Posts with an obvious bias, not so much. The deluge of recent pro- posts only serve to muddy the waters.

       What makes this sub great is that, unlike T_D, there can be Trump posts with back-and-forth discourse.  This sub is NOT an echo chamber and that's what makes it ALIVE &amp; WELL.

       Everyone is too serious. Sometimes a joke needs to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, why build a wall, when we have drone technology already in place. Simply declare that illegals crossing the border without docs, are considered enemy combatants, and drone strike them. No wall needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, what about Mexican Cartel tunneling? Those guys can build, with the aid of GPS, tunnels to reach into maximum security prisons. How is a wall going to deter underground tunneling efforts?

       It's not just this sub, it's literally everywhere you turn that's filled with divisive political opinions. I can't go anywhere on the Internet to escape it. Car blogs feel the need to comment, sports blogs the same. No TV channel is safe. It has invaded our lives, like it or not.

       We've been taking on new subscribers at a rate of &gt;15,000 a month for the last few months, mostly refugees of the unprecedented pro-Hillary media bias of the 2016 US presidential election.
