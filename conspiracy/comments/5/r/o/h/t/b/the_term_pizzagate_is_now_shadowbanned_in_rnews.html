       Reddit is a corporation and openly censors people. It's their right to censor, I don't believe they're open about it and should communicate that they are indeed censoring but it's their right as a private corp. You agreed to the terms and conditions, you did not have to, nobody forced you.

       No because the problem is that people like you conveniently want to consider "free speech" as a legal matter in order to further your objectives of censorship. When in reality free speech is a
       <strong>
        principle
       </strong>
       that people have fought and died for and IMO if things continue down this path they will fight and die for it again. If the founding fathers drafted in the constitution in our corporate slave state, they would have included that in the first amendment. That's not what the world was back then. It's what the world is now. People will continue to fight for their rights to say what they want to say, spread information, hold power accountable, and be free. Fuck the kiddos like you who try to defend the slave masters cracking the intellectual whips on us all.

       Like I hate academics but this type of defaulting to the law in ethical discussions is considered by psychologists to be low-level-mentality, something akin to the thought process of a child. Thinking that "the law" is at all relevant with regards to a discussion about what is right or wrong is just stupid and a waste of your breath / bandwidth you're typing on

       You seem to be misunderstanding me. I don't want them to censor, it's wrong, and I'm glad you shed light on this. But you can't be so naïve to think that it isn't their freedom to ban or censor what they see fit

       Free speech is not the only right we value in this society. We also value to right to private property. If I'm holding a dinner party at my home to host intellectual conversation and you come in and start ranting about conspiracy theories, I'm perfectly within my right to kick you out of my home.
      </p>

       Reddit has invited its users to participate here, and it is perfectly within its right (not just legally, but ethically, if you also believe in property rights) to kick anyone out.

       Not that you'll believe me because "CTR shill hurr durr", but I am not a democrat. I have never once been registered as a democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, the only reason I brought up Donald or the repubs is because you took it upon yourself to brand me a leftist, when in reality both side are fucking awful. Also because you are a Trump supporter, and you're parroting Republican talking points.

       He's saying reddit is a privately owned company where free speech is not protected. To operate on their forums, you must abide by their standards. For the same reasons, if you're at an establishment I run and say something I don't agree with, I can kick you out and be well within my rights.

       I spiritually identify as a pizzagate.  I bath myself in hand made organic small batch locally grown sustainable pizza sauce thrice daily. I exclusively eat Hawaiian pizza at every meal with organic locally grown and hand milled wheat, home cultured yeast collected locally, premature pineapples grown in my greenhouse, and ham from ritualistically sacrificed newborn piglets. Five times a day, every day, i practice the holy ritual of dough spinning, while chanting the only holy prayers of Pizzagatism. I work tirelessly scouring the corners of the internet seeking out these neer-do-wells and evidence of their cults. I have infiltrated their secret network of PizzaShops by mastering the art of Pizza making. Laboring along side these monsters weighs heavily upon my soul; yet, i persist for all I live to do is see pedophilic-satan-worshipping-spirit-cooking-degenerates cast forth and exposed to the cleansing rays of public shame to be judged by all of us, and forced to accept the punishments for their crimes.

       Your thinking is too black and white. It's possible to be against some things that certain corporations do, while also supporting other things. Being blindly anti-something is not a constructive position to take.

      <p>
       In this case, yes a company should have the right to pick and choose how they wish to be represented. This is hardly "lauding corporate dictatorship."

       If you wish to support the rights of corporations to exert the tremendous social power they have over the dissemination of information in todays political climate then you'll be one of the people we can all look back at and blame when we're living in a state of brainless slavery, full of tightly controlled information, propaganda, ministries of truth, ect. Period. There won't be any denying that you part of the cancer before it metastasized.

       No I'm not. The point is that free speech is a
       <strong>
        principle
       </strong>
       not just a law or amendment. Do you think
       <strong>
        the people that died to give us the first amendment
       </strong>
       simple said "Oh well there's no such thing as a first amendment, therefore I shouldn't fight to protect free speech". Do you think that? Because if that's how they thought we wouldn't have any such rights today. It's because of mentalities like yours that tyranny is able to creep up on us all. It's because of people like you that humans are a controlled species.

       The unfortunate truth is you are both 100% correct. But I do think you could have done without the first part, he really wasn't defending anything and actually condemned it ethically. No one is disagreeing it's fucked up. They are using this site as a means of silencing dissent. It's not going to work though a lot has happened this week, and I have a feeling more is happen right this very moment. Just keep spreading it, we're going to win this.

       People in this thread seem to want to defend them, apparently without recognizing that they are the ultimate gate keepers of information in our society. They've been imbued with an awesome power to effect change and either educate or indoctrinate the masses. Anyone who claims we should not hold corporate power accountable in terms of their social power is living in some kind of fantasy world and unfortunately will feel the negative consequences of their own rhetoric on a personal level eventually.

       The OP was banned for extreme abusiveness (in the thread and the modmail) and will be unavailable to reply as he's completely unable to be rational, the whole thread was a shitshow and was removed.

       Well I had reservations about removing it but if OP is unable to respond to questions or even attacks it seemed unfair to leave it up. Not sure if it was the right decision but it was a decision :/
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW I spent 10 minutes trying to ask OP to calm down in modmail and then I'd gladly unban him but he just kept on ranting and becoming increasingly unreasonable. Eventually he decided he didn't care about getting banned if his right to rant and be confrontational and abusive wasn't respected and here we are. Ho hum.

       Thanks for the reply, obviously I'm not trying to defend abusive behavior but it seems a little bit worrying that all his original information, that I didn't think was breaking any rules, was removed because of abusive comments. Why not just remove the comments?

       He couldn't reply in the thread and would probably have sent abusive PMs instead and got Admin suspended this time.

       Immediately reposted without the term "pizzagate" -

        http://imgur.com/9C197KH
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's shadowbanning of a term. It's silent. It's subtle. Most people don't realize it's happened to them. You don't get any notifications. You can only know about it if you sign out. I'm not that into the pizzagate scene but I can't stand the clear censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd probably be better off repeating the experiment so it's your content, up to you though.

       You seem to be misunderstanding me. I don't want them to censor, it's wrong, and I'm glad you shed light on this. But you can't be so naïve to think that it isn't their freedom to ban or censor what they see fit

       Free speech is not the only right we value in this society. We also value to right to private property. If I'm holding a dinner party at my home to host intellectual conversation and you come in and start ranting about conspiracy theories, I'm perfectly within my right to kick you out of my home.
