    <div class="md"><p>No because the problem is that people like you conveniently want to consider &quot;free speech&quot; as a legal matter in order to further your objectives of censorship. When in reality free speech is a <strong>principle</strong> that people have fought and died for and IMO if things continue down this path they will fight and die for it again. If the founding fathers drafted in the constitution in our corporate slave state, they would have included that in the first amendment. That&#39;s not what the world was back then. It&#39;s what the world is now. People will continue to fight for their rights to say what they want to say, spread information, hold power accountable, and be free. Fuck the kiddos like you who try to defend the slave masters cracking the intellectual whips on us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spiritually identify as a pizzagate.  I bath myself in hand made organic small batch locally grown sustainable pizza sauce thrice daily. I exclusively eat Hawaiian pizza at every meal with organic locally grown and hand milled wheat, home cultured yeast collected locally, premature pineapples grown in my greenhouse, and ham from ritualistically sacrificed newborn piglets. Five times a day, every day, i practice the holy ritual of dough spinning, while chanting the only holy prayers of Pizzagatism. I work tirelessly scouring the corners of the internet seeking out these neer-do-wells and evidence of their cults. I have infiltrated their secret network of PizzaShops by mastering the art of Pizza making. Laboring along side these monsters weighs heavily upon my soul; yet, i persist for all I live to do is see pedophilic-satan-worshipping-spirit-cooking-degenerates cast forth and exposed to the cleansing rays of public shame to be judged by all of us, and forced to accept the punishments for their crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I had reservations about removing it but if OP is unable to respond to questions or even attacks it seemed unfair to leave it up. Not sure if it was the right decision but it was a decision :/  </p>

<p>FWIW I spent 10 minutes trying to ask OP to calm down in modmail and then I&#39;d gladly unban him but he just kept on ranting and becoming increasingly unreasonable. Eventually he decided he didn&#39;t care about getting banned if his right to rant and be confrontational and abusive wasn&#39;t respected and here we are. Ho hum.</p>

<p>Just made this post - <a href="http://imgur.com/846ZO1T">http://imgur.com/846ZO1T</a>  </p>

<p>Signed out to make sure it didn&#39;t get picked up by a spam bot, turned out it did - <a href="http://imgur.com/a9tjikq">http://imgur.com/a9tjikq</a>  </p>

<p>Immediately reposted without the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; - <a href="http://imgur.com/9C197KH">http://imgur.com/9C197KH</a>  </p>

<p>It&#39;s shadowbanning of a term. It&#39;s silent. It&#39;s subtle. Most people don&#39;t realize it&#39;s happened to them. You don&#39;t get any notifications. You can only know about it if you sign out. I&#39;m not that into the pizzagate scene but I can&#39;t stand the clear censorship.  </p>

<p>You&#39;d probably be better off repeating the experiment so it&#39;s your content, up to you though.</p>
