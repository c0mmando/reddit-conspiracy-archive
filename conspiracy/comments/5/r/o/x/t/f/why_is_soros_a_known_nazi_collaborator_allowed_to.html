       I watched this and he claimed he was a spectator of their stuff being stolen and he was not the one stealing it. Him not being there would not have changed the outcome so he didn't feel guilty.

       "if I wasn't doing it somebody else would be doing it anyhow"
       <br/>
       That's it right there. If the only way you can justify your job is by saying "well if I wasn't doing it somebody else would be" then that makes you an asshole and your job a bad job. I think I remember a comedian addressing this (bill burr maybe?) but I couldn't find the link online so couldn't provide a laugh to go along with it. But damn.

       This does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       match the narrative you presented:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[25] Jewish children were barred from attending school by the Nazis, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat ("Jewish Council") which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: "The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper.... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, "You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported."[26]
       </p>
       <p>
        Soros did not return to that job; his family purchased documents to say that they were Christians, thereby allowing them to survive the war. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the fascist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14 year old alone, the official took with him while he inventoried a rich Jewish family's estate, though Soros did not take part. Tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and George would later write that 1944 had been "the happiest [year] of his life," for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[27][28] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest in which Soviet and German forces fought house to house through the city.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In fact it supports the opposite narrative. He seemed to subvert Nazism by warning Jews facing deportation. He remembered it as the best days of his life because he witnessed his father's anti-Nazi heroism.

       Maybe because it doesn't take a 14-min video to make a case for his point about Soros being a Nazi collaborator in his youth. 30 sec to a couple of minutes tops. The fact that he's unable to point out a specific section of the video or even state something like "It starts here" is telling of the fact that maybe the video doesn't contain the relevant facts. Maybe someone who goes in with preconceived notions of Soros will get whatever they feel like out of the video providing basically a
       <em>
        confirmation bias.
       </em>
       Someone more neutral or skeptical does not get the same information out because it isn't there in the first place. Changing the narrative to someone isn't interested because they don't want to watch a 13-min video isn't the right way to discuss this. Much like if someone asks me why I think the earth is round and not flat, I'm not going to give them a 2 hour youtube documentary on space, geography and cartography, I'm going to try to state my argument in a couple of paragraphs or cite a short read. Such as a wiki section or two.

       From what I've seen when people throw rambling youtube videos in the past is that it's poorly researched, heavily edited, difficult to pass along and discuss, and worse, sometimes completely outright false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've learned to value crisp written sources with citations better than youtube videos with annotations. I also find it suspicious when people think that a succinct question cannot be answered somewhat succinctly and instead require me to waste 15 minutes of my time. I told you -- there's going to be lots of things to look at and pretend to be convinced if you already started off assuming things. That's not how proof should work. You cannot say, hey, go see this hour long documentary to answer a simple question.

       It's a short clip from the show 60 Minutes where George Soros is being personally interviewed. Not a rambling YouTuber. How are you not getting this? Come back to me when you either watch it, or decide put some effort into your shilling.

       Dude, you're some 20 year old who barely knows anything about what's going on. Don't call me a shill. But yes, I could've probably paid attention to it instead of responding to you all and trying to change your minds. I just thought the latter was more worthy, but I think you've demonstrated to me how sorely mistaken I was in assuming good faith.

       Soros is a piece of shit and it has nothing to do with being Jewish. He doesn't believe in G-d. Last time I checked that was a pretty basic requirement for anyone that wants to take Talmud seriously or have anything to do with real Judaism. For shame.

       These are false. Not correct translation not even close. I know how to read Hebrew and aramaic, intercourse with a child is never permitted and a person gets lashes as minimal punishment. Killing is never allowed...it's in the "ten commandments" that's given...G-d is angry with the Jews many times, hence the destruction of the Holy Temple, many exiles and genocides. Your list is literally a joke of horrible translations. It's not even worth going through half of them it is so laughable.

       I don't hate Jews because their ancestors were rapists and murderers, I simply wish modern Jews and Muslims would denounce their religion for what it is, evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to play the game where the Talmud doesn't say you can do whatever you want to a gentile, then let's focus on the Old Testament, where it says to commit genocide, you can buy your rape victim, stone the sinner, take sex slaves, plunder cities, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       How am I supposed to take the ten commandments seriously, when God immediately commands genocide after giving the commandments?

       Face it, Abrahamic religions are archaic, evil religions written by barbaric men who had no business talking about righteousness.

       I do understand and hear what you are saying. I'm not speaking for Muslims because their "holy" book is completely fabricated and written by an angry murdering rapist (easy to read about him and his life, and he made the stuff up as an illiterate in a cave without being able to repeat it even creating multiple versions of his own book). I would like to answer your questiok by referring to one part because I don't have time to type this up on my phone. Let me discuss the part about raping, enslaving, and killing POWs. For one you need to understand that you can't understand the Torah without the oral explanation which was given to Moses and he taught to everyone. For example the Torah says we must slaughter animals as He taught us...well I have never seen a detailed Bible passage on proper slaughter of animals. This is because you need oral Torah to understand anything. Reading the Bible alone is like looking at artwork and trying to interpret it without hearing what it means from the artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so with that out of the way I will continue, though I can't force you to take me seriously, this stuff is taught by our sages and explained in rashis commentary on chumash. To understand the stuff about war, you have to realize that we Jews do not hold by this stuff anymore and are completely forbidden, as times have changed and the authorities in our religion understand that rape and killing is bad...duh..we aren't savages. I've never seen a religious group of Jews raping and murdering...because we are forbidden to both by the Torah and by the rabbi's. But in context I'm assuming you are talking about the Canaanite wars that occurred as the Israelites were entering the holy Land. This is something that also perplexed me when I first learned it from simply reading the passages. So over 3000 years ago and even today war and killing alters a person's way of thinking normally, and I'm not saying it's good but it's a reality. When G-d says you need to go destroy a tribe of people because they are evil and beyond the point of no return (we are talking about societies that were relatively lawless that were actually involved in infant sacrifice, raped, murdered, and did pretty much every vile thing imaginable) these nations were the entire reason the G-d needed to create a specific nation that would bring godliness back into the world. These nations were warned before the war started that they had to stop or they would be destroyed. Pretty much they would say no so the israelites would do as commanded by their creator even if they had no desire to kill, and they only did it because they were commanded. There are places in the world that are holier and more set aside than others, and that land is one of them. Think like it the inner sanctuary of a holy temple where people pray and give charity, but then some groups of drunken racists decide they are going to set up camp right in the middle of the temple and start raping the common folk...it's not what Hashem wanted on his holy land anymore.  The spoils of war is just a reality of the time they lived in. Today we don't have slaves because it is frowned upon but back then you would take non warriors as servants (better word than slaves as you were not allowed to harm slaves and had to take care of them) and even though I'm not proud of it, all societies had servants back then. But you can read about ancient Jewish treatment of servants and slaves if you want and you will see it is very different than what you think. On to the stuff about being able to "take" women. I don't know the last time you were part of an ancient war but the men became rather viscious at times.  According to the sages, G-d added this not because he desired for men to rape, but as a reality clause saying I dont want you to do this, but if you do you are not going to have to die or get some sort of extreme punishment, though IT WAS EXTREMELY FROWNED UPON, AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOLY PEOPLE. pretty much if you were that guy, you looked like a total asshole and you were going to lose a lot of your friends, no matter how crazy war fighting made you. These were righteous human beings. It if you don't want to believe me you don't have to....the Torah has nothing to do with the Jews directly. It is a book that is established as an authoritative book and it then delves into all the laws that Jews must keep in the holy land. So it's main purpose today is for us to learn Talmud and derive the laws for conducting our lives and connection to the creator. The creator revealed himself to the nation of over two million people simultaneously, never to be repeated to any other nation. Then he said, these are my laws.

       There will come a point, when you realize the Torah and the Talmud, are just books written by racial supremacists, who wrote a book condoning their own colonialist agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pagans, the Catholics, Judaism, Islam, all religions based around plundering cities and colonialism. Without a religion condoning colonialism, groups wouldn't have expanded and claimed the dominance that they historically have fought over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If pagan sacrifice is magic, then what is Jewish sacrifice? Why would a God want blood? Why would God get off on the burning of flesh? Why would god want genocide? How many people have been burned, crucified, or stones because Yahweh said so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third party perspective is all I have to offer, as an outsider looking at a book that details how to treat slaves, how to prepare a blood sacrifice, and the rules of plundering, it's the very same as Islam, but just different song and dance. 
I'm not saying Jews are blood ritualists, or that Jews condone the Old Testament, I'm just condoning the religion itself like any other ideology based around what I consider evil.

       The problem is I don't understand what you are saying. The Torah specifically talks about pagans and how they worshipped Molech in Canaan which would come to be known as the Holy Land. Worship of Molech involves child sacrifice, plain and simple. This was an abomination in the Creator's eyes, whether or not you are cool with it, and He said, hey Israelites, this is the land I promised to your forefathers and these people hijacked its special attributes and are using them for evil. Go destroy them and reclaim your land. Any of them that aren't willing to leave or change their ways, kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the reasons G-d asks for animal sacrifices is because it makes the service a physical reality. If a person sins by violating the Sabbath for example, he must bring a specific sin offering. G-d, an infinite non physical being derives no personal benefit from a sacrifice, however the act gives the sinner the ability to cause himself a loss to help recognize the severity of his mistake, giving G-d the opportunity to forgive him for the transgression and heal their relationship. All service is for the good of the worshiper, not the deity. That is the opposite of mist pagan religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't know where you get your info, but as far as I have learned from Jewish and non Jewish sources, pagans today still sacrifice and drink blood and kill for the sake of killing, kill for the sake of raising corrupt spirits that are here in the universe. It exists and is forbidden. G-d doesn't want any flesh or blood or death personally, as it pains him to see his creations suffer. But they have brought this suffering upon themselves. At some point they reach so much corruption as the Canaanite nations did, that they are too stubborn to return to being good moral people. At this point they still must suffer if they remain alive, as that is the nature of Divine justice. But through Devine mercy he has them die instead so they don't continue to bring more suffering upon themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I clarify something else? I'm glad to talk about this stuff as long as people don't try to personally attack me but instead attack my argument.

       The whole  "God told us to kill you because he told us we're the superior race" isn't holy,  just men making stories to absolve themselves of guilt, stories meant to inspire youth to kill. God doesn't only condone genocide,  he condones taking virgins as sex slaves, plundering cities,  and slavery.

       Killing animals for our sins,  is magic,  just like Catholic magic where telling a man your sins somehow absolves you from them, or communion magic where bread becomes flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Yahweh allows genocide,  slavery,  forced marriage,  rape,  he loves the smell of burning flesh,  he wants animal sacrifices,  from an outsider perspective,  makes Judaism look like devil worship.  Christianity is no better,  as it seeks to validate the evil system and the New testament also allows slavery to happen.

       People back in that time,  made religions around colonialism,  as a means of justifying colonialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justifying the Torah is the same as justifying the Quran, at some point you have to justify raping twelve year old girls,  honor killings,  colonialism,  polygamy,  and magic thinking.

       nobody said anything about superior races. It was pretty simple what I said: They were a really depraved people (think like a nation of comet pingpongers) and the Creator decided they were beyond the point of repentence, so He said, go kill them.  He doesn't like it.  He really doesn't like when people have to die, they are His creations, but sometimes people are really evil.  You know that people are fucked up and they have to die sometimes.  That is a reality.  Wasn't really asking your opinion on the matter or what you thought about slavery or your knowledge of 1300 BC economics or magic.  It's simple, G-d makes people to be good, people bad, people need to die.  They are not sold as sex slaves, I don't know why people make this up.  Jews can't just have sex with people they aren't married to, it's forbidden.  Plundering cities is something that is often done when you have one group of people trying to trick another group of people into sinning and turning their creator against them.  I see why this bothers us with our modern day mentalities, but if you don't like G-d because he allowed for an evil group of people to be plundered, I can't help you.
      </p>

       I guess gold should be left for wild animals to use?  I mean I don't really think we can judge, as we have never been tasked to go destroy a city of evil villains.  If it looks like devil worship to you, I can't fix that, it sounds like you should probably actually learn about the service in the Holy Temple before you judge it.   Nobody ever said raping girls that are 12 is ever ok either, though I know what you are referencing, and again, it's being used out of context.  Rape is forbidden.  In the rare case that it did happen, it was dealt with harshly.   If the Creator of the universe sets aside a piece of land and says, this land is for you and your children, you have the right to say ok, thanks, even some other people don't like it.  You can argue about it all you want and call it colonialism, but it was a decree not just saying you should live here, it was you must live here to fulfill your destiny.  Learn about it yourself, don't just read comments by some haters before you judge.  If you don't want to take the time to do that, I don't blame you, but you shouldn't just make accusations without doing an honest investigation.

       My argument is that Judaism is not inspired by God,  as the Torah and the Talmud condone slavery, among a slew of other immoral actions like taking girls as plunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Torah,  the Talmud,  the Quran,  the New Testament,  all contain objectively immoral precepts, therefore none of them are inspired by God, or at least a benevolent intelligent one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a man has higher moral reasoning than a God,  that God is no better than a man,  guilty of sin and imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yahweh is imperfect and immoral if he condones slavery,  Allah is imperfect and immoral if he commands murder,  man is immoral if they follow an immoral God.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you personally accept and condone the Torah and the Talmud,  then that means you accept slavery, and if you don't see it as immoral,  there's no convincing you that Abrahmic religions are evil.

       If man had higher moral reasoning than G-d, then there would not have been a holocaust with the base that Nazis were doing the right thing and strengthening mankind through killing inferior races and people with disabilities.  Without Divine morality defining morals, mankind can do some pretty messed up stuff claiming it is for the good of mankind.   I'm not going to go into the divinity of the Torah, but if you want proof, it exists.  Feel free to PM me, but I'd rather not discuss this is a post about Soros.

       "Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav: A male child who has relations with a female adult causes her to be like one who was injured with a stick... Rava said: This is what was meant - an adult male who has relations with a female child has not done anything because less than this [three years old] is like sticking a finger into an eyeball."

       Inaccurate, it is discussing virginity status, that is why these are all used out of context. It is saying if a boy has sex with any woman regardless of age, the woman retains get status as a virgin (important in marriage contracts). The same goes for the baby girl thing. Obviously sex with a child isn't permitted, and a person would be punished severely if caught (yes Jews have feelings believe it or not), and it's disgusting...BUT what it is saying is if for some messed up reason a baby is raped, the baby retains its virginity status (as according to some opinions the hymen grows back at that age... That is the eyeball reference)... All the Talmud is about interpreting and implementing laws of the Torah in our lives.

       That is the brilliance of Judaism. The non-billionaire Jews are conned into thinking that they have something in common with billionaire Jews, when the reality is that that the wealthy will sell them out gladly when it comes down to nut cutting time.

       To be fair, he was raised in a non observant Jewish family that hated other Jews. So it's not as if he was a traitor to his people, he was raised that way.

      <p>
       Look up what Jewish influence did to Berlin post WW1 to get an idea of why many Jews rose up against each other. They are mostly a good people with some very rotten apples that at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't turning on each other out of just fear of prosecution. There were moral dilemma's surrounding the conduct of many Jewish people in Germany that led to the uprising. The French also played a huge role in creating the Nazi's due to their treatment of Germany, and it's citizens following WW1.

       The same reason Operation Paperclip brought in over a thousand Nazi scientists like Von Braun and installed all kinds of known former Nazi SS right back into German intelligence to presumably keep an eye on the Russians right after WWII was over. No one went after any of those because they were all under the protection of the US government after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros was only 16 when the war ended. Too young to be of much importance or a Nazi collaborator or worth going after. He was also a Jew just to complicate that issue. He made all of his money scamming foreign currency markets and he's ploughed plenty of that dough into Wall St. to make him another high ranking member of America's unscrupulous elites who he does favors for while they do a few for him like making sure the government keeps him safe and sound.

       Because the sideshow of the 90 year old germans being put in jail distracts us from the Nazi bases in Sth America, Antarctica, Nazis in US Government (operation paperclip), all the Jewish nazi collaborators (hitler typed mein kampf on a rothschild typewriter), pedophile politicians being blackmailed by nazis and jews, lack of evidence for holocaust etc.

       The fact that Soros is a Jew has nothing to do with anythin ghe did. He is an avowed atheist. Believes in no God. He believes that man created God, and not the other way around (his words). He didn't care about what was happening to the Jews. He only knew he was okay, and getting a bunch of stuff.

I'm not speaking for Muslims because their "holy" book is completely fabricated and written by an angry murdering rapist (easy to read about him and his life, and he made the stuff up as an illiterate in a cave without being able to repeat it even creating multiple versions of his own book). I would like to answer your questiok by referring to one part because I don't have time to type this up on my phone. Let me discuss the part about raping, enslaving, and killing POWs. For one you need to understand that you can't understand the Torah without the oral explanation which was given to Moses and he taught to everyone. For example the Torah says we must slaughter animals as He taught us...well I have never seen a detailed Bible passage on proper slaughter of animals. This is because you need oral Torah to understand anything. Reading the Bible alone is like looking at artwork and trying to interpret it without hearing what it means from the artist.

       Ok so with that out of the way I will continue, though I can't force you to take me seriously, this stuff is taught by our sages and explained in rashis commentary on chumash. To understand the stuff about war, you have to realize that we Jews do not hold by this stuff anymore and are completely forbidden, as times have changed and the authorities in our religion understand that rape and killing is bad...duh..we aren't savages. I've never seen a religious group of Jews raping and murdering...because we are forbidden to both by the Torah and by the rabbi's. But in context I'm assuming you are talking about the Canaanite wars that occurred as the Israelites were entering the holy Land. This is something that also perplexed me when I first learned it from simply reading the passages. So over 3000 years ago and even today war and killing alters a person's way of thinking normally, and I'm not saying it's good but it's a reality. When G-d says you need to go destroy a tribe of people because they are evil and beyond the point of no return (we are talking about societies that were relatively lawless that were actually involved in infant sacrifice, raped, murdered, and did pretty much every vile thing imaginable) these nations were the entire reason the G-d needed to create a specific nation that would bring godliness back into the world. These nations were warned before the war started that they had to stop or they would be destroyed. Pretty much they would say no so the israelites would do as commanded by their creator even if they had no desire to kill, and they only did it because they were commanded. There are places in the world that are holier and more set aside than others, and that land is one of them. Think like it the inner sanctuary of a holy temple where people pray and give charity, but then some groups of drunken racists decide they are going to set up camp right in the middle of the temple and start raping the common folk...it's not what Hashem wanted on his holy land anymore.  The spoils of war is just a reality of the time they lived in. Today we don't have slaves because it is frowned upon but back then you would take non warriors as servants (better word than slaves as you were not allowed to harm slaves and had to take care of them) and even though I'm not proud of it, all societies had servants back then. But you can read about ancient Jewish treatment of servants and slaves if you want and you will see it is very different than what you think. On to the stuff about being able to "take" women. I don't know the last time you were part of an ancient war but the men became rather viscious at times.  According to the sages, G-d added this not because he desired for men to rape, but as a reality clause saying I dont want you to do this, but if you do you are not going to have to die or get some sort of extreme punishment, though IT WAS EXTREMELY FROWNED UPON, AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOLY PEOPLE. pretty much if you were that guy, you looked like a total asshole and you were going to lose a lot of your friends, no matter how crazy war fighting made you. These were righteous human beings. It if you don't want to believe me you don't have to....the Torah has nothing to do with the Jews directly. It is a book that is established as an authoritative book and it then delves into all the laws that Jews must keep in the holy land. So it's main purpose today is for us to learn Talmud and derive the laws for conducting our lives and connection to the creator. The creator revealed himself to the nation of over two million people simultaneously, never to be repeated to any other nation. Then he said, these are my laws.
