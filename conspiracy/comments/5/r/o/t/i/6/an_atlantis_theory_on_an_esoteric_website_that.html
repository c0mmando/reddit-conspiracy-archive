      <p>
       So I was stumbling around google images last night for pedo symbols in companies after another post inspired me. A few here and there, a lot of
       <a href="http://m.ebay.co.uk/itm/371254058132?_mwBanner=1">
        fingernail stickers
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.welshgifts.co.uk/spiral-triangle-pendant-18-snake-pewter.ir">
        jewelry
       </a>
       . Nothing really surprising or new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I came across
       <a href="http://www.absoluteempowerment.com/Lemuria.php">
        this weird esoteric seminar site
       </a>
       . In an article about Atlantis, both the dual heart image, and spiral triangle make an appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems just like another new age yoga self help class, but those two images alone made me suspicious. The rest of the site alludes to Masonic teachings and other esoteric knowledge. Not too creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then the
       <a href="http://www.absoluteempowerment.com/Children-and-Past-Lives.php">
        psychic children
       </a>
       come in, and the words
       <a href="http://www.absoluteempowerment.com/Psychic_Children.php">
        Ascertain the specific age childhood characteristics from ABSOLUTE LOVE
       </a>
       appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could all be nothing, but to me it seems like a revival
       <a href="http://www.ancient-world-mysteries.com">
        mystery school
       </a>
       , that includes the disgusting
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece">
        pedo stuff from the Greeks
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know what you think, especially if you live in Australia and have additional info on the author of the site

       I believe the word esoteric applies here.  The whole purpose is to create doubt about the connections.

       There is a big and small heart.  They are symbols for something else.

       Except, the FBI document makes it pretty clear that
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       the spiral heart symbol means anything, not just any vague "big and small heart" symbol.

       The FBI document makes it pretty clear that they've figured out those particular symbols are used.  Of course variations exist.  Look at the Shriners children's hospital logo with an outlined heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still a small heart within a big heart.  Coincidence...or maybe coincidence is a fabrication and the shit is a tongue in cheek variation of the symbol and someone knowing that would pick up on the dog whistle.

       the same design with no variation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Shriners logo is literally just the outline of a heart. By that logic,
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       heart logo is suspicious somehow.

       Define "all the same distinctions". According to the FBI document, the BLogo thing is supposed to contain two triangles.

        This

       symbol contains three.

       Also do you really think that the FBI will disclose all of the logos used?  I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI has a hand in keeping the knowledge under the surface because it implicates so many Highup people that they obviously investigate.

       The small fact sheet of logos was a nod in the right direction, not doctrine.

       By this logic, we should just assume that any use of a heart logo is clearly an admission of whatever crime we prefer to accuse someone of... scratch that, why not just any symbol. We can figure out what sort of evil your symbols are later. We'll fix it in post!

       It's not similar at all. The only similarity is that it's a symbol with two hearts in it, which is meaningless on its own. As for the triangle, it's not an exact match either. Compare it to the ones shown in the

       The big heart and small heart do stand for something.  An adult and a child.  Just like the hand in a hand.

       So it's more reasonable to assume a bunch of random businesses are pedophile fronts because their logos
       <em>
        slightly
       </em>
       resemble the logos from the FBI doc?

       It's not a bakery or something though. It's someone that studies esoteric symbols and knowledge. They knew what that stands for; a person who starts a company teaching people Masonic symbolism knows the deeper meaning behind things.

       The whole concept of what is "reasonable" is a scam up upheld to keep people from putting pieces together intuitively.  Why shouldn't we approach every single mundane event as an intense criminal investigation if it brings us to actual truth and not dismissal and generalizations that harbor dark activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop harboring these people in your doubts.  Let the light in and don't be afraid to be wrong.  If one of these organizations isn't in the shit then they have absolutely nothing to be afraid of because there will be no bigger picture of them painted besides an artistic inspiration.

       It's hard to tell. Some of it seems creepy and some of it seems enlightening. I read through the descriptions of different child types and have concluded that I'm either a Rainbow Child or a Star Child haha. I like some of the stuff that I read there but something about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth too. Seems a bit preachy but then again I could also be being too judgmental/skeptical. It's interesting that the spiral triangle originated from some ancient God, so now I'm curious about that. Good readings nonetheless, saving for later research.
