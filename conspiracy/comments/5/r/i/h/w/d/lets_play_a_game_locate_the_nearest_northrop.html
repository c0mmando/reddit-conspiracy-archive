<p>The new B21 Raider that&#39;s replacing the B2 is more powerful and advanced and it would only take one B2 to wipe out Europe. They&#39;re making 100 B21s right now btw. Not a peep from Trump about it. NG even hired Air Force Generals after the contract was awarded lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work on a NASA program building a telescope (google JWST). NG has facilities all over the place because they do a whole bunch of different things much like many Fortune 500 companies. One of the main reasons they are spread out is that they are made up of smaller companies that have combined over the years. TRW, Northrop, &amp; Grumman used to all be different companies in different locations and when the consolidated they were spread out all over the place. They do classified work much like Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, &amp; Orbital. All of this is very public information. Let me know what else you want to know. </p>

<p>Now can you please address why NG specifically is linked to fulfilling biblical prophecies and has a skynet-like AI that is running the show? As I said, I am open to learning more; otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be in this sub. Any articles, videos, or literature to share?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have locations everywhere because the provide the secured lines of communications for law enforcement and pretty much all their cyber security needs. It gives them full control of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated before, there are many companies that have locations all across the US, NG is not unique in this way at all. They do perform Cybersecurity so please cite information that shows any proof or even implication that NG uses their role to exert influence or control over law enforcement. How do they exert control? What are examples of situations where they did this? I can easily make claims that since police use iPhones and drive Chargers that apple and dodge (who have locations all over the place) are controlling the police. See what I am seeing in your claims? Please provide something to back up any of these claims. </p>

<p>NG does build weapons as does the rest of the defense contractors. When any of them build classified stuff they compartmentalize the information as does the government when they use the weapons. I am not naive enough to think that all of these companies don&#39;t develop some pretty powerful weapons. I don&#39;t expect proof of NG building a weapon of mass destruction as that would be kept top secret but until you substantiate some of your other claims, the WMD claim holds no water. </p>

<p>Like I said before, I am open to learning more otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be here. I have answered your questions to the best of my ability so please respond to my requests for proof. I am not here to promote NG or defend them from accusations that are backed up with evidence. But if you can&#39;t provide anything to stand alongside your claims I must think that all you are doing is creating theories on your own based off of fear and biblical prophecies. If that is the case then that&#39;s fine but please preface your posts with &quot;I have a theory..&quot; or &quot;I think that..&quot; instead of declaring all of these as absolute truths and that you know all. </p>

<p>The B2 isn&#39;t a WMD? The B21? LMFAO! What about their Space Based Missile Defense Systems? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bombers are weapon platforms, I wouldn&#39;t say they are WMDs. The weapons on board them may be what you are referring to and those weapons are built by all of the defense contractors. The missile defense system is classified so who knows what it really does. It could be a massive space laser similar to the Death Star. I don&#39;t expect you to have any info on that. I am not claiming it isn&#39;t a weapon since I DONT HAVE ANY PROOF.</p>

<p>There are probably also classified weapons developed by all the defense contractors that can be classified as WMDs that we have no idea about and I admitted to that. That is neither naive or in denial. All I want is some proof for the much easier to support claims of yours before I consider any of your impossible to prove claims. </p>

<p>So for the last time you still have yet to prove or even come up with a theory as to why NG specifically is any different than the other defense contractors or how they exert any control. All you do is claim I am naive and in denial but the irony being that I am asking you to educate me on this matter. </p>

<p>If a child asks you a question do you mock them for being in denial or being naive or do you help them to understand? If your next response contains no evidence to support any claims then I am done here. This is not a two sided discussion aimed at advancing understanding but just someone on a soap box spouting shit without any intent of backing it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always on the level. Are you? Nope. You&#39;re not a kid and you&#39;re the one standing on a soapbox diluting the fact that you work for mass murderers. There&#39;s other Defense Contractors but none have the arsenal or influence NG has and you know it. Go back to the sports subs where you guys try to look normal. I know how to play the game already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok that&#39;s it, I tried man. I&#39;m open to this shit and that&#39;s why I am here but you make personal attacks rather than responding to my questions/requests. I make no defense of the defense contractors other than requesting that there be proof to accompany these claims. I think the true mass murderers are the ones in control of the government who created ISIS and continue these pointless wars via manipulation of the population with mainstream media. I am a member of the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth and I have never held a great deal of trust in anything the government says or does. I am discuss things across different subs that interest me, sports being one of the better ones for discussion as people are civil and refrain from personal attacks when they don&#39;t agree. </p>

<p>I answered your questions thoughtfully and only wanted more information. Think what you want but I hope all others who read this thread see that you have nothing to support what you say and that any attempt at reasonable discussion is pointless. </p>

<p>Good luck in your future efforts, it is always good to question what we are told. </p>

<p>Why would a group create such a thing or something even close to it, and decide to go all Armageddon on everyone&#39;s asses? </p>

<p>You want to rule the world? Cool guy. Go try to rule thousands of years of mans base instinct. Go tell me how that works when it comes to a head.</p>

<p>But to destroy it all? You&#39;re not just destroying everyone and everything...you&#39;re destroying yourselves. This is dancing on the story line of doom with roughly the same alleged repercussions.</p>

<p>Logically..it makes no sense. To have all that power...and literally piss it all away.</p>
