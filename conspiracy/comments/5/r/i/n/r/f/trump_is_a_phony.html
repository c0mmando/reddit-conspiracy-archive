       Trump is not an idiot, he won't ever touch foreign claims of USD as it would be REALLY, REALLY bad for his own personal business and others around him. Same reason why he is running an hypocritical foreign travel ban on some countries.

       Is all fake nationalism and you are getting conned just like Obama supporters were conned by all the "Hope." bullshit.

       I think this response is ridiculous. It's
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       what the conspiracy is. If you dislike Trump, love Trump, agree, disagree, whatever, it doesn't matter. If it's
       <em>
        political
       </em>
       it is
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       conspiratorial. If you can't stomach talking about politics, then why are you here? Do you just want to talk about aliens and bigfoot?

       Like when you point out to someone that every US president, with the exception of Van Buren, is a descendants of King John of England, and they're like, "So?". Some people are blind to US politics being a tendril of a globalist agenda.

       "There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the communists, or any other group, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known." - Carroll Quigley, Tragedy &amp; Hope

       No, I'm actually here for the political discussion and am not overly interested in the other subjects although I do enjoy reading about the more developed theories and posts. But I do think threads like this run the risk of derailing this subreddit and turning it into a waste like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       if people spam submissions with no real content or quality aside from a personal opinion about an individual politician.

       Wilbur L Ross - Henchmen for the Rothschild banking dynasty. The Rothschild's bailed Trump out of bankruptcy in the late 1980's on Wilbur L Ross advice. Wilbur L Ross said in Bloomberg back in March 2016 that he would back Trump if he runs and that he would make a great leader.

       It's not like trump (or Hillary) would have any REAL control. Just puppets that get selected into office. When will people learn that 'voting' another man in a suit into office will NOT fix all this shit. I mean seriously, does the world have to crash and burn in order for people to finally learn?

       Where has possible ties to Tillerson and PizzaGate been addressed? I've been following PG since the beginning and have been trying to keep an eye on Trump and his picks but I've fallen behind. I know about one of his people having heavy ties with Dyncorp but it wasn't Tillerson. Any point in the right direction would be appreciated :)

       From memory he is mentioned in some of the attachments in the Podesta emails. He was considered to be a key note speaker at the clinton foundation conference. Seems Tillerson and Podesta have some deep ties. If you search wikileaks you will be able to find this info.

       You can't have the attention of multi-billion investors without being pro-war. It's an enormous pool of money for them and Elon Musk has been a hot ticket for investors. It's why every "Libertarian" tech company became a hillary supporting war-machine.

       I like Musk a great deal, as a thinker. I don't know him personally, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, wars require a great deal of resources. Musk produces very good batteries. Batteries and solar good enough to support troops in war zones so that they would not need local power sources or power plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope like hell Musk isn't involved in this sort of thing, or considering it, but this would be an obvious boon to Elon's companies.

       It's like people never learn. The answer to all our problems and lack of freedom is NOT voting another person into office. I mean, seriously?? Trump, Hillary, Bush, Obama, ect., are ALL PUPPETS! Wake the fuck up people! God damn, a lot of this oppression is the PEOPLE'S faults because we ALLOW this shit. Don't people understand that?

       Probably the only thing true and decent about Trump was his opposition to TPP and NAFTA, but on his "america first" (really billionaires first and israel first) policy page, he claims his own team will be replacing the TPP and NAFTA.

       I doubt that holds up legally due to the First Amendment.

       Even if it does pass Congress and is written as law, they will suddenly become 'outside consultants' or 'expert contractors' or some other term that allows them to keep doing exactly what they are doing.

       Trump said the TPP and NAFTA were bad deals and that America should sign free trade with countries individually.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means Trump could sign a worse deals for the worker and better deal for the 1℅ then the TPP and NAFTA would have ever done with an individual country and not break his promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and Trump are both puppets of Wall Street. The only thing different is Trump wasn't for a military showdown with Russia like Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reason why the neoconservatives war mongers in Congress and the Senate went so hard on the speculative Russian folder. They are deluded into thinking that a military showdown with Russia is the way to get their hands on Russian resources and have used this document to try and railroad Trump into a military showdown with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason the Democratic warmongers silence on Trump's economic plans have been deafening or protested about at times ensured to get as little publicity as possible. If these Neoconservative Democrats had put in half the effort they put into Russian dossier into the risks and pitfulls of Trump's economic plans then a whole lot more people would be in the streets protesting.
