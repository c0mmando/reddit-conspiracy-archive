       On my lunch, so I'll be brief. All of the pizza gate stuff is really getting to me as I delve deeper down the rabbit hole. I can't talk about it with anyone in real life and Im just left thinking about all the suffering children in these rings...I had to sing "Zombies" by The Cranberries on my lunch to just get out some emotion about it all...How are ya'll dealing with this kind of truth???

       You walk away for whatever length of time required!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not for every one! You cannot help if you're falling apart, right? So, use best practices and step back!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not mentally and emotionally supported  by friends, family or your community - perhaps you should step away until you find a solid sounding board!

       Just my two cents.

       I'm not a regular here, but plan to start checking out this subreddit daily now. Yes, the pizza gate stuff definitely freaks me out! I'm a Mom. My children are teenagers now. But now I'm SO glad I really kept a close eye on them while growing up!

       Well, it is just TOO coincidental when you look at all the facts.  I've also watched Ted Gunderson (on youtube) who is a former FBI agent (he has passed away) from the 60s and 70s.  All he says verifies that this goes back a long way and is true. Scary!

       I just can't figure it out! I'm a straight female. I have ALWAYS been attracted to MEN. Not boys, MEN. I just don't understand these people! And, from all I've read, it not only goes way back, but is worldwide!

       How much have you read about it? Everything I've read is so "far out there" - but I believe it.  I'm talking about not only pedo stuff, but evil forces (if you know what I mean). Truly scary stuff!

       I'd rather not read or hear about any of this crap. My knowledge comes from participating in life, with open eyes. As a Mom, I've had to be vigilant in protecting my child. Several times, men have tried to kidnap my kid. Because of this, I have several large dogs, and would not hesitate to - well, you get my drift.

       If I would have shot him, instead of allowing my dog to due her duty, I'd be in jail. When a perv tried to steal my kid from the grocery store, several elderly ladies blocked him. It's important for community members to help put a stop to this.

       In the case of Pizzagate it is highly likely that it's all about blackmail of political and business figures. Some of it is done to and by willing participants and some is entrapment. Once you have blackmail material to be held over a power persons head it becomes a safe bet that they'll do your bidding while in office. Pizzagate is about both a perk for the power elite  and a trap for candidates for power.

       The documentary about boys town was really sad, the girl who came forward and testified against the people who were involved spent way more time in jail than the people who ran the pedo ring. The media made the witnesses seem like lunatics and drug addicts just trying to be famous or something.

       Here's information about the same thing goingon in D.C. during all of the 80's and 90's. It wasn't stopped then and Pizzagate is probably just the continuation of this investigation from back then.

       Thank you for the link. I think the reason it wasn't stopped then is because it went very high up (like it still does) in our government. Which is totally sick!

       Personally? Drinking mostly. Not a suggestion for you but an answer for your question. Weed/CBD works for most people from what I see here. For me, I need to be in the right mindset beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not alone. The citizens investigating this are absolutely disgusted with what they are finding. Coordinated child abuse / trafficking has been around for a long time but we ignored the ugly truth. Now we are fighting back. We will win.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think we have it bad? Imagine what the law enforcement officials investigating this for years have to see every fucking day. That has got to suck hardcore. Now imagine you are an honest FBI agent trying to bring the criminals to justice and a higher authority steps in and blocks the investigation. I don't think there are words to describe how that would make me feel.

       I also went through a bad patch emotionally over pizzagate a while back. Now that months have passed since I first found out about it, I can say to you honestly that it gets better. I genuinely believe three things that have helped to keep me sane.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          I believe that the fact that you are this upset means that you are a sane and good person.
         </strong>
         The anger/depression/disgust that you are feeling is a natural, appropriate reaction to finding out that the most powerful people on earth drug, torture, rape, murder, and in some cases consume innocent children. But there is a second type of pain that we are experiencing which is the pain of our reality shattering before our eyes. Similar to the way it hurts when someone suddenly flicks on the lights in a dark room - it also hurts us on a subconscious level to have been so spectacularly lied to by the people and institutions that we trusted and endorsed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          I believe the pain we feel is a small price to pay for real knowledge
         </strong>
         Pain and growth/birth go hand in hand. The first sensation you experience when you are born is discomfort. Lights, sounds and even the air against your skin for the first time shock your senses. When we work out, our muscles get sore because they are growing/strengthening. When we go through emotional pain throughout our lives, we learn and grow and become more resilient. This awakening will lead to a reckoning and we will become stronger as people, more moral as a society, and could potentially lead to the dismantling of oppressive power structures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          I believe the tables have turned and we have the power now.
         </strong>
         There are too many of us who know. They tried to silence it and they couldn't. We are going to get them - it's just a matter of time. Sessions was appointed today, Wiener is facing 15 years for child porn and going for a plea. FBI is on it. Massive pedo ring crackdowns have been happening all over the globe recently. Alefantis is up shit creek with a former victim coming forward, a new Jeffrey Epstein child rape trial is back in the news. It's starting! Have faith and take heart - the truth WILL come out (no thanks to the news media).

       I feel like i was naive before PG, when it dawned on me that PG was real, i felt like that was the knife that pierced and killed what little good that is worth fighting for

       Maybe im wrong, but i hopelessly am starting to see one method that can quarantine this evil - burn it with fire, better to die a free person then sell my future descendants to become sex chattel.

       I understand your depression.  It may be a necessary process in order for you to awaken as it was for me.  I hope that you can some day rise above the negativity and raise your vibration higher than you have ever before.  You will know what this means if it happens.  I hope that you will understand what the opposite of evil is.  If you are a Christian, I leave you with this message from Jesus:
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew 5:44
      </p>
      <p>
       But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.

       Yeah, I don't even have a cell phone, and I don't have internet at home, so I just check out what I can at work and stuff. I try to just chill and stuff but the images and thoughts of what happens just gets to me when I have a free moment to think. Being at work is usually a good distraction. Thanks mate!

       I just want to thank everyone who posted something, it really made my day to come home and see that people actually care, thanks guys! I chill at home, smoke a blunt, relax with Family Guy or some silly show or movie and try to not let it get to me. But I also don't want to be an ostrich sticking it's head in the sand about it, like so many others. It needs to be talked about openly, without stigma, because all we do by not talking about it is give THEM what they want: secrecy and space to do what they want. I talked with my mom and bf, and feel a lot stronger now about it, and thanks to all of you on reddit, who really gave me hope and strength to keep up the good fight! We will get them for what they've done to innocents, light will prevail! Love, peace, and chicken grease ya'll!

       I discovered a very (((infamous))) internet forum about a year ago, and took what the cool kids these days call 'the red pill.'
      </p>
      <p>
       It really opened up my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at that point that I decided to start writing my own script to live by, instead of allowing the world to stochastically throw things at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got myself interested in politics, shortly after the Donald took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       After glaring past the
       <em>
        yugely
       </em>
       massive landfills compact full of #fakenews articles, I then became incredibly grateful that we didn't vote for such a corrupt, senile wakopath bent on waging war with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       When LePen lost to Macron, I was devastated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The French presidential election showed me how sinister, corrupt, and bias the media could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't stand watching television anymore, it's all propagandist, rhetorical, jangley-key tier chatter at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's designed to push a narrative to make you feel like trash if you're white, and to make you feel like a helpless victim who needs to be mollycoddled, sans dignity, if you're a minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's demotivating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read books now, my reading comprehension's steadily increasing as I train my eyes to perform saccades efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a decent voice, and I'm training that to sound more intelligible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst thing about the red pill is that it will ruin the things that you used to enjoy, but with time, it will make you into a better version of yourself, if you take responsibility for your success.
