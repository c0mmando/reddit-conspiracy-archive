<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-putting-iran-on-notice-2017-2">Trump administration: &quot;As of today, we&#39;re officially putting Iran on notice&quot;</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran&#39;s destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East,&quot; said Flynn</p>

<p>Flynn went on to say that Iran had violated the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which prohibits Iran from designing missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, an EU spokesman speaking at the UN Security Council on Tuesday said that Iran&#39;s test did not violate the resolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This needs more discussion, check out this comment by u/loose-ends</p>

<p>The move simply and firmly puts Iran on side with Russia and China where those two have mutually agreed to use their own currencies on any oil and gas purchases between them.
Both have of course been stockpiling gold which may mean that they&#39;re actually using gold backed securities or certificates that can be periodically exchanged for gold for those transactions.
Iran, of course, sells the bulk of it&#39;s oil to China so it&#39;s offensive and unnecessary for either of them to have to use US currency for those transactions especially with the kind of open hostility that shows through on any pronouncements or comments the US government makes about either of them. If China and Russia are willing to pay Iran in gold and vice versa there can be no legitimate objections to it. It&#39;s quite simply the best and most fair form of exchange that there is and it&#39;s only a matter of time before the entire world gets back on that bus and on with real life rather than one that is driven by completely worthless paper in the hands of a private consortium of charlatans and con men trying to buy up the world with it.
You go to war with Iran and you&#39;ll have to go to war with Russia and China as well while the entire world would rather drop the petro-dollar altogether than go that far to try and save it which is precisely what will happen if things start to look like they&#39;re headed that way.
While no one is coming right out and saying it, beyond admitting that the entire western banking and financial system is in critical condition, is that it not only can&#39;t be saved, but shouldn&#39;t be saved because it&#39;s the corrupt and criminal activities within and between those private banks and financial institutions themselves that have brought the crisis about. So it will be necessary for any financial reset to work that government banks, not private ones, restore confidence in their individual economies and currencies by issuing and using gold or precious metals or the most stable commodities they possess to back certificates for all international transactions between them. Interestingly enough, one of Trumps first executive orders was for a full audit and accounting of all of the US government&#39;s present gold reserves. To put it simply the writing is already on the wall, and I don&#39;t mean the one he&#39;s building on the Mexican border.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it might be a situation where &#39;deep state&#39; comes in and is like, &#39;Look Prez, I know you want to pull out, but USD is tied to oil and if too many countries (like Iran) get off it&#39;s tit, then we collapse, swe we literally have to go into Iran and fuck em up a bit to keep them on USD.</p>

<p>While that scenario sucks, and is most likely the case, the one good part about is that it might get Trump thinking about tying the USD back to gold or some other restructuring standards. It would probably take 4-8 years to slowly shuffle into, but if its done it would be one of the biggest moves, and best, in recent history.</p>

<p>As far as Iran, wonder if I can short their currency to make money off this? I wonder would would happen if we could all bank off this and then crowdsource a bitcoin account to hire/pay for a South American mercenary group to go get Soros</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;birther&#39; conspiracy theory is so ridiculous that I&#39;m compelled by your comment to give my two cents. Firstly, I knew a Honolulu mom who gave birth to twins at the same hospital the day after Obama was born. Here&#39;s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.womensmediacenter.com/feature/entry/for-birthers-honolulu-mom-an-inconvenient-truth">this article</a> that quotes her: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I entered the Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital on early Friday afternoon, August 4, 1961. I was registered and my expected twins were given Hawaii State birth certificate numbers 10637 and 10638. My labor was slow with poor contractions from a distended uterus. </p>

<p>“Apparently, Stanley Ann Dunham Obama came in shortly after I arrived, because her baby was registered as number 10641. Her labor was strong, and she delivered Barack Hussein Obama early that evening. The next morning my contractions strengthened. The twins finally emerged at 2:05 and 2:12 p.m. Saturday, August 5th. By the way, I don’t want to do that again!” </p>

<p>Obama and the Nordyke girls also wound up in the same classes at Noelani Elementary School and later at Punahou School from the seventh grade to graduation in 1979.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly, how exactly would such a conspiracy theory work? <a href="http://theobamafile.com/_images/BirthAnnouncementBig.jpg">There&#39;s an article from August 13th, 1961 in the Honolulu daily newspaper  stating that Obama was born <em>in Hawaii</em>, on August 4th 1961.</a> Even if &#39;they&#39; got to the newspaper company, and made them print false information, how would &#39;they&#39;, back in 1961, know that this infant (who was secretly born out-of-state for whatever reason) would go on to successfully run for President of the United States almost fifty years down the road? It just doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Particularly interesting is that the House of Representatives is readying a bill that would allow Trump to declare a &#39;preemptive war&#39; on Iran in the interest of national security.</p>

<p>It is partially tied to the nuclear deal, but a LOT of it also is based on &#39;threats to allies in the region&#39;. Like Saudi Arabia, which just had a destroyer attacked by Houthi rebels, supposedly supported by Iran.</p>

<p>It is a very broad and vague law and would pretty much let Trump choose the moment to start the war, and the circumstances that would merit going to war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a false flag attack would be perfect for Trump. It could actually unite Americans -- Trump-supporters and Hillary-supporters alike -- against a common external enemy. </p>

<p>And controlled opposition &quot;alternative media&quot; names like Breitbart, ZeroHedge and Alex Jones, would of course parrot the official narrative, claiming the attack was really perpetrated by Iran. </p>

<p>In the current climate -- with Trump facing an insane amount of opposition -- such an attack is precisely what he needs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i dont get his obsession with Iran and China. Russia would never accept regime change in Iran. A destabilized Iran would be an existential threat to Russia.</p>

<p>Iran is also much stronger than Iraq was, so an actual US invasion would be very costly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yesterday Iran hit a Saudi ship with an anti-ship missile.  Officials now say it was a suicide bombing attempt on a US war ship?</p>

<p>Today Iran put on notice by the US for testing a ballistic missile.</p>

<p>If you watch closely under all of the anti trump propaganda and BS protests, you might see a few more reasons unfold in the near future justifying boots on the ground in Iran.</p>

<p>We know what happens when a country drops the Petro-dollar.  We gently pat them down for WMDs until our currency is the standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing new. Iran has been trading with China in yuan for some time already, specially because of sancitons they couldn&#39;t use dollars to begin with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-17988142">http://www.bbc.com/news/business-17988142</a></p>

<p>Trump has quite a few Iran hawks in his administration. The problem is that Russia is currently allied with Iran over Syria. </p>

<p>Not to mention that Iran is no Iraq, Libya, any conflict over Iran will be a hellhole, with &quot;boots on the ground&quot; not to mention spillover (Iraq, Syria, Bahrain). </p>

<p>IMO nothing big will happen. Trump will end up imposing some sanctions on Iran (ICBM related, int&#39;l terrorism) while trying to find a way to overturn the UNSC Nuclear deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could very well be, that has been the pattern. However I think Iran has spent a long time detatching itself from the US, who overthrew their govt and installed the Shah in 1953, who ruled until the 1979 revolution where the pendulum swung the other way Iran became Islamic and anti-america (understandable because they hijacked irans government). So I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they didn&#39;t even have that large of a holding anyway. They have really gotten away from oil because they realize it&#39;s a means by which they are controlled. For example, the country with the largest percentage of natural gas cars in the world is Iran. </p>

<p>But symbolically, it does look bad, so I think the US would want to &quot;fix&quot; that situation. However Russia backs Iran, so challenging them is as dangerous, if not more, than trying to invade Syria again (which Russia blocked with its warships in the Mediterranean) </p>
