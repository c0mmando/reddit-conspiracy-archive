    <div class="md"><p>Dude it has been only 3 days. It is an ongoing investigation. Some things need to stay within the department to build a full and complete case. If shit leaks out or is accidentally misreported it could damage the case. I swear this generation has no patience sometimes. I want it and I want it right now!</p>

<p>Chill out man, let people have a chance to do their jobs. Do you need the details of every single story and event delivered to you in real time in order to function? What&#39;s the point of living a life if you constantly distract yourself with the lives and events of others.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the whole problem being exposed here? Too many people living the lives of others? Letting others think for them? Give it more than 3 days, good lord.</p>
