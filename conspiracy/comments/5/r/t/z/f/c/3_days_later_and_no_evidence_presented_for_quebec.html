       It doesnt say anything about finding guns in his car in either article. All it mentions is his political views. This is worthless information, not fact. I am concern many people like you want to believe this story is true but dont care if it actually is. You just invented evidence in your head about guns in a car.

       The guns in the car have been widely reported, I assume a "truth seeker" like you has read as much as possible about the event.

       Dude it has been only 3 days. It is an ongoing investigation. Some things need to stay within the department to build a full and complete case. If shit leaks out or is accidentally misreported it could damage the case. I swear this generation has no patience sometimes. I want it and I want it right now!
      </p>
      <p>
       Chill out man, let people have a chance to do their jobs. Do you need the details of every single story and event delivered to you in real time in order to function? What's the point of living a life if you constantly distract yourself with the lives and events of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that the whole problem being exposed here? Too many people living the lives of others? Letting others think for them? Give it more than 3 days, good lord.

       It's almost as though the media has an extremely limited attention span for terrorism when the culprit isn't bronw.

       I think you have that backwards if anything. But it seems to me the most accurate bit is they have a short attention span.

       Way backwards. Muslim terrorism is censored. You just see a lot of it because its hard to censor when it happens so often. But more happens than is reported.

       The fact that the story had to interject, with no stated reason or connection, that he liked Donald Trump and Le Pen on Facebook tells you all you need to know.  The media has declared him guilty by virtue of his political beliefs.  That should be alarming to everybody.

       He declared himself guilty-he called police and turned himself in. Is it a false flag attack because he's white and not a muslim?

       No I have no qualms with the official story as reported, and no reason to refute it.  I have take issue with the fact that the news is framing him as a Trump &amp; Le Pen supporter when that has no connection to the events.

       No.  If I follow Barack Obama and Campbell's Soup on Facebook and then rob a bank, would a reporter need to inject that into the story?  It comes down to the fact that they're trying to paint an apocalyptic narrative regarding certain political affiliations.

       What if Obama said: The progressive Campbell's Soupification of our country and the increase in political-religious demands are calling into question the survival of our civilisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot let this evil continue.

       Nor can we let the hateful ideology of Radical Campbell's Soupism – its oppression of women, gays, children, and nonbelievers – be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries.

       Obama claims the country has a serious problem with white police officers killing black men.  A man then goes and kills multiple police officers in Houston, TX.  Do we attempt to associate Obama with these murders?

       Not really. Of course, he didn't say "Police violence against black people is a threat to our civilization and way of life! We have to defend ourselves against these radical police extremists. Police are so dangerous we are going to stop letting them into the country. We are going to create a police registry to keep track of these potentially dangerous individuals. We can't let this police violence be allowed to spread any further! We have to act now to make America safe again!"
      </p>

       See how that's different? If he had said that, yeah, people would be blaming him.

       He was using a CZ 858 not an AK47. They are giving more info in local news i think.. I live near this place, and they dont stop talking about it on the news here..He also used a 9mm pistol and he passed all the exams and anything he needs to have it. (sorry for bad English)
