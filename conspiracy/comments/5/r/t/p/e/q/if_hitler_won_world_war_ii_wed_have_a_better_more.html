       If Hitler Won World War II We'd Have A Better, More Just World Today
.
Legendary U.S. General George S. Patton realized late in the war that the United States fought the wrong country. Patton felt the U.S. should have sided with Germany to destroy Jewish Bolshevik/Communist USSR. This information comes from Patton's diary entries, letters he wrote to his wife, and comments he made to military officers and staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       World War II was incredibly complex. However, in the final analysis, WWII was essentially a war between two competing ideologies: Nationalism -vs- Jewish Internationalism/globalism. Adolf Hitler and his allies fought to preserve the concept of Nationalism, not just for Germans but for all peoples the world over. Nationalism really just means the sovereignty of an ethnic people and the right of such ethnic people/nationalists - within their own bordered country - to self-determination.  What is meant by self-determination?  Self-determination just means an ethnic people preserving their unique culture &amp; heritage and pursuing their collective goals as a unique people.  This applies to any ethnic peoples: Nigerians, Germans, Swedes, Vietnamese, Mexicans, Tibetans, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side of WWII was Jewish (Bolshevik) Internationalism (today we simply call this 'globalism'). In the 1920's, 1930's, and of course during WWII, powerful Jewish Internationalists were fervently advancing the Jewish worldview of eventually eliminating all nations... except for a Jewish homeland... (what was later to be - after WWII - the nation of Israel in 1948). Today we see that nothing has changed; Jewish Internationalism/globalism still works toward gradually "merging" all peoples of the world (particularly in the Western World) into one globalist system with a global government, global laws, consistent global culture, global bank, global currency, etc. In short, Jewish globalism (i.e., the weakening and eventual elimination of all nations) is the exact opposite of Nationalism (i.e., a world composed of nations ... specifically, ethnically homogenous and bordered nations). The Allied powers of WWII (led by Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, et al) were tools of International Jewry and thus de facto fighting for the Jewish globalist worldview. After the (Jewish run) Allies won WWII in 1945, International Jewish forces were then free to exercise a Jewish 'Sphere of Influence' over the greater Western World (and as we see today, increasingly over the rest of the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if Hitler had won World War II and then exercised a Nationalist 'Sphere of Influence' over the greater Western World, we'd have a more just, fair, and moral Western World today. The rest of the world would have similarly benefited had the Germans been victorious since German influence would have surely spread elsewhere (ideas such as non-usurious banking and strong family oriented culture would likely have spread globally).
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Hitler won World War II, what would be different in the post war world? Here are a few examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - No USSR (the Soviet government murdered millions of its own people during its 70 year reign - to study this topic read the writings of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; Hitler would have liberated the USSR, though taking large parts of its Western region for lebensraum, "living space")
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - No cold war (because there would be no USSR)
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - No Communist Eastern Europe/Iron Curtain (when WWII ended, Eastern Europe fell to Communism - this was part of Stalin's spoils of war)
      </p>
      <p>
       4 - No Red China and Mao's subsequent killing of 40 - 60 million Chinese (the USSR created favorable conditions for Mao's Communists which ultimately led to Mao's victory over Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in 1949, thus if no USSR, no Mao victory)
      </p>
      <p>
       5 - No Communist North Vietnam (both the Soviet Union and Red China aided Ho Chi Minh)
      </p>
      <p>
       6 - No Communist Cambodia and Pol Pot's slaughter of 2 million Cambodians (Red China aided Pol Pot)
      </p>
      <p>
       7 - No dividing Korea into North Korea &amp; South Korea (the Allies split Korea after WWII ended, with North Korea becoming Communist... another of Stalin's spoils of war)
      </p>
      <p>
       8 - No Communist Cuba (given the previous, what support would Castro have had in the 1950's?)
      </p>
      <p>
       9 - No Communism anywhere (Hitler was the world's most fervent anti-Communist)
      </p>
      <p>
       10 - Liberalism &amp; multiculturalism wouldn't dominate Western ethos (both are Jewish creations and both have always been heavily promoted/advanced by Jews; thus if no Jewish influence, then no liberalism and no multiculturalism... at least certainly nowhere near the degree we see today)
      </p>
      <p>
       11 - No Cultural Marxism and no political correctness (these are social engineering "tools" which came out of the Jewish think tank known as the Frankfurt School)
      </p>
      <p>
       12 - No third world immigration into Western nations (Jews wouldn't be in power positions to craft and force through liberal immigration laws; Jews are responsible for each and every Western nation's liberal immigration policy/laws, as all were orchestrated by a consortium consisting of the World Jewish Congress, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and B'nai B'rith)
      </p>
      <p>
       13 - No depraved filth on TV, in movies, etc. (because Jews wouldn't run Hollywood)
      </p>
      <p>
       14 - No widespread pornography (Jewish lawyers and Jewish activists were the main challengers of anti-obscenity laws, under the guise of "Freedom of Speech")
      </p>
      <p>
       15 - There would still be prayer in public schools (Jewish lawyers were instrumental in banning prayer in public schools under the guise of so-called "separation of church and state," something that appears nowhere in the U.S. Constitution)
      </p>
      <p>
       16 - No man-hating radical feminist movement (Jews such as Betty Friedan, Sonia Pressman, and Gloria Steinem, among others, were the key drivers of radical feminism)
      </p>
      <p>
       17 - No Israel and all the problems it has brought the USA and the immeasurable misery it has wrought on the Palestinians
      </p>
      <p>
       18 - Jews would be living in Madagascar (perhaps) and would be carefully monitored (Madagascar was one place Hitler considered as a Jewish homeland)
      </p>
      <p>
       Many reading this will ask, "But what about the Holocaust?" The Holocaust has been grossly exaggerated by organized Jewry in order to create sympathy for Jews worldwide and thus help advance the Jewish agenda (i.e., people seen as victims tend to get their way). It is also used as a political weapon to justify Israeli militarism against the Palestinians. Hitler's Final Solution (rebranded in the early 1970's as the "Holocaust") was a plan to remove Jews from Europe, not to kill them. During WWII, just as the U.S. couldn't trust Japanese Americans, thus causing FDR to round many of them up and place them in concentration camps, Hitler couldn't trust Jews since many were partisans sympathetic to the USSR and hence they aided the USSR in various subversive, anti-German activities. Therefore the Nazis rounded up Jews and placed them in concentration camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere around one million Jews died during WWII (not six million) mostly due to disease and starvation in the final months of the war. Heavy Allied bombing of Germany and parts of German occupied Europe destroyed many roads, rail lines, and bridges making it impossible for Germany to adequately supply the camps with food and medicine. The result is that many Jews died of starvation and disease; and of course many non-Jews also died of starvation and disease (again, due to a massive Allied bombing campaign and its destruction of German transportation infrastructure). Lastly, there were no "gas chambers." Much has been written about this. To study the "gas chamber" subject, read the research papers published by Germar Rudolf &amp; Carlo Mattogno (there are many others as well). To get a broad overview of the Holocaust, read my article, What Was The Holocaust... What Actually Happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that Hitler never wanted to "conquer the world." He simply wanted to safeguard Europe and the greater Western World from all manner of nefarious Jewish influence and, more broadly, safeguard the world-at-large specifically from, 1) usurious Jewish banking and, 2) Jewish-driven cultural degradation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As previously stated, the Allied heads-of-State (Roosevelt, Churchill, et al) were puppets of International Jewry; each sold his soul for power and prestige. Again, as earlier stated, World War II was a war between two competing ideologies: Nationalism -vs- Jewish Bolshevik Internationalism/globalism -- unfortunately International Jewry won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was World War II "the good war" as is often claimed? No, it was exactly the opposite. The Allied victory marked the beginning of the end of Western Civilization.

       I don't know if Hitler really ordered the holocaust, but it does seem like a lot of the issues we're facing right now would have been avoided, America is still fighting the USSR in a way, without the Vietnam war on communism America's debt would be a lot less, if he had brought his ideology of not having the reserve bank control currency and create constant debt for the government, then maybe we would be better off overall as well, maybe this is why J.F.K respected Hitler, they both aimed to lessen the hold of the government's reliance on private owned banks.

       While 'history is written by the winners' begins to examine the very complex idea of bias in history, it also dramatically oversimplifies the issue.

       He only led the systematic gathering and murder of Gypsies, Polish, and Slavic people. That's all on top of the Jews, handicapped, homosexuals, and really anyone that disagreed with him i.e. clergy, and other politicians.

       I believe your post belongs here. As awful as WWII and the holocaust may have been, it's still very interesting to discuss the possibilities of what the world would be like if Hitler/Germany/Italy/Japan had been the victors, in my humble opinion. Any post of this nature is guaranteed to stir emotions, and bring out groups like the JIDF.

       Tptb pushed us into a war and OP is questioning the motivation for the war. Looking at the bigger picture and asking uncomfortable question. It's a touchy subject but we should be allowed to question everything , that's the purpose of this sub. Plus it's a self post and moves past politics, so that's better than most threads

       Theirs a few problems with that, though, with Hitler manufacturing the Reichsmark as a government currency with no debt, Germany had one of the strongest economies before ww2, some people even say Europe was on the verge of collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler supposedly asked Winston Churchill to stop the war multiple times offering to retreat, Hitler hated the jews, but after what supposedly happened with the Jewish killing over 60million Christians and them threatening to invade Germany perhaps theirs a slim chance that that is why he had such a sociopathic hate for their religion.

       Someone said that Russia's low population is lower than what it should be as well, theirs a lot of sites saying it happened but who knows, I'm sorry if the Original post came off wrong, I don't support what the Nazi's did, just seeing the world as it is now, makes you wonder if the people before us made the right decisions in the end and how much of history is true when the media is so easy to control by the rich,
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler did terrible things in the end, but theirs also a great contrast in his treatment of Germany and animals, that makes you wonder how that same person is one of the most hated in all history.

       Theirs this list as well, it say's the germans created the atom bomb but Hitler chose not to use it, so I don't know if all of it is fact, but Einstein did work under hitler and he did have some part in making the atom bomb a reality.

       Have you noticed that there is pretty much no real rebuttal to any of your facts, just a whole lot of "your a nazi fag" bs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is an extremely interesting subject especially if you also know anything of the history of the rothschilds (a guy did a very interesting write up over on CST) who's tentacles stretch into every facet of government as, much like the medici where to italy in the renaissance, they were the money lenders for much of the world from the industrial era on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you take a broad overview of the previous centurys you can see how international banking (i.e the rothschilds) and corporations have decimated peoples and even nations to acheive there goals and have completely corrupted every government of every nation with a central bank (which by the way is all bar 5 iirc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at neo-liberalism for instance, every western nation adopted this corrupt system all pretty much at the same time, how can this be a coincidence? Look at how inequality, violence and pc culture globally is skyrocketing and then tell me it's all just coincidence with a straight face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on you OP for flying in the face of convention and thinking critically even though you knew there would be an inevitable lambasting from the mewling masses, like you I feel there are too many incongruities and too many coincidences not just in WW2 specifically but unlike you I am nowhere near as succinct but getting back on topic I would just like to pose a point before I wrap this up, as we know history is written by the victors but who were the real victors of WW2?

       I think we can safely say that the Soviets won WW2, Stalin, although he got poisoned, got away with the man-made famine and the death of millions of Christians and Ukrainians that no one even remembers really, not to mention the advantage they got from "stealing" german technology after the war, America and Europe, did kind of win the war as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       **#2 QUOTE: SOLZHENITSYN: 66 Million Murdered By Jewish Bolsheviks…Solzhenitsyn asserts that since 1917, the Bolsheviks, continuing under assassin Stalin, through and even after WW2, systematically executed, and inside (and outside) their thousands of Gulags, worked, starved and froze to death, SIXTY-SIX million people
      </p>
      <p>
       ** Intentionalist historians such as Lucy Dawidowicz argue that Adolf Hitler planned the extermination of the Jewish people from as early as 1918**
      </p>
      <p>
       This feels like a strange coincidence, although it might just be that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also interesting that nearly all of us adopted neo-liberalism during 1970s-1980s, I don't know much about that though other than looking through wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the post as well that a lot of people have been posting on forums a lot that every bank but iran, north korea and cuba use a reserve bank now, but it's a bit shady, some people have said Canada still has a state owned bank, and Israel doesn't have a private bank.

       is nazi so bad? It just means national socialist, any country with capitalism and welfare is national socialist, even America is heading down that road, the only difference is Germany was a dictatorship, which is never ideal, although democracy has screwed over America right now so who knows really.

       There is no point in debating nazism, ffs. There are literally full libraries filled with books written by economists, historians, anthropologists explaining in profound detail how evil and fucked up National Socialism was. I'm not going to waste my time explaining what other, smarter people than me, have done in the past.

       The history of WWII and its lead up was written by the victors.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many ways the US operates as a Fourth Reich.   After WWII the US incorporated many ex-Nazis into Washington at the State Department etc.  and the CIA was used as part of the new dark state.     The use of propaganda increased.

       Hitler may not have been the particular kind of monster portrayed,   Trump may not be the particular kind of monster portrayed,  but these societies based on ideology and polarization are not healthy and do not persist.

       You do realise that Hitler went insane "somewhere on the road to Moscow"? Allot of people would argue it happened long before Russia. What do you think would have happened if he developed the H bomb? Why do you think the allies abandoned any assassination attempt on Hitler? He was doing a terrible job at commanding the armed forces and the allies wanted to keep it that way for an easier victory. Why were so many Generals and Nazis turning against him? The allied soldiers weren't fighting for the Jews, they were fighting for democracy and freedom and Jews were fighting with them. You gotta let go of blaming the Jews man. How can you explain the astronomical success that is Germany today?

       I don't blame the jews, and I've heard the story before, he stopped trusting his commanders and tried to run everything himself which ended with him losing control and making terrible decisions, and I know Finland jews were fighting along side him some in commanding positions, it's impossible for a religion to be 100% bad, and every country has flourished under private banks, the only issue is that religion+ power has generally led to people getting hurt, innocent people were executed at Salem for being witches, millions died in the crusades, the 900+ that died in the Jonestown massacre, Islamic terrorists, Muslims treating women as  second class citizens.

       Can we honestly say it's okay to still believe and base your life on fairy tales that promote elitism, when every day we learn more and more about the world and how wrong we were about things in the past?

       I read several posts that were variants of ad hominem straw man blah blah.  I will dispute a few points just to show how poorly researched the statements are.

       First off the Nazi's used many Jewish craftsmen as slaves and worked them to death.  Official numbers are varied, but it is fair to say that 4 million or more Jews died.  Third the gas chambers and crematoriums were real, I visited them when I toured Europe.  It should also be noted that Hitler would have likely been killed by his own generals if they weren't so overwhelmed.  Hitler was a dope fiend by the end of the war and it is a fair to say that Rudolf Hess was far brighter than Hitler and was the Brains behind the operation.

       Because I don't use the name Antichrist as an online handle? It feels like I'm talking to a child now, no evidence, no knowledge of who I am or what I believe, yet baseless accusations that I'm a Nazi because I posted a blog of someone, not everyone who drinks wine is an alcoholic, not everyone who kills is a bad person, but when people like you exist who only see black and white  anyone can be a demon I guess.

       I don't think Jews control the world, no one can really say they control the world, private banks have proven themselves an enemy of the general public, theirs a reason Lincoln, Jackson, J.F.K, and Hitler, all tried to transition their country from using private banks due to the amount of debt it creates for the country.

      <p>
       I don't know the truth about the holocaust, the concentration camps definitely make sense since Germany had to do something with their war prisoners, and they had the same Russian scorched earth policy, so they did kill many people, theirs just some problems with the holocaust mathematically like how did they burn 6million, and how did they keep their furnaces on every day for 5+ years,  there is clear evidence the germans had gas chambers, so there is no disputing their crimes, in the end though, everyone committed crimes in the past, America enslaved African Americans, Japanese raped Koreans, Mongols killed millions, Hitler was a terrible person but the USSR was just as bad back then, Stalin killed millions more in the

       I'm sorry I don't really know what alt-right is, I think it's white supremacist that support trump? to answer your other questions I think no, though, German life under Hitler is quite romanticized and it does feel, being middle class myself in a city where the homeless and unemployed is growing every day that we may have a better standard of life for everyone if other countries had taken Germany's example of creating our own countries to counter the reserve banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't ignore the crimes he committed against humanity and the other Nazi war crimes, although the USSR did things considered even worse in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">
        Holodomor
       </a>
       , but they stopped, we'll never know if Hitler would have continued his genocide, but it's likely he would have, so for the long term he is worse than Stalin in the end, one thing is clear that it would have been terrible for minority groups, even now 60+ years later, we're still fighting over black rights and gay marriage, it's kind of ridiculous and would have been much worse under Hitlers rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel that their is a lot wrong with the world today, I feel like a lot of other people feel that as well, why else would they have elected Donald Trump, there seems to be a growing divide between government and people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like a great injustice has been done to humanity as a whole, which is why are we still working so hard? 70 years ago people were predicting a reduce in workload, and yet we're still working 8+ hours a day, in perspective slaves worked 10 hour days and 16 during harvest times, and yet more and more people are struggling just to survive in a time where we're fully capable of supporting our population. What is the difference between making ends meet and being a slave in the end?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end it doesn't really matter, if the reserve banks are as much to blame as people say, or if the blame is on us for letting this happen It's just interesting to entertain the notion of how things would be different.

       Maybe reddit is too smart for you. Have you not the brain cells to debate the examples op has laid on the table. All you did was show up with a very unimpressive ad hominem attack...zero substance.

       Someone said that Russia's low population is lower than what it should be as well, theirs a lot of sites saying it happened but who knows, I'm sorry if the Original post came off wrong, I don't support what the Nazi's did, just seeing the world as it is now, makes you wonder if the people before us made the right decisions in the end and how much of history is true when the media is so easy to control by the rich,

       Hitler did terrible things in the end, but theirs also a great contrast in his treatment of Germany and animals, that makes you wonder how that same person is one of the most hated in all history.

       Theirs this list as well, it say's the germans created the atom bomb but Hitler chose not to use it, so I don't know if all of it is fact, but Einstein did work under hitler and he did have some part in making the atom bomb a reality.

       I'm not German never talked to a german before now that I think about it, I grew up playing Wolfenstein, and watching films like captain America, I thought this was a subreddit to question what we're taught not to be abused for being races we don't even belong to.
