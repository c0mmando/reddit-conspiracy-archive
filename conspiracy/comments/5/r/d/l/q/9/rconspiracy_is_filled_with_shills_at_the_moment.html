       , all this stuff we are seeing is it in action. Reddit will likely die out but I would bet that some of those power mods will try to infiltrate here and take over this subreddit as well. I will continue to come to very few subs when the site dies as a whole. Good luck

       I have been on Reddit for about the same time as you, I think for real this is gonna be the end. Over time the site has been getting progressively worse, mostly the past year or two. Pretty much since Spez got hired. So much advertising, now legit propaganda warfare. I thought the Russian propaganda was bad, this is next level shit. The site will die because of the power moderators. I think within a month many subreddits will Seriously begin decaying, the only ones who will last are single purpose subs like the_donald, conservative, UFOs,

       Hmm, I hope you're wrong because, even though the shills are full force and most likely in mod positions of popular subs, there are still good posts made on the reddit platform each day.

       I believe it.  I've noticed that no one, and I mean no one can criticize the left right now without being called a Trump supporter.  Sorry, but that shitty candidate failed because she was an unlikable, corrupt mess.  HRC was forced down everyone's throats by a corrupt DNC.  Wikileaks exposed them.  It's obvious Clinton was going to be the gravy train for many especially within the media, so they all fell over themselves promoting that hack.  Now they need $40 million to cover up that they shit the bed.

       A lot of Trump supporters can't understand why reddit just doesn't like Trump, so they comfort themselves by assuming it's all fake and paid for (as if anyone actually cares enough about reddit to spend money here, better used on twitter or facebook).

       And they are shitting up the sub and drowning all comments out with complaints about Trump spam. Like I get it, there was a great deal of pro-trump stuff and the enthusiasm doesn't have a place here. That has mostly settled down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are 10x more comments complaining about it than there ever were examples of the complaint. And it's all driveby shit by month old accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the newest talking point is referring to trumps army of online bots. I don't care what you think of trump or his followers, but that enthusiasm is 99% organic. But it's the same old move by the same old people where they do something shitty and pretend like their opponent is guilty of it.

       I think everyone is sick of it all.

       First of all, it's really unlikely all (or even most) of that money is going to reddit. Most of it is probably going to places where misinformation spreads fast, like Facebook/Twitter/etc. And even if they were on reddit, they certainly wouldn't waste their time on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . It would be targeted at other, bigger subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, that's not a lot of money for these kinds of operations. There's only so much manpower.

       Did you actually read the article?? Because it doesn't say he was given $40 million. "Democratic strategist David Brock’s network are aiming to raise roughly $40 million in 2017"...I'll just assume you either suffer from dyslexia or are just a rabid Trump supporter taking shit.
