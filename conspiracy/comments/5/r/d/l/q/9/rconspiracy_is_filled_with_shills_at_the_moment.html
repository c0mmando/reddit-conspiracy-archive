<p>There is many more subreddits where that came from. <a href="/r/SubredditCancer">/r/SubredditCancer</a> has a lot more details about other new anti-Trump subreddits. This is not a post I would normally make here but I think if every important the users and moderators be extremely weary of who comes in.
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/david-brock-fundraising-trump-233974">David Brock was recently given 40 million to manipulate social media</a> , all this stuff we are seeing is it in action. Reddit will likely die out but I would bet that some of those power mods will try to infiltrate here and take over this subreddit as well. I will continue to come to very few subs when the site dies as a whole. Good luck </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on Reddit for about the same time as you, I think for real this is gonna be the end. Over time the site has been getting progressively worse, mostly the past year or two. Pretty much since Spez got hired. So much advertising, now legit propaganda warfare. I thought the Russian propaganda was bad, this is next level shit. The site will die because of the power moderators. I think within a month many subreddits will Seriously begin decaying, the only ones who will last are single purpose subs like the_donald, conservative, UFOs, </p>

<p>And the newest talking point is referring to trumps army of online bots. I don&#39;t care what you think of trump or his followers, but that enthusiasm is 99% organic.

<p>First of all, it&#39;s really unlikely all (or even most) of that money is going to reddit. Most of it is probably going to places where misinformation spreads fast, like Facebook/Twitter/etc. And even if they were on reddit, they certainly wouldn&#39;t waste their time on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It would be targeted at other, bigger subs.</p>

<p>Second of all, that&#39;s not a lot of money for these kinds of operations. There&#39;s only so much manpower.</p>
