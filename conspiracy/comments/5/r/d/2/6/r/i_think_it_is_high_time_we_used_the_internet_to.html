       Not a single person that I have talked to knew what MKUltra was when asked. Their face goes from curious to
       <strong>
        ABSOLUTELY BETRAYED
       </strong>
       every damn time. MKUltra is one of the most disturbing conspiracies of our time, and we have a damn Wikipedia article about it. We have a Wikipedia about
       <strong>
        CIA mind-control
       </strong>
       . I know I'm preaching to the choir, but folks we are talking about MIND CONTROL. This is the biggest violation of the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks, have we been sitting on a goldmine? We try to tell people about 9/11 - gets dismissed without evidence. We try to tell people about Sandy Hook - gets dismissed without evidence. Boston Bombing - gets dismissed without evidence. Project MKUltra - gets dismissed without evid- wait..
       <strong>
        WHAT... YOU MEAN WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE CIA ACTUALLY USED MIND CONTROL???
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well yeah,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is quite literally the only article an American needs to read to have absolute disgust for their government. This is a violation of our rights to the fullest extent. Can we stop looking like lunatics to the outside? Let's get them on our side. You may think that everyone and their mother has heard of Project MKUltra, but that is simply not true. I am willing to estimate that less than 10% of the U.S. population knows what MKUltra is. Let's make it 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is anyone else down to start this? Let's start a hashtag. Let's expose the CIA. I don't want them to ever gain an ounce of trust from the American public. I say we start piling our ideas in this thread. We can literally create a movement, and if you guys are with me, we will. Let's use the internet to our full advantage.

       MK Ultra Sub project 68 was one of the most fucked up:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        n addition to LSD, he experimented with various paralytic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting a subject into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple statements. These experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postnatal depression; many suffered permanent debilitation after these treatments. Such consequences included incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents. His work was inspired and paralleled by the psychiatrist William Sargant, who was also involved with the Intelligence Services and experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me wonder if these experiments are still going on? What were the final results? Did they perfect brainwashing? Could some of the attackers in the mass shootings / terrorist attacks around the world be MK ULTRA subjects? Are alien abductees actually recalling being abducted by MK ULTRA doctors to be experimented on then having their minds erased?
      </p>
      <p>
       So many questions.

       I believe the Ft. Lauderdale airport shooting was a sloppy MKUltra operation. The evidence is all there IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Esteban Santiago literally told the FBI that the CIA was in his head telling him to watch ISIS videos. What the actual fuck? Then he's allowed a gun and shoots up an airport.

       Hmm, very interesting indeed! I did not know about "Esteban Santiago" saying he heard the CIA in his head? I wonder if that could be the
       <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/">
        V2K (voice-to-skull) technology
       </a>
       the military were buying back in 2008? Even more so, I wonder if V2K tech was something that came out of the MK ULTRA experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       A little bit about V2k:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sound is induced in the head of a person by radiating the head with microwaves in the range of 100 megahertz to 10,000 megahertz that are modulated with a particular waveform. The waveform consists of frequency modulated bursts. Each burst is made up of ten to twenty uniformly spaced pulses grouped tightly together. The burst width is between 500 nanoseconds and 100 microseconds. The pulse width is in the range of 10 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond. The bursts are frequency modulated by the audio input to create the sensation of hearing in the person whose head is irradiated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The reason I mention this because MK ULTRA sub project 68 specifically focused on inducing sounds and thoughts into peoples minds.

       You should look into Jose Delgado's research. Even the New York Times reported on his mind control tech back in 1965. It was advanced even then, although I suspect it was nothing but a limited hangout.

       The most fucked up thing is that even Kanye fans are brainwashed. Very few people/fans on r/Kanye cared or even realized what was going on when he was taken. I made so many posts regarding MK and people laughed it all off. Even when I connected Resnick psychiatric hospital to Hillary Clinton directly (campaign contributors of the hospital were her billionaire friends). He puts so many little clues in his music, videos, speeches... They're still clueless.

       this link under psychological it talks about Sub project 68 and Dr. Cameron in Canada. This part is particularly note worthy considering the attention pedophilia has in conspiracies lately
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1957, with funding from a CIA front organization, Donald Ewen Cameron of the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada began MKULTRA Subproject 68.[131] His experiments were designed to first "depattern" individuals, erasing their minds and memories—reducing them to the mental level of an infant—and then to "rebuild" their personality in a manner of his choosing.[132] To achieve this, Cameron placed patients under his "care" into drug-induced comas for up to 88 days, and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months, often administering up to 360 shocks per person. He would then perform what he called "psychic driving" experiments on the subjects, where he would repetitively play recorded statements, such as "You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company", through speakers he had implanted into blacked-out football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects (for sensory deprivation purposes). The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages, played for 16–20 hours a day, for weeks at a time. In one case, Cameron forced a person to listen to a message non-stop for 101 days.[132] Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse stables behind Allan Memorial into an elaborate isolation and sensory deprivation chamber where he kept patients locked in for weeks at a time.[132] Cameron also induced insulin comas in his subjects by giving them large injections of insulin, twice a day, for up to two months at a time.[113]
        <em>
         Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments
        </em>
        .[133]

       Splintering personalities. People in traumatic situations create a barrier in their personality to protect their core from the trauma. That part may even splinter off from the rest of their memory in cases of extreme stress and may include a variety of irrational behavior that the person has no memory of. So they splinter the personality, then switch over to a splinter and hypnotise the splinter - maybe to carryout an assasination and shout allah akbar. Then the person is switcched back to their main personality and has no idea that they are a weapon. A trigger is installed to switch into the splintered personality and execute the orders given under hypnosis. Then when it's all done the person is confused and has no idea what happened. The only drawback is people can't shoot accurately under hypnosis which is why multiple shooters are reported and subsequently covered up.

       Yep. Torture-based mind control has been used for a llooooonnng time because of that splintering. Those splits can re-integrate though under the right circumstances, causing the person to recall some of what happened during the creation or life of that state.

       Yea, it's a natural response to repeated trauma. I think it almost exclusively happens when the trauma starts at a very young age.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's used in mind control because a fragmented mind can be almost computer-like. Call out an alter and they can pick up wherever they left off last time they were "out". Also, fragmentation can cause some parts to have a very very strong memory. There are lots of reasons for someone who wanted to control a person to take advantage of dissociation.

        consisted of putting a subject into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple statements.

       This is incredibly dangerous. It was tried with people in the military after the first Iraq invasion on people who had PTSD.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no tape loops or noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was to give their mind a break from all the shit they'd seen and been through. 
It is dangerous because essentially you are putting an individual under a general anaesthetic for days at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A regular surgical operation under a general is risky enough, let alone keeping someone under a general anaesthetic for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for putting someone under a general anaesthetic for months, even without the tape loops or statements - they're going to be fucked up that's if they survive at all.

       One thing is for sure that they have successfully mapped the electrical activity of the brain in various states like happiness, terror, anger etc... it's possible to take that electronic signature and broadcast that as rf over a widespread area and influence the way a mass amount of people feel. You want people to be angry? No problem, it's probably as easy as pushing a button at this point.

       Yup. He was not who he claimed to be. He was an informant and directly connected to MkUltra. If you are interested in the statements he made about making LSD illegal i would watch Gnostic Medias Youtube video "fifty years of flower power" where they cite the exact location of that testimony. Maybe I will watch it again so I can tell you.

       Well if they wanted people to use drugs they would make them legal. The War on Drugs is about jailing anyone and everyone who uses even a minute amount of drugs. The private prison lobby spends lots of money to keep drugs illegal so their prisons can be constantly filled.

       War driving is remotely performed on targeted individuals.  Continuous wave laser on the tail bone or hip during sleep paralyses TIs. We wake up but cannot immediately move. Sleep paralysis.

       The noise is "the Hum" which is subliminal messages modulated in  ultrasound.  Loud and vibrational.  Measurable by holding a phone next to an ear and above the head using a vibration app, sound decible app and a sound analyzer app.

       while sleeping, the brain zapping is pulsed EMF. Not just electric. A gauss mter measures the high magnetic field. Transcranial magnetic stimulation. The purpose is to dumb down.

        Apparatus and method for remote manipulation of nervous systems by the magnetic dipole field of a rotating bar magnet. Reliance on modulation of spontaneous spiking patterns of sensory nerve receptors, and exploitation of a resonance mechanism of certain neural circuits, allows the use of very weak magnetic fields.
        <strong>
         This, together with the large magnetic moments that can be obtained with a permanent bar magnet, makes it possible to effectively manipulate the nervous system of a subject over a distance of several hundred meters, using a small portable battery-powered device. The method can be used in law enforcement for standoff situations.

       Oh, let's do this. I can show you at least three threads I have done in r/ subliminal about how in the programs they contain subs and tons of Masonic and other satanic inference. It's full of encoded things. Familar childhood symbols. They have fucked our minds through that box. Like the box in the mk ultra scenario, only we agree to participate in being dumbed down into a trance state and fed whatever they hell they want. Some of the codes are messages to each other. Others are just " Sex" subs to equate a product as sexy. And of course sex sells. Commercials for charms are actually suggesting illness to people to sell their pills. People aren't aware the programming is effecting their perception. It's a scary hole to go down.

       But everyone has watched television since they were children here and we have been programmed to be consumers who obey authority.

       THAT is impressive. Good catch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like how they used to literally flash games that said "SEX", they do it with sek in this commercial. But just for a split second, before she takes her rightful place as sek. She is supposed to literally be sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the service is equated to her dumping syrup with a mischievous look on her face in a bright hot red dress. Saying "why settle for less".
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the whole commercial before reading your post and taking a close look. I didn't catch a thing.. Consciously..

       I never watched TV even when I was growing up.  Or at least, maybe only an hour a year or so in odd situations.  Advertising is so foreign and disturbing when I am subjected to it.

       I wonder the same thing. I have never been a tv or movie watcher. Maybe a little Brady Bunch after school, but that was it. So to me, people that are really into shows or whatever have always seemed brainwashed or addicted to that shit.

       My problem with the whole "tv is all mind control" thing is, who is adding this sophisticated mind control stuff? Does the CIA directly edit and direct tv shows, commercials, etc? No. These are advertisers, and the use what works. It's not as nefarious as people make it out to be. I know people who edit and produce for advertising agencies. They have no idea how to hypnotize anyone, let alone advanced mind control techniques. The extent of their knowledge is basically "make it look cool and sexy."

       A lot of the higher end advertising are able to keep the secret of what they are doing. Subliminal s are supposed to be a no go. Not allowed. They just found better ways to get them in there. It's the same idea though. Watch a commercial about a phone and your being fed sex without even knowing it. Shame on them.

       It is literally clockwork orange, the Riddler in Batman Forever if I remember correctly, Disturbing Behavior, references to it everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want to make it really easy for someone, it is just
       <em>
        weaponized hypnosis
       </em>
       . Hypnosis has been known about forever but it shocks people to think that the most well funded industry in the world would weaponize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also people should understand "mind control" covers a spectrum. On one end it's nothing more than conditioning or propaganda, like making you numb to violence and war so you think it's just normal and no big deal (military cadences exactly this). Then you could have subliminal messages, both auditory and visually. Next is the hypnosis like you can research anywhere (just with subtly having a video display patterns to bring about the effect like a swinging watch or waving finger - just look into it). Then if you want the Manchurian candidate assassins from Monarch or Knightmare, like a Jason Bourne, many mass murderers, the cases where people can't remember what they did or other bizarre things like suicide bombers, the methods are more secret but a recurring theme is inflicting some severe trauma, like some satanic ritual abuse cases, the use of LSD, sensory deprivation and sleep deprivation for extremely long periods, inducing Stockholm syndrome, and using some sorts of symbols or themes to guide the person without them realizing. One of the old ones was using the Wizard of Oz for the subject to associate something "lost" like his heart or his brain, then told  like "you will follow the yellow brick road and the you will find what you are missing" which serves as the "finger snap" similar to hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a terrible explanation but hopefully people understand the concept just to be aware of it. If you want a psychedelic trip look into Australia's "The Family," where many kids had their lives ruined. They were even swapping the kids identities, with official passports and all, multiple times in their life. You also may recognize some other undiscussed topics, like the bleached-blonde hair of the members.

       I only have a passing idea about MKUltra, I'm absolutely willing to listen to more.  But I must tell you: if Wikipedia is your only source, then a year ago, before my eyes were opened , I would have been MUCH more likely to be blow off Wikipedia as a source.  Knowing that there are plenty of groups paid to adjust Wikipedia articles, it would be easy for me to assume the whole thing was kooky tin-foil territory
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be worth the time to generate some new articles and op-eds to give the idea greater legitimacy.

       I know they said that it was MK Ultra in the show, but wasn't the actual MK Ultra about controlling people's minds, and not (SPOILERS) teaching people to control things with their mind, utilizing a different dimension?

       That was really interesting, thanks for showing it to me. It really seems like the Duffer Brothers did their research. However, I still feel like the alternate dimension (which was entirely a creation of the writers (as far as we know)) was more in the limelight than the Mk Ultra experiments. Yes, it was a very large part of the plot, but if the viewer didn't know of MK Ultra being a real thing in the first place, they wouldn't make that connection, so it wouldn't be the best way of informing the masses, IMHO.

       Absolutely correct! Now my opinion regarding your astute observation is that
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it was pushed as a "Look everyone! Look at all this wacky stuff this TV show government did that we also did in real life! LOOK!!! EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW THIS!!!" then I'd put money on the fact that most people would turn away from wanting to know more about like, like a pushy door-to-door evangelist; any militant stance in a persuasive argument (assuming the goal of this whole example is to persuade the audience into researching MK Ultra) is almost guaranteed to to fail from the very start (in my opinion and in my experience).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead what I think the creators of this show wanted to do was leave enough easter eggs–either filmed on camera or written into the script itself–for those of us who are well read on this subject to connect the dots and be the ones to explain the history and inspiration for this show. Which I always thought was clever given the title of the show: "Ya dude, this show is trippy. Wanna know something even trippier tho...? 'STRANGER THINGS' have actually happened in
       <em>
        real life!
       </em>
       Check it out, go to the wikipedia page for MK Ultra."
      </p>
      <p>
       If persuading people into being interested in this stuff is the game, what a masterful chess move by the creators to let all knowledge-levels participate and play their role (i.e. the newbie drawn in by the show/cinematography/soundtrack; and the conspiracy population sitting right next to the newbie to guide his future research).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I am in no way positive on any of that; just theories that make sense for now. :)

       Errol Morris just made a mini-series for Netflix about MK Ultra, and the death of Dr. Frank Olson, who was secretly dosed with LSD by the CIA, after he told of his plans to quit working for the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the first I heard about CIA assassination manuals, which you can find online. One method is to throw your victim off a high floor and make it look like a suicide. To subdue your target before, it is suggested you knock the target out with a blunt object. That way, there is minimal struggle, and minimal evidence. Frank Olson was killed by being thrown out of a hotel window, but the government ruled it a suicide. There was blunt force trauma to his head, not related to the fall. His family has been fighting the government's official account for decades to clear his name. This is the center of the new Errol Morris series.

       TVs hypnotize is? Or we just zone out? You can say the same thing happens when driving, probably more frequently for me because I don't watch much tv. But psychoactive drugs in the water supply? Evidence for this? Not "pituitary gland calcification!" BS, but solid evidence? Mind control is disgusting and out government absolutely uses it and knows more about it than are willing to admit, but I want to stay away from speculation if we can.

       Idk about psychoactive but this is what the conclusion I've come to. TV is normalized and it seems like it should be in every household even radios so you don't miss out on what's going on and if the emergency broadcasts and such but when you had things like floride and other chemicals into the drinking water to dumb down people that way the propaganda is easier to digest from tv or be more acceptable to certain airwave frequencies. But idk just my 2 cents I would like any other ideas

       Yes I can read, but I can say without a doubt due to my background, that it's not in any medication on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about why it's not. Despite having M3 antagonism, it's a stronger hallucinogen than LSD and probably equal potency as a dissociative equal to that of Ketamine or PCP. Again, why was it used over LSD in MKULTRA? Those reasons.

       I read a book called "The shock doctrine" by Naomi Klein which talked about this. Basically the CIA said that they needed to fund this program as they "believed" that the soviets had been able to brainwash captured american soldiers to their communist cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the CIA started MKUltra under the guise that they would combat this brainwashing. However what ended up happening was they gained insight into the most effective torture methods that are still used to this day.

       I like what you're saying but MKUltra is old. It's declassified. Heck, they declassified remote viewing. Other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spread it all you want but the real question for this forum is what are they doing NOW?
      </p>
      <p>
       If MKU is from the era of vacuum tubes and slide rules, what do we do in the age of nanometer transistors and iphones?
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of "woke" individuals is growing, and it is growing rapidly. But you will always have people like my mother-in-law who literally get a glazed look on their face when you try to tell them anything at all even remotely related to anything conspiratorial. She doesn't even understand that CNN is "Fake News" and likely never will get to that point.

       "They" have access to the Akashic Records and the source code of this simulation we know as reality. They use our ears as microphones and our eyes as cameras. Every sensory input we get, is livestreamed to them. They read all of our thoughts.

       I've heard the same from people in the astral projection sub. Several of them have tried projecting to Area 51, but there supposedly appears to be some astral barrier preventing them from entering, and they're immediately sent back to their physical bodies.

       Id never advocate calling families but something is definitely off about sandy hook, there are many things but the most obvious to look at is the video of people cycling in and out of the firehouse.... That day was questionable.... But even if it was 100%faked, i wouldnt doubt they would. Just kill kids anyways.

       I think spreading awareness of MK Ultra is key, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's scope is bigger than you think, the TV you watch, the radio you listen to &amp; the mall you shop at is ALL purposely and meticulously made to be the way it is, to precisely control and lull your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am 100% sure, that some people that you will show the MKUltra article to will be in full out-denial, don't take this personally, for these people have already given their minds. But these people are the ones who need the most help.

       I think the Quebec Mosque shooting was part of an MKUltra experiment, I'm not afraid to say that I struggle with mental illness and I'll have 5minutes to an hour of hostility and dark thoughts seemingly at random, once I saw the headline about the Quebec Mosque shooting and how they yelled "Allahu Akbar" during it I literally felt terror. I shit you not, the prior week of the shooting I had a few hours where I was in a very dark mood and had violent thoughts and they were literally relative to what happened in Quebec, the shouting allahu akbar, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I am not going to act out on any of those thoughts, yes I am seeking help through family and doctors and I am slowly getting better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it is sheer coincidence that when I was in my dark mood I had these thoughts but then to see it ACTUALLY HAPPEN has me extremely worried, it feels like a wave of suggestions and once that wave hits someone it effects their thoughts and thoughts lead to action, I no way am condoning that horrific shooting and I'm not trying to make it sound like the shooters are 'victims', justice will be served but I just find it so eerie that I think it is MKUltra related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without going into specifics does anyone else recall any dark suggestive thoughts prior to something terrible actually happening?

       MK-Ultra is iconic in popular culture!  Who are the idiots youre talking to who are so culturally illiterate that they are unfamiliar with this program?

       Our government has always and always will feel that they are entitled to us for whatever use. They feel like they are untouchable, and they have every right to violate our privacy and our own minds. Not just with MKultra, but with assault by advertising. Have you ever heard that info on how a great portion of very successful leaders and people in general are sociopaths/psychopaths? Well, think about it. Who else would be able to do the things these people do to us on a daily basis and not break at any point? Not an average person, that's for sure. And they know they are not average people, and that is the problem. They see themselves as better. A leader, a governor is supposed to be held at the same standard and societal level as the lowest members of a society, or it will always end up like the situation we are seeing now. A real leader would fight a battle on the frontline with his followers, but our leaders
       <em>
        cause
       </em>
       the wars, and then sit back in their comfy "fortresses" so to say, while we fight the battles for them. This is wrong and it needs to change, but holding these people accountable in this day and age will take as many of us as possible and even possible a forcible removal of these people's pride, if you get what I am saying. A revolution, which I feel is closer and closer every day.

       It's interesting reading this thread, seeing how far down the rabbit hole different people have gone. At the start there is actual solid evidence and documents, and reasonable valid opinions. The further down you go, the more those opinions rely on circumstantial things, guesswork, etc. Not making fun of these people, but it is important that we realize that it eventually stops being believable at some point. How do you know when to stop? How far down is 'safe'?

       I believe the Ft. Lauderdale airport shooting was a sloppy MKUltra operation. The evidence is all there IMO.
      </p>

       Esteban Santiago literally told the FBI that the CIA was in his head telling him to watch ISIS videos. What the actual fuck? Then he's allowed a gun and shoots up an airport.

        In 1957, with funding from a CIA front organization, Donald Ewen Cameron of the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada began MKULTRA Subproject 68.[131] His experiments were designed to first "depattern" individuals, erasing their minds and memories—reducing them to the mental level of an infant—and then to "rebuild" their personality in a manner of his choosing.[132] To achieve this, Cameron placed patients under his "care" into drug-induced comas for up to 88 days, and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months, often administering up to 360 shocks per person. He would then perform what he called "psychic driving" experiments on the subjects, where he would repetitively play recorded statements, such as "You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company", through speakers he had implanted into blacked-out football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects (for sensory deprivation purposes). The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages, played for 16–20 hours a day, for weeks at a time. In one case, Cameron forced a person to listen to a message non-stop for 101 days.[132] Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse stables behind Allan Memorial into an elaborate isolation and sensory deprivation chamber where he kept patients locked in for weeks at a time.[132] Cameron also induced insulin comas in his subjects by giving them large injections of insulin, twice a day, for up to two months at a time.[113]
        <em>
         Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments

        Apparatus and method for remote manipulation of nervous systems by the magnetic dipole field of a rotating bar magnet. Reliance on modulation of spontaneous spiking patterns of sensory nerve receptors, and exploitation of a resonance mechanism of certain neural circuits, allows the use of very weak magnetic fields.
        <strong>
         This, together with the large magnetic moments that can be obtained with a permanent bar magnet, makes it possible to effectively manipulate the nervous system of a subject over a distance of several hundred meters, using a small portable battery-powered device. The method can be used in law enforcement for standoff situations.

       Splintering personalities. People in traumatic situations create a barrier in their personality to protect their core from the trauma. That part may even splinter off from the rest of their memory in cases of extreme stress and may include a variety of irrational behavior that the person has no memory of. So they splinter the personality, then switch over to a splinter and hypnotise the splinter - maybe to carryout an assasination and shout allah akbar. Then the person is switcched back to their main personality and has no idea that they are a weapon. A trigger is installed to switch into the splintered personality and execute the orders given under hypnosis. Then when it's all done the person is confused and has no idea what happened. The only drawback is people can't shoot accurately under hypnosis which is why multiple shooters are reported and subsequently covered up.

These experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postnatal depression; many suffered permanent debilitation after these treatments

       This is incredibly dangerous. It was tried with people in the military after the first Iraq invasion on people who had PTSD.

      <p>
       There was no tape loops or noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was to give their mind a break from all the shit they'd seen and been through. 
It is dangerous because essentially you are putting an individual under a general anaesthetic for days at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A regular surgical operation under a general is risky enough, let alone keeping someone under a general anaesthetic for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for putting someone under a general anaesthetic for months, even without the tape loops or statements - they're going to be fucked up that's if they survive at all.

       One thing is for sure that they have successfully mapped the electrical activity of the brain in various states like happiness, terror, anger etc... it's possible to take that electronic signature and broadcast that as rf over a widespread area and influence the way a mass amount of people feel. You want people to be angry? No problem, it's probably as easy as pushing a button at this point.
