       Although this is referred to as "Neoconservative" it's important to call out that the Obama administration diligently continued the work.

       The author of that article needs to do some more research.  It's also pretty clear that he doesn't understand what a neocon is.  I suppose I should expect this from a Murdoch owned media group.

       Pinning this on the names and faces of presidents (Clintons, Bushes, Obamas etc) directs attention away from the power structure of the 1% that plan, organize, control, and profit by these initiatives.

       Trump was talking like a warmonger before he was elected, particularly against Iran. Heck, he's already made a raid that killed an American SEAL and an American child as a part of a Saudi proxy war in Yemen.

       You're giving me talking points you heard on the news. And they are DESIGNED to mislead you. You probably don't even know what the power alignment is in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which side is Iran on in the war in Syria? Who else is on that side? Which nations are opposed to that?
      </p>
      <p>
       We literally can't even have a conversation because you think in memes that have been planted in your head from the outside. "Trump is fighting Iran!"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, he isn't. It's CLEARLY a PR stunt designed to hide his pivot AWAY from the Britain/Saudi alliance to overthrow the Syrian government, and TOWARD the Russia/Syria/Iran side in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're less at risk of war with Iran than at any time in decades. Go ahead and downvote this post and then repeat your media-produced talking points a second time... OR, go do some research on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read what the leaders of Iran, Russian, and Syria are saying about the situation. They speak quite clearly and openly.

       Regardless of any connections between the US, the Afghanistan Mujahideen, and the original al-Qaeda, al-Zarqawi's al-Qaeda in Iraq was a separate organization that rose to prominence in response to the US occupation in Iraq... unless you are saying that the US was funding al-Qaeda to fight US troops in Iraq, which would be a claim that I have never heard from anyone.

       Al-Qaeda was a faction of the Mujahadeen just like Ahmad Shah Massoud was one, too. That doesn't mean that all of the Mujahadeen were one and the same, because they most certainly were not.

       I asked this question earlier, but all I received was downvoted in response: Do you think the US was funding al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) while they were fighting US troops in Iraq? Do we have ANY evidence of this?

       The CIA had little motivation to fund al-Qaeda during those years. It isn't as if the US invaded some country and took their resources under Clinton, so the proof is in the pudding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al-Qaeda at that time was an emerging threat after the fall of the Soviet Union, but it wasn't a well-known one until later in the 1990s.

       Any "lost" nukes were probably grabbed by a state or we would have seen them used by this point, especially by al-Qaeda.

       I fully agree that the US, more specifically, the CIA, has been funding FSA Islamist groups, but they weren't necessarily al-Nusra itself (though some groups shift allegiance, such as the Islamists with Turkey's Euphrates Shield). Remember, while ISIS and al-Nusra were under the al-Qaeda umbrella at one time as ISIL, they've been hostile enemies ever since they split. (I've been following the Syrian Civil War for some time as a pro-YPG Redditor.)
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, that document you just showed made a point that I wanted to mention earlier. The Syrian government was allowing AQI to operate out of Syria against the US last decade, so it wasn't the CIA who were funding al-Zarqawi 's group at that time but regional state actors hostile to the US invasion and occupation.

       Just curious, are you just regurgitating cnn talking points or did you actually read the articles? Asking, because it sounds like the former. The 8 year old girl was the daughter of Anwar Al-awlaki, who was a terrorist, even if a dual citizen. It is sad it happened, no child deserves death, but at the same time it's not just "some" 8 yr old. If you want more fodder how about all the other women and children killed in the raid? Did you read that the women shot back too? Do you honestly think they are innocent? They knowingly put themselves and their children in harm's way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sort of like the sanctions against Iran, "oh! He is a warmonger". Or could it be that sanctions were already drawn up by Obama and Trump just delivered them at an appropriate time?

       CNN talking points? Are you saying that Trump didn't launch a mission to attack al-Qaeda or he hasn't used bellicose language against Iran? Are you using Trump White House talking points? Is this Sean Spicer?

       That doesn't mean she was guilty by association. She was a little girl, though I know Trump did say that we have to kill terrorist's families, so maybe this is part of his strategy.

       Yes, dozens were killed during the raid. That doesn't sound like a very clean operation with SEALS engaging in firefights killing civilians.

       I haven't heard anything about the women shooting back, though it certainly would make the mission sound rather poorly planned if we are attacking a compound where people lived. How do we even know if they were terrorists?

      <p>
       I am not talking about the sanctions. Trump has said that military force isn't off the table. Now, it's probably that military force wasn't off the table with Obama, either, but the Republicans have indicated a willingness to "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran," and that desire doesn't seem to have subsided with Trump.

       The thing is, Obama signed a deal with Iran. That requires them to hold up their end of the bargain in order for them to continue their uranium enrichment program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was a horrible deal to start, but there's a difference between starting a frivolous conflict, and calling someone out for specifically breaking agreements.

       Negative. It's an unsigned, non-legally binding agreement. Iranian parliament approved, but the Supreme leader denied it and didn't sign, and he has final say-so. Additionally, Congress rejected it, so Obama used an executive treaty(like a executive order, but for foreign affairs.) Their are no set agreements other than Iran is not permitted to build or test nuclear weapons. It was a preemptive social conditioning for the upcoming false-flag/ or declaration of war.

       He's drastically shifted US geopolitical strategy AWAY from wars, you just don't see that because you think that bombing ISIS is pro-war. ISIS is a US creation that is perpetuating the war in Syria. BY turning on them, Trump is turning against the Saudis, and against toppling elected governments.

       This right here. I can see why the leftists say Trump supporters are dumbasses, some dudes just don't get it.

       I have a theory the writing is on the wall for Iran. I was somewhat young when the buildup to the 2003 surge started but all these recent events sure sound like the beginning of another surge. Since Russia is on good terms with the U.S. it would seem Iran is on their own. Perfect time for another coincidence.

       I'd be curious to see the turn out. Iran's defense minister just had "tough talk" about the missile thing. The development of this situation should be interesting to say the least. Russia may improve diplomacy and Gazprom may put a pipeline from Baku to EUR by the way of syria instead of Iran if things get dicey.

       ^ I'd be curious to see what will happen these next 3 years since apparently KSA is suffering a bit, the Kennedy files are this year, and that 9/11 pub is in the works (which if released will suck for diplomacy W/KSA).
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be a start. I'm sure a Conspiracist has a video to break it down even further. Myself I'm going to start George Webb's Dyncorp series and JFK to 911 doc on youtube. I believe those break them down even more.

       I don't believe everyone thinks Trumpers are dumb but keeping a neutral point I can see why. I cannot explain things like my theories to them without being attacked. If I told them that the current political climate, especially the public and mil support, is perfect for another surge that would not bode well with them. I wonder if there are some neutral folks among them that can analyze everything and deduce there is something afoot.

       Truly amazes me that people still see Trump as some good guy on a crusade to clean up the world. Those that believe he has some sort of benevolent agenda to 'drain the swamp' and change the world and take down pizza gate are fucking deluded.

       Trump is pivoting away from the policy of supporting ISIS to topple the Syrian regime. I'd read more into that than some shit-talking to Iran.

       Iran opposes ISIS. ISIS is supported by the US, Britain, and Saudi Arabia, primarily. And opposed by Russia and Iran primarily.

       Trump shifted that, and is joining the coalition opposed to ISIS.

       If this is a surprise, you weren't paying attention during his campaign. Trump has always made it clear that he intends to attack Iran on behalf of his puppet masters in Israel.

       Actually Syria is still the primary and arguably only obstacle, so assuming Trump is some closet zionazi filling the Greater Israel conspiracy role, he's not doing a good job.

      <p>
       That being said he did denounce a really one-sided shitty deal we had with iran, and gave them a punishment after they broke a UN missile testing sanction.

       No agreement was broken.  Iran deal is broken into binding provisions and suggestions.  The ones that say "we call X to do Y"  are suggestions,  non binding.  The part about ballistic missiles is a "call to",  ergo non binding.

       Do you have evidence or does everyone in this sub believe Israel rules the world? One could argue we're instigating war with Iran on the behalf of Saudi Arabia who's been a more important ally for a longer period of time. Saudi Arabia and Iran have been the dominant powers struggling for control of the Middle East and fighting proxy wars for decades, Israel cannot stand without the US

       If Trump really is all about America first, then that would most likely be what he would choose. The only reason we don't is because of our unconditional support for Israel. Which seems to put him at a real crossroads, and we should all hope that he'll take the road that doesn't lead to WW3.

       Entitled.. well thats more of a biblical answer but you may not accept that which is far so i offer this. Many nations have changed borders and hands.. why does israel bother you but not serbia/croatia or the ottoman empire or the fall of the USSR? Why does only israel make people mad?

       No things in life are fair. We killed natives here in america with small pox and rifles. If you can take power and hold it.. then you have it. I love Hagee and AIPAC and whatever power they have is deserved. Just like africa has been a shithole for 6000 years and america became a world power in 2 centuries. Power earned is earned. Israel is tiny and no one can defeat them. Now or ever again. Fact.

       When Europeans stole Native lands, it was horribly wrong. When the United States violates treaties held by Native tribes it's still horribly wrong. When Israel throws people out of their homes and steals their land; in violation of treaties agreed upon; with the audacity to claim it's the will of God because they are "special"- it's despicable.

       Egypt was a world superpower starting from 3150 BC for about 1250 years. Archeologists and historians divide this time into the old kingdom, the middle kingdom and the new kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have heard of the Egyptians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was to Egypt that Abraham went to avoid famine. It was into Egypt that Joseph was sold. It was Egypt where Jacob sent Josephs brothers to get food when famine hit Palestine. It was Egyptians who enslaved these people called that history calls Jews till God freed them. It was Eygpt who put an end to Solomons empire after his death. It was Egyptians who probably broke the Judean kingdom at the battle of Megiddo where King Josiah was killed and allowed it to be conquered by the Babylonians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Egyptians who invented things like hieroglyphics, ink, calenders, make-up, sun clocks, papyrus the plow, breath mints, toothpaste, designed ships that sailed the rivers and in the oceans, worked with gold, glass, and bronze.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Egyptians also built things like the Pyramids, the Spinx, temples in Karnak and Luxor, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is Egypt?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Africa. For 1250 and beyond it wasn't a backward shithole. And the way things are going I can't see U.S. lasting a hundred years let alone a thousand.

       Hagee and AIPAC are illegal agents of a foreign government. As with the endless violations of the Symington amendment, they're given a pass by blackmailed, bought-off "Presidents", because dufuses believe the Hate-State is needed "to make Jesus come".

       This will not last. The U.S. will not last, in large part because of the soul-destroying acts it's committed for

       The government's "pursuit" of AIPAC and its predecessor was half-assed at best and corrupt at worst and the latest example is repugnant:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the 1950s President Eisenhower's administration repeatedly demanded the leaders of the American Zionist Council register as "agents of a foreign government."[35] In November 1962 Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's Department of Justice ordered the American Zionist Council to register as a foreign agent because of FARA violations alleging it was being funded by the Jewish Agency for Israel and acting on behalf of Israel. The Department of Justice later withdrew its demand.[27]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The American Zionist Council was reorganized as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). In 1988 former Senator William Fulbright in the 1970s and former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti, unsuccessfully petitioned the Department of Justice to register the lobby under the Act.[36]
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2005 case of United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman against United States Department of Defense employee Larry Franklin and American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman[37][38] raised the possibility that AIPAC would come under greater scrutiny by the Department of Justice. While Franklin pleaded guilty to passing government secrets to Rosen and Weissman, as well as to an Israeli government official,[39][40] the cases against Rosen and Weissman were dismissed and no actions against AIPAC were instituted.[36]

       Bro as much as I hate bankers n shit, a lot of the bad stereotypes of Judaism come from
       <strong>
        international
       </strong>
       jews who are opposed (publicly, alas they still bias media towards israel) to Zionism. Anti-Zionist jews talk about non-jews in the most derogatory way in private, seriously check it out on youtube, and they have the banks/education stuff. I'm aware the Rothchilds at one time helped form Israel, but in the context of their role compared to their overall power, it's not significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways we have a unique opportunity with Zionist jews being focused on just living in their lives, I'm not saying Israel is perfect by ANY stretch (USS Liberty, Mossad/Egypt/Sayanim false flag) but give the dude some credit for being open, it's not easy to willingly be a public target for all the anti-jewish sentiment. I'm a patriotic American and I still hate the CIA with a passion

       Could also be a negotioation tactic. Make people think all cards are on the table. So far Trump has been the same if not slightly better than our last 2 presidents in some aspects (wouldnt vote for him, but ill admit i am cautiously hopeful)... But it seems on foreign intervention he will be the same.

       This pisses me off and I can't say I didn't see it coming. Much of Trump's rhetoric has been good but this war mongering? Doesn't he know ISIS was created by US and others?? He is on board with Israel as well and personally, I despise what they have done to the Palestinians

       Do people forget that when he was campaigning in the primaries when he was proclaiming loudly that he loved war and would have no problem using nukes when it came to terrorism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump loves saying that Obama &amp; Clinton are the founders of ISIS.   I wonder what the name of the next big terrorist organization that owes it's creation to Trump will be?   Because, with the poorly aimed ban and pissing war with Iran....he's well on his way to inspiring a whole new generation.

       Hillary supported the Iran Deal. She helped craft it before kerry. She wanted the no fly zone in syria. Trump didn't which is why I voted for him. Iran's problem is that they admitted too violating the deal. What's trump supposed to do? Also if we allow Iran to get a bomb that will lead too saudi Arabia wanting a bomb. Does anyone here want saudi Arabia too get a bomb? The next 9 11 with a nuclear saudi Arabia will leave the island of Manhattan a giant irradiated crater.... also look at North Korea Bill Clinton let them get a bomb by letting them develop nuclear power first. Does anyone here think it's a good idea that north Korea has a get out of jail free card too do what ever they want? When dictators get nukes they get a giant btfo too anyone who wants too try screwing with them.

       Okay, so activate the treaty and demand inspections. Don't put up a red line on fucking twitter and wait for Iran to cross it so you can invade.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all bullshit. This isn't about preventing Iran from getting nukes. Nobody who pays attention to global politics gives a fuck if Iran gets nukes. They won't do anything with it. Iran isn't even anti-US, it's anti-Middle East intervention.

       I understand, But you missed my point. Do you want everyone in the ME to then want one? Saudi's are next. I dont blame Iran for wanting them either. Can you imagine if Syria had them? and ISIS got them somehow? Or If Iran does get them and some zionist in Isreal decieds first strike is better? ALOT of people die when the nukes start too fly. MAD stopped Russia and America, Do you think people with a death wish give a fuck about MAD?

       I'm getting kinda sick of americans not waking up and realizing that their government is basically just an extension of the Israeli one. This has now been going on now for many decades but many americans are still oblivious to it. A lot of americans still think that Trump is the real deal because he shit talks muslims and talks about the dangers of islamic terrorism as if islamic terrorism is the number one threat to the american people and not the actions of their own government. It's just the same old crap that we heard after 9/11 only it's just more direct now from Trump. It's just the usual dehumanization of brown folks in the M.E so americans will be less resistant to bombing them.

       They just keep getting duped every single election, thinking the person they elect will be different and will make good changes only to later realize that the current president was no different from the last one because the same interest were being pursued. And then the next election arrives and they get duped again...How many times can the same trick work? Just how stupid is the average american exactly?
Their ignorance and lack of action has ruined a whole region and it could even escalate to WW3.

       I would also like to add that the dehumanization of the muslim world is way bigger and way more effective now then what it was a decade ago because it is more widespread now then before and that is mostly due to the migrant crisis. 
It was most likely the intentional plan of the EU to bring in as many people as they can from the muslim world without doing any background checks so that even the criminal bad muslims gets to live in some European country. We've seen the effects of it, rapes, murder, theft and all of that has increased in Europe and a lot of the perpetrators are from the muslim world(Even though they do not represent the muslim world as a whole because in muslim countries they would be harshly punished) and the EU takes no action to combat it, instead they want to welcome more of them. Why? Because they know that the crimes will not only continue but they will also continue to rise.. This will just create more and more hatred towards muslims within the populations of Europe which is also why the popularity of the far-right is increasing. This is just another way of dehumanizing all of the muslim world as these barbarian thugs that deserves to be bombed and killed. So if America and its European allies would want to start a war against Iran, I’m sure they would get less resistance from the people because after all, it’s muslims that will get killed right?

       That's the outcome. But it's left-wing governments demanding migration, and left-wing trying to hide the crimes from the news to continue the migration plan. I don't think the left-wing wants the general population to fear migrant crimes as you claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right-wing groups will stop the migration instantly if they were in power. They don't need to create fear of migrants. They would just not open the borders in the first place.

       Have heard of this theory. Have done no research on it. I cannot refute or confirm your statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read about the theory I was reading a book about Viking influence in Russia and it was a footnote.
      </p>
      <p>
       However at this time I knew there where Jewish populations in Palestine, as well from Africa and India that would pose a problem for all Jews being of Kharzar descent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge of Jewish population in Ethopia is on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       My knowledge that there were Jews in India uInknown to the Jews of Europe I read in a history of the church in the east. In the book it mentioned the arrival of the Portuguese in India and its persecution of the church of St Thomas with a side note there was a  they also found a Jewish synagogue which they also persecuted.

       There is the same ignorance in Australia.  We have to do what the Americans say otherwise we don't stand a chance in the world. So we follow regardless and blindly even when it was not un our interest and the US screwed us. We did it in Vietnam, Iraq 1, Afghanistan, Iraq 2, and now Syria. People often forget proud ex aussie Ruppert Murdoch is an ex Australian.

       Yeah, I fully understand your logic and definitely consider it feasible.  The main difference was acknowledging the class warfare. No other presidential candidate has done that in decades.

        While the White House has said the order to bar Iranians and others was made to tackle the threat of terrorism, it is notable that since 1975 no Americans have been killed in terrorist attacks in the US by the citizens of the countries included in the ban.

       Trump has been consistent in regards to Iran, saying there is no way they stop developing weapons despite the deal we struck with them. One of the first things he mentioned after announcing his candidacy was what a shitty deal we made with Iran. I think he is trying to cancel the deal and get our money back/re-install sanctions.

       Iran is a pawn, if Trump and Putin think they could say joint capture the spoils of Iran they would gladly do it. If Russia gets behind actions on Iran it will be the proof of the Trump/Putin alliance, which is really the oil production alliance. They have to stop the advance of solar energy which will destroy the value of the oil reserves they control as well as the leverage control of oil supply gives them over the world.

       Our current economy is dependent on the Petrodollar. Iran, like others before, want to sell their oil without using the US dollar as the medium. Therefore, we will destabilize their country to install a leader who will comply with our demands. Of course the narrative is that they are building bombs, and the "Iran Nuclear Deal" was just a modified and more convincing version of "they have weapons of mass destruction."

       This exactly. I don't know why there aren't more upvotes. The other two countries that decided they weren't going to use the dollar for their oil sales were Iraq and Libya... You see how that turned out for them.

       i personally feel like iran has a right to be a sovereign nation and pursue nuclear ambition for energy purposes. i dont think we should be saber rattling for war with any nation, but we also cant allow these nations to walk all over us and test nuclear capable missles, etc. so im not really for war, or making cases for war (especially interventionist wars) but im not going to be a pacifist and pretend war sometimes is necessary and having a strong military presence and being tough isnt important.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even the stupid "New World Order wants to rule through Socialism" meme is a crock of shit. Oligarchs don't want socialism. It's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard, but it's a conspiracy movement accepted gospel, because the paid think tanks gaming this movement want it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This focus on a fictional New World Order that might occur, is it's own Psy-Op, because it makes people want to defend the existing World Order. It's part of why Trump was elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       And oh look, it's business as fucking usual at the GOP mainstream Old World Order Swamp with Trump's appointees to cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole movement is a joke.

       Yes, well I definitely think that there is a huge threat from the left. Not so much communists, but perhaps it's like Brave New World vs 1984- the left comes in and teaches people to censor themselves ala BNW, re: SJW.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right comes in and uses might to enforce censorship ala 1984, re: Trump's libel laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there would be examples that oppose that "theory" but it just seems a tendency that the left does more brainwashing and the right just takes people already brainwashed and gives them more instructions. Which is why schools and media are left and the military is right.

       I was convinced Hitlery wanted war with Iran. Trump is going for sanctions. I'm totally for using economics and alliances to turn your back on someone, as long as you're willing to revisit it later and determine if it was effective.

       It's a simple distraction play. Trump wants to 'normalise' relations with Russia. The hawks in Washington need to be thrown some kind of none to distract them while that goes on, and Iran fits the bill for many reasons.

       Trump is a cartoon villain from a prepared playbook, he'll wreck Iran then when the ensuing (also pre-planned) chaos and carnage spreads throughout the already destabilized region he'll get the blame, while the neocons will have surreptitiously (and unattributedly) achieved their aim.

       He's doing it to prevent the "shadow governments" WWlll with Russia. If we are at war with Iran, can't hardly be involved in a WW with russia at the same time.                                                                                        "In his knowing what is being plotted against him by this Vatican-Communistic “shadow government”, however, Freemason leader President Trump and his aligned US military forces are, instead, preparing to unleash war on Iran—which if able to occur before the Federation has to engage in conflict with Ukrainian Nazi forces, will stop World War III as the American people will not allow two wars to occur at the same time."

       He hasn't attacked yet. However the cynic in me feels this is just a continuation of the plan and what is basically going on right now is the hands have switched but the result is the same.
The US is still bombing Yemen helping Saudi Arabia. 
Now lets see what will happen with Syria, will they go after ISIS with Russia? because fuck ISIS. If you saw what they did to people who surrender. Unarmed soldiers executed by the thousands.

       Reading these comments I pick up it is bec of Israeli agenda. So, I will put out some Biblical prophecy that may give some clues to how/why Israel prominence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So JESUS is returning, that was His promise, and it will be to save self destructing world. Before this happens, these things will be in place-
      </p>
      <p>
       The AntiChrist will come to power and lead a one world gov. that takes cash out of circulation and ppl can only buy and sell if the have a his mark on their hand or forehead (associated with number 666).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish Temple will be rebuilt. (Why is US embassy being moved to Jerusalem, where Temple is located? Hmmm)
      </p>
      <p>
       The AntiChrist will sit in the temple to be worshipped as god. This is called "the abomination that causes desolation" in Revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great army from the north (of Israel) will attack and the carnage will be unimaginable.  This is Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p>
       JESUS will return to save world from total destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep these in mind when watching powers align and move.  As you know, the cash prophecy is now unfolding before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I failed to understand previously, Israel government will be hijacked by NWO players to allow AntiChrist his attempt to usurp JESUS place. Many Christians support Israel, but are not realizing this, my opinion, therefore supporting unjust Israeli actions.

       Trump is being a lot more pugalistic toward other nations than I expected him to be. I thought his first move would be to reconcile things with Putin and reduce tensions with Russia. I didn't expect him to inflame China, Russia, Mexico, Iran, and Israel all at once, one after the other. It seems pointless to me to inflame the hatred against himself -- there's enough hatred already.

       It means the fracture in the elites does not include war making generally. It would seem the military industrial complex is compatible with trumps fossil fuel foreign policy. 
What trump et. all seem to disagree with the establishment on is secretly funding the enemy, which we've been doing now since middle eastern terrorism was a thing. Or even South American stuff. It's hard to appreciate how duplicitous the CIA ops in South America have been all in the name of American security.

       I can't believe this sub is naive enough to think that anyone who wasn't gonna play ball would be allowed to become president. seems this sub is in love with Donald and just like the rest of his supporters, are somehow blind to how obviously shady he is. if anyone considers themself a conspiracy theorists to any degree this guy has gotta set your bullshit detector off.

       You and a few millions of your fellow countrymen believed that Trump and Hillary are different.

       A tiny fraction, who still have a functioning brain knew that all the candidates are playing for the same masters, the maintainers of the fiat system.

      <pre><code>THE HEGELIAN DIALECT: FALSE CHOICES
</code></pre>
      <p>
       <em>
        One of the great lessons to be gleaned from the world of conspiracies is that of the Hegelian Dialect. In this theory, we are presented with options that inevitably put us where the puppet masters want us through a coordinated series of false events.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       the choices were either trump or hillary, sadly both serve the same masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       we were just believed to have a choice while in truth the agenda of the illuminati that was envisioned by albert pike in the late 1800's and is still right on track, even if they let you believe that you made a choice for the better by picking nationalism over globalism....

       When Europeans stole Native lands, it was horribly wrong. When the United States violates treaties held by Native tribes it's still horribly wrong. When Israel throws people out of their homes and steals their land; in violation of treaties agreed upon; with the audacity to claim it's the will of God because they are "special"- it's despicable.

       Egypt was a world superpower starting from 3150 BC for about 1250 years. Archeologists and historians divide this time into the old kingdom, the middle kingdom and the new kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have heard of the Egyptians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was to Egypt that Abraham went to avoid famine. It was into Egypt that Joseph was sold. It was Egypt where Jacob sent Josephs brothers to get food when famine hit Palestine. It was Egyptians who enslaved these people called that history calls Jews till God freed them. It was Eygpt who put an end to Solomons empire after his death. It was Egyptians who probably broke the Judean kingdom at the battle of Megiddo where King Josiah was killed and allowed it to be conquered by the Babylonians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Egyptians who invented things like hieroglyphics, ink, calenders, make-up, sun clocks, papyrus the plow, breath mints, toothpaste, designed ships that sailed the rivers and in the oceans, worked with gold, glass, and bronze.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Egyptians also built things like the Pyramids, the Spinx, temples in Karnak and Luxor, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is Egypt?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Africa. For 1250 and beyond it wasn't a backward shithole. And the way things are going I can't see U.S. lasting a hundred years let alone a thousand.

       Bernie Sanders maybe was, he was the only one who refused to speak at AIPAC. I still massively respect him for that, if only he wasn't the candidate of the SJWs and the fucking 20-gendered landwhales. I still believe that the fact that those people 'lost' might keep our culture intact.

       Hagee and AIPAC are illegal agents of a foreign government. As with the endless violations of the Symington amendment, they're given a pass by blackmailed, bought-off "Presidents", because dufuses believe the Hate-State is needed "to make Jesus come".

       . Good luck trying to guilt 4 billion Africans and Asians into becoming your next
