       Well, if you take a look what they did to Ben Swann of CBS Atlanta for taking an objective look at P.G. you kind of wonder who is controlling the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude was taken off air had all of his social media accounts scrubbed all for doing a segment on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'D have to "speculate" in a "sensible manner" that it had to do with his investigative report on Pizzagate, however, it could have been myriad other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to latch on to my personal opinion regarding  the podcast being pulled, however, I have a pretty solid idea it was due to the unproven Pizzagate segment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is no smoking gun evidence to Pizzagate, but, you have to admit having artwork of a Jeffrey Danger victim as the center piece of your household is pretty fucked up to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes having that piece proves absolutely nothing regarding C.P. but that's just  one thing that fuels the speculation in the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other proven facts or strange oddities in the case are
      </p>
      <p>
       pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein and his close relationship with podesta and Clinton
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The strange coincidence of all the C.P. symbols and slang used in comet's menu and  John podesta s emails that the FBI has corroborated as fact.

       Ben Swann is likely trying to protect what's left of his career. Even if the stuff is true in the way the internet has indicated (unlikely), he just echoed the circumstantial evidence that was arrived at poorly. Not very good judgement on his part.
      </p>

       I have a Grim Reaper tattoo and like macabre stuff to an extent. It doesn't mean I have cult rituals in a Parisian catacomb.

       The banned documentary was largely discredited, see

       While some connections are abundant and likely factual, that's what happens in power. It's a big club, but seemingly small in how they all collude and collectively ensure like-minded goals. Pedophilia and child trafficking most certainly exist--though, it's quite the assertion to have put all of this together and arrive at conclusion, of which neatly fits under the 'pizzagate' umbrella.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's little to nothing to stand upon where that's concerned, and people keep plugging away trying force square pegs in round holes. it has been detrimental to this sub and any self-imposed standards that once existed. The burden is upon its proponents to support the conclusion they've made. You've not done this, nor has OP's weak attempt above.

       lol I have not looked into Pizza Gate at all, except for the censorship of it. Has there ever been another small business in history that has garnered so much protection from mainstream media and government? After Making of Murderer,  anitowoc County businesses and the perpetrators from that story were harassed, they didn't get nearly the same special treatment and the perpetrators
       <em>
        are part of the government's police state.
       </em>
       Streisand effect?
