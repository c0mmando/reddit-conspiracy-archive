We know that everyone on reddit should be considered both a friend and a foe at the same time. The anonymous nature of reddit and the ability to buy accounts makes that necessary. As such, we critical thinkers regard every post as potential disinformation -- only original sources, logic, and the understanding of human nature can be used to make convincing arguments to us.</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re trying really hard to convince us that Trump is or is not involved in a conspiracy, all that matters is the quality of the argument you make. Polite and rational debate is necessary in order to pinpoint the truth, and that is what this sub is about. Shills have no power here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also have multiple accounts to massively up vote or downvote posts, they give gold to certain posts to shift the narrative and make a point of view look more popular. I&#39;ve noticed 2 big campaigns of the shills as of lately:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Blatant censorship and ridiculing of anything related to Pizzagate or sex trafficking. </p></li>
<li><p>A lot of pro-trump pushing, and reassurance that &quot;don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s anti establishment&quot;. In regard to his cabinet, They say he&#39;s &quot;keeping enemies close&quot;, they come up with all kinds of stupid goofy shit to prop him up, they want to give the impression to new readers that this sub is pro trump, to discredit our message to anybody who doesn&#39;t like him. Trump is a false prophet, and they also use trump talk to generally cause arguments, confusion, and create &quot;trump vs anti trump&quot; tension among us to distract and create animosity on this discussion forum.

    <div class="md"><p>Number 2 is an interesting theory I hadn&#39;t thought of. Basically these ridiculous t_d-style posters are reverse-shills, being paid to make terrible obnoxious arguments in favor of Trump in order to convince &quot;normal&quot; Trump opponents that Trump supporters are dangerous lunatics, thus &quot;radicalizing&quot; moderate dems and furthering the toxic divide between the two major groups of the underclass. This keeps us distracted and you know the rest.</p>

<p>I think the simple explanation is more likely, but it&#39;s definitely food for thought. I think my opposition to Trump has been galvanized by the way his supporters defend him, and I bet there are many more like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t to keep us theorists from each other. They do not care about that.</p>

<p>What it really is, is that they are cramming our conspiracy page with all kinds of bullshit so that anyone coming here for an opinion of the world will never be able to get one. I would be willing to tell everyone what I think and I bet people would want to listen, but the programming combined with everything else makes it really hard. When you even suggest someone gets into conspiracies you watch them basically fall for every single one of them. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to bring more in. They have it pretty on lock in my opinion.</p>

<p>This is all to keep the brain washed, brain washed. If a person comes and listens to the shills on every thread as they have been taught, I doubt they&#39;ll ever understand us.</p>

<p>Shills are scum of people though, the all seeing eye will be used in our favor one day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets just, for a second, take the fact that Trump is influenced by Russia as fact.  If the DNC hadn&#39;t scuttled Bernie Sander&#39;s campaign, their best polling candidate, Trump would probably not have been elected. The DNC email leak, which has proven to be real, shows this fairly clearly. This makes the Trump/ Russia connection irrelevant, because it was the US&#39;s own internal corruption that failed and fell to a Russian agent in this scenario. To be honest everything that I&#39;ve just talked about is irrelevant too, why?</p>

<p>Because if we have learned anything about our govt. in recent years it is that the govt. does not serve the interests of it&#39;s people. It serves the interests of corporations and billionaires. It is a plutocracy. This is the REAL problem, and it exists at the very foundation of our government system. No arguments other arguments can be had, and no other sultans will be effective until this is addressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we didn&#39;t have a horrible, outdated election process involving the electoral college then Trump probably wouldn&#39;t have been elected either (not that I believe Clinton is any better). And the &quot;US&#39;s own internal corruption&quot; only failed on the DNC side...it worked beautifully on the Republican side with things like gerrymandering and voter registration laws that make it more difficult for citizens to vote. And even the citizens who DO vote are, for the most part, politically inept due to lack of serious interest in politics (beyond the superficial) and being inundated with propaganda from mainstream media sources of information.</p>

<p>The fact that our election came down to Trump vs. Clinton, two of the WORST candidates in US presidential election history, speaks volumes about where our country is at right now politically speaking. It&#39;s a complete shitshow/spectacle.</p>

<p>I completely agree with you, this is ABSOLUTELY the real problem. And unfortunately not enough people realize this issue spreads to both the Democrats AND Republicans. So many people are only capable of seeing the surface-level of politics, and they just eat up the bullshit left/right propaganda. People are STILL defending Trump based on things he said during the campaign about &quot;draining the swamp&quot;...they actually bought his fake-populist bullshit simply because he stood opposite of Clinton (who is the epitome of establishment politics). Those same people who supported Trump will turn around and defend the fact that he brought 4-5 Goldman Sachs members on board immediately, including one as Treasury Secretary. They would&#39;ve been all over Clinton for doing the same shit, but it&#39;s the left/right blinders that are destroying this country.</p>

<p>We need to hold EVERYONE accountable, not just the people on the &quot;other team&quot;. People need to stop making excuses like &quot;well the other side is worse&quot; and stop picking sides altogether. Let&#39;s judge ALL politicians based on their individual merit and actions, and not whether they have a &quot;R&quot; or &quot;D&quot; next to their name. Money in politics is the problem, and it&#39;s getting worse and worse while people are caught up on insignificant bullshit.</p>

<p>Abso-fucking-lutely!  I believe that the media is fueling this whole notion of the &quot;other&quot;.  Hell, Democrats and Republicans view each other as actual enemies that threaten this country more than outside influences.  Basically, they&#39;re pitting citizens against each other so they don&#39;t notice that we&#39;re all being fucked sans lube.</p>

<p>I live in the south and I listen to a shit load of Conservative radio so that I can better understand how they see things and it&#39;s pretty depressing.  They&#39;re almost never objective and they complain about divisiveness while fueling it.  I&#39;m not so naive that I think it&#39;s only one side, of course, but it&#39;s what I&#39;m exposed to most often.  I&#39;m sure that more left leaning folks are no different.</p>

<p>After saying all that, how can we go about affecting any change?  It&#39;s definitely an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I&#39;d love to hear lots of opinions about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found that the best way is to not talk, and listen very carefully to the other person drone on about their partisan BS. Eventually they will say something that you, as and informed person, can take their hand and dive deeper. You really can be another persons &quot;Morpheus&quot; if you speak to them correctly.</p>

<p>The key to doing this is to understand that when you attack someone&#39;s point of view their immediate, carnal urge is to defend that position with as much or more emotion than they are receiving. The key is to start talking about where you agree, and the diverge. Not to start out diverged.</p>

<p>The key thing is that YOU have to be the &quot;adult&quot; and lead the conversation in a civilized manner. Also remember to pick your battles. It&#39;s highly unlikely that you can covert someone from Legacy Media addiction in one conversation. Focus on cracking the door open rather than knocking it down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what your saying, however I will counter this position. One of the problems that ancient governments (in their many forms) had was that when the leader died or abdicated, his power was taken with him. Usually a civil war ensued as people / groups fought to take power for themselves, and the winner would begin a new cycle of government basically starting from nothing. (I&#39;ll try to link you to my source for this later)</p>

<p>The transference of power from the person to the &quot;office&quot; is what has made existing governments last so long. The power is in the office. Once the president (or whoever) leaves their power is left behind their desk. The shadow government surrounds the office and not the people. The system is now a series of offices, not people. </p>

<p>What do you think about this argument?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we think of a human as a particle, we could think of an office as an atom. Similarly we could think of modern governments as molecules.</p>

<p>Even though molecules are made of atoms, and the roll of the collective atoms is vitally important, the fundamental nature of both the atom and the molecule is derived from particles.</p>

<p>In this instance the nature of the &quot;particles&quot; is human thought and action. Each government is merely a convoluted monolithic human construct. </p>

<p>Obviously everyone understands this at a base level but remembering it when addressing the moral standing of individuals involved with it is important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on the nature of them thy could be anything. An individual as a particle, a small collective as an atom, and a large group as a molecule.</p>

<p>Each &quot;layer&quot; can have &quot;sublayers&quot; to explain small scale interactions without needing another layer. For example Quarks can be used to to describe the biology/psychology of a person and leptons can be used to describe the transfer of ideas, which typically effects all those within a group. </p>

<p>Also particles can exist within multiple atoms which makes this system very confusing, but It helps me visualize social interactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. I hope you don&#39;t mind but I am going to step away from the molecular analogy, but I will agree that small pieces converge to make a whole. Here is how I see it.</p>

<p>Billionaires and corporations make up the majority of lobbying interests. The lobbying interests create and shape the rules and guidelines that govern the office, and even go as far as to tell the office what to do. The office is filled with a person of no real importance other than that they will say &quot;yes,&quot; and do what they are told. These offices nearly all function in a similar way. All these offices combine form the structure of our government. </p>

<p>I think one of the most influential changes that we could make to our government is to put the citizenry in place of the corporations and billionaires. This could be done by campaign finance and lobbying reform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that changing a single corrupt piece in a system will do very little but that is because there are still many more. We must bring attention to each corrupt piece, no matter how small, because those corrupt pieces are what the corrupt monolithic structure are truly formed of.</p>

<p>Obviously limiting the ability of some corrupt pieces to manipulate the structure is useful though, so I agree entirely with your sentiment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a global Russia conspiracy where they fund groups in every major western country is pretty fucking important.  Also when people start <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article129453019.html">dying for talking</a> about it.  But that&#39;s just me, you make up your own mind.</p>

<p>Here are the groups we know are being <a href="https://thenorthlines.com/putins-spy-game-dawn-of-a-new-cold-war/">funded by Russia</a>
* Jobbik in Hungary
* Golden Dawn in Greece
* the Northern League in Italy
* France’s Front National</p>

<p>Likely Trump is on that list as well.  So what about the other countries?  Who even knows who Russia is funding in them but I bet you it&#39;s greater than zero.</p>

<p>Now while everyone is looking at the two above, nobody has realized that China is running their own ops, they&#39;ve literally bought out Hollywood and are propagandizing anything they put out:</p>

<p>Pizzagate just has all the hallmarks of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic">moral panic</a>.  So what if Trump is trying to cause a moral panic to distract from Russia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is mountains of evidence regarding pizzagate. The Russian narrative was pushed AFTER it came out but it&#39;s also never really been a secret that the US hates Putin. So in your argument you&#39;re saying trump wanted to distract people with pizzagate by getting Putin to hack the DNC and reveal 100% real emails with the hope that &quot;pizzagate&quot; would happen in order to distract the people from his Russian ties, yet the Russian ties weren&#39;t really a thing until AFTER, so basically if your theory is correct, he did the exact opposite of what he was planning to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is even though the Russia ties didn&#39;t come out in the media till after Pizzagate the document that was put together was being passed, in the media, around long before Pizzagate.  No one would report on it, that seems rather suspicious right there given how damaging it was to Trump.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m saying that the FSB is good at smearing people.  There is mountains of evidence regarding pizzagate but who is to say who created it?  If I was trying to distract from a story I knew was going to come out eventually, Pizzagate is the perfect decoy.  It&#39;s got the moral panic angle baked right plus enough &quot;evidence&quot; for everyone to find to keep everyone looking at it rather than what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it has more legs than PizzaGate.  Christopher Steele, the ex-MI6 agent, is where this story originated.  He&#39;s a relatively successful family man which makes what he did dangerous to him and it makes me question his motives behind it.  He was involved in the FIFA inquiry as well.</p>

<p>The allegations are unverified, but Steele is legit.  One of the sources for the allegations has also been found dead which doesn&#39;t look great.  It&#39;s certainly unproven, like I said, but it&#39;s piqued my interest due to his background.  That so many organizations tried to say that this all originated as a 4chan to discredit it is also curious.</p>

<p>Sure, that&#39;s fine.  It doesn&#39;t change my opinion of the issue, however.  I honestly believe that it has more legs than Pizzagate due to Steele&#39;s background.  That&#39;s not to say that one is more important than the other or that one is true while the other isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s one of PG&#39;s problems, in my opinion.  There could be an international child trafficking ring, but because of the hyperbole and baseless speculation involving satanism, cannibalism, and more... it makes it incredibly difficult to follow.  You&#39;ll have someone say &quot;Wait, that&#39;s not the real PG!  Look at this.&quot; and it just never ends.    PizzaGate sorely lacks credibility and, more importantly, a focused description.  </p>

<p>This is all just opinion of course, but I&#39;m curious about your opinion.  Can you understand my skepticism, yellow?</p>

<p>The news did report on it, but they debunked it as fake news involving a pizza shop running a global child trafficking ring. Of course that sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>But when you look at the details surrounding what started &quot;pizzagate&quot; something definitely seems fucky.

    <div class="md"><p>To know what Pizzagate is distracting from, you have to remember when and where it started.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know what&#39;s a thousand times bigger than lurid allegations of paedophilia backed up by circumstantial evidence that appeals to specific demographics? A Saudi spy sending State Dept. emails to a personal Yahoo email address directly from Hillary&#39;s private server.</p>

<p>The conspiracy community is, broadly speaking, a group of investigators and &quot;free-thinkers&quot; that have spent decades uncovering and detailing government and corprate secrets. For decades, conspiracy theorists have been poring over government documents and reading obscure books, researching and studying, trying to gain as much knowledge on a given topic as they can so that they can properly understand what happened and reveal their truth to all who will listen. In return for their efforts they have been painted as Kazynski-looking krazies to distract from the facts. Over the years, a fairly linear narrative has emerged of US government activities involving oil, &quot;regime change&quot;, and the arms trade that has little, if anything, to do with partisan politics. The Bush dynasty&#39;s connections to the CIA, Saudi Arabia and terrorism are relatively well-known but it isn&#39;t just one family, or even one party, it&#39;s the government itself.</p>

<p>Given all the things that conspiracy theorists have uncovered over the years, including but not limited to government connectiins to 9/11, and knowing the tactics used to denigrate them, what can we make of the extraordinarily sudden change of direction the investigations into the emails took right at the same time people started asking questions about Huma Abedin&#39;s &quot;Insurance&quot; folder? An anonymous user on 4chan, claiming to be a member of the FBI, told everyone that there was information in those documents that would bring everyone and everything down but he didn&#39;t say what that information was. Instead of further looking into a Saudi woman with alleged family ties to terrorism sending State Dept emails from Hillary&#39;s private server to her own private address (as in it was literally something like H_Abedin at yahoo), possibly during a period when Yahoo got hacked, the conspirosphere suddenly got obssessed with pizza.</p>

<p>Conspiracy Theory is a complex game of moves and counter-moves with few rules and the highest of stakes. What is something that could &quot;bring everything down&quot;? What is more likely to be a distraction narrative? A smoking gun for the biggest political scandal in American history, if not the world, involving millions of deaths, trillions of oil &amp; arms dollars, terrorism, regime change, and both sides of politics over a period of decades? Or is it a suspiciously partisan secret paedophile network that rapes and sacrifices babies for ritual cannibalism in the name of Satan? According to the forum sliders, if it&#39;s not pizza it&#39;s a distraction because They don&#39;t want you investigating what&#39;s truly important.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reasoning seems backwards. They didn&#39;t have control over the release of incriminatinge info. Unless they knew they were hacked, they knew it was full of incriminating shit that human beings find morally reprehensible, and knew pizzgate would be uncovered does your narrative fit. But then it still doesn&#39;t make sense to raise a ruckus about Russia until after the damage was done... You want to lead, not try to do damage control.</p>

<p>Another point, when the mainstream media silences one story while pushing another non-stop, critical thinkers turn them off. They lie about everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Russia only got brought up after pizzagate and then was heavily pushed in the MSM after the election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Hillary mentioned Russia more than once during the debates. Possible Russian connections were in the news before that. And it was &quot;pushed&quot; in the MSM because news was released by our government concerning Russian hacking and attempts to influence the vote. Do you expect them to <em>not</em> report news? If we&#39;re going by timing, realistically, Pizzagate came along about the same time as Russian interference was becoming more clear. </p>

<p>The greater question is why didn&#39;t the media investigate and reveal more of Trump&#39;s connections to shady ex-Soviets and the like sooner? There&#39;s certainly been evidence of it for longer than the election cycle. Including links to human traffickers, like Tevfik Arif, who worked with, and for, Trump. Or the people running Trump International Escorts, who are directly connected to Multigroup, a subsidiary of the Bulgarian mob. You&#39;d think Trump wouldn&#39;t let them use his precious name for <em>years</em> if there weren&#39;t <em>some sort</em> of agreement there.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic">Moral Panic</a>?  Pizzagate just seems like a textbook example of it, in the late 80s there was one all about satanic pedophiles and it all turned out to be fake.  I&#39;m not sure who was ultimately behind the one in the 80s but there are people who are able to cause them seem to have preference for accusations of pedophila.</p>

<p>A historical version of this would be the Salem Witch Trials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally, the only conspiracies you are into are proven. They&#39;re not conspiracy theories, they&#39;re conspiracy facts (ironically, except the Russia / Trump one, it&#39;s the only one that&#39;s actually a theory). </p>

<p>So what we have here is someone who&#39;s only actual conspiracy <em>theory</em> they subscribe to is one conveniently being pushed at this very moment by the exact MSM using the exact MSM propaganda / talking points / coverage that they&#39;ve used a plethora of times. That&#39;s not exactly like moving the goal post or presenting a no true scotsman.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve described is like me asking if you&#39;re really a Christian and you saying &quot;Well, I don&#39;t believe in Jesus as the son of God, I think the bible is written by man, however, I do believe Jesus actually did exist, just not a prophet / any abilities, so yeah, I am a Christian&quot;.</p>

<p>I just want to be able to talk about Trump and his Russia connections</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which &quot;Russia connections&quot;?</p>

<p>The &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot; spiel? Sorry, but personally, I&#39;m not buying. You want to discuss OTHER possible &quot;Russia connections&quot;? Okay, make your case.</p>

<p>As for me, I am far more interested in Trump&#39;s ISRAEL connections - because from what I can see, he is <strong><em>way too cozy</em></strong> with the Jewish State - and it is they, NOT RUSSIA, that have embroiled the US in all of the mess in the Middle East over the past couple of decades - in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria - and it is THESE actions that have cost us Trillion$ and made half the world&#39;s population bitterly angry at us.</p>

<p>And by the way, Israel&#39;s interests are INCOMPATIBLE with those of Russia - especially when it comes to Syria - and by extension, Iran.</p>

<p>So Trump can NOT serve the both interests of Russia and those of Israel. Which do you think he will choose?</p>

<p>Finally, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we had an American President that actually put the interests of the PEOPLE of the USA first?</p>

<p>Better luck next time, I suppose.</p>

<p>If anyone has &quot;dirt&quot; on Trump, it would be Israel. From the Jewish magazine <em>FORWARD</em>: </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget that, like Bill Clinton, Trump was a <em>&quot;fellow traveler&quot;</em> with Jeffrey Epstein - the King of Kink ala the Lolita Express. Did Epstein record such sessions for &quot;political dirt&quot;? Hmmm... and if he did <em>(of course he did)</em>, I think it&#39;s safe to say that he didn&#39;t sell/give the damning evidence he collected to &quot;The Russians&quot;, LOL<sup><sup>ita.</sup></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also there are a shitload of Russians in Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it would be more accurate to say that <em>there a shitload of Jews in Israel that came from Russia</em> - and there are diaper-fulls of Jews STILL residing in Russia - but nearly half of the <strong><em>&quot;Children of Israel&quot;</em></strong> on earth reside right here in the USA - and they don&#39;t need to sneak around, snooping for &quot;dirt&quot; and other secrets, because they are US Senators, Congressmen, Cabinet Members and hold high positions in EVERY IMAGINABLE segment of US politics, business, industry, and academia - INCLUDING our most sensitive intelligence and military leadership positions...</p>

<p>If anyone has &quot;dirt&quot; on US politicians (and they DO), it is Israel.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re worried about Russia?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, what a shocker. I am sarcastically <em>flabbergasted</em> by that revelation!</p>

<p>Indeed, one might tend to ponder whether that may be part of the reason that you are so obsessed with diverting our attention to &quot;RUSSIA&quot;, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You should be worried about the rich and not my people</strong>, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should be worried about <strong>&quot;Rich people&quot;</strong>??? Well, then, it would seem utterly NEGLIGENT to ignore <em>&quot;your people&quot;</em>, would it not? </p>

<p>Why? Because according to Wikipedia, the CORE Jewish Population (persons that are ~universally recognized AS JEWS by OTHER JEWS is ~14.2 million souls - or about 0.2% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country#Table">(<strong>ZERO - <sup>point</sup> - TWO percent) of the Earth&#39;s population.</strong></a></p>

<p>Whereas, according to <a href="http://www.forbes.co.il/rating/list.aspx?en6v0tVq=FK"><strong>Forbes</strong></a> <strong><em>(Israel ONLY edition)</em></strong>, &quot;Jewish billionaires represent 11% (ELEVEN PERCENT) of the Global Billionaire&#39;s list - with joint capital reaching $812 Billion (2014) - and that list does NOT include members of some VERY WEALTHY Jewish families - such as the Rothschilds, Medici&#39;s, etc.</p>

<p>Crunching the numbers, we find that Jews are <strong>550 times</strong> more likely to be on Forbes Billionaire&#39;s List than non-Jews. (Stunning, isn&#39;t it?)</p>

<p>Source: Forbes - Israel: <a href="http://www.forbes.co.il/rating/list.aspx?en6v0tVq=FK">The World&#39;s Richest Jews</a> (in Hebrew - open in Chrome, Right-Click and click &quot;Translate&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>550 to 1</strong>. That&#39;s something, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p>

<p>Now, what were you saying? ... ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You should be worried about the rich and not my people</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s &quot;the rich&quot; I should be &quot;worried about&quot;, it seems like &quot;<strong><em>your people</em></strong>&quot; should be the focus of &quot;inquiry&quot;, or so to speak. No? <em>(sorry!)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have more in common with you than I do Sheldon Adelson or Soros. And they have more in common with Trump and the Koch brothers because they&#39;ll all billionaires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if, as you say, our focus should be on &quot;the rich&quot;, I should think that our attention should be directed toward the <strong><em>&quot;Children of Israel&quot;</em></strong>, rather than the &quot;Russians&quot;, no?</p>

<p>But I suppose that, given YOUR perspective, you would want to divert the attention of the rabble.</p>

<p>I am sure that your efforts are appreciated - at least at some level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just trying to wake you up.  I <em>really</em> don&#39;t need to be trying to convince you but it pains me to see you being manipulated because I know y&#39;all just want to do good.</p>

<p>So here is my most convincing argument, please read it with an open mind. If you don&#39;t believe it after this then I guess we are just on different sides of history.</p>

<p>I think a global Russia conspiracy where they fund groups in every major western country.  People are <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article129453019.html">dying for talking</a> about it.</p>

<p>Here are the groups we know are being <a href="https://thenorthlines.com/putins-spy-game-dawn-of-a-new-cold-war/">funded by Russia</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Jobbik in Hungary</li>
<li>Golden Dawn in Greece</li>
<li>the Northern League in Italy</li>
<li>France’s Front National
So what about the other countries?  Well who even knows who Russia is funding in them but I bet you it&#39;s greater than zero.  We are facing an organized assault and it&#39;s being totally misread because Russia was smart enough to convince people like Alex Jones with RT to pump out their propaganda for them. </li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Trump is a good guy or not, I just think he is compromised.</p>

<p>All of us are biased in one way or another, but if you&#39;re willing to recognize it and engage others in earnest discussion then you&#39;ll end up with a stronger and better informed opinion in the end.  A willingness to dismiss something that you disagree with at the drop of a hat is something that should be frowned upon.  </p>

<p>I honestly believe that this sub would be so much better if more people engaged in discussion instead of the constant in-fighting.  If that poster truly is a shill, then their arguments will falter when discussing a topic with someone that has a more well-rounded and informed opinion on the subject.  This post is kind of a mess and it&#39;s all over the place because I suck at posting with my phone, sorry!</p>

<p>This is so fucking true. So many people are <em>the exact same thing</em> they claim to hate with a passion, but somehow they can&#39;t see it. People bitch about libruls needing to create safe spaces, while creating one of the biggest safe spaces of all. People bitch about SJWs getting triggered all the time, but they themselves are triggered insanely easily. People bitch about SJWs shutting down conversations out of hand without rhyme or reason by just shouting out a buzzword like &quot;sexist&quot; or &quot;racist&quot;, while <em>they themselves</em> do the exact same thing with the phrase &quot;SJW&quot; or &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

<p>It is insanely infuriating.</p>

<p>That&#39;s objectively false. There have been no changes to the voting algorithm that do not apply to every single subreddit. The only changes they&#39;ve made recently were having posts be truly reflective of how many people voted on it, which is why posts will show 20k upvotes now. And they made it so <em>no single subreddit</em> could dominate the frontpage of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, because that fucking defeats the purpose of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally getting objectively false information from <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> that they spread around to feed their persecution complex boners. </p>

<p>You mean to tell me that a website notorious for being populated with young liberals, where the most popular candidate by far was the single most liberal person in the entirety of congress, can&#39;t <em>possibly</em> dislike conservative views without the admins interfering?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;takeover&quot; if those places are reflective of the views of people who have always been there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But for some reason we ignore the people who post exclusively on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> who come here just to stir shit up. And we ignore how any discussion on the actions of <em>the current president of the United States</em> routinely gets stifled with downvotes, on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit.</p>

<p>What the fuck is confusing about it? People upvote stuff, it becomes more visible. People downvote stuff, it becomes less visible.</p>

<p>It just turns out that <em>most people</em> downvote stuff they disagree with. And  on a website where most people are liberal, that means that conservative stuff becomes less visible.</p>

<p>It is not rocket science. It isn&#39;t some grand conspiracy orchestrated by the admins to systemically stifle conservative discussion. It is a byproduct of how this website works and how it has <em>always</em> worked.</p>

<p>You consistently display how you don&#39;t have even a basic understanding of what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>The numbers used to not reflect the exact number of people up voting and down voting. That&#39;s why every post would display, at most, 8,000 or so upvotes no matter how many people voted on them. If 30,000 people upvoted it, it would still say 8,000.</p>

<p>And they didn&#39;t do it to trick you. They did it to make it more difficult for people using bots to see how successful their attempt to game the system was. They explicitly stated this many times. </p>

<p>The change didn&#39;t make the number of displayed upvotes less reflective of how many people upvoted. It made it more reflective of this. They explained this in very explicit detail as they made the change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like when they first introduced the new algorithm.. Posts were getting 100k upvotes and smashing records with nearly every post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are less than 40 posts with more than 100k upvotes. How is it possible that &quot;nearly every post&quot; got that many, when less than 40 posts <em>ever</em> got that many, and well over half of those were made long before the change took place. </p>

<p>And the post with the most upvotes was made 4 years ago. How was the record being smashed with nearly every post if it hasn&#39;t been broken in 4 years?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>But even though I am laying out in detail how little you know what you&#39;re talking about, I will bet my bottom dollar that you will go on believing the blatantly false things you&#39;ve filled your head with after this conversation. And you will go on believing that you know more about this topic than anyone else, to boot. It&#39;s sad, really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rest of your arguments are silly and too time consuming to debate.</p>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that you realized they were correct and were unable to refute them in any meaningful way? Because that&#39;s what I&#39;m reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we didn&#39;t have a horrible, outdated election process involving the electoral college then Trump probably wouldn&#39;t have been elected either (not that I believe Clinton is any better). And the &quot;US&#39;s own internal corruption&quot; only failed on the DNC side...it worked beautifully on the Republican side with things like gerrymandering and voter registration laws that make it more difficult for citizens to vote. And even the citizens who DO vote are, for the most part, politically inept due to lack of serious interest in politics (beyond the superficial) and being inundated with propaganda from mainstream media sources of information.</p>

<p>The fact that our election came down to Trump vs. Clinton, two of the WORST candidates in US presidential election history, speaks volumes about where our country is at right now politically speaking. It&#39;s a complete shitshow/spectacle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because if we have learned anything about our govt. in recent years it is that the govt. does not serve the interests of it&#39;s people. It serves the interests of corporations and billionaires. It is a plutocracy. This is the REAL problem, and it exists at the very foundation of our government system. No other arguments can be had, and no other solutions will be effective until this is addressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with you, this is ABSOLUTELY the real problem. And unfortunately not enough people realize this issue spreads to both the Democrats AND Republicans. So many people are only capable of seeing the surface-level of politics, and they just eat up the bullshit left/right propaganda. People are STILL defending Trump based on things he said during the campaign about &quot;draining the swamp&quot;...they actually bought his fake-populist bullshit simply because he stood opposite of Clinton (who is the epitome of establishment politics). Those same people who supported Trump will turn around and defend the fact that he brought 4-5 Goldman Sachs members on board immediately, including one as Treasury Secretary. They would&#39;ve been all over Clinton for doing the same shit, but it&#39;s the left/right blinders that are destroying this country.</p>

<p>We need to hold EVERYONE accountable, not just the people on the &quot;other team&quot;. People need to stop making excuses like &quot;well the other side is worse&quot; and stop picking sides altogether. Let&#39;s judge ALL politicians based on their individual merit and actions, and not whether they have a &quot;R&quot; or &quot;D&quot; next to their name. Money in politics is the problem, and it&#39;s getting worse and worse while people are caught up on insignificant bullshit.</p>

<p>I think a global Russia conspiracy where they fund groups in every major western country.  People are <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article129453019.html">dying for talking</a> about it.</p>

<p>Here are the groups we know are being <a href="https://thenorthlines.com/putins-spy-game-dawn-of-a-new-cold-war/">funded by Russia</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Jobbik in Hungary</li>
<li>Golden Dawn in Greece</li>
<li>the Northern League in Italy</li>
<li>France’s Front National
So what about the other countries?  Well who even knows who Russia is funding in them but I bet you it&#39;s greater than zero.  We are facing an organized assault and it&#39;s being totally misread because Russia was smart enough to convince people like Alex Jones with RT to pump out their propaganda for them. </li>

<p>Someone doesn&#39;t like certain &quot;inconvenient&quot; facts being brought to light.</p>
