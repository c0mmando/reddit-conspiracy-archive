    <div class="md"><p>Redditers tend to use the upvote/downvote buttons as a like/dislike. I remember there being a few announcements made by the previous CEO that had quite a bit of downvotes just because folks didn&#39;t like her. If it weren&#39;t for the heavy weights I would not have known about the posts.</p>

<p>I believe that the current weighting for announcements on the site is appropriate. There&#39;s just a question on whether or not the post in contention should have been made into one since it wasn&#39;t directly related to the site.</p>

<p>I think you hit the nail on the head. Just saying IMO it was an abuse of power, one of which, I view as manipulation to push a political message. </p>

Reddit, which started as and pretty much remains a place where lax immigration policy is easy clickbait. About as easy as nostalgic feel goods.
Reddit, which started in the bush era. Speaking of nostalgic feel goods, remember all the conspiracies about Bush and how being liberal was edgy?
Reddit, the place that tried to crown Bernie Sanders over Hilary.
Seriously, why do you think this is a conspiracy? What is the conspiracy? To preach to the choir? Is being in a minority somewhere that uncomfortable for you?</p>
