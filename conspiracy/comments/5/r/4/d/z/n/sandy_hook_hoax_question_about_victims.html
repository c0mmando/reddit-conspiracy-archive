       I've been searching around Reddit for a good place to start asking this question/questions in regards to the Sandy Hook Massacre possibly being staged or not, and I guess r/conspiracy is the best place for me to go (even though the majority of posts I see here are politically related, haha). The definition of conspiracy itself over in the side bar, "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful", gives me a bit more reassurance. Just hear me out, bear with me on this, because it's a bit long.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I've been living in a town close to Newtown CT since I was born. I won't disclose where it is, but it was close enough to Newtown that my school had to undergo lockdown during the shooting. I was twelve years old when it occurred. However, my class was on a field trip in the Hartford Science Museum at the time of the event, and we weren't even allowed to cross back into our town because the town itself was locked down. I was hearing from some adults chaperoning the trip that all they knew was that somebody was shot in Newtown, nobody knew where yet, nobody knew who was hurt and who was dead. Needless to say, the bunch of us twelve year olds were terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once things quieted down and we were bussed back into town, meeting up with our parents at the town hall rather than taking the bus home like usual procedure, we finally learned the truth; a man had gunned down a series of kids in a town so close to ours that it shook us to our very foundation as a community. Watching the news in the following days/weeks, I specifically remember seeing the parents and siblings being interviewed who were unusually stoic and emotionless when speaking about their recently murdered children...odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, leading up to the shooting and for about a year and a half after, I attended a sort of swimming club in another neighbouring town to Newtown. Several of the Sandy Hook victims attended as well, and I specifically remember seeing a little boy who I thought was awfully cute leaving the pool before I got in; his mother addressed him as Noah. I found out later that the boy was Noah Pozner. After the shooting, I stopped seeing Noah at the swimming club.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this seems pretty legit, but I still can't get over the fact that all of those parents on the news were so stony-faced and calm when talking about their recently deceased kids...for good measure, here's a couple of links that show these parents.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt1KzZ9Bs8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt1KzZ9Bs8

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfn065PkCQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfn065PkCQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All the research I've been doing is pointing towards a concept called "crisis actors". That would explain why the parents were so stony: they were just actors, poorly portraying grieving parents. I also didn't attend the swimming club long enough to know if Noah Pozner had been attending for a long time, because if he hadn't been attending for long, it would be possible that he was another actor planted there to further validate the shooting. What do you guys think of this? Can anybody give me some good info and proof of possible crisis actors utilized for the Sandy Hook "hoax"? Or do you guys think it was legit? I'm totally torn. I'd love to hear some input and put a bit of my inner conflict to sleep, ha ha.

       there's only so much crying they can do, you expect them to cry every day for weeks after that? everyone handles grief and loss differently. it could be with indifference at first, the typical movie reaction of sadness, or pretend and act like it's normal and so on and so forth.

       You don't need experience with shooting victims, please don't be so flippant. Sandy hook TV coverage has the most disguisting, treasonous characters deceiving the general public. And that's just the start of the deception. If you're interested, check out We need to talk about sandy hook on YouTube.

       I can understand all of that, but the problem I have with their reactions is that such a good portion of parents were so emotionless when speaking on it. There was even that one parent who was laughing and joking before he realized the camera was rolling, and he conjured up some tears and a sad face in the blink of an eye. (Robbie Parker was the name I believe...?"

       Thanks. I've been doing more research into it, but I do live in a house with a number of other people and they are wary of search history. I've brought up the possibility of a conspiracy to them and they can get very angry and offended. (Can't necessarily say I blame them).

       What blows my mind is the lack of people in the area willing to discuss the conspiracy theory surrounding the event. You are one of only a few who have come forward to put out an opinion, even though you are doing it anonymously and aren't even directly from Newtown.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that real people died but Adam Lanza was a patsy. There were two men in camo seen running through the woods that day, but they were let go. They could have done it, and planted Adam's body there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the crisis actor theory is disinfo that is planted to get people off track. Maybe Robbie Parker was an actor and laughed on purpose to get people to consider the whole hoax theory. The reason they would do this is so that legitimate conspiracy researchers spend years trying to piece together the wrong picture.

       It sounds like such an intricate idea but of course it's possible. And yeah, not many people around here will even talk about the event with me; although I do know a sizable number of people who also sense something strange at hand.
      </p>

       I never knew about the two men in camo, that's really interesting. Hard to believe they were just let go.

       If this wasn't a hoax just think of what these people continue to go through with people saying there fake and crisis actors. They lost their children and people go around calling them fake.

       Some people are just fucked in the head and go on shooting sprees there not always false flags or have any reason to them.

       There is not a single thing about Sandy Hook that doesn't seem like a complete fabrication. Its the perfect hoax because any time someone brings up these glaring issues, some concern troll says, "think of the parents and what they are going through."
      </p>

       A tiny kid with psychological problems and no formal training could not carry, shoot  and cycle through 3 different weapons and kinds of ammo with expert speed an accuracy. Its not possible. Period.

       People say the exact same thing about 911 that the thousands of people never died. Unless you can prove that Sandy hook was staged apart from circumstancial evidence, have some sympathy for the people it affects.

       The lack of maintenance records for the Sandy Hook Elementary prior to the date of the shooting is not circumstantial, its about as solid as it gets.

       If a school is/was running, they require maintenance and repairs constantly. There would be a paper trail (a public record one.)

       If the school was abandoned or not in operation, there wouldn't be maintenance records for upkeep of the grounds and buildings. (Which there aren't)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the school was abandoned and had no students in attendance, there could not have been a shooting of children if there weren't any children there to shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore: proving the school was not operational = proving the shooting was a complete hoax.

       Judging by these mostly weak responses, I would say your best bet would be to search for old SH posts in r/conspiracy. There was a lot of good discussion on this over the years. A lot of theories were put forth, a lot were reasonably debunked. Personally, I'm on the side of "something fishy" going on. Maybe crisis actors were used, probably not. Unless this thread blows up, I doubt you'll get the type of answers you're looking for.

       Yeah, I get the same general vibe. I'm feeling like it wasn't entirely staged, maybe not even entirely planned but there is a good portion of details that are being hidden from everyone.

       Very easy to get caught up in the trivial evidence; always follow the paper trail when investigating anything.

       Wolfgang Halbig is/was on the best line of investigation I've seen so far.
