        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been searching around Reddit for a good place to start asking this question/questions in regards to the Sandy Hook Massacre possibly being staged or not, and I guess r/conspiracy is the best place for me to go (even though the majority of posts I see here are politically related, haha). The definition of conspiracy itself over in the side bar, &quot;a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful&quot;, gives me a bit more reassurance. Just hear me out, bear with me on this, because it&#39;s a bit long.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve been living in a town close to Newtown CT since I was born. I won&#39;t disclose where it is, but it was close enough to Newtown that my school had to undergo lockdown during the shooting. I was twelve years old when it occurred. However, my class was on a field trip in the Hartford Science Museum at the time of the event, and we weren&#39;t even allowed to cross back into our town because the town itself was locked down. I was hearing from some adults chaperoning the trip that all they knew was that somebody was shot in Newtown, nobody knew where yet, nobody knew who was hurt and who was dead. Needless to say, the bunch of us twelve year olds were terrified.</p>

<p>Once things quieted down and we were bussed back into town, meeting up with our parents at the town hall rather than taking the bus home like usual procedure, we finally learned the truth; a man had gunned down a series of kids in a town so close to ours that it shook us to our very foundation as a community. Watching the news in the following days/weeks, I specifically remember seeing the parents and siblings being interviewed who were unusually stoic and emotionless when speaking about their recently murdered children...odd.</p>

<p>So, leading up to the shooting and for about a year and a half after, I attended a sort of swimming club in another neighbouring town to Newtown. Several of the Sandy Hook victims attended as well, and I specifically remember seeing a little boy who I thought was awfully cute leaving the pool before I got in; his mother addressed him as Noah. I found out later that the boy was Noah Pozner. After the shooting, I stopped seeing Noah at the swimming club.</p>

<p>To me, this seems pretty legit, but I still can&#39;t get over the fact that all of those parents on the news were so stony-faced and calm when talking about their recently deceased kids...for good measure, here&#39;s a couple of links that show these parents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt1KzZ9Bs8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt1KzZ9Bs8</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfn065PkCQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfn065PkCQ</a></p>

<p>All the research I&#39;ve been doing is pointing towards a concept called &quot;crisis actors&quot;. That would explain why the parents were so stony: they were just actors, poorly portraying grieving parents. I also didn&#39;t attend the swimming club long enough to know if Noah Pozner had been attending for a long time, because if he hadn&#39;t been attending for long, it would be possible that he was another actor planted there to further validate the shooting. What do you guys think of this? Can anybody give me some good info and proof of possible crisis actors utilized for the Sandy Hook &quot;hoax&quot;? Or do you guys think it was legit? I&#39;m totally torn. I&#39;d love to hear some input and put a bit of my inner conflict to sleep, ha ha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand all of that, but the problem I have with their reactions is that such a good portion of parents were so emotionless when speaking on it. There was even that one parent who was laughing and joking before he realized the camera was rolling, and he conjured up some tears and a sad face in the blink of an eye. (Robbie Parker was the name I believe...?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What blows my mind is the lack of people in the area willing to discuss the conspiracy theory surrounding the event. You are one of only a few who have come forward to put out an opinion, even though you are doing it anonymously and aren&#39;t even directly from Newtown.</p>

<p>My opinion is that real people died but Adam Lanza was a patsy. There were two men in camo seen running through the woods that day, but they were let go. They could have done it, and planted Adam&#39;s body there.</p>

<p>I think the crisis actor theory is disinfo that is planted to get people off track. Maybe Robbie Parker was an actor and laughed on purpose to get people to consider the whole hoax theory. The reason they would do this is so that legitimate conspiracy researchers spend years trying to piece together the wrong picture.</p>
