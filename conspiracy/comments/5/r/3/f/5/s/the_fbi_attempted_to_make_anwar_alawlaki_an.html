        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">251</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/myteasinggf.html">myteasinggf</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Get this info out.  Before the FBI blackmailed him he was a respected member of the muslim community, giving interviews following the 9/11 attacks to NYT, National Geographic, and other MSM.  His daughter was murdered this last week in Yemen, the first military attack authorized by Trump.  This very well might have been Trump making good on his promise to murder the families of terrorists.</p>

<p>From another post on the sub here is his daughter
<a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/vbmMtQAz2V2uaGcbDtw-aY2Ve9-er5Ofow53iYd8T24.jpg?w=360&amp;s=ba0a5d409fafdaf453cc733876906fed">https://i.redditmedia.com/vbmMtQAz2V2uaGcbDtw-aY2Ve9-er5Ofow53iYd8T24.jpg?w=360&amp;s=ba0a5d409fafdaf453cc733876906fed</a></p>

<p>Here is his son, an American citizen.  Some say only 16 when murdered.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pDLfq8ltJlc/UAumfijdMwI/AAAAAAAAH2g/CTAuPokmO1Y/s1600/abdulrahman-al-awlaki1.jpg">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pDLfq8ltJlc/UAumfijdMwI/AAAAAAAAH2g/CTAuPokmO1Y/s1600/abdulrahman-al-awlaki1.jpg</a></p>

<p>The father was an American whose murder marks the end of habeas corpus. He was accused of being a member of a terrorist organization, and Obama authorized his murder without a trial in violation of law dating back to the Magna Carta. His murder was as clearly unconstitutional as Trump declaring himself King, and a violation of international law.  His son was also an American citizen and murdered by the United States.</p>

<p>Also remember that Saudi&#39;s carried out the 9/11 attack.  He, his son, and his daughter were all killed in Yemen.  Yemen is resisting Saudi rule, so the US and Saudi Arabia have been inflicting brutal suffering on the country.  Many are killed with bombs, but many children and babies are dying from US sanctioned starvation. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37423263">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37423263</a>  This is the exact policy that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children during the Oil for Food program.  The US was openly unapologetic for these children&#39;s gruesome death.  <a href="http://fair.org/extra/we-think-the-price-is-worth-it/">http://fair.org/extra/we-think-the-price-is-worth-it/</a>  Media are not allowed into Yemen.  No direct flights are allowed into Yemen from outside the region, and anyone entering by plane is vetted by the Saudi&#39;s first.  The famine in Yemen was man made, with the US and Saudi&#39;s bombing food production targets to cause starvation.  <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/10/27/famine-looms-in-yemen-as-u-s-backed-saudi-bombing-intentionally-targets-food-production/">http://www.salon.com/2016/10/27/famine-looms-in-yemen-as-u-s-backed-saudi-bombing-intentionally-targets-food-production/</a>  Here are terrifying pics of the starving.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/27/middleeast/yemen-world-food-program/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/27/middleeast/yemen-world-food-program/</a></p>

<p>Until recently the US supplied the Saud&#39;s with cruel, illegal cluster bombs to suppress resistance to the Saud&#39;s immoral empire.  Also remember that Syria is not a civil war, it is nearly all foreign fighters and Syria is simply the battlefield.  Syria is a proxy war between the House of Saud and Iran for who controls the region.  Also remember that no monarchs were overthrown by the Arab Spring.  Only secular governments were successfully overthrown, and they were replaced by democratically elected theocratic governments.</p>

<p>Apologies for the extra info, but hopefully you find it useful.</p>

<p>Updated to include info about US bombing sites to artificially create famine in Yemen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel wouldn&#39;t be a Jewish State if it were democratic, that&#39;s correct. Whites were also saying there would be a genocide in South Africa if it ever became democratic, which it became in the end, and no genocide happened.</p>

<p>Because the &quot;two-State solution&quot; is dead and buried, the one-State solution is the only alternative left. You can&#39;t continue exclusively reigning over a population, and 50 years later say they&#39;re not part of your country (while you&#39;re their sovereign). I oppose those who say Israel &quot;occupies&quot; the West Bank for example - no, the West Bank is part of Israel; it&#39;s just the Israeli citizens that live there have yet to obtain civil rights.</p>

<p>The concept of a racial majority, Jewish supremacist Israel is racist anyway. A multi-confessional Israel is better. And I know Jews won&#39;t oppose this because they are at the forefront of the fight for assimilation and tolerance. Am I wrong?</p>
