That said, I think part of the problem may be that there isn&#39;t a great alternative sub for this kind of subject matter, with <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being basically establishment politics and <a href="/r/The_Donald/">/r/The_Donald/</a> being too, well, Trump-related. Does something like <a href="/r/AntiEstablishment">/r/AntiEstablishment</a> (basically inactive) need to be the alternative? I personally don&#39;t know where to go. Even the &quot;Related Subreddits&quot; section here doesn&#39;t really give me a clear option. Just to say, it may be more effective to say &quot;go here&quot; instead of &quot;go away&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is getting a lot of this because there is a legitimate establishment conspiracy going on right now. You might not see it, but it&#39;s happening. Ask yourself why Trump is the headline story in every news network, morning and late night talk show, newspaper, radio show, and awards ceremony. It&#39;s strange. The fact that Hollywood cares so much should your first big red flag. Nothing he has done is worthy of the insane amount of negative attention he&#39;s getting, other than simply being anti-establishment and rattling a few high profile cages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, that he <em>is</em> the establishment. He <em>is</em> the elite. </p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy in the history of this sub is that Trump, Bannon and Co are pulling the biggest hist in history and somehow they&#39;ve got the people who claim to be free and critical thinkers, defending their every move.</p>

<p>You spend years crying out that global cover-ups and corporate influences taking over the US are not being covered and when one is, <em>you&#39;re</em> the bad guy. </p>

<p>I have to believe this is foreign influence or massive troll factories because I cannot believe a psyop at this scale has not only worked, but has the very people who specialise in this sort of thing, completely blindsided. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like watching George Bush coming out at a press conference and telling the world that 9/11 was an inside job and millions of truthers attacking him blaming Saudi Arabia and terrorists. </p>

<p>I honestly cannot believe the sheer level of blindness to the biggest conspiracy in our generation by the very people who spend their lives investigating conspiracies. This leads me to believe that there are some super powerful forces at work. First, get the free and critical thinkers brainwashed, then get them defending us, then... Profit. </p>

<p>The gaslighting is clearly working on me and that&#39;s as much evidence as I need. </p>

<p>I would like to see less US pol stuff, but I also want to see more aliens/extradimensionals, hidden tech, big picture, hidden history, etc.</p>
