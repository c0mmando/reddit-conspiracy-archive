      <p>
       So, I know this has been discussed a lot; stay with me as I want to share a story of a conversation I had with a work colleague with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My, rather unpopular position on this subject, is that I'm fairly certain that we didn't go and it was indeed a moon landing
       <em>
        hoax
       </em>
       . My colleague however, is equally adamant that we did go (essentially the mainstream narrative). I love debating this subject with people; most seem to not even question it. Some do get upset and angry at my 'ridiculous' position. I guess it varies widely between people, although most who I have discussed it with tend to be close minded and
       <em>
        blissfully
       </em>
       unaware of some basic
       <em>
        facts
       </em>
       of the moon missions. My colleague is not one of these people. He is extremely smart and also has considerable knowledge about the landings and missions. It's refreshing to discuss, in detail, areas of contention with people that have the knowledge but have drawn a different  conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument Is long winded, however I've tried to just bullet point some of the areas that I feel really sell the hoax story to me.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Cold War.
        <em>
         Communist
        </em>
        USSR vs USA! "Red Scare". Lots of public fear.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Russia Superior Rocket technologies. You name it USSR did it first,
        <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/">
         First artificial satellite
        </a>
        , First man in space,
        <a href="http://www.space.com/17764-laika-first-animals-in-space.html">
         first animal
        </a>
        , first unmanned lunar
        <em>
         return
        </em>
        lander,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit">
         first unmanned moon orbit
        </a>
        ..the list goes on. The USA had massive technical debt and were way behind in the "race".
       </li>
       <li>
        Sputnik and Sputnik II scared the shit out of them. Nukes from space. Need for US to invest heavily in LEO, Spy and weapons satellites etc to compete with Russia. Probably not a desirable use of billions of dollars for the public and very hard to 'hide'.
       </li>
       <li>
        'ol Dicky Nixon, Vietnam War, JFK. All very trustworthy, right?
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing#Unmanned_landings">
         Unmanned lander were extremely unsuccessful
        </a>
        . 28 July 1964, Ranger 7 was the
        <em>
         first ever
        </em>
        successful NASA mission to the moon (It wasn't even designed to return). Even the USSR's Luna 10 became the first spacecraft to actually orbit the Moon in April 1966. Only 3 years later the USA managed to send
        <em>
         man
        </em>
        and
        <em>
         return
        </em>
        everyone across all missions
        <em>
         unharmed
        </em>
        . Think about that and consider were are now with our exploration of Mars and Space X. Do you think Elon will have a fully finished returned lander on Mars in 3 years from now? Is even an
        <em>
         unmanned
        </em>
        return lander feasible in 3 years?

         Funny thing happened on the way to the moon

        .

       <li>
        No crater under lander/no dust on lander.
       </li>
       <li>
        Van Allen belt radiation and total level of cosmic radiation/coronal mass ejection total after spending time on the moon. This one will be fun.

        Completely untested stages of eagle/lander works flawlessly every time.
       </li>
       <li>
        Development of Apollo segmented, no testing of all components together.

        James Webb resign just before Apollo 8.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now there were some points he brought up that I feel are good for the counter argument.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Moon rocks.
       </li>
       <li>
        Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Photos. (Are these conclusive to you? They are not to me. Just some blobs. How do we know we are looking at them and not a unmanned craft? Doctored photos? I think the LRO was
        <em>
         technically
        </em>
        capable of providing
        <em>
         much
        </em>
        better resolution of images, however where are these?)
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Van Allen belt radiation and estimated dose of CBR not something to worry about. (I guess
        <em>
         actual data
        </em>
        is the missing confirmation of this?)
       </li>
       <li>
        Hammer and feather test on moon. (Is this possible in a vacuum chamber on earth?)
       </li>
       <li>
        Light prism on the moon to shine lasers at. (Russia never landed on the moon but has two there, so this isn't proof to me that
        <em>
         man
        </em>
        landed).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Anyway I thought I would extend this conversation here. What do you guys believe?

       How do you explain the hemispheres then? Or the magnetism of the north or south pole? The equator? I just can't buy into flat earth as I've seen the curvature of the earth myself.

       You just mentioned hemispheres and magnetic poles. I'm not arguing for flat earth here but if you don't understand those things beyond what NASA tells you then it's not really an argument. Please do tell us how you've seen the curvature of the earth though because every camera without a fish eye lens that has reached low-earth orbit showed a flat horizon.

       Let me help.

      <p>
       Yes we did go to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes we did fake the moon landing as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USG faked the moon landing to guarantee we had perfect photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USG was afraid the mission might fail or may fail to at least produce the optics (photos) they needed to show the world they were technologically superior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile we supposedly mastered anti-gravity propulsion/craft in October 1954 so the rocket technology was already far outdated by the late sixties.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA = never a straight answer. And NASA is a public facing division of the department of defense. They show the public very little and what is shown to the public is often manipulated/photoshopped. Ex. Mars photos, and the ongoing claims we have yet to colonize Mars etc.

       However it was not because they were scared the video would fail and they wanted to ensure they were viewed as technologically advanced but because they couldn't show the public what was actually up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the videos are fakes but a lot of the photos were taken on the moon and highly edited.

       Going on a docudrama I saw on Netflix, but the impression I got was that the Soviets were mostly interested in rocketry for the purposes of war. Korolev had to fight tooth and nail for every sensor, animal, or otherwise scientific instrument that wasn't a warhead. I think by the mid-60's they were willing to send probes up to the moon but something as expensive as putting people up there seemed vainglorious and not really useful to the military.

       Which of all of those do you feel are the most actually compelling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Making massive bullet lists has sort of quieting effect on people who'd disagree and don't want to get sucked into a morass. It's also irritating when someone demands you refute 50/50 before they admit they might be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had to pick 3 items from that list which, if I were to show you that you're mistaken, you'd question your position, which three would they be?

       I assume he is referring to: holofractographic unified field theory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The holofractographic unified field theory, as developed by Nassim Haramein. This theory explores the fractal, holographic nature of the structure of space and thus, how the totality of all is within each piece - unifying physics and solving quantum gravity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Essentially someone has managed to reconcile and prove things with math that we have not been able to prove before (we rely on observations and measurements).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand it well enough to be able to figure out whether the theory checks out, but I've seen it pass peer review and start to gain a small amount of traction in the world of academia. Considering how much of our known world this theory could end up turning on its head... I really wish some more attention was focused on it to prove it as truth or bunk.
