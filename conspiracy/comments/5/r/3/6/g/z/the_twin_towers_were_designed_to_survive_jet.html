        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that <strong>the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center&#39;s designers anticipated</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif">FEMA&#39;s Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.</a>  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707</p>

<p><strong>Statements by Engineers</strong></p>

<p>John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698">Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707â€”DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.</a>  Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That piece of complete garbage? I do not think so, they have proven nothing.</p>

<p>The NIST&#39;s  investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster, that resulted in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_finalreports.cfm">NCSTAR</a> report, is inadmissible in a court of law in the United States, because it fails the <em>Daubert</em> standard, this determines the standard for admitting expert testimony in federal courts, <strong>The Federal Rules of Evidence and the Admissibility of Expert Opinion Testimony in an Adversarial Evidentiary Proceeding</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/281a">The National Institute of Standards and Technology, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, may initiate and conduct investigations to determine the causes of structural failures in structures which are used or occupied by the general public. No part of any report resulting from such investigation, or from an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team Act [15 U.S.C. 7301 et seq.], shall be admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under the standards established by the United States Supreme Court in <strong>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed 2d 469 (1993)</strong> and its progeny, expert testimony offered to support the official theory and hypotheses concerning the cause of the destruction of World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2 and 7 (the WTC) on September 11, 2001 <strong>would probably be excluded from admission into evidence by an impartial judge in a civil or criminal proceeding</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_Standard">The Daubert standard provides a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of expert witnesses&#39; testimony during United States federal legal proceedings. Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy refers to the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under Daubert and FRE 702, when carrying out evidentiary gate-keeping duties under the Federal Rules of Evidence, <strong>judges must at a minimum inquire into:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, <strong>did not support its initial findings</strong> They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.</p>

<p>More importantly, any actual relevant sections of the official report <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper&#39;s suitability for publication.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> <strong>Whether there is a known or potential rate of error associated with the methodology used and whether there are standards controlling the techniquesâ€™ operation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>rate of error is 100%.</strong> That is, the previous rate of success in collapsing two 110-story steel skyscrapers such as WTC 1 and 2, by a fire ignited by jet fuel (even taking into account aircraft impact damage) and one 47 story steel skyscraper such as WTC 7 (which had no aircraft impact damage) <strong>is 0%.</strong> The official explanation of the destruction of these three buildings on September 11, 2001 assumes unprecedented processes and events in all three cases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been scrutinized and generally accepted by the scientific community.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no general acceptance of the United States Government conspiracy theory in the scientific community. The official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.</p>

<p>*There are additional factors considered by courts, but all four main Daubert factors are applicable to all cases generally (where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or where the state courts have adopted the Daubert or similar test)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST&#39;s specific objectives were:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed;</li>
<li>Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response;</li>
<li>Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, </li>
<li>Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  an agency of the U.S. Department of <strong>Commerce</strong> failed on every single one of these objectives</p>
