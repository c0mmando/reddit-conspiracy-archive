I'm an authority on the flammability of materials and I have testified in court on this subject. WTC 7 was demolished with explosives attached to the structural frame. Hardly anything in the building was flammable; it was mostly steel, glass, and masonry.” —

        “My experience has included being president of three different architectural firms in Michigan and New England. My outrage and shock at being asked to believe the net of lies surrounding this event matches the feelings of the founding members of AE911Truth. As I watched the towers fall on television, I knew the rapid destruction on display made no scientific sense. Though the tentacles of this subject run in every direction, this betrayal of our national confidence and honor as citizens must not be allowed to stand.” —

        “I'm a licensed architect familiar with structural steel design. When considering the yield point of A36 steel and the redundancy factors included in all 21st century buildings, these buildings could not have been collapsed by an airplane of any kind. This was obvious to me at the time I saw the collapse on television. When the first building came down I told my wife that ‘airplanes cannot make that happen.’" —

        “I have 30 years of diverse design and on-site experience in the engineering field. My most relevant credentials are my extensive experience in computer simulation of structures and mechanical components. I recently reviewed much of the documentation that AE911Truth has supplied and also other sources. My conclusion, based on my engineering experience and intuition, is that structures that are struck in a random nature do not respond with the type of symmetry we see in the WTC towers collapse. In fact, if one were hypothetically tasked to collapse these towers as symmetrically as they fell, it would be nearly impossible, at least for someone without expertise in demolition or other advanced techniques.” —

During my career, I have developed a specialty in analyzing and addressing residential and commercial buildings with structural problems. It’s taken a long time for me to come to terms with the real possibility that the true causes of the WTC collapses on 9/11 were obscured from the general public and perhaps much worse. We must know the truth, because what’s left of our democracy depends on it.” —

        “I have worked in almost every city in NY. I have been licensed 24 years doing a variety of work from residential to industrial. I was on the phone with another architect on 9/11. We both noted the flashes on the floors below the collapsing floor when the towers came down. Two years later I was involved in demolishing six buildings in Kodak Park. I realized it was like watching 9/11 all over again. I have no doubt that WTC was controlled demolition. If the mast was not controlled it would have been a sideways fall killing 10,000 more.” —

Recognizing that the Twin Towers and WTC 7 were instances of controlled demolition is not the hard part. The hard part is overcoming the emotional hurdle that our government betrayed us. I went into shock and had to grieve when I accepted this. As a country we need to face this anger and grief if we are to come to terms with ourselves and leave a legacy we can reconcile with.” —

       <p>
        “I have a Bachelor of Architecture and a Master of Architectural (Structural) Engineering. I remember being very surprised by the collapse of the Twin Towers after the planes struck. Despite the damage and fires, it did not seem possible. I also remember reports of Building 7 being evacuated because it was expected to come down from sustained damage. I accepted the explanations given by the media. It wasn’t until years later that I started examining the research of experts on this and other websites and rethinking my discomfort with the official account. From an understanding of steel failure, I would expect any collapse to be gradual and asymmetric. If the official story were true, it would be a major embarrassment to the US design and construction industry that these towers failed so catastrophically, especially Building 7. I want to stand on the right side of history. We all deserve a real investigation with subpoena power, that explores every possibility.” —

       The two undeniable contradictions is the WTC 7 fell for no apparent reason - it was not only not hit, but a building between it and 1 and 2 was undamaged, and that the pentagon was hit by a jumbo jet that nobody saw and that wasn't recorded on camera, said jet piloted through a near-impossible flight path by a pilot who could barely pilot a Cessna.

       I mean...I watched the several frames of grainy video they released from that piece of shit mother fucker ass bitch bastard garbage camera (sorry this subject gives me tourettes and cancer) and to me it was pretty obvious that a missile hit the Pentagon.

       I can't believe they were able to make America buy their story. It's really like the most wild thing that's happened in history if you ask me. I can't talk about it with anyone in trash life because of I were to find out they believe the official story I would instantly lose all respect for them as a person.

       The available evidence seems to suggest that some type of medium sized aircraft, what type and exact size is unknown.

       What i am actually saying is this, claiming a missile hit the Pentagon means ignoring every single piece of evidence and only relying on your personal disbelief.

       Every piece? I used all the visual evidence in my conclusion minus the lone pictures of random aircraft parts that could really be faked. Like the perfectly round hole in the wall with no marks from wings or engines.

       What about the people who were killed at the Pentagon? Just a coincidence? Nope. The Office of Naval Intelligence was targeted specifically due to their investigations into the  9/12/2001 theft of the Soviet Treasury.

       I went to the 9/11 event in DC in 2013. Barbara Honegger gave a very convincing presentation of the available evidence regarding the Pentagon on 9/11 and I'm pretty sure she said she thought it was a missile that was launched from the helipad.

       yeah i did that and the results did not make them seem like good sources.  the first one, for example, just has this thread and a couple other sites with this same list of quotes with no sources and no further information.  and then ae911truth website.  Engineering is a huge field, doesn't mean its true because an engineer said it.  and i dont see how its helpful to list a bunch of quotes like this.

       I could not find a video of the words coming out of Caswell's mouth specifically. There are other engineers in multiple videos saying essentially the same thing, which searching Google did turn up... There's no doubt that in fact, actual architects and engineers disagree substantially with the official story of 9/11. Posting the quotes is helpful to some people because it helps drive home the point that it's not just sun-deprived fap addicts and old,  lunatic outcasts screaming about hologram planes and baal's face in the dust cloud. 
Laws of physics have to be suspended to make the official statement true. I admit though, and I apologize that it did take a little longer to find out than just a quick Google search.

       But all these people will be labeled as complete 'nuts', despite the credentials they carry. It's crazy how some won't even listen to these people. They deserve an open mind at least.

       What should it look like? Falling sideways / at random? Just a chunk missing with the rest of the building still intact? One person mentioned the building would have fallen over and killed more people...

       Wonder why they wouldn't just crash the planes and leave it at that? Why would they go a step further into a theatrical type display?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe bc huge explosions are normalised in film, tv, etc that they didn't think "just the planes" would be enough (which is incredibly sad)... not sure why they would make it so obvious? To have less collateral damage (if it was to fall naturally / random more people who have been hurt)?

       Type their names into Google plus a little context. Would have taken less time than typing your inept line of questioning, no?
