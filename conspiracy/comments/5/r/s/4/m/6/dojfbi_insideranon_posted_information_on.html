<p>Dropping a small piece of information, take it however you may. I will not provide any picture&#39;s for proof as I don&#39;t feel like clearing metadata. I likely will not reply back to any questions, unless they are questions I do not mind answering. </p>

<p>Information was finally submitted from the FBI to the DOJ today at 3pm. Mr. Sessions was briefed 3 weeks ago as to the investigation in its entirety. Once assumes his position, arrest warrants will be signed, and arrests will be made. This is also why the Democratic Party in DC has been fighting the Sessions vote. Panic.</p>

<p>Furthermore, starting Monday or Tuesday of next week, you will begin to start seeing arrests of individuals. Over 30 politicians (many are household names), and over 40 other individuals throughout DC, VA and also a handful in NYC. Some may off their selves before they are apprehended, so keep a eye out for that over the weekend, and you will know they are involved in some manner.</p>

<p>The child pedophilia ring / sex trafficking arrests California was not related, at least no evidence yet to suggest that it was. May be wrong has people begin to talk, or make deals on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let us pray - I wish everyone on here peace and freedom from conscious suppression.  Many people on here are awoke, but still oppressed because we still don&#39;t have the <em>truth</em>.  We realize that there is something deeper going on than what is on the surface, but we remain oppressed because we can&#39;t verify what it is.</p>

<p>If we obtain truth, I think it will free our subconscious and hopefully open the mental floodgate to some sort of universal harmony and intellectual dawning.  I&#39;ll tell you - watching that Joe Rogan and Alex Jones podcast gave me a LOT of hope and optimism.</p>

<p>Freedom, everybody -  freedom.  Fight for it - die for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time I saw your post speculating that some of these guys were incarcerated as soon as the election was done, i was drawn into that - you backed it up with a lot of info and it had some power and confidence to it that other theories lacked.</p>

<p>By the way - I noticed something interesting.  In late October, somebody (leaker or larper) started posting on 4chan something like &quot;shes been warned not to run&quot; (if you search that, you will find the thread).  They said that one Nov 1 at 11am, there should be a press conference an hillary was to drop out.  Well, it never happened.  So on nov 1, i believe at 11am, Steve Pczenik released a video on youtube saying that Hillary had enacted a coup, and intelligence had enacted a counter coup.</p>

<p>My interpretation is that they told her that it was over; she refused to acquiesce, which they interpreted as a coup, and so they then reacted accordingly.  Not sure if meaningful, but something I noticed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>November 1st, at 11am. I remember looking all over the web on that day to find any info the anon was talking about. It is interesting to note that the FBI records vault twitter account tweeted out on November 1, 2016 at 11am a whole bunch of declassified records on Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency regarding commuting Marc Rich, plus they tweeted some declassified stuff on the Vince Foster murder, and then the Piecznik video, which led me to believe that not all 4 chan anon&#39;s are larpers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea - something incredibly interesting in history happened over the course of the past year or probably longer; sad that it occurs and we dont even notice really.  I hope they release the scoop desperately - its essential for mankind to know what happened, so we can pass it down for generations and they don&#39;t fall into the same trap.  This shit has probably occurred in history over and over again and has gotten to different stages each time, some times worse than other times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree - im confused though on which direction to go here.  David icke and the HLI sort of contradict each other.  They all contradict with the FBIanon on 4chan; unless the fbianon is right on a &#39;human&#39; level, but it also trapped in the same window that the rest of us are trapped in.  I just started watching george webb - the leads he is following (human organ and sex trafficking) is lining up with both the fbianon and HLI; but i think george webb is implying that trump is involved too (this contradicts fbianon, but not the HLI).  Steve Pczenik was actually sort of supported by the HLI as a conveyer of messages between elites; but Steve P fully supports and trusts trump, even though the HLI is basically saying that trump is just another elite.  So HLI endorses steve  P, but steve P lines up better with the fbianon</p>

<p>Really fucking confusing</p>

<p>Still trying to figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A part of me thinks that HLI holds back a little bit. One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that he seems to get deeper and deeper every question session. Now this could just be the conversation and questions evolving, but he did say that the public could not handle the truth all at once. If he came right out and said reptilians, he could possibly be written off as LARP, which is the last thing he wants, given how close his regime is to taking over. Just like if the earth was flat and he came out and said it, no one would pay attention. His conversation has definitely evolved to &#39;think of a better way to run the world&#39;, but it&#39;s hard to imagine a better way without full disclosure of the secrets they hold. That&#39;s what frustrates me the most. </p>

<p>As for Pieczenik, Trump, and Jones, I hope they are on the side of HLI and want to overthrow the old order, even though HLI said they&#39;re not on the same team. One can hope though. </p>

<p>In the end, there&#39;s so much information and so much going on, it&#39;s hard to discern what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not. I will definitely keep paying attention to all of the above though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, HLI presents it like &quot;trump could join us if he wanted, but he doesnt show any signs of doing that&quot; - so i guess trump is redeemable in his eyes, but since trump is still playinf ball (taxing, holding back info), he is still the old regime</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be absolutely honest here. </p>

<p>If WWIII breaks out, and famine follows, and all the worst of the worst Biblical shit breaks loose, I won&#39;t give a fuck so long as the kiddy diddlers get what is coming to them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even close to kidding, either. </p>

<p>To everyone fighting the good fight, mentally, physically, and spiritually. God Bless you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if what FBI Anon says will happen. But there is no denying that something is coming. It has been picking up more and more steam, and it&#39;s close to popping. I only pray it happens sooner than later, and it certainly explains the volatility of the left right now as well as them stalling on Sessions.</p>

<p>Everyone stay on your toes, be aware and be vigilant. And understand one thing; if/when the shit goes down, these protests and riots will only escalate. People won&#39;t want to swallow this red pill. It will rock their world view. They will cry foul, and claim the evidence was all planted by the Russians and Trump&#39;s administration. Hell <em>will</em> break loose. But God Dammit, it needs to. The days of these assholes extorting children will come to an end soon. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on Trump, at all. And I have a lot of questions about the direction he is heading. That being said, if he eradicates the pedophiles, he will have my support.  </p>

<p>Bring these mother fuckers down. Let them reap the fucking whirlwind and let us all watch them ride the lightning. Public executions across the fucking board. </p>

<p>That sounds a bit fishy. Timeline wise.<br/>
3 weeks ago Session wasn&#39;t AG, and he still isn&#39;t. Why brief him?</p>
