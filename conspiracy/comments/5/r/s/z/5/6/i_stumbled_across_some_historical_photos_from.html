<p>My impressions are that these are privileged and well-to-do men and this is how they entertained themselves before movies/TV/broadcast radio.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that they eventually started using these &quot;get togethers&quot; as planning sessions. Why not? The meetings would have provided a cover and the secluded location would have provided plenty of privacy.</p>

<p>Another, darker aspect to The Grove, as brought to light in the book <a href="http://whale.to/b/the_franklin_cover-up_-_john_decamp_-_ebook.pdf">The Franklin Cover-Up by John W. DeCamp</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From very early childhood, Paul Bonacci was subjected to
tortures as profound as any the Nazis inflicted on their captives.
This is not merely a comparison; rather it is an actual continua-
tion, as we shall see. From sexual degradation, from witnessing
and forced participation in Satanic cult murders, Bonacci suf-
fered the cracking of his mind into what is called &quot;multiple
personality disorder&quot; (MPD). Tens of thousands of American
children have been diagnosed MPDs; virtually all of them are
thought to have resulted from sexual abuse, of which perhaps
85 percent were cases of Satanic ritual abuse.
Psychiatric professionals specified in Paul Bonacci&#39;s legal
proceedings that through it all, Paul&#39;s different &quot;personalities&quot;
have emerged incapable of lying, with an ultra-sharp memory.</p>

<p>In one instance detailed in The Franklin Cover-Up, Paul
was taken by Larry King and others to a wooded area in
California-identified after publication as the Bohemian Grove.
There Paul and another boy were forced to do sex acts with
and to consume parts of a child whom they had watched being
murdered by the cultists. The body was to be disposed  of  by
&quot;the men with the hoods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a preceding portion of the book, the victim goes into further detail regarding his experience (Warning: The content can be incredibly disturbing, to the extent I&#39;ve posted it as an image rather than text):</p>

<p>An exert from a related article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John DeCamp’s book, The Franklin Cover-Up, includes Paul Bonacci’s testimony about a snuff film of a child being murdered on July 26, 1984 in California in “an area that had big trees.” At a meeting in Santa Rosa, DeCamp told a group that he had edited out Bonacci’s references to an enormous, moss-covered owl and men in hooded red robes because he not know then about the owl at the Grove and thought it “too far fetched for people to believe.” In the fall of 1992, Paul Bonacci was shown a black and white photo of the moss-covered owl at the Grove and quickly identified it as the site of the July 1984 snuff film described in DeCamp’s book. Although this testimony has been available to law enforcement officials since mid-October 1992, no official investigation has been made. A casket christened “Dull Care” and borne, like the passing of Arthur, in a boat across the lake could be a symbol, also, not only of “cares of the world,” but of caring itself. The denizens of the Grove, as a collective body, are the ruling class and upper echelon bagmen who make and orchestrate war – the modern Molech. It would make sense to immolate caring, conscience and the consequences of their business transactions, lest they take responsibility for millions of souls around the globe whose lives have been affected by wars of Yankee Imperialism in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Moloch is often associated with Mammon (Divinity of Greed/ money/ wealth) , but really is more likely the deification of The high priest/ esoteric knowledge and wisdom/ the moon/ guardian of the underworld</p>

<p>Moloch has been traditionally interpreted the epithet of a god, known as &quot;the king&quot; like Baal was an epithet &quot;the master&quot; and Adon an epithet &quot;the lord&quot;, but in the case of Moloch purposely mispronounced as Molek instead of Melek using the vowels of Hebrew bosheth &quot;shame&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A collection of early Gnostic scripts dating on or before the 4th century, discovered in 1945 and known as the Nag Hammadi library, contains a tractate pertaining to Melchizedek. Here it is proposed that Melchizedek is Jesus Christ.[70] Melchizedek, as Jesus Christ, lives, preaches, dies and is resurrected, in a gnostic perspective. The Coming of the Son of God Melchizedek speaks of his return to bring peace, supported by the gods, and he is a priest-king who dispenses justice.</p>
