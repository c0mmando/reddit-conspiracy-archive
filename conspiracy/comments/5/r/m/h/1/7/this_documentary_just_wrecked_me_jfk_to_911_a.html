        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">Here&#39;s a link to the video on Youtube.</a></p>

<p>I assume this has been posted on this sub before, but I&#39;ve never seen it till now and I thought I was fairly well informed on theories and such.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s very well edited and produced, and the far reaching connections the director makes are kinda all encompassing and terrifying.  </p>

<p>Not sure I wanna spoil the big bombshells or let you see it yourself.  I guess I could try adding the major takeaways below in an EDIT, perhaps using some sorta spoiler formatting?  Let me know.</p>

<p>bonus info i forgot:  the British Royal family isn&#39;t British, they&#39;re German.  They changed their name in like 1917 during WW1.  </p>

<p>EDIT4:  The Dutch and British Royalty actually funded the murder of their own people just to make more money and push back communism.  Dutch royalty actually helped hitler invade and pillage the netherlands...</p>

<p>Edit2: the famous jfk video, Zabruder film, has been doctored to hide jfk&#39;s car coming to a complete stop just before the final devastating headshot from the storm drain on the side of the road.  This is clear from a second video from the left side of the cars because u can see the cop motorcycles catch up to the limo. </p>

<p>Edit1: Spoilers </p>

<p>Rich industrialists made bank from WW1.  They wanted another big war so American businessman like Prescott Bush poured money into Germany to get control of their industry and bring Germany back to life, despite their absurd WW1 reparations/debt.  </p>

<p>Used Hitler as a puppet.  It wasn&#39;t hitler who brought back Germany&#39;s economy, it was huge investments from the USA and British and Dutch royalty.  at one early point the Nazi party&#39;s address was in manhattan, a building controlled by prescot bush and others</p>

<p>They wanted WW2 for war profiteering plus to stop russian communism.  Seeing the russian revolution and the murder of a royal family in russia, including the bayoneting of little princesses, scared the shit out of the other kings and queens, etc.  </p>

<p>usa industrialists and british royals and dutch royals made shitloads of money from slave labor at concentration camps.  That was the biggest purpose of the death camps, to use slave labor to exploit natural resources of germany and poland to make huge profits for the royal families of england, the netherlands, and american businessmen like bush, walker, and others.  Auschwitz in particular was next to a massive coal deposit the West had coveted for decades.  </p>

<p>EDIT 7?:   It was an American company that manufactured the gas that killed the Jews in the Concentration Camps.  maybe standard oil?  can&#39;t remember its a 4 hour film, </p>

<p>Ford motor company produced trucks for the nazis and high tech chemicals were made by usa firms and funneled to germany the entire war.  the nazis gave ford their highest award.  </p>

<p>in about 1934 these same ppl tried to overthrow FDR but the military man they chose to lead the coup betrayed them and warned fdr, who did nothing.  </p>

<p>JFK was killed because he pissed off the mob and the cia and industry.  it wasn&#39;t 1 group it was all of them and they&#39;re all working together.  </p>

<p>The final shot on kennedy came from a storm drain on the side curb of the road by some random low level cia stooge, some teen.  thats why kennedys head got shoved up and back.  the damn driver actually stopped jfks car after looking twice to see if he&#39;d been hit in the head yet.  no headshot?   then stop at this part of the street marked with yellow on the curb.  </p>

<p>The cop that lee harvey supposedly killed had a striking resemblance to jfk and they used his body to do a body switch with jfk, because it was gonna be too obvious that multiple shots hit kennedy and not only from behind (oswald fake story).</p>

<p>Watergate was actually to seize evidence of the real conspirators involved with the jfk assassination.  1 of their own was possed for being put in jail for 3 years and threatened to rat everyone out.  not smart.  they made his wife&#39;s plane crash; the watergate murder.  </p>

<p>he then talks about the usual 9/11 stuff we already heard about from loose change and others.  </p>

<p>all media, justice system, politicians, they&#39;re all corrupt as fuck and the mafia is also heavily involved.  </p>

<p>He claims george bush senior was in dallas the day jfk was shot and was standing outside the book depository after the shooting.  </p>

<p>woody harrelson&#39;s father was apparently an assassin/hitman who shot kennedy, along with like 6 other sniper teams .   </p>

<p>then the obvious: all these terror attacks are because we have no enemy.  need to keep justification for military spending and taxes.  </p>

<p>1 of the final claims is that the immigration of refuges in western nations is intentionally to induce terrorist attacks.  </p>

<p>EDIT3: It&#39;s disturbing that the filmmaker accuses Oliver Stone of being a CIA propaganda stooge with his film JFK starring kevin costner.  It seems the point was to focus the public on fake explanations of the jfk shooting and gove legitimacy to the absurd govt account.   I always wondered why aokiver Stone made that 9/11 movie with Nicholas Cage.  It makes sense if he&#39;s pushing the Man&#39;s narrative.  </p>

<p>Hmmm, but then stone has his world history tv films....</p>

<p>edit5:   notice how packed the parade route in dallas was?  except near the grassy knoll?</p>

<p>and in video u can see the secret service being waved off of the back of kennedys car.  1 agent throws his hands up like wtf?  im supposed to be on the back bumper</p>

<p>FINAL THOUGHTS: so am I to assume that JFK Jr was also assassinated, his plane crash?  basically for his father&#39;s sins against the mob and threats to the cia and industrialists?</p>

<p>the grand plans of tptb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is run by groups of elites. Council on Foreign Relations, Bohemian Grove, elite Freemasonry, elite colleges and universities, general staff of the armed forces, etc.</p>

<p>The British subverted America through the intelligence agencies, finally pulled off in 1963 when they killed Kennedy. Look into Dulles, Bush Sr., Permindex, etc. Our intelligence agencies were created by British intelligence, and many of our senior officials (including the current CIA director) have connection to British intel.</p>

<p>I realize this is really jarring (Britain was our ally, etc.), but don&#39;t take my word for it, go ahead and investigate yourself. It&#39;s more important that you think about it and learn, than that you agree with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you brother.  I went down this rabbit hole awhile ago. I see tptb as being a collection of world leaders, banks, the ultra wealthy etc etc. I think you are correct that there are thousands that comprise tptb, all working towards a common goal with disagreements on how to achieve that goal. I believe most of their power is because of the rampant brainwashing of the populace. I believe that is their true power. If we collectively acknowledged our free will we would instantly step outside the prison tptb created for us. </p>

<p>They&#39;re aligned with the British.</p>

<p>Do you know anything about the history of Skull and Bones? That flag flew over pirate ships for centuries before Yale was founded. They literally operated a network of ports, which enabled smuggling and piracy to flourish:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_haven">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_haven</a></p>

<p>It goes even further back than that, to the scattering of the Knights Templar. The Templars had vast holdings, including many ships.</p>

They S and B are fighting for control of the Crowns wealth. The Templars have been on the side of the crown since the 10th century. Where i live the Templars came here when the Jesuits were on the rise again and sided with the Crown, the crown in case you didn&#39;t know goes all the way back to the people who built the standing stones in Orkney 10,000 years ago before they moved to Egypt for a while and are now back in Britain again. All the stuff about the British/Masons/skull and bones etc being on the same side is a double bluff to muddy the waters. I can see Templar graves out my bedroom window, i can read the archives on George street in Edinburgh on account of special privileges  and i know for a fact there are three sides at war and i know for a fact almost all the conspiracy stuff about the freemasons/ skull and bones is 100% bullshit laid out for people to find so they can believe they&#39;ve figured it out while all the while something totally different is going on </p>

<p>Ok, here&#39;s a problem. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong. But it&#39;s best not to make arguments like this. Better to provide the sources and reasoning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Templars have been on the side of the crown since the 10th century</p>

<p>I would put it a bit later, when a lot of the Venetians took over.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking at this, and there certainly is a lot we don&#39;t know about the real origins of different people groups. But I&#39;m not at all confident reaching conclusions like this. We know almost nothing about antediluvian history and civilization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the stuff about the British/Masons/skull and bones etc being on the same side is a double bluff to muddy the waters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting this. The Masons are directly descended from the Templars who took over English craft masonry. They use many of their symbols, rituals, etc. Have you read much masonic history, or gotten into any of the higher orders (Shrine, Knights Templar, 30th degree+ of Scottish Rite)?</p>

<p>Do you know that Freemasons have published intentionally inaccurate information at times? Do you know about the Convocation of the Rose, where most of these secret societies meet together?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want another couple of really good documentaries to watch, you should check out Bart Sibrel&#39;s documentaries on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr6Vcvl0OeU">Astronauts Gone Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z1OaLv0Pq4">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you are unsure about the faking of the moon landing, take the time to pay attention to the demeanors of those being interviewed. They&#39;re annoyed, they&#39;re agitated, they&#39;re being badgered, they&#39;re being called liars. People tend to get upset about that stuff, but watch and listen to them all. Notice their avoidance of many questions, their deflections, their contradicting responses and information. Some get super fidgety and look avoid eye contact. Some sweat and others will altogether walk away as if they&#39;re not annoyed but in fear. If you&#39;re not convinced by the information and interviews, pay attention to what Edward Mitchell&#39;s son says at the end of <em>Astronauts Gone Wild</em> and ask yourself this: Why would somebody make such a threat when they don&#39;t even know they are being overheard? Not a comedic suggestion, but an actual suggestion as a reasonable course of action?</p>

<p>They&#39;re fun to watch, even if a bit cheesy.</p>

Bohemian grove secret society etc etc. but. Obviously the money all flows to somewhere. Unless it&#39;s just all made up and we should break free and start using another currency or use the barter system again.  But I&#39;m no law expert. Is it a law we have to use the dollar. Or whatever currency you use in your country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This documentary wrecked me as well. It&#39;s completely overwhelming how much disinformation and for lack of a better term, evil, they expose. After watching the whole video and having my mind completely blown, I thought to myself, if I was completely wrong about this, what else could I be wrong about... I immediately started seriously researching UFOs, and extraterrestrial encounters, and holy fucking shit... I tried to tell people, but once you&#39;re this far down the rabbit hole, there&#39;s really no way of discussing these topics with &#39;normies&#39; in person without coming across as a delusional conspiracy theorist. My only advice to anyone who&#39;s reading this is simply to keep digging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>First you dig for the truth about your enemy</em>
<em>Then, you dig their grave</em></p>

<p>In all seriousness, you&#39;re sort of right, but there definitely are things that we can do. There&#39;s a $300,000 finite model analysis being conducted at the University of Alaska Fairbanks that allegedly refutes the official models released by NIST regarding the third tower collapse on 9/11 that&#39;s scheduled be opened for peer-review this May. All documents related to the Kennedy assassination are to be released to the National Archives by this October. And look at, for instance, all the traction Pizzagate has been getting lately. These conspiracies theories would be nothing if it weren&#39;t for the actions of countless people out there digging for the truth. Stirring the pot can definitely get you killed or defamed, but I think it&#39;s better to go down a martyr, at least knowing that you tried to do the right thing. Your actions may not bring the perpetrators to justice, but perhaps you can help prevent another JFK, 9/11 (or potentially Pizzagate) type event from happening again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the most frustrating part is, is my friends will sit down and watch a 10 Hour documentary about the government railroading a guy on Making a Murderer and watch it in disgust.. But won&#39;t watch a 2 hour documentary with a stupid amount of evidence... Because there is just no way our government would kill 3,000 of its own citizens.. So irritating, half my friends think I&#39;m crazy when i bring this shit up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This documentary messed with me. It wasn&#39;t because there was any new information - it is a very concise and comprehensive collection of the most important or relevant information I&#39;ve come across in the last 8-9 years since I stopped saying &quot;I don&#39;t do conspiracy theories&quot; and decided to see what this long-ago-coworker was talking about. What bothered me about it was that it was around a year after I started reading about the r/MandelaEffect and while I have some things I&#39;m pretty certain about most I can chalk up to confusion, bad memory or people not paying attention to details. I&#39;d heard about the JFK ME here and some other websites but I&#39;d never actually read any details on it and because <em>Dark Legacy</em> provided kind of a clusterfracked set of information (I&#39;d still recommend it) I assumed the JFK ME was just another piece of the conspiracy theory that was dividing people, but nothing new or different. However, when I watched <em>JFK to 9/11</em> last Spring I had a moment when I first turned it on and I wondered if I would catch the ME surrounding JFK. The moment the limo rolled onto the screen I said &quot;what the fuck&quot; loudly enough my roommate across our apartment heard me through his closed door while gaming. I immediately paused the doc and went to read about the JFK ME. Sure enough, I&#39;d spotted it in about a second. I asked my roommate and he remembered the same number of passengers in the car as I did - 4, not 6.</p>

<p>The rest of this documentary was straight-up solid information about the <a href="http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/images/TheConspiracyToRuleTheWorld.jpg">conspiracy to rule the world</a> and I&#39;ve recommended it to everybody who asks for good information on the grand conspiracy or many of the more important events that have led to the world being what and how it is today. I always upvote this when it is posted.</p>

The spelling of brand names, products, of logos and such span over decades or can be of mkre recent products. The Berensten Bears is likely the most famous.
