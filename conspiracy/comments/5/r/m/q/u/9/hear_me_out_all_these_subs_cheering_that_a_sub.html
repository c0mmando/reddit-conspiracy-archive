    <div class="md"><p>It makes total sense. If I was to put myself in (their) position. I would get all the smaller subs shut down and attempt to control the narrative in the larger subs, think about it. They ultimately want to control the narrative, the larger subs would be the most valuable. That&#39;s why r/politics is absolutely biased, they IMHO have the narrative controlled there. </p>

<p>From my experiences, they will try to wear you down. They create a &quot;bait&quot; post, you respond, then I think if you have a good point they start to downvote the post, so nobody else sees it, and keep attacking your opinions, in this attempt to wear you down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you said that.  I got told off for mentioning r/communism yesterday because of their apparent absence of plans etc (that we can see at least).*  As you&#39;ve just made a comment talking about the mere &#39;what if&#39;s&#39; - how do those very same &#39;what if&#39;s&#39; apply to that sub in your opinion.  Remember, we&#39;re just talking specifically about:</p>

<p>&quot;So Nazism is an experiment you&#39;re willing to see where it goes again? What if they became a party? What if they got elected? What if they started instituting programs... how would you feel about those ideas then?&quot;  without displaying any complacency of course.</p>

<p>I joined an anti-fascist org years and years ago before anybody starts attacking the &#39;fucking nazi&#39;.  I hate fucking nazis.  Also hate the far left.  Also not a fan of Conservatives, Labour, Democrats, Republicans, anarchists... You&#39;re all really pissing me off tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see him defending Trump here, and a quick look through his profile makes me think you&#39;re trying to put words in his mouth. I also think Aaron Swartz likely had a much more nuanced view on all of this than you&#39;re giving him credit for. He also championed other causes such as transparency in government and freedom of information, which seem at odds with your choice to associate him with the Democratic Party (especially after this last election )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have used the term &quot;evidence&quot; instead of &quot;proof&quot;, my bad. </p>

<p>So, the only thing that actually happened in your source (I read that crap article and moved on to the abc investigation) is that Trump sold condos to Russians (as well as many people of other nationalities) and had some projects planned in former soviet countries which didn&#39;t go ahead. All of this happened before he was president. That is nothing I&#39;m afraid, it isn&#39;t evidence of jack shit and certainly is not big enough to impeach him. Keep reaching. He said he has no investments in Russia and the Abc investigation uncovered that...gasp...he has no investments in Russia. Pales in comparison to what was revealed to be factual by wikileaks with regards to Clinton.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t me. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not sure how you got that. Trump said it, but ABC showed it is false. </p>

<p>The article says the opposite, that he has benefited in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars from his business interests with Russians. I guess you can argue semantics, that the investments aren&#39;t physically in Russia - he just is partnered with powerful Russian businessmen. </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-trump-political-conflict-zone/story?id=42263092">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-trump-political-conflict-zone/story?id=42263092</a></p>

<p>Trump has had many deals with Russians, mostly real estate but also the Miss Universe pageant thing. He partnered with Russian nationalists. Nothing illegal or even wrong with that, when you aren&#39;t president. But he&#39;s president now, and has not divested his interest. He slapped a &quot;blind trust&quot; label on it, but experts have already stated that it is not a blind trust. He&#39;s still getting money from those partnerships and businesses, and knows where the money is coming from. Simply calling it a blind trust isn&#39;t the same as it being one. </p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/">http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,” Trump’s son, Donald Jr., said at a real estate conference in 2008</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/11/15/why-trump-wont-use-a-blind-trust-and-what-his-predecessors-did-with-their-assets/#728b07fe7915">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/11/15/why-trump-wont-use-a-blind-trust-and-what-his-predecessors-did-with-their-assets/#728b07fe7915</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You typically cannot simply transfer existing assets into a blind trust. As a practical matter it’s likely a complete non-starter,” says Leslie Kiernan, a partner at law firm Akin Gump and a former Deputy White House Counsel under President Barack Obama. For the trust owner to be truly “blind” to his portfolio, the assets typically have to be liquidated first, Kiernan says. The cash can then be funneled into the trust, to be managed by an independent trustee approved by the Office of Government Ethics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump would actually be able to legally avoid the conflicts of interest problems, because presidents are exempt if they report everything. All he has to do is report it. But instead of doing that, he is claiming this &quot;blind trust&quot; thing, which it isn&#39;t. Why not just report his business interests? The fact that he is avoiding it is extremely suspicious. But what we already know is incredibly troubling, even if he can use loopholes in the law to cover his tracks.</p>

<p>Impeachment isn&#39;t really a matter of legal vs. illegal anyway - it&#39;s a matter of political support. Whether or not he is impeached is more connected to how happy he keeps Congress, and the balance of power in it. The current Congress probably wouldn&#39;t impeach him with what he&#39;s doing so far, but he has already lost a lot of support on the GOP side. And 2018 is likely to see a big swing towards blue due to public outrage. </p>

<p>So I stand by my argument that &quot;something can be done&quot; about Trump being president. It will take time, it&#39;s not guaranteed, but politics is an ever-changing beast and he looks to be treading dangerous waters and it&#39;s less than 2 weeks into his term. </p>

<p>&quot;Alternate views&quot; is a funny way to say &quot;group of <em>literal neo Nazis</em> who explicitly made overt attempts to use Reddit to dox and hunt down people&quot;</p>

<p>You either don&#39;t know what racism means or you have never visited <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a>. They never made a secret of the fact that they were a white supremacist group. If you saw the things that got most upvoted on that sub, you&#39;d find a bunch of white supremacist propaganda </p>

<p>You mean the moderators of the subreddit???</p>

<p>You do know why they were banned, right? It&#39;s because the admins blocked a website that put bounties on doxxing people, which could not possibly be more against Reddit&#39;s well established site wise rules. And the mods of r/altright <em>manually unblocked links to that website</em>, and stickied a thread linking to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, you don&#39;t get the joke. Though there may have been a very few actual racists involved (and almost surely shills pretending to be neo-nazis) the vast majority of alt right people just like to say shit to challenge your limits of what&#39;s acceptable to say. Saying anything that is just anti- PC in general is simply the backlash society gets from trying to shut people up.

I don&#39;t see the difference between a group of people who identify themselves as a group (white) wanting a place on the planet they can call their own (white nationalism/supremacy in their own lands), and Zionism (Jewish people wanting their own). Or Japanese people, or Indians, or Chinese, etc.   Why is OK for everyone else to create establish those states, but white countries are told they need to accept the world or they are &quot;racist&quot;?</p>

<p>What does racism mean to you</p>

<p><em>noun</em></p>

<ul>
<li>prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one&#39;s own race is superior.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, sentiments promoted and expressed routinely on <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you care if someone is racist?</p>

<p>Is this a serious question? Have you never taken a United States history class, or a World History class for that matter? Are you genuinely unaware of the immense harm these ideals have caused to untold amounts of people and to society as a whole?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to sound like a jackass here but even a cursory knowledge about history, or even current affairs, would give you an understanding of why someone would care if someone else is racist.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except that you can&#39;t have that in America without flat out genociding/deporting tens of millions of people solely for the crime of being born brown? So it&#39;s better to learn how to fucking share.</p>

<p>And besides that, no one is saying racism in other cultures is okay just because they&#39;re pointing out the racism in your specific culture is bad. That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so you&#39;re using the dictionary definition of racism, excellent.  It&#39;s too bad you can&#39;t seem to reply without salting your posts with insults though, they didn&#39;t add anything and didn&#39;t help you get your point across. </p>

<p>Everyone in that r/Altright sub agreed that &quot;Asians have a superior IQ on average.&quot;  So does that make them racist when they say <strong>another</strong> race is superior to their own in some way?   It just happens to reflect what all of the science shows us.   Acknowledging general racial differences makes you a realist, not a racist.   People who pretend that we are all the same, that we are all equal, when the science shows us that we are not, are the ones who invite the conflicts we&#39;ve seen throughout history.   Forcing groups of people to live with each other, groups that are very different, groups that prefer not to live with each other, is what we historically refer to as invasion.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m fine living among any racial groups, and have for most of my life. I have multiracial family I love and support, plenty of friends who come from all over the world.  I simply acknowledge there are people who do have a preference to live only among similar to them, and I&#39;m fine with them too.  I&#39;m fine with people having the choice, the freedom, where as you, being so uncomfortable with the reality of races, want to take away peoples&#39; freedom of association.  I think giving people this choice, this freedom, is the most peaceful anti-war solution.  You, on the other hand, are anti-sovereignty, anti-freedom, and pro-conflict by not acknowledging this basic fact.  You have a totalitarian mindset and are basically inviting violence into the world because you can&#39;t accept that people don&#39;t think the way you do.  That is the dictionary definition of a bigot.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I am.  I am saying that.  I think it&#39;s fine for other cultures, other races to be &quot;racist&quot; (by your definition) just as I think it&#39;s just as fine for people to be &quot;multi-culturalists.&quot;</p>

<p>If everyone in a country happens to be the same race (like Japan for example), their is no discrimination based on race within their own borders.  Whereas here, in the US, the levels of racial discrimination and violence (&quot;hate crimes&quot;) aren&#39;t going away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe people who prefer to live among their own this are driven by hatred or a need to treat others as inferior.  It&#39;s just what makes them feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>They also said that black people are generally better at sports than white people. That is not what is at issue here.</p>

<p>You are in flat out denial if you are saying that the general consensus wasn&#39;t that white people are inherently better than everyone else. While they would concede that black people tend to do better atheletically than white people, they argued that despite this white people were inherently superior to them. While they would concede that Orientals tended to do better academically, they argued that despite this white people were inherently superior to them for other reasons.</p>

<p>Many people on that sub said, <em>explicitly</em>, in no uncertain terms, that they were white supremacists. They used the exact phrase &quot;white supremacist&quot; to describe themselves. It&#39;s not something that I am pulling out of my ass and attributing to them, it is literally a title they themselves donned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging general racial differences makes you a realist, not a racist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They weren&#39;t merely acknowledging the fact that there are differences and trends among different races of people. They argued that every other race was inherently inferior to them.</p>

<p>That is what made them racist. Literally, by definition. And the users on that sub would not deny it if you called them a racist. They embraced being called that with pride. So I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re fighting so hard against it.</p>

<p>This sounds an awful lot like you&#39;re blaming the abolishonists for the Civil War because they felt black people should be treated better than dogs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty rich that you&#39;re saying that people against <em>literal Nazis</em> are the invaders here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I simply acknowledge there are people who do have a preference to live only among similar to them, and I&#39;m fine with them too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a basic understanding of American history will teach us, &quot;I don&#39;t want to live around black people&quot; very quickly turns into &quot;Black people aren&#39;t allowed to live here&quot;. </p>

<p>And we kinda had this whole thing back in the 60&#39;s where it was plainly laid out that this inevitably results in people getting subpar services and treatment, and typically are treated as second class citizens. Which is why that shit is illegal nowadays.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we think that everyone having equal treatment under the law and people not being denied equal opportunities just because they committed the crime of being born brown is a <em>little</em> more important than someone never wanting to see a minority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think giving people this choice, this freedom, is the most peaceful anti-war solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, <em>we literally did this</em> in this country. It didn&#39;t turn out well. Giving people the &quot;freedom&quot; to deny services, housing, employment, or education to minorities just because they are minorities leads to millions of people getting fucked over royally.</p>

<p>And it is impossible to give white supremacists the &quot;freedom&quot; to live in their pristine lily-white society without doing this. Sorry, but racists don&#39;t get a safe space.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give them the &quot;freedom&quot; to do that, without necessarily restricting the freedoms of minorities to <em>exist</em> in their world. By definition. You can&#39;t have both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have a totalitarian mindset and are basically inviting violence into the world because you can&#39;t accept that people don&#39;t think the way you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only we let white supremacists do whatever they wanted. Then we would have world peace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is the dictionary definition of a bigot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am bigoted towards people who are bigoted towards minorities. I&#39;m not going to deny it.</p>

<p>But saying that being bigoted towards these bigots is equally as bad as being bigoted towards people just for being born is irrational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s fine for other cultures, other races to be &quot;racist&quot; (by your definition)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, of course is <strong>the</strong> definition of the word. Just so we&#39;re clear. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If everyone in a country happens to be the same race (like Japan for example), their is no discrimination based on race within their own borders. Whereas here, in the US, the levels of racial discrimination and violence (&quot;hate crimes&quot;) aren&#39;t going away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we&#39;re just going to ignore the thousands of years of human history that explain why the racial makeup of America is more diverse than the racial makeup of Japan, along with the fact that Japan is miniscule when compared to the US in terms of population and geographical size?</p>

<p>Japan&#39;s cultural makeup is not solely due to some &quot;Japanese supremacy&quot; movement they had.</p>

<p>There is a laundry list of reasons why America is not like that and can never be like that, and why <em>even trying</em> to make America like that would disenfranchise tens of millions of people.</p>

<p>If you sent every minority in the country to gas chambers and slaughtered them in droves, you&#39;d soon find yourself in a society where you can&#39;t have racial discrimination or hate crimes. But maybe this isn&#39;t the ideal?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe people who prefer to live among their own this are driven by hatred or a need to treat others as inferior. It&#39;s just what makes them feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about, are we? We&#39;re talking about regular users of r/altright. Who largely referred to themselves as White <em>Supremacists</em>.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be a <em>Supremacist</em> without thinking others are inherently inferior. By definition</p>

<p>Not in denial, I just read the sub very closely and the consensus, when taking upvotes into consideration, was simply that races were different, not generally &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than everyone else.   That&#39;s pretty much the idea behind all of the speakers at AmRen or Radix, which are pretty much the foundations of alt-right.   See, I am willing to listen to other peoples arguments that I don&#39;t necessarily agree with, but I&#39;m not going to misrepresent them to make my points, as you&#39;re doing here.  I don&#39;t need to add insults or gaslight either.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another point that you don&#39;t understand.  The argument is &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t a race be supreme (rules) in its own country?&quot; not that any particular race is generally superior to another.   They are Asian-supremacists for Asian countries, Jewish supremacists for Israel, etc. </p>

<p>What you are ultimately arguing against is white-sovereignty.  You are not going to change their minds, because it&#39;s obvious that you haven&#39;t even begun to understand their arguments.  They understand yours extremely well by contrast.  </p>

<p>Until you let go of the bigotry you admit you have and accept that humanity is imperfect, that there are people who just want to be left alone to live with what they see as their own kind, you are arguing against peace.</p>

<p>Because <em>you literally cannot have it in this country without disenfranchising tens of millions of people</em>. If they want to fuck off to their own island and make a sovereign nation where only white people are allowed, power to them. But when they advocate for that here, in the United States, the <em>necessarily</em> are arguing for taking away the rights of minorities in the process.</p>

<p>Like I said, we already tried this. There was this whole &quot;segregation&quot; thing where we tried to separate white people from minorities in this country so white people could have their &quot;sovereignty&quot;.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t work out very well on the whole &quot;basic human rights&quot; front.</p>

<p>Disenfranchising how, exactly?   Segregation never ended.  All of the communities in my city are naturally racially segregated anyway; we have Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Latino, and white communities, people generally live amongst their own and I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  We are also still racially segregated in a large part due to wealth.   Why do you think white-flight is a thing?  Whites, in large part, have been peacefully self-segrating all along, and now that option is being taken away with programs like HUD and section-8.   </p>

<p>The problem is that &quot;diversity&quot; has arguably had a negative effect on the population.  There is lower social trust, less income equality, higher crime, etc. and you&#39;re never going to convince those people otherwise because they have all the statistics and science and historical evidence to back up those arguments.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the <em>most peaceful</em>, because I understand their argument that diversity + proximity = conflict, and understand you will never change their minds about that.    We can hash out different means of implementing a resolution, be it balkanization or resettlement or whatever, but if all you believe is that anyone who disagrees with you is a &quot;RACISSSST NAZI XENOPHOBE&quot; and continue to be unwilling to consider different viewpoints, or even let them speak their minds, then you&#39;re obviously not interested in peace.</p>

<p>Should a minority have the right to move into a white community, where some members of that community moved to that community because they disliked minorities? Yes or no?</p>

<p>If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, which is how the law sees it, then you can never have the guaranteed racial segregation that white supremacists want. If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, the you are arguing that people should have their rights taken away from them because of the skin they were born with.</p>

<p>The problem is that &quot;diversity&quot; has arguably had a negative effect on the population. There is lower social trust, less income equality, higher crime, etc</p>

<p>Crime is at a lower rate than it has been in decades, and there aren&#39;t too many public opinion polls on the matter but I have a hunch that there was a smidgeon less social trust among minorities when they were routinely denied services, housing, employment opportunities, and equal treatment under the law.</p>

<p>And do you have any idea what income inequality looked like back then? Or does it not matter, because the ones who suffered from it were black?</p>

<p>No, they really don&#39;t. But the funny thing is about statistics is that you can make them say anything you want if you try hard enough, and you can make history say anything you want if you&#39;re willing to ignore large swathes of it. Which is exactly what they do.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that, because it is nearly impossible to sway someone with logic or reason if they did not arrive to their position via logic or reason. But just letting them have their way because they won&#39;t change their minds is not an ideal solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Disagree: Why do you think it should be everyone&#39;s right to live wherever they want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because everyone should have equal protection under the law, as outlined in the United States constitution, and allowing a community to make laws that specifically target people for being minorities is in direct violation of this. Furthermore, as outlined in Brown v. Board of Education(a super important Supreme Court case you&#39;ve probably never heard about), allowing institutional segregation is necessarily encouraging institutional inequality. </p>

<p>Because, as we&#39;ve already experienced firsthand in this country, it is impossible for the law to allow people to be treated differently because of their race and be forced to separate facilities, communities, and services, while at the same time ensuring that these facilities, communities, and services are equal.</p>

<p>And, I know this might sound a little crazy, but some people think that minorities getting subpar treatment in society just for being minorities is a bad thing.</p>

<p>Apparently you have no understanding of US history, no understanding of the United States constitution, and no understanding of the lessons we already learned as a society a long time ago. And that is why you believe what you believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, you&#39;re not going to convince me or alt-right people that diversity isn&#39;t detrimental</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying that it is impossible to convince you otherwise is explicitly saying that you refuse to admit that it is even remotely possible that you are wrong. Which is not something that a rational person does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, you&#39;re not even going to convince anyone it brings anything positive!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are correct. So long as no one sees minorities having equal treatment under the law and being able to have as much opportunity as anyone else to be successful as a positive.</p>

<p>But since a significant amount of people <em>do</em> see that as a positive, you are not correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that really the best argument for diversity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. Cherry picking a bad argument and representing it as the entirety of the opposition is <em>totally</em> a rational way to conduct discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing you&#39;re convincing me of is that you&#39;re anti-white <strong>supremacy</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You forgot a word.</p>

<p>Saying that white people should not be allowed to discriminate against minorities, make up their own laws to treat them differently, or otherwise infringe upon their rights is not &quot;anti white&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;anti-infringing upon the rights of everyone who isn&#39;t white&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, I&#39;m done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like how you had to tap out when the objective fact that we are, specifically, talking about people who promoted Nazi propaganda is brought up. I guess acknowledging this <em>objective fact</em> is your big no-no area.</p>

<p>What the fuck are you going on about? So we should never make any attempt whatsoever to learn from history because it&#39;s biased from the victor&#39;s viewpoint? We should ignore it outright?</p>

<p>Or should we acknowledge it, learn from it, and try not to repeat the exact same mistakes from back then?</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m wondering if you genuinely are completely ignorant of what America was like for minorities when Jim Crow laws and segregation were the law of the land.</p>

<p>But the truth is, you probably know all about it, you just don&#39;t care. You don&#39;t care if we make those exact same mistakes and undo the things we did to prevent those very things from happening, because you don&#39;t give a shit about the people hurt by these laws and these policies.</p>

<p>All you care about is the white people who don&#39;t like minorities can get what they want.</p>

<p>You say &quot;laws are just on paper&quot;, but <em>refuse</em> to look at why those laws were put on paper in the first place, which is what&#39;s really important here. </p>

<p>Not once have you even acknowledged the treatment of minorities under segregation, or that that when we <em>actually did</em> the thing you are currently advocating for, black people were treated like second class citizens. You are completely and utterly ignoring the other side of this, while at the same time saying with absolute confidence that you completely understand both sides of the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your idea of reality is entirely subjective and narrow-minded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your idea of reality apparently only goes as far back as a couple decades ago because you are dead set on ignoring the reasons why your ideology failed when it was the law of the land.</p>

<p>But seriously though, what&#39;s the point in even talking to you? You already stated in no uncertain terms that it is impossible for you to change your mind. That you refuse to listen to anything other than what you already believe to be the truth, and you already dismiss anything else out of hand as &quot;propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>Because you stated earlier that you will refuse to change your mind, you explicitly said in the same stroke that you refuse to be reasoned with and that you refuse to let go of your ideals regardless as to whether or not they are proven right or wrong.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m blocking you, and won&#39;t see any replies you make to this post. Since you&#39;ve essentially promised to be a complete waste of time either way. Goodbye. Thanks for affirming exactly how rational your kind can be, which is not very</p>

<p>I support the idea that everyone should be treated equally under the wall, but I don&#39;t support the idea that everyone is &quot;equal,&quot; because we aren&#39;t, everyone is different.

<p>They&#39;re selling the idea that censorship equals &quot;Freedom from Unpleasantness&quot;. This is a classic example of deception. In this case, get people to see something differently than it actually is.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really going on is that censorship is being sold as a way for people to feel secure. They want to feel secure that nobody will challenge their opinions, values or beliefs by expressing something different.</p>

<p>So people are actually demanding more censorship in the erroneous belief that it will make them happier and more secure.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that they&#39;re giving up their real freedom of expression (a form of Liberty) in exchange for some false idea of protection. It&#39;s happening as we speak.</p>

<p>I fail to see how this doesn&#39;t make it a witch hunt and doesn&#39;t make it a situation that could easily spiral into very bad situation. This was an <em>attempt to find the personal information of an individual</em> which is the definition of doxxing.</p>

<p>Was the witch hunt reposted at <a href="/r/alternativeright">/r/alternativeright</a>? I&#39;m assuming moderators get a message stating why their sub was banned so maybe we should ask them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cant just assume guilt if you want to be objective. That is bot what doxing is, Doxing is the <strong>public</strong> <strong>sharing</strong> of personal identifying information, which was not done on r/altright. It is not an attempt to find PII and even if it was, the attempt was sanctioned by and occuring on an off reddit site which never had the intention of posting it publicly rather passing it on to law enforcement. The &quot;witch hunt&quot; was not posted on the other sub as far as I know, it was a barely active sub. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying reddit did anything illegal or took anyones rights, just that they lied about why they banned the sub and its lesser used counterpart, and that the altright sub was not a &quot;neo nazi&quot; sub, rather a sub where there was a wealth of right wing idiologies including national socialists, and they were around 1/4 of the users. </p>

<p>You posit that a squadron of Soros bots had infiltrated <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a> and then posted doxx to get the sub shut down. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a great theory but the fact the mods stickied the doxxing post kinda leads me to believe it was the real neo nazi user base of the sub that led to it getting shut down, and thank goodness for that. </p>

People on Facebook and Twitter can call for the death of Trump all day even say they will do it themselves. One guy said if get this many subscribers he would do it. So a link off reddit to another site trying to expose somebody for attacking another is bad? Damn does anybody know of any platforms that is like reddit because I am done here.

Reddit has a right to ban people for any reason and in this case they found that the sub was collecting personal information on people in exchange for money with the threat of violence, retaliation,  and harassment. The sub was already walking a fine line for being a place where literal Nazis gather to talk about their ideas for genocide. Reddit has no obligation to give them a pulpit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in the context of the this thread we are talking about the recently banned sub <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a>,  which was a place that housed and espoused White Supremacist  and Nazi rhetoric.  Although I scarcely visited the sub, some of their top posts ranged from talking about literal genocide of non-white races to Hitler worship. They denied the holocaust, and hate Jews.  They want to use the terms white nationalism and race realism,  but I refuse to use politically correct language and just call them what they are,  which is white supremacists,  racists,  and Nazis (because of the whole Jews and genocide thing).  There are probably other reasons but that&#39;s the gist of it. </p>

<p>Or do you think its much more likely it taken in a much more systematic way where the admins create a case file of sorts, collected data, discussed it, planned the banning beforehand and whether to go through with it, set a deadline for it to happen/not happen, and then enacted that ban on said date?</p>

<p>As to white genocide, it isn&#39;t a case of believing it. White reproductive rates are currently less than replacement rate in every european country and the US. There is also a concerted effort to bring those of other races with higher birthrates into historically white countries. What is happening is exactly what happened when Jewish people moved to Palestine and started breeding like crazy, the same as when European settlers arrived in America and Australia. The new population out bread and outfought the old, and a demographic genocide ensued. This isn&#39;t some crazy groundless idea, it has a basis in historical fact and is provably happening right now. So yes I believe in white genocide the same way I believe the sky is blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What race are you? In my opinion no, it is not, thats a personal choice. That said there are those on the alt right who would say you are diluting your genes, destroying the white race, you&#39;re a race traitor etc. I don&#39;t care about your individual choices because I know that when left to your own devices generally humans prefer to matw with someone of their own race, even when there are other options on the table. There is a great deal of diversity of opinion on the alt right, we are not bigots (using the term bigot correctly, look it up).</p>

<p>For the most part the alt right is strongly against miscegination propaganda on TV and in films as it is an attempt to brainwash people into acting against their biological instincts. If everyone of every race never married within their race &quot;diversity&quot; would no longer exist, there would be no black culture, no white culture, no chinese culture, no middle eastern culture etc just one race with no history (kinda like the NWO plan, eh?).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s racist or wrong to say that ethnic diversity tends to tear at the fabric of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New York and California are the two most diverse areas in our country, and both of them have some of the largest economies in the world. </p>

<p>Singapore itself embraced diversity and focused on uniting the country between Muslims, Buddhist Malay&#39;s, Chinese, and Indonesians, expats, etc, and is one of the safest countries to live in and is in the top five of most indexes around the world for numerous signs of a great country to live in.</p>

<p>For me personally, I&#39;ve lived all over the world, and mostly in Asia. I&#39;ve lived in South Korea for four years, and I lived in rural Cambodia for one year. My wife is Singaporean and I plan to move there in the future. </p>

<p>In every country I&#39;ve been to, I&#39;ve always been very welcomed into their society and they embraced me, even if we had extremely different cultures. Diversity works if you embrace instead of fighting it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m relatively convinced that they had communication with Reddit administration to shut down <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a>.  I think they all got on there, posted personal information about someone and had their minions upvote it.  Then the admins just said &quot;Whelp, that&#39;s the last straw&quot; and banned them.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice Reddit admins are being very quiet about this particular ban and offering very few details.</p>

<p>In additoin to this, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> moderators are claiming they are seeing this behavior happen on <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> as well. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t say this much but Alex Jones is right when he says that the legacy media is losing its influence on the public.  So, make no mistake, if they can&#39;t control what you see on Television, then it stands to reason that they will do absolutely anything in their power to control what you see on the internet.  Hence all of this new talk about &quot;Fake News&quot; and these moves we&#39;ve seen on Reddit recently.</p>

<p>Whether or not that is true, it doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re allowed to hate other people. That&#39;s was the 1st amendment is for, to protect speech that you don&#39;t agree with. In a free market of ideas where nothing is censored, any extreme hate groups would natrually be silenced by logic and reason. The problem is that corporations and government allow hate-groups that fit their agenda flourish, even so far as shove the propaganda down your throats in school/academia/media, and then censor logic and reason. </p>

<p>How far out of realistically would it that these people are the ones breaking Reddit side rules in these sub reddits to get them banned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked the same question, similarly.</p>

<p>I wanted to know if people thought it was possible that SJWs made alts, went to that sub and broke the rules, triggering the admin ban.  Could they have been working with the admins or did they just assume the admins were watching?</p>

<p>Even though Reddit could just shut down <a href="/r/AltRight">/r/AltRight</a> because they wanted to, being a private company, it looks better to say, &quot;<em>(Oh it was because they were doxxing someone)[<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1yhswb/a_brief_compilation_of_srs_doxxing_brigading_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1yhswb/a_brief_compilation_of_srs_doxxing_brigading_and/</a>]</em>,&quot; when doxxing is the sort of shit SRS is well known for.</p>

<p>As to white genocide, it isn&#39;t a case of believing it. White reproductive rates are currently less than replacement rate in every european country and the US. There is also a concerted effort to bring those of other races with higher birthrates into historically white countries. What is happening is exactly what happened when Jewish people moved to Palestine and started breeding like crazy, the same as when European settlers arrived in America and Australia. The new population out bread and outfought the old, and a demographic genocide ensued. This isn&#39;t some crazy groundless idea, it has a basis in historical fact and is provably happening right now. So yes I believe in white genocide the same way I believe the sky is blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cant just assume guilt if you want to be objective. That is bot what doxing is, Doxing is the <strong>public</strong> <strong>sharing</strong> of personal identifying information, which was not done on r/altright. It is not an attempt to find PII and even if it was, the attempt was sanctioned by and occuring on an off reddit site which never had the intention of posting it publicly rather passing it on to law enforcement. The &quot;witch hunt&quot; was not posted on the other sub as far as I know, it was a barely active sub. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying reddit did anything illegal or took anyones rights, just that they lied about why they banned the sub and its lesser used counterpart, and that the altright sub was not a &quot;neo nazi&quot; sub, rather a sub where there was a wealth of right wing idiologies including national socialists, and they were around 1/4 of the users. </p>
