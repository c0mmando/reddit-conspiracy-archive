       Has anyone noticed how the media just went COMPLETELY silent of Pizzagate? Even after Ben Swann of CBS made that video about it, other media completely disregarded it. Even Trump's FBI team is not talking about it.

       Understand your point here but it's not "pizza" - there's a massive pedophile network across the world. It's being dismantled slowly but surely and it's more likely that the people out front talking about it in the legacy media were politely asked to stop while the raids are behind planned and executed. Yesterday 474 people were arrested in LA for a range of deplorable crimes including slavery and child trafficking and of course pedophilia. Stay strong and patient.

       Yes, but in this instance and many others these cases seem to be completely ignored by international media and just covered as local news. It also never gets to me why things like this are never investigated at large and just taken as individual cases. Especially with the FBI and the public having access to evidence and emails that, even if you don't believe in a nationwide or worldwide pedophilia network, you would perceive as fishy and just outright  unexplainable.

       The "media", their owners, their controllers, the government behind them - are in many cases likely directly implicated in this web. The grassroots media isn't implicated and that's why you see this LA report or Ben Swann. Then it gets buried by the "management"

       Just to note, pedophilia is no more a crime than wishing that someone was dead.   Possession of child pornography is a crime, as are things like statutory rape and sexual assault.  But simply being a pedophile is not illegal, as long as you don't act on those urges.

       When people talk about pedophilia being a crime, they're implicitly talking about molesting/raping children. Please do not be ridiculous, most people just don't like directly talking about kids getting diddled.

       Or maybe the pizzagate thing is not real and this one here was real? Ever thought of that? That maybe people who spend their professional life on finding child trafficers maybe have not found anything about pizzagate and instead spend their time with actual hunts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying pizzagate is 100% unbelievable or that the logos are not weird, but maybe it should also be at least an option to you that maybe it was coincidents and that there are actual conspiracies out there that deserve more attention than this?

       This is about a movement to finally dismantle an international criminal organization which has a choke-hold on society and governments all around the world. They do a lot of things. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, assassinations, kidnappings, bribery, intimidation, money laundering, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whoever they really, they are the world leaders in child trafficking. I don't really understand why, but it's happening and it has to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza connection was just weird enough to catch people's attention, and more and more are realizing just how serious the problem is every day.

       The "pedophile network" is not being dismantled.  I'm convinced that there are real systems of political blackmail which use pedophilia and other sexual dirt to gain compliance from powerful people.  Pizzagate touches that concept, but we haven't seen any evidence of that particular structure being investigated yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm someone who has been "debunking" the individual claims around pizzagate since its inception.  I firmly believe in the concept, but think the crowd-sourced investigation has been rife with poor logic and disinfo.  But I'm now more and more on board with the concept that there is something shady in the podesta emails- in particular the link with CPP.  Just not sure the investigation is on the exact right track yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 474 people being arrested in “Operation Reclaim and Rebuild”, is again misleading- and needs to be addressed for the sake of logic and reality.  We aren't talking about a "pedo ring", here.  This was a budgeted LAW ENFORCEMENT initiative against sex workers, and is being spun as having "saved exploited children".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that they were busting prostitutes, Johns and pimps, and a small portion of the sex workers they busted were underage.  Yes, of COURSE those were children who were being exploited and deserve to be rescued- they were probably mostly strung out runaway teenagers who are now working the streets to survive- maybe under the abusive hand of a pimp.  But the majority of those arrested were female sex workers who probably also deserve to be "rescued" from whatever condition is relegating them to being arrested for prostitution.

       It's among the elites. They ignore and assist the elites. Dyncorp, owned by Steven Feinberg, Donald trumps top economic advisor, was involved in a huge child trafficking ring. They call them brownstone operations. They are a huge government contractor. They lost no contracts. No arrests.

       Maybe, just maybe because all of Ben Swann's "evidence" that he provided is circumstantial with no clear lead to follow. Do you honestly believe that the owner of Besta Pizza was locking up children in his pizzeria in conjunction with Comet Ping Pong?

       Of course I don't believe such a thing happened, and I don't support that idiot who decided it was his own duty to investigate a pizza place. I believe that these two places have some sort of connection with the whole supposed pedophilia ring. The symbolism, the relationships between them and the emails.

       And of course they would do that immediately after the stories broke. They already knew what was in the emails' before they released (Since it's their employers emails'). So they could even plan how to handle it.

       Hahha. So "they" control the media, and the one narrative they've tried to hide is that a pizza shop owner molests kids. Okay. It was just an invented story to paint someone associated with Hillary Clinton scurrilously. Everyone was so hyped on hate for Hillary that they bought it. It's fake news folks. It's fake fucking news. It's okay. Move on. Or maybe, start looking at what Donnie's doing.

       You're missing the greater picture. This is a world wide network of pedophilia with many people in power implicated, the pizza shop owner is one small cog in the machine. The media is completely ignoring the evidence and trying to narrow it down to one shop to hide the true information of a greater scandal. I'm sure it will all come out eventually so we shall see where it leads.

       I think the nazi ideals is the framework for our society. The internet has made doxxing very easy and we are probably going to see censoring and targeting in the future but I am not worried about spreading truth because in the end the truth will set you free. Man only has power over you if you allow it.

       How many states have had a big pedo ring bust lately? Two or three of them?

       We should make a list of them so we can see which ones are still pending. I would bet real money that there is a pedo-ring operating in every single state in the union and of course the NSA knows all about it.

       Wait, so when the media talks about pizzagate and points out it's flaws, it obviously means that pizzagate is real because the media is going to such great lengths to cover it up.

       That's not the point. No msm said "Pizzagate started when people thought there was code words in the Podesta emails." Which is 100% truth, even if you don't think code is being used. The public was mislead when they were told it was "fake news" because it wasn't even news.

       So, again: there's no evidence and in months of that nonsense nobody has produced anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why pizzagaters are now left with pointing at real cases and claiming they are related to pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another couple of month, pizzagate will be an anecdote theory that people will laugh about. Like Jade Helm and Obama's third term.

       Pizzagate is not simply Comet and Besta. It's the entire elite underground child trafficking conspiracy. That exists. Who do you think traffics humans, poor people or rich people? If a poor nobody we have never heard o was running human trafficking I would be more shocked than if Jennifer Aniston was running it. It's one of the most lucrative businesses in the world and it is tax free income, and up until now the government let it happen without any inquiry.

       Tindergod is a waste of time.  I've ran into his comments on several threads.  He'll latch onto a tiny sliver of your post and then drive that into the ground using mockery, misdirection, mistruths, and strawmen.  Meanwhile, totally ignoring the point of the post, other facts, etc.  Maybe he is paid to be here, maybe not, but he's not worth your time.

       Again, you are only helping prove my point. Instead of looking at the content of the posts you attack the username because you can't actually formulate a solid response.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole comment chain is basically more poorly constructed claims of "evidence" in favor of Pizzagate being met with skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like almost all pizzagate related discussions it quickly turns into those who believe in it attacking those who question it.

       The two police sketches are different depictions of the same suspect based on eyewitness accounts. Additionally, the suspect was described as "aged between 20 and 40" by witnesses. The Podesta brothers are 68 and 73, which would have made them 59 and 65 at the time of McCann's disappearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more importantly, the sketches likely aren't even of the suspected kidnapper in the first place. If you look at the original report, it's pretty clear they're talking about a person of interest or suspected eyewitness:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance."
