It&#39;s being dismantled slowly but surely and it&#39;s more likely that the people out front talking about it in the legacy media were politely asked to stop while the raids are behind planned and executed. Yesterday 474 people were arrested in LA for a range of deplorable crimes including slavery and child trafficking and of course pedophilia. Stay strong and patient. </p>

It also never gets to me why things like this are never investigated at large and just taken as individual cases.

<p>This is about a movement to finally dismantle an international criminal organization which has a choke-hold on society and governments all around the world. They do a lot of things.

<p>But whoever they really, they are the world leaders in child trafficking. I don&#39;t really understand why, but it&#39;s happening and it has to stop.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;pedophile network&quot; is not being dismantled.  I&#39;m convinced that there are real systems of political blackmail which use pedophilia and other sexual dirt to gain compliance from powerful people.  Pizzagate touches that concept, but we haven&#39;t seen any evidence of that particular structure being investigated yet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m someone who has been &quot;debunking&quot; the individual claims around pizzagate since its inception.  I firmly believe in the concept, but think the crowd-sourced investigation has been rife with poor logic and disinfo.  But I&#39;m now more and more on board with the concept that there is something shady in the podesta emails- in particular the link with CPP.  Just not sure the investigation is on the exact right track yet.</p>

<p>But 474 people being arrested in “Operation Reclaim and Rebuild”, is again misleading- and needs to be addressed for the sake of logic and reality.  We aren&#39;t talking about a &quot;pedo ring&quot;, here.  This was a budgeted LAW ENFORCEMENT initiative against sex workers, and is being spun as having &quot;saved exploited children&quot;.  </p>

<p>The reality is that they were busting prostitutes, Johns and pimps, and a small portion of the sex workers they busted were underage.  Yes, of COURSE those were children who were being exploited and deserve to be rescued- they were probably mostly strung out runaway teenagers who are now working the streets to survive- maybe under the abusive hand of a pimp.  But the majority of those arrested were female sex workers who probably also deserve to be &quot;rescued&quot; from whatever condition is relegating them to being arrested for prostitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two police sketches are different depictions of the same suspect based on eyewitness accounts. Additionally, the suspect was described as &quot;aged between 20 and 40&quot; by witnesses. The Podesta brothers are 68 and 73, which would have made them 59 and 65 at the time of McCann&#39;s disappearance.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, the sketches likely aren&#39;t even of the suspected kidnapper in the first place. If you look at the original report, it&#39;s pretty clear they&#39;re talking about a person of interest or suspected eyewitness:</p>

<p>&quot;Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine&#39;s disappearance.&quot;</p>
