       His supposed "Muslim ban" (its not a damn Muslim ban!) Made a older woman die who was heard to America... And they published a correction that the son lied... But no one is making as large a deal that the story was a lie. Fake news.  And no one will make sure to spread the truth either.  The correction is on a 2nd link you need to click on.   And when people are told he lied, they'll just come up with an explanation that makes then feel good.

       Wrong. Because of what the media says, people like us have a harder time talking sense to other people and try to educate them. Not saying we should care what others think on a personal level (that's up to each of us) but we should care as a group, because we are losing the news war. Yes we are gaining believers each year but often times they are to scared to admit that think like we do.

       Journalistic integrity is important yes,  what you fail to notice is that the 6 corporations that own the media do not have journalistic integrity anymore.
I trust the Intercept.  But Cable news? No.  Like 90% of news sources? No.

       Umm, yes. For over 18 months now. To me it's clear the media has been trying to run a psy-op against Trump since the moment they realized he was a real candidate. It's been recently proven through email leaks that the mainstream media takes marching orders, at least partially, directly from  Democratic party officials.

       Trump spoke about banning Muslims on his campaign. He passes an EO immediately banning muslim-majority countries and you're telling me he didn't know it would be viewed as a Muslim ban? Knowing this, he would have issued a statement along with it stating "This is not an attack on the religion of Islam, but on those who would use Islam to justify acts of Evil. This is a defensive measure based on intelligence information. We know you, Muslims of the world, condemn the actions of the extremists and that you understand our need for safety as well as yours." or something to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there was no gesture or offering. This was intended to be viewed as a Muslim ban specifically to create unrest and controversy. That is not how a president should be acting.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes the media plays right into it because they are rabid and ratings are through the roof on anything Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what you get when you have a for-profit media (not that a non-profit media is better)

       I completely read and understood your post.  And believe that it would have been a more honest post had you -- in full disclosure -- noted that Obama had also made a similar 'ban' and nobody went bananas.
      </p>
      <p>
       To bemoan this president 'acting' a certain way (he is not) when the previous -- and not so far-distant - president did the same thing without media fanfare is not entirely objective or fair posting, that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is rabidly anti-Trump at the moment, even when Trump does the same things Obama did.

       The GOP went bananas over everything Obama did. You can say this is all partisan but that's just containing this to America. Countries and leaders around the world, including many GOP high-ranking people have condemned or shown concern over this action far and above anything Obama did. This could have all easily been avoided with a statement that clarified its intent, which was conveniently absent, because the outrage is intended. Obama always intended to prevent outrage while this administration aims for it and THAT is the point I'm making here.

       I'm very much so opposed to president Trump's party for many reasons. That being said, I despise this. Fake news is likely one of the leading factors that got him elected, and continuous to perpetuate stupidity. This fuels the fire so much for trump supporters. God dammit.

       Well basically, the story is fact-checked by the guy with the top comment. Then he's fact-checked by the guy with the second top comment and an opposite view. Then they just argue like stupid bitches.

       This is about the conspiracies of and examples surrounding the media's false narrative about Trump and how the luggenpresse as turned normal people into frothing nazi witch accusers based on untrue lies and skewed fake news propaganda.  Don't you also  find it interesting how some polls have Trumps approval at around 60% and others, who by the way said he was going to lose, have him in the 20s?
