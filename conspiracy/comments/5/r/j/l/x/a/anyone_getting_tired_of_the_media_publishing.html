    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Because of what the media says, people like us have a harder time talking sense to other people and try to educate them. Not saying we should care what others think on a personal level (that&#39;s up to each of us) but we should care as a group, because we are losing the news war. Yes we are gaining believers each year but often times they are to scared to admit that think like we do.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump spoke about banning Muslims on his campaign. He passes an EO immediately banning muslim-majority countries and you&#39;re telling me he didn&#39;t know it would be viewed as a Muslim ban? Knowing this, he would have issued a statement along with it stating &quot;This is not an attack on the religion of Islam, but on those who would use Islam to justify acts of Evil. This is a defensive measure based on intelligence information. We know you, Muslims of the world, condemn the actions of the extremists and that you understand our need for safety as well as yours.&quot; or something to that effect.</p>

<p>But there was no gesture or offering. This was intended to be viewed as a Muslim ban specifically to create unrest and controversy. That is not how a president should be acting. </p>

<p>But yes the media plays right into it because they are rabid and ratings are through the roof on anything Trump.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you get when you have a for-profit media (not that a non-profit media is better) </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The GOP went bananas over everything Obama did. You can say this is all partisan but that&#39;s just containing this to America. Countries and leaders around the world, including many GOP high-ranking people have condemned or shown concern over this action far and above anything Obama did. This could have all easily been avoided with a statement that clarified its intent, which was conveniently absent, because the outrage is intended. Obama always intended to prevent outrage while this administration aims for it and THAT is the point I&#39;m making here.</p>
