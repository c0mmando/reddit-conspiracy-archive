       That place is about as pro George soros, censorship and hillary clinton as it gets. Most conspiracies stem from the things that sub pushes the most.

       It's an obvious takeover attempt and no doubt most of the CTR/shareblue shills congregate there and in r/politics.

       For them to succeed in an infiltration on this sub, they would need to play devils advocate.... they do that and they will end up learning a thing or too.

       I'm not sure what you mean by trumpster. Is that supposed to be an insult? But there's a lot of users on t_d and here that think the same, unlike the Clinton and soros loving sub ETS.

      <p>
       ETS is a sub based on and full of the wretched minority on t_d.

       Point is, ETS is getting called out left, right and centre in r/conspiracy.

       Well that sounds like a right hot mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't be surprised that CTR survived and morphed into a new venture considering how wild the anti-Trump sentiment has been whipping about lately. As I write I'm watching a new segment about protesters burning shit at UC Berkley. The time is certainly ripe for a refreshed campaign of agenda-pushing across all avenues of social media and it's easy enough to get angry SJW types worked into a frenzy and support their narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks that it's bogging down the sub again (it would be lovely if they kept their business within the politics sub) but I suppose that's how it goes. There aren't many places left on Reddit that you can share an opinion that doesn't line up 100% with the rabid "liberal" theme without getting attacked or downvoted until your comment is hidden.

       That's mostly just trying to push pro trump stuff.

       As inappropriate a lot of t_d content is here, it still aligns in some way with what this place is about, especially at the moment.

       ETS is the complete opposite, like I say, they are pro Clinton, pro soros, pro censorship and the worst part is they will downvoted and censor any conspiracy if there is a remote chance it may reflect well on trump.

       Don't go by that.  It's one of the most annoying things on r/conspiracy.  All accounts older than 2 months had to be 2 months old at some point, including yours.  Some of the shill accounts are as old as OPs mum.

       It's been thrown by a lot of sometimes inappropriate protrump posts, but I'm pro trump, but pro conspiracy-theory-mentality first. I've been posting and coming here for years.

       I'll be the first to investigate trump if and whine that time comes.

       ETS and t_d can't be compared here. ETS stands for everything against what we stand for... clinton, soros, censorship. At least, for now, a lot (certainly not all) of what is going on in the t_d aligns with what is discussed here.

       Post history is a great start. I noticed a lot of these shills have high karma, older accounts, and that typically have a gigantic gap that prior to Q1/Q2 of 2016 (primary election/shilling season)

       It's been a very noticeable trend that these users have the highest voted and often times gilded comments that follow the MSM narrative or propogate disinfornation. Very obvious examples would be the sorting this sub by top and looking at the profiles of the top commenters.

       I fucking hate what they've done to this website. It's ruined it. This is what makes me keep digging and calling these people for who and what they are.

       Well that sounds like a right hot mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't be surprised that CTR survived and morphed into a new venture considering how wild the anti-Trump sentiment has been whipping about lately. As I write I'm watching a new segment about protesters burning shit at UC Berkley. The time is certainly ripe for a refreshed campaign of agenda-pushing across all avenues of social media and it's easy enough to get angry SJW types worked into a frenzy and support their narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks that it's bogging down the sub again (it would be lovely if they kept their business within the politics sub) but I suppose that's how it goes. There aren't many places left on Reddit that you can share an opinion that doesn't line up 100% with the rabid "liberal" theme without getting attacked or downvoted until your comment is hidden.
