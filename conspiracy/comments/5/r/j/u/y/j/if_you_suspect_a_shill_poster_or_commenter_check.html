    <div class="md"><p>Well that sounds like a right hot mess.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that CTR survived and morphed into a new venture considering how wild the anti-Trump sentiment has been whipping about lately. As I write I&#39;m watching a new segment about protesters burning shit at UC Berkley. The time is certainly ripe for a refreshed campaign of agenda-pushing across all avenues of social media and it&#39;s easy enough to get angry SJW types worked into a frenzy and support their narratives. </p>

<p>Sucks that it&#39;s bogging down the sub again (it would be lovely if they kept their business within the politics sub) but I suppose that&#39;s how it goes. There aren&#39;t many places left on Reddit that you can share an opinion that doesn&#39;t line up 100% with the rabid &quot;liberal&quot; theme without getting attacked or downvoted until your comment is hidden. </p>

<p>ETS is the complete opposite, like I say, they are pro Clinton, pro soros, pro censorship and the worst part is they will downvoted and censor any conspiracy if there is a remote chance it may reflect well on trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that sounds like a right hot mess.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that CTR survived and morphed into a new venture considering how wild the anti-Trump sentiment has been whipping about lately. As I write I&#39;m watching a new segment about protesters burning shit at UC Berkley. The time is certainly ripe for a refreshed campaign of agenda-pushing across all avenues of social media and it&#39;s easy enough to get angry SJW types worked into a frenzy and support their narratives. </p>

<p>Sucks that it&#39;s bogging down the sub again (it would be lovely if they kept their business within the politics sub) but I suppose that&#39;s how it goes. There aren&#39;t many places left on Reddit that you can share an opinion that doesn&#39;t line up 100% with the rabid &quot;liberal&quot; theme without getting attacked or downvoted until your comment is hidden. </p>
