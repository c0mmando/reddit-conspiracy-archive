    <div class="md"><p>Well, probably accurate. It&#39;s been established the basement belongs to a different building. Still owned by the same guy. I find pizza gate has a lot of course material. It&#39;s crazy how more believable something is when you have the source. Like my math teacher used to say, you have to show your work. I don&#39;t wanna see the answer. I need to see how you got there. Pizza gate is far above in providing the clear path of understanding that they are definitely using codes and it&#39;s about something bad, all since they only seemed to show interest in sex, morbid art, and kids...  then all their connections have involvement in stuff having to do with kida, but have gotten in trouble for missing doings.... pertaining to kids.... I mean, my math teacher wouldn&#39;t complain about showing my work. I may have a decimal error, but the average of the result is on track.</p>

<p>I am unfortunately having trouble finding a link to, but I&#39;m still googling for it.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s interesting to note how popular this post got.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the major players, actually named, in the piss gate dossier have been found dead (of a heart attack in the back seat of his own Lexus!) or been arrested for treason.</p>

<p>The dossier suggested that 19% of oil company Rosneft would be a bribe for dropping sanctions on Russia. After the election, by some bizarre coincidence, 19% of the oil company was sold. Part of the deal was to an untraceable company in the Cayman Islands.</p>

<p>Many of Trump&#39;s team have direct ties to Russia, having worked for the Russian government, in Russia. Others have worked for Russia Today, the official propaganda arm of the Russian government.</p>

<p>Surely that&#39;s enough to at least cause people to think there might be more.</p>

<p>The very resistance to this idea, on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of all places, is itself curious.</p>

<p>And there are many more connections, but those are just what came to mind immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer? This sub has never trusted the MSM/establishment and the way the Trump-Russia connection was presented by the MSM/establishment was a complete joke and seemed like desperation. The whole Buzzfeed shenanigans with pissgate felt like a forced conspiracy and discredited the rest of the dossier.</p>

<p>Could there be something to the Trump-Russia connection? I&#39;m game to talk about it but is there anything else than the dossier and Manafort?</p>

<p>Regarding the sale, I found the Glencore and Qatar connection interesting... I know Clinton had ties to both. Did the Trump conspiracy structure it this way to make it look like Clinton? Or was the dossier put out in advance by the establishment to make it look like Trump when it happened later? Or is this all an independent Russian disinfo campaign to just cause confusion between everyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, thank you for the civil reply. I really do appreciate that.</p>

<p>To address your point. I think one of the major advantages of this sub is that hypotheticals can be put forward and seen to their logical conclusions in a collaborative environment. It seems that this sub is pathologically avoidant to even considering that the Steele dossier could be true.</p>

<p>Obviously, if it&#39;s left up to one person to investigate, they aren&#39;t going to find all the connections that a whole sub would, if they were engaged to the level that, say, they were with respect to pizzagate.</p>

<p>I just find it utterly astounding that people in a conspiracy sub would find such a conspiracy theory not even worth considering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. The thing is, nobody has put any effort into digging into any connections further than what has been presented to us. So it feels forced.</p>

<p>I think there is a misconception as to why this sub is perceived to be more interested in Pizzagate than Trump scandals. For the most part, it&#39;s not partisanship. It was participation. I forget where the genesis was (here, t_d, 4chan) but a handful of people started making connections during the one of the WL releases. Not the MSM, not Brietbart, not any media but conspiracy theorists. And these were verified emails with some really strange language. Every day we were waiting for more releases, making connections. Media silent. It felt like we were actually doing something rather than sharing some GLP LARP links. Regardless of political beliefs, a lot of people were excited to see Trump win because all the effort may actually mean something. Did we get played and are we distracted from what Trump is actually doing? Played, doubtful. Distracted, maybe. These were real emails. </p>

<p>So when the MSM screams &quot;Russian Conspiracy&quot; it doesn&#39;t really resonate with us because it feels like we are being spoonfed a conspiracy rather than making connections on our own. Does that mean something isn&#39;t going on behind the scenes with Trump? Not at all. It just means it&#39;s hard to get traction when it&#39;s a synthetic rather than organic conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. That&#39;s a fair point. If understand you correctly, you are suggesting that there aren&#39;t enough breadcrumbs here for people to put together to make it worthwhile?</p>

<p>Though I&#39;m not so sure I agree with you on the role of partisanship. Now, I&#39;m going to make a statement that may betray some bigotry on my part, so I fully admit I could be biased and wrong in this assessment, but I find that conspiracies have typically been a right-dominated hobby. I think there is an a priori correlation between this sub and Trump support that existed even without pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. Obviously I can&#39;t speak for everyone.</p>

<p>I think if someone presented a well-sourced post with new info that didn&#39;t feel like it was forced, it could gain traction. I&#39;d be happy to look into it. The challenges are 1) what I said above about the hope team Trump pursues Pizzagate may cause some people to look the other way for now and 2) with the recent re-funding of CTR, the way /politics looks right now, and the MSM, people are skeptical that it feels forced. Any post would have to be high-effort.</p>

<p>Regarding right v left wing conspiracies, I think your somewhat half-right. Think about the roots of the ideologies. The right usually favors less government, so a lot of right-wingers will parrot the corrupt government conspiracies (tyranny). The left usually favors egalitarianism, so a lot of left-wingers will parrot the corrupt big business / social prejudice conspiracies (exploitation). </p>

<p>The problem is is that the left is now in bed with big business. So all they have is to call Trump and everyone around him a racist bigot. Which is a much more subjective thing to prove than 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p>This sub is not short of Bush/Cheney conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer.  We never even broke the skin of all the Clinton stuff and the Trump/Russia thing was so very obviously spun out of that.  Even if there is something in dossier that you mentioned, it still doesn&#39;t mean that the Russians &#39;hacked the election&#39;, which is the connection we&#39;re supposed to make.</p>
