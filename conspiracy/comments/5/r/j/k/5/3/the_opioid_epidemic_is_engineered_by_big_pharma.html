       ** TLDR: the opioid epidemic is engineered to make profits for big pharma. Their pain pills cause opioid addiction. Then they conspired to increase the price of naloxone and lobby for the gov to buy the drug. Naloxone is the drug that stops overdoses. **

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Six pharmaceutical executives who worked for fentanyl company Insys Therapeutics, including a former CEO, were arrested on Thursday and charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to defraud insurance companies and bribe doctors to prescribe their powerful and addictive opioid painkiller, according to an indictment from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts.

       There seems to be money flowing into the Clinton Foundation from big pharma. The CEOs are donating to Hillary's campaign. On the campaign trail I've seen Bill Clinton name drop the drug naloxone. The recent emails on wikileaks confirms that the one of the goals of the Clinton Foundation is to make this drug be everywhere. One of the manufactures of this drug is Hospira, a company recently bought by Pfizer.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Naloxone’s rise to prominence has been good for its manufacturers, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer PFE -0.06% , which both doubled the price over the past two years. (Three other companies, Mylan MYL -2.65% , Kaléo, and Adapt Pharma, also recently entered the market.) But more significant: It saved 8,000 people from an overdose last year—a number that’s growing fast.

       There seems to be serious conflicts on interest. been the campaign and the companies. For example Clinton wants to give these campaigns 7.5 billion dollars through federal programs. This is an OP-Ed from Hillary from last year:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Today I’m releasing a strategy to confront the drug and alcohol addiction crisis. My plan sets five goals: empower communities to prevent drug use among teenagers; ensure every person suffering from addiction can obtain comprehensive treatment; ensure that all first responders carry naloxone, which can stop overdoses from becoming fatal; require health care providers to receive training in recognizing substance use disorders and to consult a prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing controlled substances; and prioritize treatment over prison for low-level and nonviolent drug offenders, so we can end the era of mass incarceration.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Despite the drug not being under patent, there is still a virtual monopoly on the manufacturing of the drug. The allows the 2 or 3 companies making the drug to raise praises for no reason
      </p>
      <p>
       In an emailed statement today, Amphastar CFO Bill Peters said, the company's price for naloxone was less than competitors.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Indeed, our price for naloxone after the increase is still the lowest among similar products in the United States. The fact that we have the lowest naloxone price is all the more remarkable because it is sold in a pre-filled syringe associated with a higher manufacturing cost. On average, the price of naloxone in the U.S. market (in vial form) is $37.23 per milligram, or 226% of the price of Amphastar's naloxone (in a prefilled syringe) when considering the price per milligram of naloxone. With all of this in mind, I am confident that we can assist Ohio in a similar way that we did with New York as we are committed to public safety."
       </p>
       <p>
        In making his request, DeWine pointed to $6-per-dose rebate that Amphastar this month agreed to pay back to New York, an agreement that also protects the state against wholesale price increases for a year. According to The New York Times, that rebate was sought after police departments in the state, as well as across the country, began complaining that price increases were limiting their ability to save lives. In Georgia, for one, the price rose from about $20 a dose to $35 to $40 a dose. Health officials in Baltimore have been handing out kits containing naloxone to relatives and friends of people where there were concerns of overdoses but has had to limit that to 2,000 from 3,600 in the face of price increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        The company, which went public last year, reported 9-month revenues of about $155 million and an operating loss of nearly $11 million for three quarters. It did not break out sales of naloxone in its last filing but said the drug was having "increased sales."   Amphastar is not the only company to be caught in the cross-hairs of public sentiment for raising prices of the overdose drug. The Clinton Foundation last month said it had negotiated a discount with Kaléo for the naloxone autoinjector it makes. Rain Henderson, CEO of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, wouldn't name the price but told the Times it would make it available to any institution that can distribute it widely. The foundation has approached other naloxone makers but Kaléo was the first to respond.

       Clinton seems more concerned about providing drugs to treat overdoses, rather than combating the over use of opioids in the US medical system or seriously helping people battling addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is interesting about her plan to make naloxone widespread, is that it lines the pockets of her donors, while reducing the number of deaths from overdoses. This plan could change this statistic, without changing the number of addicts in various communities. It wouldn't solve an addicts problems, just makes their habits less deadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wondering if if someone here with more experience at looking at campaign donations could find anything illegal. It seems highly suspicious to me that you can take millions of dollars of money from companies, and then name drop their products in Op-eds and speeches while campaigning. There are different ways this problem could be solved, such as developing non-addictive pain medication. However, a Clinton administration and the Clinton foundation want to push a band-aid solution on this opioid addiction epidemic; this of course increases the money that flows into their donor's pockets. I think this is one of the easiest cases of Clinton being influenced by campaign contributions and Clinton Foundation donations.

       I've continued to dig and I have found something extremely interesting. I was having trouble linking Hillary Clinton to the Pfizer's Super Pac, but Pfizer has been extremely active this year, giving thousands of dollars to Democrats. I started to cross reference the Democrats they give money too with the list of Democratic Ssuperdelegates. Here are the links I'm using: Pzifer's PAC:

      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that Pfizer gives money to superdelegates who then pledge their vote to Hillary. I think there needs to be some serious analysis of the money going to superdegelates; it is probably far more cost effective to get a candidate via superdegelates than it is to donated to Hillary directly.

       Update:
      </p>
      <p>
       The access of this drug is now being more widely available, in Florida for example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First responders in Florida have administered naloxone for years. But under a measure approved by the Legislature this year, patients and their families can now quickly get the drug from a pharmacy. Naloxone, sold under the brand name Narcan, isn't available over the counter. But patients and their families no longer have to get an individual prescription from a doctor to access the drug. Instead, they can purchase an autoinjector or intranasal version of naloxone through their pharmacists if the pharmacy receives a so-called blanket "standing order" from a doctor. "This gives better access to patients who didn't have that access before," said Michael Jackson, executive vice president and CEO of the Florida Pharmacy Association. "This medication can save lives."

        “One concern is that money for naloxone is coming out of the same pot as money for treatment and prevention,” Alison Knopf, editor of Alcoholism &amp; Drug Abuse Weekly. “The costlier it is, the less money for treatment and prevention.” Meanwhile, last February, Kaleo Pharma raised the list price for two single-dose injectors to $3,750, from $750, a price that was set last November, after previously costing $575, according to Truven.

(Sec. 902) HHS may establish a grant program to support prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs (e.g., naloxone) for patients at an elevated risk of overdose, including patients prescribed an opioid.
Grant recipients may use the funds to purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs, establish a program for prescribing such drugs, train health care providers and pharmacists, track patients and outcomes, offset patient cost sharing, conduct community outreach, and connect patients to treatment.

       <p>
        Lali's Law
(Sec. 1302) HHS may make grants to states that allow standing orders (documents that allow a person to acquire, dispense, or administer a prescription medication without a person-specific prescription) for opioid overdose reversal drugs (e.g., naloxone). Grants may be used for:
       </p>
       <p>
        *developing standing orders for opioid overdose reversal drugs for pharmacies,
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         encouraging pharmacies to dispense drugs pursuant to such a standing order,

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide information to certain prescribers on best practices for prescribing naloxone for patients receiving chronic opioid therapy or being treated for opioid use disorders. (Naloxone is a prescription drug used to rapidly reverse an overdose of opioids, which are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.) The information must be provided to prescribers in federally qualified health centers and the health care facilities of the Indian Health Service.

        The compromise legislation also includes language to encourage naloxone co-prescribing in federal health settings. Kaine authored the Co-prescribing Saves Lives Act, a bipartisan bill that would encourage physicians to co-prescribe the life-saving drug Naloxone alongside opioid prescriptions and would make it more widely available in federal health settings.

       This move will allow the manufacturers of narcan to make huge amounts of money for decades to come due to the constant "need" to replace expired drugs for first responders around the country:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to one report, Baltimore spent $118,236 on naloxone in fiscal year 2016, more than triple the $33,540 the city spent in 2014...
       </p>
       <p>
        In a rush to head of a growing epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses, many state and local government tapped into emergency funds to get naloxone to their first responders. Or else they took advantage of limited-run programs like the federal government’s Rural Opioid Overdose Reversal Grant Program, which distributed just $1.5 million to 15 communities....
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Health and Human Services announced at the end of August that it will provide up to $11 million to fund the purchase and distribution of naloxone, but only a dozen states will see any of that money....
       </p>
       <p>
        But naloxone doesn’t last long. In May, the county had to destroy half of its remaining naloxone stores—about 200 of the 900 kits it originally purchased in 2014 from Amphastar—because they had expired.....
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of other police departments rely on money seized during drug investigations to fund their naloxone programs. And in July, a judge in Pittsburgh took the unusual step of requiring two convicted drug dealers to shell over nearly $4,000 to pay for naloxone.

       It used to be sold as low as $4, and several politicians are complaining about the recent price hikes. Small companies that make the drug get bought by bigger companies (look at Pfizer purchasing Hospira).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As of October 2014 — the most recent time for which prices are available — Hospira's version of naloxone was $15.80 a dose. That's up from $0.92 a dose in 2005, according to Truven Health Analytics. The price of Hospira's version of naloxone hit a peak of $21.90 a dose in January 2014. Pfizer purchased Hospira last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, Kaléo has raised the price of its naloxone product, Evzio, several times since last year. In November 2015, the price went up to $375, followed by an increase to $1,875 in February 2016. Since then, the price has been raised to $2,250 for each single-dose injector. Evzio, which is an auto-injector that works like an EpiPen and is specifically created for use by people without medical training, was introduced at $287.50 for each single-dose injector in July 2014, according to Truven....
       </p>
       <p>
        The price increases, combined with the increase in demand, have caused sales of naloxone to jump from $21.3 million in 2011 to $81.9 million last year, according to numbers from prescription-tracking company IMS Health and cited by The Los Angeles Times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amphastar, one of the two producers of the lower-priced injectable naloxone, saw a revenue increase of 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015, according to a press release. The company attributed that increase largely "to an increase in sales of naloxone to $10.3 million from $6.7 million."

       Unless this issue get more publicity the trend for this will continue. This will mean less people will get the drug, and more tax-payer money will line the pockets of private companies. The companies are exploited a high demand, with cartel like behavior. The extreme price hikes suggest this has nothing to do with the cost of production.  Other countries negotiate drug prices, why can't we?

        Clinton would also boost evidence-based prevention programs in schools and make naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, more widely available. Some states have already made naloxone available over the counter so family members and friends of addicts can purchase it. She's also stressed a need to improve and integrate mental health and substance abuse care, as the two often occur together.

       Update - December 2016
Big-Pharma Executives were arrested for pushing fentanyl!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Six pharmaceutical executives who worked for fentanyl company Insys Therapeutics, including a former CEO, were arrested on Thursday and charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to defraud insurance companies and bribe doctors to prescribe their powerful and addictive opioid painkiller, according to an indictment from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to get doctors to prescribe more fentanyl, the indictment says, Insys executives gave them thinly disguised kickbacks. One of the preferred methods for this was to bring them in to supposedly give paid speeches about their products with other healthcare professionals. But many of the events had no attendees, and sales representatives routinely falsified names of guests, the government claims.
       </p>
       <p>
        When one of the company’s top prescribing doctors stopped prescribing as much of the potent opioid, one top executive emailed another saying, “we cannot go a single day without a prescription from … [the doctor]. I do not want to hear excuses, we pay good money here,” the court records indicate.

       New Update -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Naloxone is most commonly administered by injection or spray. Kaléo, a Virginia company, has increased the price of its naloxone auto-injectors, sold as Evzio, from $690 for a kit of two to $4,500 in less than two years. Amphastar of California nearly tripled the price of syringes pre-filled with naloxone.
       </p>
       <p>
        “When we started in 1996, a 10cc vial of naloxone was $1.63. Now that 10cc vial is almost $300 at Walgreens here,” said Bigg. “Has the price been raised well beyond what it costs to make in an obscene way for such an important lifesaving drug? Yes.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert Childs, director of the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, one of the largest non-profit distributors of naloxone in the US, said his organisation has spent about $220,000 this year giving out more than 13,000 naloxone kits to police officers and others working with those at risk of overdose.
       </p>
       <p>
        “If naloxone wasn’t the price it is, we would be able to buy a lot more and get a lot more out there to high-risk populations,” he said. “There’s a public health crisis with opiate and opioid-based drug overdoses, and the response has often been to increase the price which is probably the worst response you can do.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The increased demand and rising prices has resulted in a surge in income from naloxone for drug companies, up 400% since 2011 to $82m last year.

       <p>
        For the first time in American history, median U.S. life expectancy is declining — as a result of opioid addiction. From 2000 to 2015, more than 500,000 persons in the United States died from drug overdoses. These casualty figures not only reflect a national health emergency, but are emblematic of a war on the American people. By comparison, approximately the same number of Americans lost their lives fighting in World War II, Korea and Vietnam — combined.

        Naloxone has been available since 1971, originally under the brand name Narcan, and now in several generic forms, as well as formulations with new delivery systems. Both categories have their own cost stories; a generic form made by Hospira, now owned by Pfizer, rose in price from less than $1 per milliliter vial in 2005 to more than $15 in 2014. The newer delivery systems range in price from $125 for two doses to as much as $3,750.
