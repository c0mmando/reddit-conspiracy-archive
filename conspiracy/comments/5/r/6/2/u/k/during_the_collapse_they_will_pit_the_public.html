       The gaslighting from the media has done its job.  The public will be against each other during the collapse. They are very close to pulling the plug.  Did you actually think all that urban warfare training the last 10 years was for fun?

       I was watching CNN last night for whatever reason they were talking about (and actually using the term itself) Elites and the creation of doomsday underground bunkers, saying that recent political turmoil has gotten some of the Rich to begin thinking of shelters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it most odd since it's somewhat already known that underground shelters have already been created and exist currently yet CNN was trying to spin it as a recent development within Rich circles, as if they all haven't already had their own shelters made.
      </p>
      <p>
       For CNN to even bring it up was just off putting really.

       I posted a link about those shelters a few days ago. Basically it was tech billionaires who know how many people are going to be out of work when their jobs get automated.

       Good luck to them with that. I give a 50/50 chance enough military and ex-military guys turn on them and turn their underground bunkers into active grenade receptacles.

       Seal the entranes, drill through soil and the bunker's upper foundation, and just start pouring that cement into it.

       If there was some sort of collapse, i doubt it, itll probably be more of a slooow creeping takeover while noone notices, their whole deal, probably what they learn at the top of their societies,  is creating and managing crises for their own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it does come to it as a contingency It'll go like - ohnooo everythings fucked oh if only human nature wasnt so badd and greedy (induces guilt, also subtly implies that they take some of the blame but are detached and wise enough to see it)
      </p>
      <p>
       (things are bad for a while)
      </p>
      <p>
       its ok everyone while we were suffering just like you, we managed (with superhuman resolve) to find the time to plan a way to make everything better. ( notice how selfless they are)

       There are different types, interpretations, and ways of Nature, however, and just because "Nature" is going one way, it doesn't mean it couldn't - and even
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       - in fact be going another.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that it is by no means some sort of "immutable law of Nature" that the public is pitted against one another while the perpetrators slip out the back door.
