    <div class="md"><p>I was watching CNN last night for whatever reason they were talking about (and actually using the term itself) Elites and the creation of doomsday underground bunkers, saying that recent political turmoil has gotten some of the Rich to begin thinking of shelters.</p>

<p>I find it most odd since it&#39;s somewhat already known that underground shelters have already been created and exist currently yet CNN was trying to spin it as a recent development within Rich circles, as if they all haven&#39;t already had their own shelters made.</p>

<p>For CNN to even bring it up was just off putting really.</p>

<p>Seal the entranes, drill through soil and the bunker&#39;s upper foundation, and just start pouring that cement into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there was some sort of collapse, i doubt it, itll probably be more of a slooow creeping takeover while noone notices, their whole deal, probably what they learn at the top of their societies,  is creating and managing crises for their own benefit. </p>

<p>If it does come to it as a contingency It&#39;ll go like - ohnooo everythings fucked oh if only human nature wasnt so badd and greedy (induces guilt, also subtly implies that they take some of the blame but are detached and wise enough to see it)</p>

<p>(things are bad for a while)</p>

<p>its ok everyone while we were suffering just like you, we managed (with superhuman resolve) to find the time to plan a way to make everything better. ( notice how selfless they are) </p>

<p>(communist moneyless propertyless utopia ensues, any resistance is unthinkable heresy you dont want to be a bad greedy human do you? look who had to bail you out the first time!)</p>
