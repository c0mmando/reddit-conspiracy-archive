       Get rid of the electoral college. Every vote counts. States shall not be defined by their blue or red color anymore.  Democrat, Republican and now introducing a third party candidate that will be given access to the debates.  Libertarian, Green, Independents etc. can have their own primary and the winner gets the debate floor with the Dems and Republicans. The color for this representative shall be white. Hence, red, white and blue. America should not be composed of a duality of common interests and bias. Give Americans more choices. But most importantly, give equal publication to those choices. Lets start a revolution and make real change.

       I agree....Unbiased criticism. As "conspiracy theorists" or as I like to say, unbiased and consciously aware citizens, we need to recognize corruption from both parties. So we take a neutral position. Does not mean if we criticize one candidate, we wholeheartedly support the other. We do not subscribe to the duality of our system so any politician is susceptible to criticism.... As it should be.

       Likewise, I drive around with a "Hillary for Prison" bumper sticker on my car. I work in a very liberal town and live in a very conservative area. Around work I get pissed off liberals screaming at me, around home I get nods of approval from pick-up trucks with Trump stickers.

       I'm registered as an Independent. I supported Bernie. Sorry I hold the law in higher regard than political agendas.

       I agree but it's sad that the moment you point out that they do indeed control ALL parts of the machine - people suddenly drop the notion for Trump.

       As much as I like the idea and agree with it, i just think nobody gets into politics without personal motivaton and bias. I also think that if the left and right are controlled, so is the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the electoral college goes, this isn't something new, the race has always been to 270. Bush did it, Obama did it, and nobody bitched about it then. Only now when HRC loses does that aspect of the public vote get thrown out there. It's not anything new it's always been there. I personally think it's worth keeping so that incredibly densely populated areas aren't outright picking the next president. However, if my candidate lost based on the EC, then so be it, because that's the game. It's been the game. Some people can play it better than others.

       The system doesn't support three parties as written.  Also as you wrote it, it doesn't make much sense to lump, for instance, Libertarians and Greens together, especially as a top-down thing.  As you describe it, Democrats would have it in their best interests to push a Libertarian over a Green, and Republicans would have it in their best interests to push a Green over a Libertarian.  Because the two major parties control pretty vast resources, this would just become another team red / team blue front, with a slightly different dress on.  You'd probably need instant runoff or some other type of voting system, which would allow voters to primarily select a candidate that they most preferred, and secondarily a candidate that they preferred less, etc.  At that point, it seems pretty likely that you'd hit some pretty reasonable polling percent or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your core problem is even bigger: the debates are controlled by a bipartisan, not a nonpartisan group.  That is to say, it's also run by Democrats and Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current system is set up to devolve into a two party system.  The founding fathers probably didn't know this.  You'd need a new system that doesn't incentivize this so strongly.  At that point, you wouldn't end up with three parties (and Libertarians are yellow, and Greens are green), you'd end up with a bunch, in varying degrees of importance and relevance that could shift naturally over time.
