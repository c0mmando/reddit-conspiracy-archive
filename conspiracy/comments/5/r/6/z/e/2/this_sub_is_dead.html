       Long time lurker here. Was a frequent visitor to here for the past 3 years on and off. But I'm probably never going to return. This sub is no longer about conspiracies or finding the truth. Its become r/The_Donald's little play pen where they can exist in their fantasy world without backlash from intellectuals. It makes me sick to my stomach to see a one so promising subreddit turned into another Alt-right cesspool and nobody wants to admit thats whats going on. You guys cherry pick the facts to fit your world view and yell SHILL! if someone points that out. If I wanted to be surrounded by stormclouds and Neo-nazis I'd just go to /pol/. This place used to be a safe haven of free-thought and now every other post here is defending Donald trump like hes some sort of savior to humanity. HES ONE OF THEM! The power brokers, the rich-elite that want to build an oligarchy empire. HE IS NOT OUR FRIEND. He is the enemy, but you people are so brainwashed by reverse psychology you can't even see it. Hitlary was sacrificed so this buffoon could be in office. Did you guys forget the plan. Divide and conquer. Trump is the fascist elites little golden boy. He was supposed to win. Just look at our nation. Its so polarized that any outside force could come in and take us over. You ever think for a fucking moment that you are being played? This is why amateur conspiracy theorist should never have a say here. Fuck all of you. Peace.

       Good riddance to bad rubbish... I'm starting to think all these accounts that announce that this sub has turned into the T_D2.0 and then gracelessly quit forever all belong to the same guy.

       I'm glad they kept this little "script" in the playbook... it is hilariously obvious and always good for a chuckle.

       Dude, you're the last person to be complaining about a script or narrative manipulation, you pop up in almost every single comment chain.  You're probably one of the largest causes of the cancer that is causing people like OP to leave.  You throw out the same idiotic accusation ceaselessly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know what kind of person it would take to have these views, given that you aren't trolling.  You're one of the most paranoid, alarmist, fearful idiots I've ever encountered.  One of the only users to spew more bullshit than
       <a href="/u/333tttbbb">
        /u/333tttbbb
       </a>
       , and he deleted his account right around the time that pizzagate was revealed to be a fit of internet aspergers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You use his same type of argument, too, repeat the same thing over and over again until it seems like the entire sub is saying the same thing.  This is a tactic of idiots, and is only useful on idiots.  You need a new playbook.

       I stole this from another users post, but its relevant in these types of threads
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1. Claim you miss the "real sub"
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2. Attempt to stir up division by claiming this is now T_D 2.0
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3. Apply this formula anywhere on this sub you see the words Obama, Trump, or Pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4. Claim anyone who disagrees with you is a shill
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the pattern folks.

       What you've picked up on (unknowingly) is that the Illuminati have two different categories of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the official lies aka 'political correctness, equality etc.' and then they have the unofficial lies 'we need a war on 'x,y,z non-white group' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal for the elite is to eventually replace the official lies with the unofficial lies.

       I completely understand the difference my young friend. Keep telling yourself that people who are effective at projecting are always ignorant, it's going to leave you disappointed and outplayed. Logic is one of many tools in life. Humans are not naturally predisposed to acting logically, so it is naive to think you can communicate with logic alone and achieve anything on a political scale. But that's not even the funniest part of your little comment, as I'm confident what you wrote is 99% projection based on what I wrote in this comment. You're telling yourself that you're above the cretins, when really you're just as ignorant as the idiots on both sides who think there is a battle between logic and emotion. Its a battle between underlying ideologies, where both sides use multiple tactics.

       Interesting for you to choose the argument of "logical and not," as if it were actually some wide gulf that separates the enlightened from the "ignorant" along the ideological spectrum. The fact that you're not young and naive while submitting such an argument seems more telling than someone's preferred candidate this election, no?

       I think the reason this sub is so confused about Trump is that he is so being so blatantly attacked in the MSM that it lends credibility to his claims to be "anti-establishment". He also employed rhetoric that would naturally appeal to conspiracy theorists. His failure in the election seemed inevitable, and then he won.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get why you think that Trump's rise is simply a new stage in the the game. And I don't just mean objections that fit within the realm of normal politics. There are some clues in that direction, but as I'm alluding to above, there are clues in the other direction as well. His rhetoric might be empty, though it would be a strange strategy to even try to appeal to conspiracy theorists. I could go into more detail, but my point is that at this stage there is a degree of uncertainty about what Trump represents. That uncertainty diminishes all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have some tests I'm waiting to see whether he passes.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Will there be disclosure? I'm especially thinking of 9/11, but also of the fact that the Kennedy files are supposed to be released this year. I also care about disclosure of recent CIA operations in Syria. If he doesn't disclose that's bad, but maybe just a practical and strategic decision. I'm more concerned that he discloses and pins the blame on just the Saudis and uses it as a pretext for expanding a hot war in the Middle East.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm also watching out for a false flag. He has set himself up in such a way that his scheme would "benefit" from an Islamic terrorist attack, i.e. the typical false flag pretext for doing something you wanted to do anyway. Now, that doesn't mean I'll judge any terrorist attack to be a false flag—there are actual Islamic terrorists—but I'll be looking for it. If his "new regime" is still willing to employ that evil tactic, then you know the whole thing is a lie.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don't have a lot of reason to be optimistic about Trump, but even his opponents have to admit that he has been very unpredictable and has produced some real surprises.

       Trump is not anti-establishment. He's just revolutionizing the establishment. He's getting rid of some of the facade and bringing the establishment into the fold. Some of his established cabinet appointments are brought forward with disdain. Steven Bannon is now openly part of the security council, which I'm pretty sure in past presidencies there were also very much uncredentialed figures in the highest decision making forums of the government. Trump is just being open about it.

        If you couldn't see the entire establishment (career politicians, pollsters, former presidents, mainstream media, social media) all against him then you didn't see the threat he posed to their system.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To be fair, they very much admitted he was a threat, but for different reasons. Most "intelligent" people who disagree seem to complain about his lack of experience first and foremost, and how it's not easy to start off as president in politics. Obviously he at least appears to the conspiratorially inclined as a threat to a LOOOONG term plan there was for the world, but the average Joe doesn't get that at all.

        You also probably believed all the cooked polls where they over polled democrats by 30-40% just to make it seem like Hillary had a clear lead.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well I mean they over-sampled primarily, and there was the very legitimate phenomenon of such public negativity to Trump supporters that they wouldn't answer pollsters. That is a very interesting psychological/social exercise by itself - I honestly think the pollsters didn't do it on purpose per-se.

       Yeah they admitted they oversampled minority demographics from the Podesta leaks, it's definitely shady no doubt. All I'm saying is their polls were SO wrong that they even seemed to surprise the Dem's themselves (eg. the Blue Wall states switching) and hence some of the poll error is from nefarious causes, some is from genuine error from an interesting social phenomenon.

       Yes, for their internal polls and it happened in 2008, do you not pay any attention to the shit you're told?  The way this sub just blindly accepts whatever suits their preconceived notions is fucking astounding considering this is a conspiracy sub.  You people were played like a fiddle and you wear it like a badge of pride.

       We're both on the same page man, nobody was played like a fiddle. Clinton is headed to jail, not the White House. I'm just saying there was ALSO an interesting social dynamic of Trump supporters that was somewhat new and that if they had such ability to masterfully manipulate polls, they should have known they were losing Wisconsin etc. and had an event there. I'm just saying it's more likely the poll fiasco was a case of total corruption + incompetence.

       Honest question here. If the polls were "cooked" why does it make any sense that Hillary's camp was responsible for that? If your candidate is not performing well in polls, you don't want to overstate a lead because it risks making some of your supporters stay home because they feel "safe" that you'll win.

       It's equally probable that those pulling the strings behind Trump wanted her numbers to be over-sampled to lower her voter turnout.

       It proves oversampling is done specifically for the purpose that I stated, and not only did they do it, they instructed others to do it.  Nowhere did I put a date on it.  You're the only one who thinks it only happened in 2008.  They literally posted the oversampling with their poll results, champ, so we know they were all oversampled, and we have this proof of their reasoning, which is timeless.

       They oversampled.  Publicly.  And not just for esoteric "how do people feel" reasons, but to specifically put leading questions and ideas into the voter base, give encouragement to their voter base, ask the most objectionable questions about their opponents to get swing voters thinking/talking about those questions, to give a sense of "why bother" to the opponents voter base, and many other biased motives.

       And they immediately prove your point by down voting your post. They have low energy and no creativity. Every sub is the exact same strategies and talking points. They have such little support for their misguided vision that they have to PAY people to pretend to agree with them. Think about that.......The movement in the US has less to do with "pro-Trump" and everything to do with "anti-bullshit". I don't care which political party you support.... It's irrelevant....both sides are loaded with filth. What people in this country want is the return of morality and rule of law.......and it's coming back

       I love the downvotes of CTR employees, I collect them alongside bottles of their tears as trophies. You're right, it proves beyond a doubt that CTR (or whatever they tried to change their name to) is alive and well. CTR is the most loathesome organization to anyone who ever participates in political forums and no one beside CTR themselves would ever downvote a post bashing them or their terrible political candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election is over. CTR filth is now only trying to rip society apart and encourage sedition and to save their criminal bosses. I can't wait until the new DOJ starts taking out the trash.

       This Brock character has no shame. He was a conservative shill quickly turned liberal shill, a political mercenary. Why should I expect CTR people to be any different? I don't even think they are American. How could Americans accept a pittance to go online and attack and belittle other Americans all day long? How could Americans get paid to actively attempt to tear apart the fabric of American society because some billionaire would profit from our society crumbling?

       I ask myself "what kind of person would..." all the time. I still don't know other than to guess that some are Really that screwed up and believe they're doing something good and others just don't care because a paycheck means that much. I have to say though, i think even the idea of getting paid to further an agenda one Actually believes in or was Actually good is still manipulation and i still wouldn't do it.

       It might be worth it to try and red-pill some of these lost souls. When you suspect a CTR, ask them if they enjoy being billionaire's propaganda whores. Ask them if they know their personal information has been doxxed by 4chan, and may happen again. Ask them if they realize they are Big Brother's thought police and are helping fast-track our world becoming 1984, which will sure as shit affect them, too. I believe they are foreigners who couldn't give a shit less about America, though, I'm afraid. They certainly are anti-American either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this post is downvoted, I know it's you, CTR. Look deep inside yourself, Mr or Miss CTR. Is it really worth it?

       Fuck Trump and his controllers. As much as you people want to be in his exclusive club and feel important you're not. Sadly none of you will realize it until there is a fucking boot on your throat, maybe even then you won't.

        I think the reason this sub is so confused about Trump is that he is being so blatantly attacked in the MSM that it lends credibility to his claims to be "anti-establishment".

      <p>
       That's proven wrong by the fact that Fox News is openly pro-Trump, as are many other conservative outlets, and in fact there are some outlets (Breitbart, Infowars) that are openly pro-Trump propaganda sites.

       I'll concede that Fox is generally pro-Trump now that he has the power, but before he had sealed the deal on the Republican primaries Murdoch's network was clearly not very enthused about Trump—its efforts to undermine him were just less energetic than at other MSM outlets. Breitbart and Inforwars, whatever else you may think of them, are simply not MSM. Prior to the Trump phenomenon were relegated to the fringe, but they have attention as outlets of the Trump worldview now.

       I am uncertain too.  The MSM and CIA war on him makes me want to love him. But is that by design?  Are they playing an elaborate game? Making so much noise and hyperbole over silly things so when/if he does something awful we are ignoring or disbelieving? Or is it genuinely that he isn't playing along with the rule book and freaking them all out?
      </p>
      <p>
       So far he has been doing what he promised too.  When is the last time that happened? Before they shot Reagan when he wouldn't let Bush be the actual power in the Oval office?
      </p>
      <p>
       He made history being the first elected president or governor telling the govt employees that any dispute between govt and a person re Obamacare be decided in the person's favor.  A president told them NOT to punish us or "tax" us???
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again he says torture works. It does not and it's a gross violation of human rights endowed by our Creator.  Labeling someone an enemy combatant doesn't negate their human rights or citizenship no matter what laws they pass... this support of torture is chilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he EOs something amazing I have wanted for years. 2 regulations must he removed for each new one to pass.  Back to my admiring him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the creepy wall.... now I am nervous and worried.  Berlin wall comes to mind.  Ron Paul has said also it's more to keep us in maybe?  Same as Obama sneaking the new regulations that the IRS can put a hold on our passports if THEY arbitrarily decide we owe taxes.  Even $1.  And all this illegal immigration and visa clamp down is to get us to swallow the national IS cards or chips or 666 stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       My head is spinning. And I cannot count on any MSM to report fairly.  Instead I see some ridiculous piece on war with China based on unsupported and unverified rumors (they even admit).

       Maybe TPTB are making the noise and hyperbole so that if he comes out with evidence that Clinton Inc was behind ISIS, or that Bush was in on 911, no one will believe it.  He's been labelled a crackpot conspiracy theorist before for his Obama birther stuff.  The more the establishment tries to delegitimize and discredit him, the more it seems like he's not one of them.

       I am totally with you, but I think your "tests" are a bit weak. He doesn't control the false flags- only his own reaction to them.  And he certainly isn't the one who gets to control "disclosure".  That's way above his paygrade.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't think Trump has an ideology at all.  He's a salesman and a brilliant marketer.  He is going to cleverly market whatever whoever is running him wants to market.  He'll do it through mis-direction and two steps forward one back.

       i mean, the litmus test for determining whether an account is a shill or not isn't solely reliant on their post history/frequency.  it's a whole number of things, mostly having to do with what they write.
      </p>
      <p>
       a shill will always have an aim in their comments, whereas normal people are usually just speaking their mind or conveying their thoughts.  some shill-like aims include: diverting attention from a particular topic, purposefully angering someone, or making a community turn on itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, based on only the comment that i'm replying to, my opinion is that you're probably not a shill.  you say some dividing things ("echo chamber" is a particularly charged phrase, as well as the inconsistency between reading the sub every day and not reading it lately), but the actual meat of your post is pretty reasonable: "calling someone a shill isn't a legitimate response to an argument."  therefore, i would consider the probability of you being a shill fairly low.
      </p>
      <p>
       the OP, on the other hand, made a post with the sole purpose of insulting the readers of the subreddit it's posted in.  he uses a bunch of inflammatory language (neo-nazi, alt-right, "cherry pick the facts to fit your world view") but provides no examples or evidence for any of these claims whatsoever.  because of this, i would consider the probability of him being a shill much higher.  of course, it's never 100% because you can never know for certain, that's the internet for ya.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't really like talking about this very much because the question of whether or not someone is a shill is a pretty useless one, at least for non-moderators.  whether or not someone is shilling, there is always a more legitimate response to their argument than accusing them of something you cannot know for certain (apart from circumstances in which there's a bunch of copypasta posts from different accounts or something).  someone who doesn't tackle the argument will always play into their hands: if they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a shill, the argument is diverted and the shill looks genuine to those who may agree with them.  if they aren't, then it divides the community even more.  because it always ends up with a negative context, it's even very possible for shill-accusers to be shills themselves!
      </p>
      <p>
       however, putting peoples' comments into this context ("how likely is it that they are a shill?") is an unfortunate necessity if one wishes to cleanly navigate the internet nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       i can't fault this guy for coming to that conclusion, but i can fault him for publicly stating it and not legitimately responding to the argument presented.

       It is fucked with all the political content of late, but l get why it's here.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me as an Aussie and as somewhat of anarchist, l like that the turd is now floating on top of the proverbial punchbowl instead of hiding underneath all the fruit. At least the world can see the turd for what it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My country of origin also has issues which sadly align with American. Both our so called leaders (administrators) are wealthy oligarchial muppets with no interest in the common man/woman and with egos the size of a planet. Narcicism on steroids. And both are astute capitalist cunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still lurk here for the glimmers of truth that occasionally appear and for the interesting stories from other disenfranchised humans.

       If you weren't so wilfully ignorant about the world outside your own borders you might actually learn something. Let me rephrase it for your little indoctrinated pea-brain. Tony was Trump lite and he did not last a full term. He was replaced with Malcolm who is pushing much the same agenda (for Goldman-Sachs), but puts a friendlier face on things.

       Blame reddit, and the CTR group they let take over the general subs during the election. They banned everyone with dissenting, critical or skeptical views from politics/news/etc during the election, and censored comments to keep every thread an anti-Trump echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result a lot of pro-Trump people were pushed elsewhere, and T_D doesn't allow dissent either, so we have to discuss things somewhere.

       Someone is jealous that we solved all the conspiracies by electing our fearless leader. Don't you know America is Great Again?

       But seriously, if there's one good thing about Trump's regime it will be seeing the reactions of all the idiots in the conspiracy community who actually thought Trump - a capitalist who has bought elections his entire career - was somehow an "outsider".

       These altwrong guys organize off site in to brigade in chat sessions via irc and discord. They have message discipline and will mass downvote anything that strays from their goals. They treat this as a media war. They have no interest in

       Actually, I've found people are pretty critical of Trump here.  They're critical of anyone not acting in the people's best interests.  Not everything Obama did was good/bad, and neither is Trump.  I find that there is the same conversation going on, but there is a lot more attention to it...and it seems like this sub is being flooded from time to time with shills.  There are 754 people here now, there were over 5,000 here yesterday...and that's when the pro-Trump comments were happening.  It's almost like it's a game being played to lose focus on some of the truth on here.  This sub is not dead...it's being beaten to death by outside forces.

       The real problem is that nothing of this stuff has anything to do with any kind of conspiracy. Trump or no Trump, it doesn't matter.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       has become some kind of political news/agenda/opinion platform.

       It’s really strange and tbh reveals a lot about the user base of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ethos here has always been anti-authoritarian, anti-elite, anti-corporate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that now we have an Authoritarian Elitist CEO in charge of America a lot of the people here are happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It tells us that during Obamas eight years, the were not in fact Conspiracy Theorists with a healthy distrust of Government, but essentially right wing bigots who hated Obama for not being ‘american’ enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a sad day tbh, while the rest of Reddit indulges in bullshit partisan bickering my hope was that this sub would bore down to the heart of the matter. Reveal who holds power and how they use it, there are enough dodgy dealings going on already at the White House, but no, all we hear is that classic talking point Trumps camp is pushing so hard “give him a chance”.

       When the MSM and CIA are aggressively pushing a conspiracy theory without presenting any evidence, it is very likely to be state sponsored propaganda. I think the mods made some hard choices for very good reasons.

       It is no secret that reddit can be gamed. If you have people working full time, you can make it appear as if the user base supports some idea or another.

       I would rather know what the actual userbase thinks and this is impossible if a thread is being gamed.

       You have 1500 subs doing nothing but whining about Trump 24/7 and you're going to complain about one of maybe 15 that isn't fully jumping on the "le drumpf is totes Hitler" CTR bandwagon.  There are plenty of posts critical of Trump here if you look. If the fact that there are also posts that are pro-Trump and don't get removed or actually get upvoted is so problematic to the pampered pussy generation, you can go make your own liberal circlejerk conspiracy sub. I'm sure it will be filled with the petulant kids that already run  99.8% of reddit as it is in no time.

       It is not about Trump or left or right. The point is that the sub is being gamed. It started immediately after the election and is obvious to anyone that has been here for any length of time.

      <p>
       In the past, the discussion was nuanced and had a sense of history. Now it is just us or them, left or right. Divide, divide, divide. Real conspiracy students know this game plan and can see it happening right here.

       Look at your own post: "1500 subs v 15", "pampered pussy generation", " liberal circlejerk", "petulant kids".

       I would mostly agree. However, it goes well beyond this sub. This entire website and most of the internet is being gamed and many of us are just fed up with the obvious far left bias and astroturfing from the top down, and that was going on well before the election. Yes, it's all propaganda and we're all guilty, that doesn't mean there isn't truth and lies in the mix going both ways. That said, as long as the ctrl-left can excuse assaulting and threatening conservatives and label them all "nazis" for merely disagreeing or not voting the way THEY wanted, I'm sure as hell not going to have issue insulting them with mean words. There's been quite a bit a divisiveness on this sub  for years and yes, it's become much worse recently. That's to be expected given the butthurt of the election, some of Trumps proposals, in combination with the general difficulty in discussing things that can't truly be proven fact or fiction to one way or the other. We all have our own vision of what the "truth" is and NONE of us know the whole truth. Some things will come out, and some we'll never know. All we can do is look, research, and do our best to come to an well reasoned conclusion...
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense, I really don't need to take some arrogant test for you or anyone. First of all, I don't necessarily buy the "as a gay person" lead in as fact, but who can say other than OP. Sadly, people frequently start social-justice regulated discussions with padding in attempt to have a  fighting chance to be taken seriously and I'm always suspect of the "I'm one of them/you" set up.   I would say the message itself is  pretty clear and one that people can't even mention outside of those few subs ruled out as "hate subs" because they don't pander to the thought police.

       Still, regardless of your political views I don't think it really belonged in this sub to begin with as it simply seems like just another agenda post framed as a discussion.  I've had enough agenda pushing from both sides and I'd rather everyone stop, but I'm not going to lay down so the 90% liberal user base can dictate what can and can't be discussed. No one gets to simply declare themselves correct, or "on the right side of history".

       I agree astroturfing can go both ways and I hate it in any direction. But if reddit is, as you say, 90% liberal than that is what I would expect to see. That's the natural bias of the user base. r/conspiracy has has its squabbles but the whole tone of the place changed dramatically overnight after election. It is plain to me that this is unnatural.

       Also thanks for answering my arrogant test.

       There are a couple things that jump out at me about that post. First, for such a short post it commits a ton of logical fallacies; begging the question being the most obvious. The agenda here is not really about gay stuff but to create a divide between the right and left. Here are some of the points that are
       <em>
        asserted
       </em>
       : The left doesn't see hypocrisy. The left shouts the right down. The left is
       <em>
        brainwashed
       </em>
       . The post isn't really about muslims or gays. Its about how the left doesn't
       <em>
        get it
       </em>
       .

       The goal is to turn you against your fellow man; make you think he is to blame for your problems; and distract you from the real power getting rich while draining america dry.

       Good luck in finding a sub thats any better than this one OP. as much as you say it's "become r/The_Donald's little play pen" there's alot of debate going on here that you wouldn't find on "The_Donald", people like you always try to find an evil villain to fight and always make the ruling elite out to me this all seeing all powerful enemy that cannot be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is its healthy to have an opinion about something and discuss it in an open environment, I agree this sub has changed since you have alot of people looking for the next big story and not many sources of good information available but please don't go categorizing people for defending Trump, his actions lately provide credibility to the anti-establishment narrative and at the same time have made alot of the rich and powerful speak out against him. If this is all an act then so be it, I've yet to see some concrete proof that "everybody is in on it" as this sub eludes to constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Trump is an idiot, yes he's not someone I would ever want to be close friends with, but if defending his actions when they are the same actions I would do in his position is how I get labeled as part of an "alt-right" cesspool then I guess you missing the point of this sub.
      </p>

       It's better that you go. goodluck.

       This sub is the best place I know of, CTR are attacking it using all kinds of tricks, trying to disband what they see as a Trump strong hold, telling us the sub is no good anymore.  Fortunately we aren't that naive to fall for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't realize that we would turn against Trump if he didn't keep his promises of draining the swap, sorting out the vaccine industry and making friends with Russia.  However not that there is any alternative, anything was going to be better than Hillary and WW3.

       Trump is a manifestation of whats wrong with the world today, If anything his idiocy, bigotry and cleanup of some of the corruption is just going to pave the way for for a true leader, he is showing us just how easy it is to make an impact, it's just a pity he comes from a background of corruption, I dont think he's going to last long, but I'm hoping that when he goes down he takes alot of corrupt globalists down with him and finds a way to put a spotlight on the shadow figures lurking behind government bodies.

       See this is what I don't get. My friends are easily 80% anti trump if not more and I'm in my 30s. Almost my entire office is anti trump. Even my mom who has voted GOP her entire life hates him. He is probably the most off putting person I've ever seen speak.

       And then you think everything is this organized effort but some shadowy group. People hate the guy, and you act like it's impossible to believe people disagree with you. Must be CTR. I just don't get it.

       Trump as a wild outsider gives a lot of hope to people who want answers. I'm waiting for Area 51, Nazi treasures and Bigfoot to be tweeted out any day now... around 3 am.

       No, r/Conspiracy is half-half at this point.

       I honestly believe Trump was propped up by the American political establishment. It's a perfect plan to divide and weaken the American people. One side will see him as the political outsider, the saviour, while the other side seems him as "literally hitler". His supporters think he is going to "drain the swamp" and dont bother to stay vigiliant or watch him objectively, the other side thinks he is a fascist dictator who can do no good. There is no room for discourse, no room for anyone in the middle the have an opinion or fit in. Everything against him is "Fake News" or "liberal propoganda" and everything for him is "alternative facts" or "alt-right" propoganda. It's complete insanity and there are no news outlets that I have been able to find that have anything close to a middle ground. This election has completely killed political discourse in America.

       No need to be angry. There are many here, including me, who have known all along that Trump is part of the elite. We have stated this, and we've received lots of upvotes. I've pointed out for months that the MSM used reverse psychology to market Trump as a working class hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's true that this sub has become infested with people from The_Donald, people whose vocabulary often consists of the word "cuck" and not much else.

       People are making a big mistake if they think this is an influx of the_donald. This is very much a coordinated effort, and it's not an organic one. Divide and conqueror, as someone else said. I've stopped coming here. And those legitimately looking for hidden truth should too. And most will, of their own accord. Many already have. I still jump on here to check if anything has changed, and each time I see it has further devolved. The dissolution has been staggeringly rapid.

       If Trump was "for real", he'd immediately kick out all five Goldman Sachs megabanksters from his own cabinet. Then he'd audit and shut down the Fed. Then he'd shut down the CIA and the rest of the military industrial complex. Then he'd cut all support and all ties to the terrorist state known as Israel, the state behind 9/11. 
This would include shutting down AIPAC and kicking out dual-citizen Israeli/American politicians from Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Trump is doing the opposite of all of this, tells me precisely how "anti establishment" he is.

       Interesting user name.

       Trump knows America is ass broke and so far underwater in dept that it's lost sovereignty to the bankers. The US is in statutory management.
      </p>
      <p>
       When taking over a set of books which are full of hidden ledgers and a lot in the red, he's going to hire 'money people' to sort out the books.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, he's also used to extracting wealth, and knowing he's handing over the country to a new owner in a few years, there's bound to be a tendency to maximise personal wealth at the expense of the 'business'.
      </p>

       My brother. There's still hundreds of thousands of us who see Trump for who he is: an establishment center piece. As long as we stay here, this sub is not dead. Your post on the front page is a prime example of the life this sub still has. It seems to me like you had just came from some sort of heated debate someone here on this sub before posting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you need to consider the possibility that you're debating against people who are literally paid to spout Trump nonsense. There could be thousands of them. They could easily make you feel as though you're the minority here. You're not.

       I wish these type of posts would include some type of arguments supporting the conclusion that he is a part of the globalist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have examples of "neo-nazis" you claim are populating this sub or any upvoted comments or posts in that nature?
      </p>
      <p>
       "You ever think for a fucking moment that you are being played?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course. Do you think you are the first person to raise this concern on this sub? I can't speak for anybody else but I am extremely concerned that there will a revelation or incident proving that he is just another puppet playing his role.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest that if you are genuinely concerned with this you try using other methods of argument than yelling at people to fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility remains that you are right, however the fact remains that nothing so far has conclusively proven or even indicated that you are. If there was you would mention these things in your rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion posts like this that don't offer any new evidence or insights, but simply general conjecture based on nothing tangible while showering abuse at a group of people arguing a certain view-point, that is what is killing this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labeling those you disagree with as "neo-nazis" is contradictory to your stated desire for this to be a "safe-haven of free-thought".
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you realize that writing "Peace" at the end of a hateful rant does not make it any less hateful. Especially if it's preceded by the words "Fuck all of you"

       Donald Trump's campaign ran a very sophisticated social media operation that astroturfed lots of online communities in favor of Trump. They did this with the white supremacy community, they did with his conspiracy theorists, and with regular "conservatives." The posters on r/conspiracy don't want to admit this for 3 reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Many of them are paid shills
      </p>
      <p>
       2) They are dumb enough to actually believe that Donald is anti-establishment
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They are scared to accept that the establishment is so smart and strong they can even infiltrate the conspiracy theory movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       By installing the Donald, they have a useful puppet (Donald is clearly a narcissist doing whatever his advisors tell him) and they are killing the free-thought/conspiracy community because it has now completely discredited itself. Kills two birds with one stone. Brilliant.

       What did you expect?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what happens when 90% of large subreddits are controlled by liberal commenters and moderators... Users with right-side/conservative views are pushed into fringe subreddits where they are less likely to be harassed every time they open their mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it would be great if this sub would be split 50/50 left and right, but it won't happen until more people on the left become regulars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch whenever a post gets popular. You see a massive influx of left-side
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       users rush in to upvote comments that fit their side. This is the balancing effect, that you desire, in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't blame individual users for this phenomenon, they have a right to their own opinions like you. Blame every single subreddit that is becoming increasingly political for the left.
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       is a good example.

       I don't see how anyone can complain in a /conspiracy forum that the biggest Cabal candidate lost. Sure you may think Trump isn't clean either... but the Bushes and Clintons hate him. The MSM Corporate media hates him. That should tell you all you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary had won, this forum would just be anti-Hillary. Same difference. We just see her as a non-player at this point. There is still work to do. No one should feel the need to defend Trump's every move, but if you want to cheerlead the Cabal narrative, do it somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, don't call people brainwashed and go on promoting ALT-RIGHT this and that... I'm a lifelong liberal, twice voted Obama... support Trump... and also now think labels are nonsense and are used as tools to divide.

       Angry, emotional self post based on your feelings with exactly zero evidence of anything that you're saying being true. No commentary on any recent events (no TPP is a big one).

       I agree that trump is not a good guy, and in many ways he could be worse than any leader before him. He's clearly on the side of Zionists, and he may very likely be a pedo himself. The whole system needs removing and power should go to thepeople. Make the internet president of something.

       Any objective person can look at the front page of this sub and see three factions...one pro HIllary, one pro Trump and a much larger one pro neither.  Posts like this are partof an effort to dissuade people from posting so thanks, and don't let the door hit you in the ass.  As a lurker you never contributed to the discussion anyway, and the things you rail about you could have fought againt...but instead you left it to the rest of us...so, leave it to the rest of us.

       There is, of course, the "Reddit Conspiracy" that prevents any kind of balanced discussion of important issues and topics that has driven many to post here what they can't post elsewhere because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the not so small fact that politics itself plays a major role in virtually all of the most important conspiracies that refuse to die as long as real truth about them remains unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       And politics also largest player in trying to suppress and keep those truths buried. So in manner of speaking these posts are  relevant as are the reasons why they are being so vigorously repressed and buried. Simply more artifacts for us politely consider and mull over for whatever scraps of truth they may contain that can't be spoken of elsewhere.

       You're wrong. This only shows how alive this sub is. It is changing with the times and staying relevant. Right now, Trump/pizza/Antarctica/Israel/Soros conspiracies are more relevant than ever. We all know Trump cannot be trusted, but he's more of an anti-hero than a villain. Unfortunately, he's the only person on our side who has a fighting chance. We'd all be happy to put our support behind Bernie, Tulsi, or Rand but they just aren't in a position where they can effect as much change as Trump. So. fuck you.

       Long time lurker you have only been on Reddit for a year how can you make that judgment after only a short time spent on this sub and it was during the most fucked up presidential race in history. Yes this sub has problems but still way better than most of the other subs.

       Black and white thinking like this is killing the sub, not 'the donald' or people who like or support trump.  Those who legitimately support trump have thought about this very likely much more than OP has, and can elucidate their reasoning for supporting trump, whereas those who cry about excessive trump posts here can only complain in a simple way

       More like it's become an r/politics echo chamber. There are more of you supposed "lurkers" from r/politics spouting the CTR narrative than there are "pro-Trump stories" you're always claiming are filling up the sub. Far more.

       Op's on the right track but, Leftists, liberals, socialists, right wing, alt right, Trump supporters, Republicans, Dems, most of the time these are just words, words that are designed.to be used as tools to segregate people and turn them against Rach other. By defining someone's differences so strongly in opposition to someone else's you create conflict inside a group that would normally work together, and divided you will be continually conquered, Untill everyone focuses on what unites them over what divides them. The 1% they're the enemy, they are the only ones who profit from causing a "war" between two sides, they've been doing it for generations.. I know its hard but even the racists can be thought of as victims, they're stupid and ignorant yes, but theyr'e  are easily brainwashed, so they live in a bubble where no one can get through and tell them its wrong because they've been shown for years negative stereotypes through every available source of media all whilst their community is blighted with drugs, unemployment and crime caused by the actions of the people pointing out who should be blamed for all their problems. They don't even know that they've been manipulated, and that their anger and hate is the very thing that politicians have become adept at monetizing.

       328 comments. Thank you for bringing it to light again!! The sub needed this little boost and we all appreciate the atte tion greatly and thanks to this post, many folks that never spoke up before have now signed on as active members of r/conspiracy. This post did more to bring the sub back to life than we could have by posting conspiracies. So thank you. Now lets get to exposing the insane corruption around HRC and DT and make sure niether ever have a place in govt again!

       The conspiracy is that EVERYONE in media and Politics was looking down on him, was denying his ability to run for Republicans then won then was scoffed at at being president and won that too. He came with a promise and multiple at that and is now actually DOING THEM. Me being from New York, never liked him, but as I do research on his person I have found his economic understanding was absolutely good enough and even better for fact at getting things done here in America.. our industrial revolution was a huge success due to business men and not politicians.. I have to with my mind and heart belive he will do better for Americans first and foremost amd every one else second.

       If you weren't so wilfully ignorant about the world outside your own borders you might actually learn something. Let me rephrase it for your little indoctrinated pea-brain. Tony was Trump lite and he did not last a full term. He was replaced with Malcolm who is pushing much the same agenda (for Goldman-Sachs), but puts a friendlier face on things.
