       It's probably a diversion. Totalitarian evilness is raising it's ugly head again and only if the people unite and come together in one voice to denouce the evildo-ers will there be any hope of libery for our children. Please let me know if I use too many run on sentences. There is so much suffering of others that we cannot remain ignorant and follow the voices of Trump supporters. I'm not saying that Clinton is any good either, don't put words in my mouth but I know that now is the time when we can make a real difference if we unite against intolerant evil. If you're reading this and think that it's all just satire, it's not. We have to focus on what really matters guys.

       I think the phrase has a certain tone of insincerity and can be used to mask a persons less than holy intention. As I was using it satirically, I created a persona who sounds well meaning but is super wishy washy. It represents a form of emotional disempowerment that creates a type of co-dependency that is rife among spiritual seekers. Which ironically is not to say that spiritual paths are bad but rather to point out that there are pit falls. I believe that as one proceeds toward enlightenment the pitfalls become greater not less. Love and light is sentimental throw away phrase that may or may not be sincere - which is part of what I'm pointing to in the post. Shills use this same type of sentiment to manipulate.

       TPTB influence the division, the people are the ones who divide. Every damn president before has acted like they cared about the citizens. Have we not learned? They don't give a fuck, it's the same fucking loop every time. "Oh THIS time it'll be different! Don't worry, the last guy sucked but THIS NEW guy PROMISED he would! So he HAS to"  i can't believe people think like this. The majority of the government is an oppressive state and we are FAR from freedom. Trump cannot save us from what is coming,; if he could, he wouldn't be president.

       Their is an oppressive tyrannical state, whoever they may be, and we need to regain our freedom. It doesn't matter who, we know it's out there. Our time is running out, if we take action then people will be more open to joining us because we're actually doing stuff and fighting back. They need to know there is still hope and that we don't need to settle for this oppression and especially they need to know that there are other people DOING things about it
