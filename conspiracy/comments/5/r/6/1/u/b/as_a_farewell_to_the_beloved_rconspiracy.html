        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seeing as we will most likely be getting shut down soon, I believe now is the best time to post what we believe to be true.</p>

<p>I will compile a list of theories and ideas I have to give everyone an idea of the conscious mind and how it affects reality.</p>

<p>I will tell you in advance though. This theory of mine seemingly is more than a theory. If your mind is able to make these connection&#39;s I am impressed.</p>

<p>I will give you a little primer. First of all, you can&#39;t think in terms of this world. I will hand you the key mechanics to understanding it all. I am using occult knowledge in my truths so if you can&#39;t follow I doubt I have time to explain. I am giving my own personal philosophy on the world. I see no one dropping fat truth bombs for others to follow. I more so see people leading others to facts. I am simply going to try to persuade you into believing me in hopes that one of you sees more.</p>

<p>First of all we are souls, we are consciousness. We are currently in this world completely blind basically. All the answers are in your heart so I am going to tell you what my heart feels. Everything is illusion always know if you follow love it will work out for you. It may be a tougher road but it is the path to take.</p>

<p>In this physical realm it is quite easy to understand but hidden. The entire world is frequency. Everything vibrates, we are vibrating. The higher you vibrate the more positive and in sync with truth you become. Easy ways to improve your vibration I will list. Health is part of this so I will open a second paragraph on physical. The mental health side is simply taking anything that makes you feel inferior or negative and searching for a new belief. The reasons we are taught to be inferior and obey authority is because of programming. Simple. Thinking you are not good enough in any way is part of the programming. You&#39;re beautiful inside and out. I love you.</p>

<p>Second part is health. Ways to increase your natural vibration, EAT FRUIT. I am talking all non-gmo fruits. Eat a fruit diet as humans are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM5gn26wdQA">fruitivores.</a> Take cold showers. Cold increases your ability to absorb oxygen. Oxygen is the highest form of energy for humans. If you eat carbohydrates that are sugar, bread, basically anything to be honest, you increase your acidity. As you become more acidic your muscles contract and do not absorb oxygen. It is the key to health. As simple as it is, fruits are what we eat, cold is what pushes us because it makes us uncomfortable and forces us to adapt. Work out at the gym, take herbs to achieve optimal health.</p>

<p>Next. Take drugs to achieve astral travel. I have little experience with this, take ayahuasha, DMT, magic mushrooms, cannabis. Strongest in effect starting on the left.</p>

<p>The entire government is entirely corrupt, the entire school system is a fat load of shit. We live inside a flat earth and there is a firmament above us. Everything spins around the north star. The moon has it&#39;s own cycles and does not reflect sunlight, it has it&#39;s own cooling light.</p>

<p>Your consciousness creates reality. Love everyone.</p>

<p>EDIT: YOU GIVE WHAT YOU GET I HOPE YOU ARE ALL GIVING</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to write this up. Your comments about mental and physical health are especially appreciated. I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are on what will unfold over the next decade. Do you see any big shifts occurring?</p>

<p>As for this sub getting shut down, I don&#39;t see it happening any time soon. Especially if we survived the pizzagate ban hammer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly humans are pretty dumb so even after they&#39;ve entirely lost they won&#39;t understand until we come back with everything we&#39;ve ever wanted.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if big shifts will occur. I think it will greatly depend on what state the world gets into. I believe we are headed for collapse as the housing markets and everything else are so inflated. Sadly there is enough stock in the majority of plants that I believe mass unemployment is definitely in the cards.</p>

<p>Fees are going up everywhere non stop the breaking point is whenever they decide.</p>

<p>Be as healthy as you can be. Peace and love all races will come together, it will be beautiful.</p>

<p>Imagine an ant hill where everyone&#39;s fighting instead of walking in their single file lines? Imagine an ant hill where they are poisoning their water, lying to them, feeding them garbage, keeping them in perpetual slavery, and somehow they like it because they are scared of everything else. On top of that doing every other form of abuse to the population.</p>

<p>Now imagine a population of ants where that didn&#39;t happen. Now imagine humanity lol. We are suppressing each other and holding each other down. I don&#39;t expect an easy road ahead but it will be a road none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not enough protein in fruit to sustain the human body/brain. There is a reason why humans are and have always been hunter gathers. It&#39;s a balance of healthy fruit, veggies, and meat. The acidity part of your post is correct, but that can be counter balanced by drinking alkaline water.. </p>

<p>There is well balanced and fanatic/radical. What you said/encouraged was more of the fanatic/radical. Sorry, I just want all to be healthy, including you mate :) Cheers!</p>

And as a recently developed vegan, I definitely notice a huge difference in health and that not eating meat hasn&#39;t affected me at all.

    <div class="md"><p>Hands down sugar is the worst thing for you, preservatives too.</p>

<p>I would say Fruits, veggies and herbs are top level. I would eat meat before I eat sugar to be honest. Sugar in reference to any sugar that does not come from fruit.</p>

<p>The moon doesn&#39;t reflect the sun. It just physically doesn&#39;t make sense. You just need to use your head for that one. We spin around the sun according to heliocentric model, yet the moon goes through it&#39;s own cycles. 29.5 days. It just physically doesn&#39;t make sense sadly. </p>

<p>Really I know it&#39;s hard going against the grain but, really think. Sometimes we see the sun and moon at the same time. You just gotta use your head, look at the sun, look at the moon. Think about the angle that would need to happen to make that happen. Then look at it again, over time you will see it varies way too much and has absolutely no basis for sense. Sometimes the moon is visible the same time as the sun, sometimes it&#39;s almost a full moon, sometimes it&#39;s almost completely dark.</p>

<p>The explanation? Simple. The moon goes through cycles and the moon is actually it&#39;s own light source. </p>
