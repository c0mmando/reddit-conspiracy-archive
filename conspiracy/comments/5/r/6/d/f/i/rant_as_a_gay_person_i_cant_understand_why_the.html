<p>Edit 2: I want to stress that I mean no offence to muslims or anyone else.  I should have worded the post much better. I know that there are so many good muslims (obviously) and, like most things, it&#39;s a tiny and radical minority that cause trouble for the rest. I was just trying to spotlight a concern that some have about the perception of LGBT and how do we move towards a place of mutual understanding, appreciation and respect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well the real life humans are being oppressed, they are spreading an ideology of hatred, Islam intertwines politic and religion. 
I mean, what would happen if an man told a feminist woman that she could not wear bikinis. Could only where restrictive clothing. That&#39;s how Muslim women are treated. They&#39;re treated as inferior to men. And that is only in &quot;progressive&quot; Islam. That&#39;s all around us every day. In its more extreme instances Muslim women are lashed to death for being raped. Homosexuality is forbidden, and in certain parts of the world it is <em>punishable by death</em> The same goes for homosexuality.How are liberals okay with that? How are they able to ignore these atrocities? Muslims are the victims of a violently oppressive ideology, and they are unwilling to surrender it. They will die for their religion. That is horrifying. 
How are liberals able to stand by and support an ideology so viciously anti-liberal, anti-Western thought, anti-feminism, anti-LGBT? I get sick of hearing them make their arguments. None of them makes any sense. 
And even if the radicals only compose (<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/">scroll down to the bit about worldwide support for radical Islam, Pew Research btw)</a> let&#39;s say 10%. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. You do the math. </p>

<p>Did you even read his comment? Liberals don&#39;t support Islam they support peoples right to be a practicing muslim even if they disagree with those views, they support tolerance towards people of different background. I agree with you that a lot muslims hold incredibly dangerous and backwards views that are incompatible with western society. As a liberal myself we feel we have to what we can to help these refuges by making them integrate into western society, pushing them way makes it impossible for them to change their ways and only fuels their cycle of ideology. We feel that we as westerners should &#39; be the ones show them the light&#39; so to speak. Remember we support the individuals not their religion and ideology as a whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a big mistake I made in my comments was the haphazard use of the word &quot;liberals.&quot; I&#39;ve noted it in the original comment. 
You&#39;re right about &quot;progressive&quot; v &quot;conservative&quot; in the current usage. What I meant is that even in the less extreme subsets Muslims are practicing something that is anti-liberal. I guess what I meant is, how are the burka and the hijab not a problem? Why are they allowed? I ask that sincerely. 
And I just feel like it&#39;s not possible for them to integrate. From everything I&#39;ve seen and experienced, Muslims are expected to remain apart from the Western societies they inhabit.
Anyway. One thing I think we can all agree on is that it is a weird time to be alive. And I truly believe that, at the heart of it, we all want the same thing: For the world to get better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are exceptions, certainly. But they still belong to an ideology that systematically oppresses women and homosexuals. They may be the nicest people ever, but they still belong to an ideology of hate. 
I&#39;m an immigrant myself. Irish to America, though I have dual citizenship. So I know a thing or two about immigration and assimilation. The Irish were treated awful when they first arrived in America. We&#39;re not always great about assimilating, tbh (I&#39;m thinking of NYC), but we&#39;re also not a threat to the Western way of life. </p>

<p>How?   </p>

<p>Mentally ill is not a very precise term. A lot of people acts mentally ill sometimes, that doesn&#39;t mean that they are ill, they could just have some kind of annoying personality trait, but that isn&#39;t an illness and most people have traits that someone will find annoying.<br/>
On the other hand lots of people have mental illnesses but will hide it from others and not really show any outward sign of illness.  </p>

<p>So it won&#39;t make much sense to call a certain way of acting a mentally ill way of acting, unless you actually specify what you mean by that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol did you read the article? </p>

<p>It literally states the opposite of what you are saying, some highlights:</p>

<p>&quot;The survey also asked Muslims whether people of other faiths in their country are very free, somewhat free, not too free or not at all free to practice their religion; a follow-up question asked Muslims whether they consider this “a good thing” or “a bad thing.” In 31 of the 38 countries where the question was asked, majorities of Muslims say people of other faiths can practice their religion very freely. (The question was not asked in Afghanistan.) And of those who share this assessment, overwhelming majorities consider it a good thing. This includes median percentages of more than nine-in-ten in South Asia (97%), Southern and Eastern Europe (95%), sub-Saharan Africa (94%), Southeast Asia (93%) and Central Asia (92%). In the Middle East-North Africa region, nearly as many (85%) share this view.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Muslims who favor making sharia the law of the land generally agree that the requirements of Islam should apply only to Muslims. Across the regions where the question was asked, medians of at least 51% say sharia should apply exclusively to adherents of the Muslim faith. This view is prevalent even in regions such as South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, where there is overwhelming support for enshrining sharia as the official law of the land.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is an issue with the simple fact that the refugees from Syria and other middle eastern nations haven&#39;t been living in western culture. The Islamic people in Europe haven&#39;t been integrating particularly  peacefully in many cases either. Allowing this to continue is allowing hardliner right wing brained Islamic people into the nation who, after skin tone ultimately have much more in common with the right than the left as far as values and ideals go.</p>

<p>None of this is to say Muslims are bad people inherently, just that the violence in that part of the world, along with a culture and religion that accepts it has created something that can&#39;t be easily integrated into western culture. The US still has a duty to take on refugees, but a bit of a wake up call is needed on the left when this is going on. They need to acknowledge the problems instead of telling everyone that it isn&#39;t happening, or calling people racist for saying anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, and so I get a reply of out of context quotes that can easily be explained. Good job proving my point.  </p>

<p>You quoted two verses that both pertain to times when Muslims were being attacked, times of war, not general everyday living. The first one, the verse directly before it says that if you kill one person, it is as if you have killed all of mankind. Why didn&#39;t you quote that as well? Does it not fit your narrative? It then says the punishment for waging war against God and his prophet for no reason other than their religion, and the punishment for spreading disorder or corruption, should be judged and carried out according to the nature of the transgression. The punishments might sound harsh, but all the verse is saying is there should be punishment for those who wage war or cause disorder. It doesn&#39;t give Muslims carte blanche to attack or kill non-Muslims. The next verse then literally starts by saying &quot;Except for those who repent&quot;, and that God is all forgiving. Meaning that punish those who attack you for your religion, but if they repent, then show mercy.  </p>

<p>The second verse, I don&#39;t even know what to say since its clear you didn&#39;t even read the verses you are quoting. That is also a bad translation you are using. Again, why didn&#39;t you quote the verse just before it that says to fight those that fight you, but not to exceed the bounds set by God. It then goes on saying that IF THEY FIGHT YOU, then kill them because disorder/attacking God is worse than killing. The next verse says if they desist from fighting, then God is all forgiving. But if they continue to fight, then continue to fight against them until there is no more disorder. It then again repeats and says if they desist, then to stop fighting them.  </p>

<p>So, both verses are in relation to Muslims being attacked because of their religion, both say to fight those that wage war against you because of your religion, and both say to stop fighting when they stop fighting you. Neither of these verses gives Muslims divine right to kill non-Muslims, not even close. But then you already knew that and quoted out of context verses anyway to try and prove a lie. Well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Crusades were actually very tame compared to the age of colonialism and imperialism, when Europeans committed slavery and genocide on a global scale, with missionaries always being the first ones to step off the boat.</p>

<p>Slavery in the US was a religious as well as ideological institution, with the predominant belief being that the black race was invented by God in order to serve the white one, and its affects last to the present day. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe the old &quot;Hitler was a Christian&quot; special to go with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really care about Hitler, he was a nut into all kinds of dumb occult garbage, it&#39;d be dumb to try to associate him with Christianity. However, the vast, vast majority of Nazi foot soldiers and regular German civilians who actually turned the nuts and bolts of the Holocaust were undoubtably Christians, and explicitly faulted the Jews for killing Christ among their other alleged conspiracies. Concentration camps were run by Christians, Christians ran the trains and operated the gas chambers, Christians tossed cadavers into mass graves and bulldozed over them. </p>

<p>And, for the record, <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/home/topic-pages/victims_final">roughly 1/5th of all hate crimes in the US are motivated by homo- or transphobia</a>. These include robberies, assaults, and all sorts of murders.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord&#x27;s_Resistance_Army">There&#39;s the good old LRA</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s more but that&#39;s all I have off the top of my head. It&#39;s also worth noting that Christians in America are still fighting every day to restrict the legal and civil rights of gay Americans. They&#39;re trying to turn back the clock and you&#39;re a rube if you think they have any stopping point in mind.</p>

<p>And, again, it&#39;s undoubtably the case that Christians have been less violent in the past 50 years towards homosexuals, but this isn&#39;t because of any kind of inherent moral superiority in their religion. It&#39;s precisely because leftists dragged their asses out of the dark ages while they whined and protested every inch of the way.</p>

<p>Christians have not taken their holy book on a word for word basis in a very very long time! The Bible says a multitude of things that Christians do not take literally and they are viewed as analogies. This is the entire problem with the Muslim world right now. They believe the Koran is 100% literal and must be carried out word for word. This is why they kill people on Jihads, treat women as a subservient, kill non-believers, and kill homosexuals. The Muslim religion as a whole does not appear to be taking any steps to move away from this literal interpretation of the Koran like the Christians did HUNDREDS of years ago. </p>

<p>Not only gays have been drug behind trucks here, and it&#39;s not sanctioned. It&#39;d be a crime regardless as to who the victim was. If the victim was gay there&#39;d be a hate crime enhancement- this allows for additional punishment, not less. </p>

Can you not separate the difference between something a country does as part of its laws and something the religion actually asks for?

<p>Also, please stop referring to Muslims as &quot;they&quot;. There are over 1.6 billion Muslims around the world, the majority of which have no link or relation to the Middle East besides the religion itself. Muslims are not some monolithic entity, so stop treating them like one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be a christian, but that does not mean that you can speak for all christians. I have met christians of all different interpretations, including literal. </p>

<p>Sure, christians, in general, have gotten less literal, but they&#39;ve also had some 600 more years to do so.</p>

<p>Some examples of christian beliefs on homosexuality: <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/153607/major_ron_paul_supporter_favors_death_penalty_for_gays">Major Ron Paul Supporter Favors Death Penalty for Gays</a>. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-peron/whos-helping-finance-ugandas-kill-the-gays-bill-you-are_b_2229509.html">Who’s Helping Finance Uganda’s ‘Kill the Gays’ Bill?

<p>It seems like the real reason that the U.S. doesn&#39;t have such an extreme problem as majority Muslim countries is that the former has a secular government, which has let other voices in and pushing christians, in general, to be more accepting.</p>

How about the societal and cultural norms that have grown through the years and the fact remains Christians do not carry out the literal word of the Bible. Your anecdotal evidence of a fraction minority does not discredit this fact.

<p>Did we talk about this before or are you categorizing me in some out-group that you disagree with?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are saying the only reason Christians are not violent is because of our Government?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no, no, not because of the government per se, but because people in the U.S. kept the government secular rather than letting christianity control the government and the narrative. Though, I would say that there are probably some out there that think again because of the legal consequences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christians do not carry out the literal word of the Bible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you make a broad statement like that, then a fraction minority does discredit that <em>claim</em> because it shows that there are those that try to (by actually stoning a homosexual to death, for example) and those that talk and push for the literal word of the bible to be carried out, even trying to make it law. You could say most instead of leaving it a blanket statement, but then I could equally say most Muslims...and we can go back and forth because making general statements about groups of people, especially ones that number over a billion people, is ridiculous. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a fraction minority does not discredit this fact</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so people that preach at mega churches and get the ears of republican presidential candidates don&#39;t show that there are definitely a portion of christians that support such thinking? </p>

<p>most muslims are not terrorists. a fraction minority does not discredit this fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why would we even think of bringing them into our society?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, because I care about people no matter their religious beliefs. Let&#39;s leave out all males 10 years or older, you are still saying &quot;Fuck off&quot; to women and children. It&#39;s called integration, maybe it was left out of your text books. These people need help, not to be tossed aside. Also, there&#39;s this awesome thing where people can learn, develop and, though you may want to crucify me for saying this, evolve.</p>

<p>How about getting off your high horse, take off your blinders and take a look at the world. All religions have been and still are being violent in different areas of the world, including christianity. </p>

<p>What narrative? I don&#39;t watch mass media, is this something you picked up from watching that shit. I actually do use critical thinking to form my own opinions with facts and evidence, always questioning, maybe you should try the same.</p>

<p>When is the last time Christians were throwing gays off roofs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In America it was pretty common to burn them at the stake...then later to lynch them...and then by the late 20th century the most popular method was street violence or dragging them behind trucks. Gay people still suffer a disproportionate number of hate crimes and it&#39;s <em>not</em> Muslim-Americans doing most of them, not even close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not even a Christian and I know that Christians are plenty accepting to the LGBT community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m an ex-Christian and I know that this is true or false depending on exactly which Christians you&#39;re talking to, how many beers they&#39;ve had, and whether or not you think they&#39;ll agree with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[All Muslims are the same, all Muslims are fanatics, all Muslims are pure literalists, more Islamophobic garbage]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the left had bought into this kind of thinking 50 years ago then there&#39;d have been a concerted campaign to wipe Christians off the Earth. Luckily, most leftists realized that not all Christians are the same, not all are irredeemable, they are all human beings, and so even though Christians resisted the entire time, the left managed to drag them to a state of basic tolerance of gay people.</p>

<p>that means that approximately 1,400,000 muslims (300m pop x 0.9% muslim x 51% of muslims against) in the US are opposed to gay marriage.  </p>

<p>vs approximately 61,000,000 non-muslims (300m pop x 34.3% of pop in those groups x 60% avg against).  I know the math is wrong on this, but it still gives you a general idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uganda meanwhile is also a member of OIC. Well, there are also Carribean nations that ban homosexuality, and there are &#39;family rights&#39; groups in Mexico and France. But at least there are also many Christians who don&#39;t subscribe to violence, and the best thing is they&#39;re campaigning that, like the Christians in the west, or my local example from <a href="http://pgi.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pernyataan-Sikap-PGI-tentang-LGBT.pdf">Communion of Churches in Indonesia in their recent statement</a> that the churches should open their doors to all people. It&#39;s a shame that around the same time, the <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/02/17/mui-wants-law-ban-lgbt-activities.html">national Islamic clergy assembly (MUI) called for a ban</a> of LGBT &quot;activities&quot;. So if western muslims don&#39;t want to be bashed by right-wing extremist, they better start to preach to chunks of their community about respect.</p>

<p>I know that there are moderate, peaceful muslims. I know personally some of them, and they are good people. While many others are reactionary bigots, imagine a redneck saying takbeer, and I personally know some of them. They believe deeply in the bloody verses of the koran as deep as you believe in human rights. They don&#39;t wanna hear whatever you say. Millions of moderate and peaceful muslims are irrelevant if they don&#39;t start teach the same values to these part of the muslim community since they don&#39;t wanna listen to outside sources. It&#39;s only them who can start doing something.</p>

<p>I would be really glad if the migration to the west can make more openness in Islam. Seriously. Because then, I can mention it as an example to my next-door local muslim here. I detest Trump&#39;s executive order since it&#39;s actually putting LGBT people from ME at risk, but many other people from the area are not so different than I described. Just stop welcoming them with regression to defend their outdated values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For muslims to &#39;evolve&#39; as western society did they would need to have a similar mindset, which they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I once came across the following article: <a href="http://www.newenglishreview.org/Nicolai_Sennels/Muslims_and_Westerners%3A__The_Psychological_Differences/">Muslims and Westerners: The Psychological Differences
by Nicolai Sennels</a>.</p>

<p>It really opened my eyes on how different the world view of muslims is.</p>

<p>pasting the most relevant part below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Locus of control </p>

<p>There is another strong difference between the people of Western and Muslim cultures; their locus of control. Locus of control is a psychological term describing whether people experience their life influenced mainly, by internal or external factors. It is clear from a psychological point of view that Westerners feel that their lives are mainly influenced by inner forces – ourselves. This is reflected in our points of view, our ways of handling our emotions, our ways of thinking, our ways of relating to people around us, our motivation, our surplus, and our way of communicating. These internal factors are what guide our lives and determine if we feel good and self confident or not. Every Western library has several meters of self help books. Every kiosk has dozens of magazines for both women and men that tell us how to create happier and more successful lives for ourselves. Our phone books have columns of addresses for psychologists, coaches and therapists. All these things are aimed at helping us to help ourselves create the life that we want. Some might argue that all this introspectiveness is too much and that just doing what is useful for oneself and others here-and-now would be more constructive, but this is how our culture is. </p>

<p>All these things do not exist in Muslim culture and countries. The very little psychiatry and psychology that is taught, in only a few universities in the Muslim world, is imported from the West.  It is mostly taught by teachers educated at Western universities and does not have roots in the Muslim culture. </p>

<p>But Muslims have something else. They have strict external rules, traditions and laws for human behavior. They have a God that decides their life&#39;s course. &quot;Inshallah&quot; follows every statement about future plans; if God wants it to happen. They have powerful Muslim clerics who set the directions for their community every Friday. These clerics dictate political views, child rearing behavior, and how or whether to integrate in Western societies.</p>

<p>The locus of control is central to our understanding of problems and their solutions. If we are raised in a culture where we learn that &quot;…I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul,&quot; as William Ernest Henley wrote in his famous poem Invictus in 1875; we will, in case of personal problems, look at ourselves and ask: &quot;…What did I do wrong?&quot; and &quot;…What can I do to change the situation?&quot; People who have been taught throughout their entire lives that outer rules and traditions are more important than individual freedom and self reflection, will ask: &quot;Who did this to me?&quot; and &quot;Who has to do something for me?&quot; </p>

<p>Thus, the locus of control is central to the individual&#39;s understanding of freedom and responsibility. Even though our Christian based societies may, in certain situations, give too much emphasis on feelings of guilt; it also strengthens the individual&#39;s sense of being able to take responsibility for, and change one&#39;s own life. In societies shaped under Islamic and Qu’ranic influence there may be fewer feelings of guilt and thus, more freedom to demand the surroundings to adapt to one&#39;s own wishes and desires. This may include demands to wear Islamic costumes which can result in more Muslim demands for Islamization of our Western societies, but it is also a powerful source of victim mentality and leads to endless demands on one&#39;s surroundings. In a very concrete way this cultural tendency, shows itself in therapy, as a lack of remorse. The standard answer from violent Muslims was always: &quot;…It is his own fault that I beat him up. He provoked me.&quot; Such excuses show that people experience their own reactions as caused by external factors and not by their own emotions, motivation and free will. Even though one&#39;s own feelings, when experiencing an insult, can be moderated by one&#39;s own point of view, this kind of self reflection does not happen to the same degree among Muslims as it does among Westerners. It only takes one person to beat up another: the guy who is doing the hitting. It also only takes one person to feel insulted. Being beaten and feeling insulted are thus strictly different social events. The latter depends on ones self, while the former is solely caused by outer circumstances. Unfortunately, this fact is not considered in Muslim culture and apparently also not by the supporters of laws on hate speech, racism and defamation.</p>

<p>The difference in mentality is clearly stated by the old Indian proverb:</p>

<p>You can walk around softly everywhere by putting on a pair of shoes, or you can demand that the whole Earth becomes covered by soft leather.</p>

<p>It is a question of locus of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I just don&#39;t see immigration as the #1 source of Islamic extremism in America. The majority of Islamic terrorists are self radicalized Americans,  not immigrants or refugees. Same with in Europe. Those are the real threat,  not immigration. Making all these strict immigration  laws is just a) making then hate us more (I agree this is a bad argument and we shouldn&#39;t base our immigration policy on whether or not people will hate us,  but it is true) and b) ignoring the real threat </p>

<p>This is entirely reasonable. I just hope you aren&#39;t implying I am calling the immigration ban a &quot;ban on Muslims&quot;.  I&#39;ve never said that,  nor do I believe that, even though I tend to sway to the left on most issues. </p>

<p>Again,  reasonable.  I would just like to point out that the bombers themselves were the terrorists,  not the dudes father. And IIRC they were radicalized long after coming into the states. They lived for years as good ol&#39; American boys before deciding to kill innocent people. I don&#39;t think improper vetting of the father was the  cause. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>Agree 100%. I don&#39;t have the answers either. Thankfully us two arent the ones making policy decisions lol  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do find it odd that Obama banned all Iraqis from coming into the US for 6 months.  No one batted an eye.  But Trump does it, his reasoning is the same as Obama&#39;s, but the Obstructionist Left falls over themselves in being offended.  The hypocrisy is just a bit rich for my taste as of late.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can speak to this a bit. Obamas ban was a direct reaction to a specific threat. A dozen or so Iraqi insurgents infiltrated the refugee system,  some even got as far as Kentucky before getting  caught,  so Obama proposed a ban until the security breach could be investigated, identified and rectified (the proposal was also devoted in Congress,  IIRC). Furthermore, the ban was only on new refugee applications,  not existing ones,  and it didn&#39;t cover green card holders and other people who were already here legally. So if an Iraqi citizen had a student visa during that time and happened to be outside of the country,  that person was still allowed in. Trump&#39;s ban is much different,  it&#39;s not addressing a specific threat, it&#39;s addressing a potential one, and it&#39;s hurting a hell of alot more innocent people than Obama did.  I agree there&#39;s some hypocrisy,  especially in the overreaction of the left, but I do not think the two situations are that comparable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I thought that it wouldn&#39;t stand up in court.  A ban on Islam is against the law and its just not American.</p>

<p>So I opened up the text of the EO.  (It&#39;s not very long.)[<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states</a>]</p>

<p>Basically it references some very serious issues that occur within the <em>culture</em> of the countries targeted.  It isn&#39;t Islam specific, though those nations are majority Muslim.</p>

<p>So once I understand that he was making the ban more about the area these people are coming from and not Islam itself, I understood it a bit better.</p>

<p>Really, the ban is a 90 day hold.  That&#39;s it.  It gives the Trump team enough time to figure out how they want to proceed.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s disgusting that a lot on the Left are saying this will only push more towards terrorism against the US.  It&#39;s a disgusting thought because it implies that Muslims and those from the Middle East are so easily manipulated and weak that something like this could push them into violent acts of terrorism.  Frankly every Muslim should be offended at this insinuation.</p>

<p>If a Muslim is wanting to come to America and is currently blocked, I&#39;d hope that they realize that this is just America trying to be safe rather than sorry.  And I&#39;d hope they are patient with us as we change Presidents.  I also hope that after the ban is lifted they have the opportunity to come to America and prove that they are just as hard working and dedicated to America as the white guy or black woman that lives next door to them.</p>

<p>“As a young person, I feel it necessary to show the great nation that we live in that there doesn&#39;t need to be this kind of violence and hatred in our world. And that loving one another doesn&#39;t mean that we have to compromise our beliefs; it simply means that we choose to be compassionate and respectful of others.”

<p>I know all muslims obviously aren&#39;t bad.  But if just 1 or 2 refugees attempts a mass killing, it would trigger a stage of events that would probably end up with Muslim ppl being put in camps circa WW2 Japanese ppl.

    <div class="md"><p>I ultimately agree with this. It&#39;s a false notion to fight over &#39;who has it worse&#39;. None have a say in the outcome. There may be 6 different classes of slaves, but none make the rule.</p>

<p>In a &#39;free&#39; society government cannot impede upon your individual, as an individual without government is natural, and the joining a collective is voluntary. In today&#39;s world, governments will imprison
you for all sorts of behaviors that offer little detriment.</p>

<p>The ones in charge aren&#39;t bound by these laws. If those bound were in charge, they wouldn&#39;t make such laws. These &#39;laws&#39; which serve the unjust are just manifestations of enslavement.</p>

<p>In so much as the disguise works and the many don&#39;t practice self-rule, it&#39;s fine. Time is short, and if you waste your life on a &#39;protest&#39; which does not simultaneously outright reject and propose an alternative, you&#39;ve already lost.</p>

<p>There is a big bicycle powered bus driving off a cliff. You can&#39;t stop pedaling but you can elect a new driver. However the driver says that it&#39;s the brown, gay, yellow, pedalers that are the Real issue.</p>

<p>And in so much as groups of people are stupid enough to believe that, groups of them have agreed to kill gays in reply. Can u participate in a free society with such insignificant mental capacity?</p>

<p>I would suggest not. If you are so easily turned into a beast, you&#39;d have no place in a modern world. The rule of beasts is fundamentally different from the rule of equals. Sometimes you got to put in place laws they don&#39;t understand to limit their populations.</p>

<p>I would have to disagree. A free-mind, and a wise person, will be able to see the issues from many different eyes, and come up with a solution. If I refuse to see the pain and suffering through the eyes of those I am going to harm, then I lack empathy. I would be a tyrant. </p>

<p>She clearly thinks Sharia law is something different than you or I do, something very benign.  Further, that&#39;s just one person among millions, and she seems to be very lonely in her support for it among even her most devoted fans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure how to take this seriously, if you really think there&#39;s widespread support for Sharia law.  More likely you&#39;re just being dishonest, a way to win points in some argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  The second that the polling said 51% of Americans were cool with it. ;P</p>

<p>Interesting story (to me.)  There was a little kerfluffle about HRC saying that Nancy Reagan was a friend to teh gays and was amazing at all the political capital she gave to Aids Rsearch - at Nancy&#39;s funeral.</p>

<p>So, I went and looked to see what Bernie was doing during the Reagan years.  Turns out, he was a mayor of Burlington, and during the same time period that Ryan White was getting firebombed out of his house, Bernie was making it illegal to discriminate against sexual orientation for housing.  Not much was written on it, but as far as I could tell, it was Burlington and San Francisco that did that.  That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>And the Clinton&#39;s?  They were selling tainted blood to Canada, since the US said they didn&#39;t want to use HiV+ blood anymore.  <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/04/arkansas-bloodsuckers-the-clintons-prisoners-and-the-blood-trade/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/04/arkansas-bloodsuckers-the-clintons-prisoners-and-the-blood-trade/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so not &quot;illegal&quot; then.  If something is illegal, it caries penalties for performing or partaking, which gay marriage did not.  In fact, her previous support for labeling marriage as between a man and a woman carried a caveat that she believed in same-sex unions, while keeping the term marriage as between to only refer to opposite-sex couples.  This was for sure a calculated move, but demonstrates at least her desire to see same-sex couples afforded the typical rights of married couples (visitation, financial support, etc) while appeasing the religious crowd by keeping the &quot;institution&quot; of marriage technically opposite-sex, something the religious community considered important.</p>

<p>Her stance on not calling out Islamism was entirely to do with her need to appease those Muslim countries she wanted to work with.

    <div class="md"><p>The fuck are you talking about? Putting Muslims on a pedestal of protection and support? Is that really what it&#39;s about? Or is it more about due process and the rule of law? Are people celebrating Islam or simply trying to be fair to people? Putting someone on a pedestal means putting them above everyone else. Yeah, really put them on a pedestal by honoring their visas and our own laws and values. </p>

<p>Nope. Utter bullshit. There&#39;s nothing that hurts gay rights or women&#39;s rights by letting more Muslims into the US. When muslims in the US are accepted, they become much more moderate or liberal themselves. And again, letting them in does not have any impact on rights of gays or women. Right wing policies do, though. Nothing about asking for the constitution to be upheld puts Muslims above anyone else, as you imply. Supporting one group does not logically follow that you&#39;re supporting their religion.</p>

<p>You want real hypocrisy? There&#39;s a giant movement to outlaw abortion from Christians. None of them give a fuck about the death penalty.</p>

<p>The only reason the west isn&#39;t like that is due to the Enlightenment and a push back against the church. For most of history, Christians treated homosexuality and women the same way as Muslims. IIRC, the law against buggery in Pakistan that stands to this day was implemented by the British.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would a SJW be ready to advocate the de-institutionalization of marriage? I understand the argument they put forward on gay marriage, i.e. it&#39;s unfair heterosexuals get to do it and we don&#39;t. Because when you&#39;re married the government makes it easier for a great deal of things (fiscality being one). That&#39;s fair enough in my mind.</p>

<p>But rather than imposing a &quot;new&quot; definition of marriage and family, why wouldn&#39;t the government stop advocating any? As in, it doesn&#39;t care/register if you&#39;re married or with whom. All it knows it that consenting adults may establish a private contract (like a shareholders&#39; agreement) and be asked to enforce it if there&#39;s ever a disagreement.</p>

<p>Churches would be free to organize whatever celebration/ritual they&#39;d like. They&#39;d have no legal value however and &quot;civil wedding&quot; wouldn&#39;t exist anymore.</p>

<p>Would gays or SJWs be ok with that? To conservatives reading this, would you too? That&#39;s the liberty approach. And the reason governments institutionalized marriage in the 1st place (protect women) has become obsolete.</p>

<p>Mormons or Muslims could have polygamy, feminists could have polyandry, gays could marry each other, and Christians could retain their traditions/values. Wouldn&#39;t that be great? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only argument against this is that there is &quot;good&quot; in having a mechanism whereby the government can provide a bundle of recognized rights and responsibilities on a couple. I.e., if you commit to supporting each other we will allow things like visitation rights, tax simplifications, etc... instantly and for free. Acquiring these things would take time and money normally. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t feel there is &quot;good&quot; in having more stabilized relationships then this isn&#39;t needed. I tend to think having privileges for couples that legally to commit to supporting each other is good, but I can understand and appreciate the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, and I do think it&#39;s good and virtuous to have stablilized relationships. I just don&#39;t think government is the right institution to promote this (case in point, is doing the exact opposite). </p>

<p>Couples could privately commit to supporting each other in a contract. You can give that contract the name of &quot;wedding contract&quot;, but don&#39;t need to, and it needs be given no particular significance <em>a priori</em> by the State.</p>

<p>Shareholders&#39; agreement are a very good example of such contracts. They are very similar to wedding contracts actually. The only big difference being children (who are not assets but have freedoms in their own right). But yet again I think, even for the protection of children, that it would be better to take the .gov out of the equation rather than giving it yet more prerogatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive had this thought for a while now.  government has no business defining marriage anyway.  as far as i was raised to understand, marriage was a public commitment made in front of your peers and (in the case of the religious) in the eyes of your god to be committed adn faithful to the person you are marrying.  im pretty sure the idea was to place great importance on your commitment in that your peers, your community, or your church would all know you made such commitments and support you, or you would face the shame in all your neighbors knowing you are a liar and a cheat.<br/>
the way i see it is the govt should get out of the marriage business altogether.  some major corporations have already address the &quot;family&quot; aspect of this by allowing you to designate anyone as your financial and insurance beneficiary regardless of relationship status.  why couldnt it just work like this in regards to any government benefits related to having a family? 
if your church marries same sex couples, or does not marry same sex couples depending on your belief, pick another church.  or dont have a marriage in a church at all.<br/>
maybe im old school or small minded, but i thought that was the way things were supposed to be in the usa.  live according to your faith whatever it is, dont worry about people who dont agree, and dont feel the need to call for a law every time someone does something that bothers you.  that is the mindset i just dont understand at all.</p>

Just one peek at their subreddit and you&#39;ll see that Christianity has many of its own fuckwits. Not a large amount but very vocal. And just like Islam, MANY who won&#39;t admit the shitty things they believe in public. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to convince Americans to tolerate, much less welcome in, that cult. It is dangerous and, while I know that people can be browbeaten into almost any opinion, there is going to be sufficient resistance that your efforts will have minimal impact.

<p>This would be like tons of black women marching around wearing Klan hats on behalf of Black Lives Matter in the year 3250.   And it would only be similar if slavery was still going,  having never been abolished,  with no Reformation or civil war,  and the Klan ran governments totalling more than a billion people where everyone was forced to be racist and would be killed if they were not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The swastika and the &quot;ghost suit&quot; were only used by groups that tortured and killed, right? We&#39;re there moderate nazis and clansmen?</p>

<p>Many moderate Muslims wear the hijab and are otherwise identical to the average person. I would say the burqa is much more like a swastika because they are almost entirely used by the harmful strains of Islam that get involved in torture and stoning gays. </p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly the hijab wearing is solidarity with moderate Muslims, not ISIS or those commuting honor killings, etc. you may not see a distinction but the protesters do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean in reading his comment. It&#39;s full of buzzwords and labels and generalisations cherry picked directly from the most extreme groups that are engaged politically. Sure, these groups (feminazis/SJWs) are annoyingly present in social media, and whatnot. But they don&#39;t represent the silent majorities or the people who show up at the airports angry about injustice. And in my experience, if you spend your days searching the internet for  these sorts of extreme points of view, it will only reinforce your own views that they represent the greater whole or that their over-the-top way of thinking about society is some sort of widespread phenomenon; when really, it&#39;s only a loud minority being giant, unintelligent babies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, thanks. I agree that if the propaganda / current hegelian dialectic caricatures conservatives, libertarians and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, it is also safe to assume their caricature SJWs. Their goal being to convince everyone that those outside their identity group is are morons/bigots. Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>Personally I loved Michael Moore during the Bush years, although I didn&#39;t agree with him on economic policy issues. He rightfully denounced the neocons and war criminals. That is, before he turned around and started supporting the new war criminal in town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that most people complaining about SJW&#39;s even run into them directly someplace like Tumblr. Usually they&#39;re getting cherry-picked examples of dumbasses (or trolls...) shown to them by places like TiA or 4chan.</p>

<p>It seems silly that a lot of folks&#39; political beliefs are heavily reinforced by &quot;look at these dumbass 19 year olds that hold an opposing belief system&quot;. College aged kids are fucking dumb, it&#39;s nothing new. What seems new is the conservative movement to put these dumb people front and center so they represent the other side. Suddenly &quot;everyone on the left&quot; is an SJW idiot and you don&#39;t have to argue against adults with well thought out positions.</p>

<p>It should raise a red flag when the other side is hand picking the representatives of a group. Folks arguing against these SJW&#39;s should try to imagine liberals disregarding their opinions completely by instead cherry picking the facebook page of some 19 year old coal-rolling racist dumbass from Appalachia and using the stupid political posts therein as a strawman for all opposing beliefs.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the evidence for any of this? What agenda? And how is it worse than the active opposition to LGBT rights from the right?</p>

<p>None of that has anything to do with left-leaning politics. The left spends more time and energy fighting for civil rights than the right, sure, but that doesn&#39;t make <em>being gay</em> or <em>dating other races</em> a &quot;left&quot; thing. </p>

Yes the UK has long been associated with more left leaning liberal politics and society. Clearly they valued left leaning policies towards women and property while occupying India that helped to reshape the caste system and its modern incarnation. I&#39;m not in the mood to debate the liberal blessing the UK has given the world so if that citation isn&#39;t good enough you&#39;ll have to accept it at moot. </p>

<p><em>And what is it you see in media where gay men are being back stabbed? I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about, or why you think the left would do it. What does it accomplish?</em></p>

<p>The post modern led Left label white men as either sub or evil, there isn&#39;t much leeway. You can&#39;t have white men allowed a position of authority/social influence, be they gay or otherwise.
I&#39;m sure you can conclude what that accomplished for the left.
I think this is the bit about gay white males being censored but maybe not...life is mysterious like that</p>

<p>I used to think that only the Left was engaged in identity politics.  They seem obsessed with genders, gays, trannies, blacks, immigrants...any minority group.  I was actually pissed because I attributed identity politics to why the Democrats lost (which I still in part believe).   </p>

<p><em>But here is the piece of the puzzle I was missing:</em>  The Right is every bit as obsessed with identity politics as the Left.  Maybe even more so.  But it is in the form of being racist, or sexist, or hating gays, immigrants, and people that aren&#39;t from their religion.  These are people that would never give Obama a chance simply because he is black.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the entire culture of liberals and tolerance is actually just the kids on tumblr. I&#39;m a huge asshole, die-hard liberal, and borderline misanthrope. But I&#39;m not religious so I treat gay people like they&#39;re people. I hate religion, but not equally. Islam is patently worse for women and gays. It&#39;s worth noting that making suicide against the religion is the only thing keeping Christians from being suicide bombers or engaging in mass suicides to get to heaven faster.</p>

<p>The only people who think the way you do spend too much time on tumblr, have never interacted with gay people and think that feminism is solely the 4th wave shit pushed by teenagers online. Surprised you didn&#39;t mention anything about how the gay agenda is really just to legalize pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find anyone on the left supporting the government of Saudi Arabia, for example. They support Muslim people&#39;s rights to believe what they want and not be persecuted for it. Believe it or not, the majority of Muslims don&#39;t want to throw gay people from the tops of buildings or set them on fire. I&#39;ve met gay Saudi Muslims and Muslim women from Iran who don&#39;t want to wear a hijab. Their governments persecute them, and every American (liberal, conservative, muslim, atheist, etc) I&#39;ve ever talked to on this will condemn those governments&#39; actions. I know an openly gay man who lives in Dearborn (the largest % Muslim/Arab populations in the US) and has never had an issue.</p>

<p>Of course certain cultures within Muslim communities around the world have varying attitudes towards this - but they are changing, as are their attitudes towards gay people in general. </p>

<p>I think many on the left are a little more sensitive towards criticizing Muslim communities because they&#39;re so often unfairly criticized. Assuming someone who is Muslim (especially in a Western country) automatically hates gays is often unreasonable. Be critical of the actual people/societies/governments that spew hatred, not of just &quot;Muslims&quot;</p>

<p>The corrupt Leftist thinking goes that if they didn&#39;t personally see people criticizing those Christians, then we&#39;re not allowed to criticize Muslims.

<p>This could also easily apply to the Christian fundamentalist or the Republican policy makers who claim to be one. (I say this as a non-partisan)</p>

<p>The reason is simple. What&#39;s the point of freedom of speech or religion if you only allow the speech or religion that you agree with. </p>

<p>That means allowing the KKK to march the street. That means allowing anarchist protests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally I would agree with you here but islam is a whole other beast.  It&#39;s tied to a religious government as a requirement for all Muslims to wage jihad to make that happen and to kill all infidels or convert them by the sword.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ told us to love one another and have compassion and bring his words to all who want to listen.  I am no expert and don&#39;t claim to be but I am unaware of any Christian movement that requires conquest and conversion by force.  Many may like the idea of Christian government but most I&#39;ve attended from various Protestant branches to my husband&#39;s Catholic church it&#39;s preaching peace and love and individual repentance and sin.... Judge not others etc.  Love the sinner and hate the sin. (We all need to work on this and quit making moral issues laws like prostitution, drugs and gambling etc).</p>

<p>islam has no get along to get along.  It mandates conquest and blood and an Islamic state.  Anything less means you are not a good muslim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, with Christianity or Islam?  Because with the mass influx of refugees into Europe and the violence and chaos that has accompanied that, it kinda feels like echoes of the Muslim Conquest.  Obviously it&#39;s not nearly as dangerous... yet.   I&#39;m sure the Islamic invasion of the Byzantines was seen as just some isolated raids at first too.  I dunno, I don&#39;t want to speculate too much, but if Islam is still seeking to invade, the situation right now looks a lot like a Trojan horse.  Anyway that&#39;s not to mention the daily conflicts and killings between Shi&#39;ites and Sunnis scattered throughout the ME.</p>

<p>Christianity hasn&#39;t done <em>much</em> violence in recent times (abortion clinic bombings are about the only thing I can think of, and that is not fresh in most memories), so I would say of the two religions, Christianity tends to be more peaceful.  Not Hindu or Taoist peaceful, but still more chill than Islam.</p>

<p>Your point&#39;s valid with the Crusades not being a relevant example of modern Christianity; I was just pointing out that they&#39;re not even a good example of aggressive violence in Christianity (as so many like to paint it) considering that they were initiated as what was effectively self-defense.  I was commenting with intent to dispel some of that ignorance.</p>

<p>If history is any judge, this will probably literally never happen.  Islamic extremists have been known to wage war against other sects of Islam for not being &quot;Islamic enough.&quot;  You think they&#39;d really tolerate an entirely different religion enough to &quot;team up?&quot;</p>

<p>Have we not already seen that in Orlando and San Bernardino?  Or are you referring to primarily Christian-based domestic terrorism (like bombing abortion clinics, though I think that&#39;s in the past)?  The way things look, politically-based domestic terrorism seems to be the greater immediate concern.</p>

<p>I whole-heartedly agree.  But I&#39;m also certain that there is a large portion of the US population that disagrees with that statement entirely (i.e. &quot;no, they just want to peacefully adopt our values and seamlessly integrate , and it&#39;s racist to presume otherwise&quot;).</p>

The Crusades happened before some translators fought to have the Bible in the common language.  The Crusades aren&#39;t the evidence of a violent faith, but rather the fault of a corrupt political elite that manipulated the people.  Who was calling for war?   Political and church leaders based on greed.</p>

Many people cite the Crusades as an example of the shame of Christianity&#39;s violence, and there&#39;s some merit to it (the Crusades were carried <em>way</em> too far IMO), but they began as an effort to drive back the invading Muslim forces that were off on their own tear of conversion - which effectively began with Muhammad conquering his former tribe in Mecca hundreds of years earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Have you heard of &quot;Uphold the Ch&#39;ing Dynasty&quot;? It was the Chinese response to the Christian invasion of China that started around 1858, and climaxed in 1901 with foreign Christian governments taking military control of Beijing. </p>

<p>&quot;&#39;It is worth any cost in money, worth any cost in bloodshed,&#39; argued one bishop, &#39;if we can make millions of Chinese true and intelligent Christians.&#39;&quot; - Understanding the American Promise, James L. Roark and company. </p>

<p>Also, two quotes from Christian history:</p>

<p>&quot;I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.&quot; - Mein Kampf </p>

<p>&quot;My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God&#39;s truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.&quot; - Adolf Hilter, 1922.</p>

<p>Stop with your bullshit history. It&#39;s not just Islam. All religions are a drain to society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To call for an instatement of sharia law is bullshit no matter who calls for it. But being muslim is not the same as wanting sharia law. </p>

<p>Take for example the Muslim mayor of rotterdam who tells fellow muslims to fuck off and leave if they don&#39;t like the western values of the country to which they chose to come. ( <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2907941/Moroccan-born-mayor-Rotterdam-tells-fellow-Muslims-not-appreciate-freedoms-living-West-pack-bags-f-live-TV.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2907941/Moroccan-born-mayor-Rotterdam-tells-fellow-Muslims-not-appreciate-freedoms-living-West-pack-bags-f-live-TV.html</a> )</p>

<p>I agree that there is a significant and vocal portion of muslim immigrants who think that their holy book (or more precisely, their interpretation) should be more binding for everyone and hold views on many issues which are fundamentally incompatible with western civilization and feel backed up by their religious teachings. </p>

<p>But the consequence of that is not to conclude that Islam or muslims are incompatible with western civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;The second is this: Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.” Mark 12:31</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the intro to the Parable of the Good Samaritan (paraphrasing here... &quot;Rabbi.... then who is my neighbor?&quot;).</p>

<p>For reference, Israelites and Samaritans <strong><em>HATED</em></strong> each other and committed vile acts against each other.  Or so I&#39;ve heard.  I&#39;m Catholic.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve actually <em>read</em> the Bible.  </p>

<p>There are quite a few interpretations of this parable.  The one I subscribe to follows the thought that even though this gravely injured Israelite is this dude&#39;s nemesis, the dude stops anyway and ensures the guy recovers.  This after the Israelite&#39;s fellow countrymen abandoned him (*).  </p>

<p>To summarize, our neighbors include those not on our respective teams.  It is just as much of our duty to care for our enemies that it is to care for our family.  </p>

<ul>
<li>- I&#39;ve heard a few sermons that note that the folks who refuse to help they guy are not to be viewed as bad people but rather an example of letting fear getting in the way of the above duty.  The injured guy could have been a decoy.  The robbers who fucked him could be waiting for someone to help and jump them.  Shoot, the dude might be in on it and not injured at all.  The point is that there are very valid reasons why someone won&#39;t risk helping.  But we gotta try and get over that fear.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>That also means the refugees.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d imagine this is partly due to gays and women focusing on the religion that is currently oppressing you in your own country, as opposed to the one that <em>could</em> be oppressing you?</p>

<p>On paper, both Islam and Christianity have pretty bad thoughts about women and gays, thoughts that in the modern era we have grown out of. In practice, those bad ideas still emerge, specifically in underdeveloped areas where each respective religion can feed upon xenophobia, hatred, and other unhealthy impulses. The Middle East has a LOT more of the social conditions for this sort of &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; religiosity to form. Fixing those social and economic issues-- in most historical cases-- tends to eliminate the sort of religious fundamentalism that allows one to pretend that some religions are inherently more violent than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.” (Matthew 5:17 NAB)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus approved of the law, and was the only one to fulfill all the requirements.</p>

<p>So theological question then - when was the law accomplished?  When did Jesus fulfill it?  Because most scholars would say upon his ascension.   Jews don&#39;t believe it&#39;s fulfilled, and they are still bound to it (with changes of course, over time).  Christians see it as fulfilled and much of the NT is how people should live our their faith in light of it&#39;s fulfillment.  The book of Hebrews pivots the conversation from OT to NT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda off-topic, and not really a counter-point at all.  His death and sacrifice filled fulfilled the requirements for sin sacrifices for everyone.  Rather than just abolishing the need for sin offerings, He paid the price himself.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really have any bearing on the previous conversation though.  And wiping out the tribes in that area was never part of the law to the Jews either, it was direct and specific instructions from God (to try and keep the Israelites from getting distracted by the other religions in the area). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does have bearing, it provides a bunch of context and framework for the religion (and that context is the reason <em>why</em> Jesus&#39; sacrifice was needed, which is the core of Christianity).  But just because God told the Israelites to do something specific 3000 years ago doesn&#39;t mean Christians today are commanded to do the exact same thing.  </p>

<p>The Old Testament sets the stage for the New testament and explains why it was needed.  Jesus is fulfilling the Old Testament&#39;s laws and prophecies, not throwing it out and starting from scratch.  It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no relevance, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a difference between historical record (God telling the Israelites to wipe out specific neighboring bad influences) and ongoing commands for day-to-day life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The laws of the Old Testament point towards Christ&#39;s fulfillment of them. For example, Cattle were sacrificed at the temple looking towards Christ&#39;s eventual sacrifice, and once that was fulfilled, there was no need for animal sacrifice. There is much that Christ fulfilled, and therefore the old way of doing things was either unnecessary, or more elaborate depending on the situation. </p>

<p>There is a lot of logic behind the Laws of the Old testament, and the teachings of Christ. In the OT, the Hebrews were a new band of people united under a new religion. If you look at the laws in Exodus you can see that they are laws meant to preserve these people and to weed out those who would cause them harm. Kosher dietary laws existed because eating certain things could spread disease back then. In the New Testament, that law was updated because it was much safer to eat those foods and the Kosher law was therefore unnecessary. So, rather than &quot;Don&#39;t eat this!&quot; the rule became &quot;You can eat this, but don&#39;t eat too much because that&#39;s dangerous, too.&quot; In the same way, the Hebrews established and protected themselves through war to get rid of the people around them who were a danger to them, as has pretty much every civilization throughout history. As the nation grew more and more stable, that became unnecessary as well, so the peace Jesus preached was because the violence of the OT had been fulfilled and the establishment of a nation through violence was unnecessary. The harsh death sentences of the OT were replaced by more civilized ways of dealing with people.</p>

<p>The laws of the OT were appropriate and useful, and many of them became unnecessary by the time Jesus was on Earth. However, much of Christ&#39;s teaching actually expanded upon many of the old laws. You can see this most easily in the verses where He says something like, &quot;You have heard it said that ____<strong><em>, but I say to you _</em></strong>__.&quot; He&#39;s usually quoting an old law and then saying how it should have been interpretted, or should be interpreted going forward.</p>

<p>A good example of this is in the same passage that the verse you quoted is from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Matthew 5:21-22</em></strong>
<strong>21</strong>“You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.’<br/>
<strong>22</strong> But I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Raqa,’ will be answerable to the Sanhedrin, and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ will be liable to fiery Gehenna. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in this instance, he is not saying this law is unnecessary, but that it is in fact more serious than they had thought. Not only should you not kill someone, but holding anger against them is also sinful. This follows the logic I spoke of before. It&#39;s unhealthy for humans to harbor hate or anger for others, and it&#39;s a good example to show that most sins are similar to a parent telling a child not to run out into the street or touch a hot stove.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Some Old Testament laws became unnecessary over time and were updated, but some needed more clarification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, facts then.  You initially asked for examples for Christians murdering people.  Setting aside the fact that the Mormon War was hardly an OK suburb (particularly because it was concentrated in the Missouri area)... Let&#39;s discuss global terrorism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>radical islam is responsible for 99% of all terrorism in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fact: Nope!  True, religious extremism has seen an uptick in recent years, but the most recent data shows ~60% of terrorism occurs from the 4 main groups right now (ISIS, Boko Haram and the Taliban).  80% of the deaths occured in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not getting better. It will only get worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fact: Nope!  It&#39;s literally getting better.  Terrorism spiked in 2006, and while last year saw more attacks than the prior year, the trend is in decline.  Terrorism will always exist.  This is just the latest trend.  Before that there was the IRA, Chechan Rebels, Pipeline bombings in Columbia, Kurdistan Workers Party.... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sooner we state the facts, we can start trying to cure the root cause of all this shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fact: Yup!  So, do some research, study up on global history, and start stating facts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we can cherry pick lines of scripture from any book all day. What is important is reality. The reality is that most fundamentalism is dying except for Islamic, in which ~15% of muslims already living in western countries support or condone terrorism in the name of religion.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand sharia law and what it entails? It&#39;s a lot like our common law in practice, where interpretation is left up to your local jurisdiction and the judges therein. Think of the punishments outlined in the Quran as legal maximums according to our law, because the judges are supposed to be merciful, as Allah is merciful, and attempt to bend the sentences as much in the defendant&#39;s favor as much as reasonably possible. It&#39;s not good optics to <em>actually</em> stone everyone. It&#39;s great optics to say &quot;well, I&#39;m supposed to have you stoned, but I won&#39;t.&quot; Any truly tyrannical government either has popular support due to external factors, or is so unstable as to not be able to last more than a couple human lifetimes. And the caliphates almost all lasted longer than that. They weren&#39;t tyrants, they were relatively reasonable (for the time), if warmongering, governments. The Arabs have had tons of innovations in government, all homegrown, which modern Western culture seems to completely ignore in favor of the mental image of the hordes burning the Library of Alexandria or some shit. Yes, that happened, but we wrecked and looted shit in the Crusades as well.</p>

<p>Now, where is this implementation of sharia law today? Well...we kinda blew it up. We&#39;ve wrecked so many governments in the last hundred years or so that there&#39;s no continuity left, no common law precedent left to build upon, no wise judges to implement sharia law sanely. Do I <em>want</em> sharia law, as it would likely be implemented now? <em>Hell fucking no</em>. But as many Muslims think of it being, in living memory, back before we started really wrecking shit, and of course through a healthy layer of nostalgia? It&#39;s really not a unreasonable thing for them to miss. The sharia people knew how to keep order. That&#39;s seductive when your entire region has gone to shit. And it also means, definitively, self-rule. No colonialism, no Western approval necessary. Sharia means that Arabs get to judge the Arabs, in a distinctly Arabic way. </p>

<p>Please get some context for things, okay? Ask what you think when you think of a term, and what they think when they think of a term. Though the word may have the same dictionary definition for both of you, for them it feels like home, while for you it feels alien and horrifying. And that&#39;s okay. We just have to know how to come to understandings. We need to have <em>dialogue</em>. As I&#39;ve said tons of times in this thread, I just simply don&#39;t understand how you can pass judgment on literally millions of people without ever talking to them, discovering what they are really like, what actually matters to them. Books are books, people are people. Don&#39;t judge people based on books, or books like they&#39;re people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on post. I would also add that people who want to see Sharia Law in their governance typically want to see aspects of it mixed in with western democracy. They don&#39;t necessarily want to go back to an antiquated time where women are silenced and hands cut off for thievery - which is what most people assume is meant by having Sharia Law. Some Muslim countries even have a greater number of women with Master&#39;s Degrees than their men. People in the West have a tendency to think when Muslims call for Sharia they mean that old-school barbaric crap, but that&#39;s only because the loudest voices have tended to be terrorist&#39;s. Try talking to real Muslims. Having known a fair share of Muslims myself, I&#39;d say that even the more conservative folk among them don&#39;t want to go back to that world either. </p>

Crusades/Christians in general vs. Islam today is a fairly weak comparison b/c you&#39;d have to say Christians are no different than they were 1000 years ago.</p>

<p>Read up on Blackwater, I mean, shit, the CEO published a book that was very explicitly about conducting a religious war against Islam. I have no doubt that much of the reason we&#39;re so active in the middle east is because we&#39;re primarily a Christian nation and they&#39;re primarily Muslim nations, not to mention the prophecy contained in Revelations that a world war must be sparked in the Middle East in order for Christ to return and take all the good Christians home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah?  Have you seen pictures of women whose faces have been disfigured by acid?  Widespread female genital mutilation?  Homosexuality being illegal?  There are a people that have fled fundamentalism in the past, but the Wahabis control most of the mosques in the US.  They have the backing of Saudi Arabia, the &quot;center of the Islamic world,&quot; where people are still beheaded.  Have you not seen the polling of Muslim immigrants to the UK and Europe?  Seen the Muslim scholars that tour Europe talking about cutting off the heads of homosexuals?  This is a myth that all Muslims are peaceful moderates.  The ones you are probably talking about are secular Muslims.  According to the reformists themselves, they are fighting a battle for the soul of Islam against these Wahabis and their ilk.  One can argue that the fundamentalists or whatever you want to call them misinterpret the scripture, but it is a historical fact that Muhammad himself waged war.  This is in stark contrast to Christianity, so it is not brutal ignorance or bullshit.</p>

Also, you don&#39;t address the cultural differences I mentioned.  Nowhere are Christians throwing acid in girls faces or throwing homosexuals off of buildings.  Do you not agree that more recent waves of immigration are of a different character which could explain the opinions polled of Muslims living in the West that aren&#39;t exactly compatible with Western culture which you likely have more in common with than these people?  I never said all Islam was a problem, but you cannot deny the differences between Christian and Islamic scripture and the historical fact that the prophet waged war himself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds of millions that are not so innocent.  Who is the one living in an echo chamber?  A little criticism of Islam is met with defensiveness.  Islam needs to be open to honest criticism if it is to reform.  It&#39;s true that people are lumping Islamism with all Islam, but people that are just trying to make sense of all this are less to blame than the Islamists themselves and liberal politicians and pundits who have misinformed and apologized.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether the prophet waged war defensively or aggressively.  There is enough evidence that it was aggressive to keep it uncertain, yes?  Even if defensive, good or bad, this is a militancy that is completely absent in the NT gospels.  Do you not agree that this is ripe for twisting by those that wish to?  I&#39;m sure Sharia was in some ways a brilliant system in medieval times, but it&#39;s time to update.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those comments were not criticisms.  They were blanket statements.  Huge difference.  People, you included, seem to think that Islam is one way.  You say &quot;it&#39;s time to update&quot; Islam like any other religion HAS updated.  It has moved with the times for the vast majority of this planet. (I spend a lot of time in Indonesia where I have family it is similar to western Islam here as well) This is why I started off calling this whole thing ignorance.  If you or the OP had spent time in a western Islamic community you would have a full understanding of that.  But you don&#39;t.  People are not being critical of Islam hey are dismissing it or attacking it and it&#39;s causing oppositional violence toward people I care about. From my point of view the liberal politicians are not apologizing for Islam.  They are avoiding putting too much emphasis on Islam as a whole as the enemy so that innocent people are not hurt. Judaism has violent text and you do not criticize them.  How about instead you go after the 7 or 8 countries that have used religion in their government to push hostility in Islam.  Islam in countries without government religion intervention are all doing just fine with it.</p>

There are going to be crazy people that decide to take matter into their own hands and do something stupid.   That&#39;s kind of beside the point.  We should be able to ask simple questions like the OP.  Why is the Left so bent on apologizing for Islamists who have obvious issues with respecting others&#39; way of life.  Being anti-homosexual is not some isolated thing practiced by some small insignificant minority.  It&#39;s still a crime in like 11 countries to be homosexual, so how can you so easily dismiss such a backward thing?  You say Islam has been updated, but reveal that you haven&#39;t really experienced life in the heart of Islam.  If it has, then why are the reformers in Europe fighting &quot;for the soul of Islam?&quot;  The countries whose laws and customs they wish to reform are in the ME and not places like Indonesia.  It seems you have this bias you have developed because you have been insulated from the problems that people are rightfully critical of.  I can&#39;t really trust that your picture of Islam as a whole is entirely accurate because you don&#39;t seem to have any experience outside of the secular westernized world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the OP?  How do you figure?  I can&#39;t seem to find the post that started this back and forth, but if I remember correctly, instead of answering his question, you attacked him basically by calling the post dangerously ignorant or something like that.  I responded to this original attack that seemed to dismiss off-handedly the real and justified concern of homosexuals after fifty of them were slaughtered in the US.  He never made any blanket statement.  He never said all Muslims and even edited to make that clear.  You seem to be saying that this question is dangerous and will lead to violence against innocent Muslims by promulgating this notion that Islam is monolithic which he never did.  You went on to say how Muslims are totally peaceful we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about because you&#39;re a Muslim and know better.  I suggested otherwise.  I don&#39;t see the disconnect, or why you can&#39;t seem to follow the discussion.  Meanwhile more people have died, been injured, raped, assaulted, robbed, in Europe, and people continue to be attacked for daring to suggest that Islam has problems.  Indonesia is no exception it turns out.  They may be a minority sect there too, but it is far more widespread than you seem to want to acknowledge.  Actually can you name a country that has a significant Muslim population that hasn&#39;t had problems with Muslims getting along with others?  Anyone that attacks someone that asks a relevant and legit question like the OP instead of having a polite discussion about it especially when people in the OP&#39;s group have recently been massacred just looks like an asshole imo.  Islam has a big problem, and you seem to want to downplay it which doesn&#39;t help anyone except maybe the Islamists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP accused &quot;Muslims&quot; (a term which includes 1.6 billion people) of refusing to respect his human rights.</p>

<p>Your response was &quot;good for you, OP&quot;.  Was OP &quot;gaslighting&quot; muslims?</p>

<p>I DID make an assumption about your value system and political ideology based on your generalization about muslims and &quot;sjws&quot;.  And I asked you whether or not my assumption was correct.  For many on here, that assumption IS correct.  If it&#39;s true about you, maybe it highlights the flipside of your argument and points out your own hypocrisy.  If it&#39;s not true about you, maybe it highlights something for you about others who share just a part of your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, my issue with this post is the use of &quot;they.&quot; Certainly, there are Muslims around the world who feel this way and their faith revolves around a very strict interpretation of these beliefs. But not every one of the millions of Muslims in the world is the same as the ones you are describing. It is wrong to throw a blanket over all of these millions of people because they <em>might</em> have extremist views. At the same time, we should not support the persecution of LGBT people in the name of religion, whether that religion is Christianity, Islam, or any other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so hard to not group people because it&#39;s extremely difficult to vet out those with harmful intentions versus those that do not wish harm.  The ones that want to have cultural take over even if that means violence will only lie to immigration.  So how do you spot that?</p>

<p>Like others have cited and commented on here, people are watching European countries that have led the refugee asylum efforts now struggling with crimes against women which are skyrocketing.  </p>

<p>Being kind and assuming any Muslim should be a safe Muslim is almost impossible at this point.  I don&#39;t think anyone seeking asylum should be blocked, but at this point, current events surrounding Muslims have put people in a very tough decision point.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like you know that 1 person out of 10 that had their house burn down and need a place to live is a blatant robber.  You have no way of knowing which of the 10 are a robber, but you want to help the other 9 that are not robbers because they don&#39;t have a home.  Do you let all 10 into your home, knowing that the one will rob you?  Or do you apologize and not let any in?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from Mohammed Ali along the same lines though he&#39;s talking about his fear of white people: </p>

<p>&quot;There are many white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. If 10,000 snakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn’t want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that that thousand get together and form a shield? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if that makes any sense at all...I tried. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reply definitely makes sense. I don&#39;t know if the USA is doing something differently when it comes to vetting, and I know that compared to Europe our refugee numbers are much lower, but there haven&#39;t been any acts of terror committed by a refugee since before 9/11 (maybe never?), so something must be working on that front. We&#39;ve had far more incidents of mass shootings by white dudes in movie theaters/schools/churches than by Muslims. It&#39;s a hard discussion to have and I think it can (and should) make people on both sides uncomfortable to talk about. There&#39;s no denying that Europe has been negatively affected in some ways as a result of their refugee policies, but they have also helped a great number of people escape death and destruction. I&#39;d love to hear the perspective of a an actual refugee on their experience in all of this.</p>

<p>The religion is like the bizzaro world.  They command the opposite of the Ten Commandments in almost every line.  Only honor thy father is there. Sort of. As long as he isn&#39;t gay, didn&#39;t try to leave islam and convert to something else etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more Agnostic I guess than anything, but I come off Atheist to those who just can&#39;t fathom not supporting Christianity. At least, that&#39;s what I always get. </p>

<p>Anyways, one day I was having a polite conversation with a co-worker, and we were just exchanging stories, and beliefs, and she asked me, to paraphrase &quot;why do you want the Muslims to take over?&quot;</p>

<p>I was pretty confused, and asked her what she was talking about and why she thought that&#39;s what I wanted. Her basic implication was that if I wasn&#39;t 100% fighting a war for Christ, than I was actively working to help Islam take control. </p>

<p>It never even occurred to her that I was vehemently against both. But that&#39;s what you can expect from a person who wants the rapture to happen in their lifetime. Seriously. She believes the rapture will happen in her lifetime and is excited for it. But anyways, that&#39;s a whole other thing. </p>

Either all vaccinations are uneqivocally good or you are anti-science.

<p>Hi! I don&#39;t mind you discussing such things, <em>IF</em>...you can give good evidence for their existence and <em>IF</em>... you are fairly presenting the science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>woeful effectiveness of unnecessary shots like the flu one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really mean anything from a safety, epidemiology, or public health standpoint. I see two points here: its ineffective and we shouldn&#39;t administer them (unnecessary doesn&#39;t mean anything useful here. Is any health care necessary?).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm">Here is the effectiveness.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 2014 study* showed that flu vaccine reduced children’s risk of flu-related pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission by 74% during flu seasons from 2010-2012.
Another study published in the summer of 2016 showed that people 50 years and older who got a flu vaccine reduced their risk of getting hospitalized from flu by 57%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not all of it. That&#39;s just a couple of studies. But I think the bulk of the evidence says that it saves a lot of lives, reduces a lot of symptoms, prevents a lot of contractions of flu, and saves a whole bunch of labor productivity. So from many different perspectives, its extremely effective.</p>

<p>Now is it a good idea? Its hard to imagine a cost benefit analysis based on science where it isn&#39;t a good idea. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All arguments should be logical and debate allowed. Bad arguments or reasoning should always fail in open debate, but only if you allow such debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t a debate or forensics. That&#39;s actually a terrible way to decide policy. This is a weighing of evidence. Those are different processes. Now as long as we approach this in a scientific way and not a debate class way, it can be productive. Otherwise its just cable tv in print form.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rather passionate about this issue. I am immuno-compromised. So unless you are a scientists that&#39;s well-versed in this and qualified to go against scientific consensus, do those of us that are immuno-compromised and much more likely to face complications and death a favor and get the damn shot. Thanks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm</a></p>

<p>In the last six years, only one season has had a shot with an effectiveness higher than 50%. Look at some of those earlier effectivenesses too. They have confidence bounds approaching -50%!</p>

<p>I&#39;m immuno-impaired, but any discussion in the public realm was so toxic that even being immuno-compromised was not a good enough reason not to get every shot, including the flu one. I saw entire comment threads calling for people that dare to question any particular shot as deserving of the death penalty and for their kids to be taken away by the state.</p>

<p>I said nothing about how policy should be decided. I was talking about the public realm of discussion.</p>

<p>For what risk? You didn&#39;t address that at all. So either you don&#39;t know that&#39;s relevant or you are being disingenuous. Has it occurred to you that imperfect vaccines might have tremendous knockon effects?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I notice you didn&#39;t even address the general thrust of my comment though, which was that not all vaccinations are created equally and deserve to be forced onto everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t even clear what that means. Again, it comes down to a cost benefit analysis. You can&#39;t reason from cost nor benefits alone. That&#39;s basic risk management. You haven&#39;t seen fit to present both costs and benefits. So either you don&#39;t know that&#39;s relevant or you are being disingenuous. </p>

<p>This is why you don&#39;t get the deference you feel you deserve. You are clearly ignorant of basic facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in middle ground too. I agree with some of Trump&#39;s actions and decisions, but also disagree. I hate that everyone has to be on one side or the other, and sadly it&#39;s usually the most extreme right and left voices that get heard most.</p>

<p>I can see why people would hate both Republicans and Democrats if all we hear is the most extreme right and left.</p>

<p>I with there were more influential and loud voices that were moderate, logical and reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol... I just look at myself as seeing both sides and trying to engage in constructive dialogue, trying to find a compromise...</p>

<p>I do agree with your analysis too. I think there are many types of centrist or moderate right/left. We all have different motivations. I, personally, don&#39;t claim to have a moral high ground. Another goal of mine is just to help extreme people from either side to recognise and understand the other side&#39;s argument based on their perceptions. I also try to make people aware of their bias or the bias of their source of information.</p>

<p>In many cases the truth lies somewhere in the middle of the extremes.</p>

<li>It wasn&#39;t actually a women&#39;s march, multiple genders were represented</li>
<li>Most protesters showed up to demonstrate but a small group of radicals decided to get violent and effectively bait the police</li>
<li>They turned away people who were pro-life even though they wanted to protest against the same guy</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There is research supporting a distinct difference between biological sex and gender identity, suggesting the gender is a component of the psyche. <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/01/how-science-helps-us-understand-gender-identity/">This</a> Nat Geo article is a great overview and does a good job using a real human lens to explain it.</p>

<p>Here is an study concluding that around 2% of children are born outside of the clear male/female designation, so I wouldn&#39;t really call that a supreme rarity. The link will not properly embed so here: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2%3C151::AID-AJHB1%3E3.0.CO;2-F/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2%3C151::AID-AJHB1%3E3.0.CO;2-F/abstract</a></p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s shitty that these opinions still exist is because you <em>won&#39;t</em> pay attention to the science so that you can continue to discriminate against people who are different. The reason it&#39;s shitty is because you&#39;re not going to read what I linked before telling me that I am wrong again, and even if you did read it you&#39;d just cherry-pick anyway. For a sub that is supposed to be open-minded and reject many forms of social conditioning, you all seem perfectly content with the forces that condition us into assuming one of two social identities.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say he wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to have the opinion, but that is immediately where you guys always take it. Is it supposed to make your argument stronger by making it seem like you are...I don&#39;t know...oppressed?</p>

<p>He is allowed to say whatever scientifically-unfounded, hateful things that he wants -- I just thought this sub would be better than to let itself be spoon-fed the same repressive narrative that helped form the Cold War generation, especially considering the way that our understanding of biology and psychology has completely exploded in the past 50 years. There is plenty of information, but time and time again you&#39;ll go out of your way to defend opinions that do hurt real people and are not based on real, current science. I don&#39;t understand that in general, let alone on a sub that is based on skepticism and critical thinking.</p>

<p>Edit: another thing I have been noticing with many forms of hate like this is that the person reaching out to be hateful typically has nothing to actually gain from it. What do you gain from supporting a narrative that tells other people the way their brain is organized is unacceptable? Anything you do stand to gain is dwarfed by what others lose in freedom of expression. For example, I understand why middle-class white voters were strongly compelled to vote for Trump, they&#39;ve been a neglected socioeconomic class for generations and saw a clear advocate for their cause. But I don&#39;t see anything parallel to that when discussing gender identities, since straight/cis people have literally always been the &quot;default&quot;.</p>

No, but if you think that it is impossible to have a normal discussion, because you opponent said &quot;fuck Trump&quot; it&#39;s more your fault that you get emotional as well, since there are MANY good reasons to say fuck Trump and still be intelligent. 
If you want to defend Trump, I think you should do the argumantative approach, because no, sane person would see how someone could actually defend Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you did that now. And you still owe me at least some kind of proof, that it isnt the case.
Of course, plain clinical insanity would be wrong, but you should know, that I dont mean that kind of lack of intelligence in discussions nowadays and so do you mean not that kind of insanity, I guess.
It&#39;s about the plain old why the heck did you do that? Because there are obviously a lot of people who dont understand, but you just say &quot;I cant talk about that&quot;, you really dont see the circle? 
You havent even tried to talk about that, at least here with me.</p>

<p>But most people who voted for Trump do exactly that! Don&#39;t you see that this &quot;not explainations&quot; are just as worse as saying: &quot;I voted for him cuz I hate dem foreigners.&quot;
I doubt, yet, that you did because of that, but if you dont say anything, that&#39;s the thing most Trump supporters, that talk, say, why they voted for him, thus I just have to conclude, that statistically most, possibly you too, voted him because of that, until I hear something else.</p>

<p>The second most heard reason was: &quot;I hate dem Clintons.&quot; 
Which I think would fit you more. But what is it finally?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t owe you shit. Let&#39;s be clear on that. You are making a lot of assumptions about someone on the internet.  People voted for Trump for different reasons. I&#39;m not going to sit here and explain why every person voted for him. Let&#39;s look at the rust belt, most of those states were blue last time. Maybe they liked his economic plans. Maybe people voted for him for his plan on congressional term limits or ban on foreign lobbying. Maybe the media propaganda against Muslims for the last 16 years has done its job and made people worried about American safety. Maybe people are tired of identity politics, maybe they&#39;re tired of people calling them insane. Maybe people really do believe abortion is murder. Maybe people believe the government needs to be smaller and that there should be less restrictions. Maybe people voted for him because the Democratic party pushed them away rigging the primaries. Maybe people read the Podesta emails and couldnt vote for clinton.</p>

<p>You just lump trump supporters as one monolith like they all voted for him for the same reasons. If you read his platform maybe you could see why people would have voted for him.
Go to the Donald and ask your questions, I am sure they will tell you why they voted for him if don&#39;t go in there acting like you&#39;re better than them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont lose your ballsack dude. I dont want to here from why anyone voted for him, but why did you. Gee.
Furthermore, I explained why someone, me, who wants to understand the political mess, has to generalize, when no one explains shit.
Additionally, I will not go to his plattform. I dont believe propaganda from anyone and if you think that he of all people, doesnt do propaganda, than you are naive.
And lastly, yes, I am making a lot of assumptions. What you gonna do? Forbid it? Is that the &quot;less restriction&quot; part Trump supporters stand for?
Or the restriction on decisions made for them? I mean, they want to restrict the freedom of a woman who wants to make an abortion, after all. And they really think this cell cluster is life? But they have no moral problem with eating meat or plants? That&#39;s the part which is insane! And it is just that. saying: I love life! So I am gonna destroy the life of some stranger, by forcing them to get the baby she cannot care for, so it may be starve to death painfully, but goddamnit better this way than killing this poor thing when it doesnt feel anything. Gimme my brutally murderes cow sandwich.
You dont see the insanity, right?
The other things are pretty reasonable. A little naive again, but reasonable.</p>

Now you just stopped thinking for moment, this platform of greatness by him is even that: By him. Meaning I am still dependend on a person with my information. And everybody knows that, if you want information about person it is quite stupid to ask the person himself, he lies about himself, everybody does. If you want to know a person you have to talk to his friends aka. his supporters. 
And yes, it makes me feel better, to know the far world beyond my own horizon, if you are happy in your little world, so be it. But when this narrow perspective gets into politic people like me want to know why, how and if it nessecary.
You know... that is research. I just use better sources. More believable ones. And those sources draw a clear picture. You fit right in it. You wont believe that, because you are SOO different from the others, right? Those liberals? Those special snowflakes? Those who neglect the reality? </p>

<p>No. Right wing media is garbage propaganda too. Foxnews is crap just like the nytimes, npr, latimes, chicagotribune, washingtonpost, cnbc, bloomberg, the list goes on...</p>

<p>The difference is that the right wing media is tiny and a reaction to the liberal domination of media. Foxnews was created just 20 years ago precisely because of the one-sided nature of &quot;media/propaganda&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This applies exactly to the OP as well. Pushing against the banning of Muslims isn&#39;t an endorsement of their policies and culture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the hypocrisy of muslims demanding we respect their human rights but they refuse to respect mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can believe whatever you want, but nothing gives you a unilateral right to act on whatever it is you believe in.  We can protect against action (i.e. preventing persecution through violence, harassment etc), but we can&#39;t protect you from other&#39;s beliefs. Nor does anyone or any entity have a right to forcibly police other&#39;s beliefs. That&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t go ban Muslims because of their beliefs about homosexuality. That would be policing their beliefs and an act of persecution.</p>

<p>Likewise, we can do everything we can to prevent persecution of homosexuals. We can&#39;t protect you from belief systems and other people&#39;s thoughts. We can protect you from actual acts; practical manifestations of those beliefs.  But we can&#39;t protect you from the mere existence of a contrarian belief system.  We can protect from making it able to criminalize homosexuality (an act of persecutuion), but we can&#39;t protect you from the existence of their belief that it should be.</p>

<p>Culturally, you can educate, inform, advocate and pressure them to change their belief system. Make your voice heard.  Just don&#39;t cross the line into harassment and persecution of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I often ask people, during these discussions about muslims, if they have gay friends and if so, what do they think the majority of Muslims believe.  They don&#39;t want to believe that most have extreme views on homosexuality.  Do they not care about the rights of their gay friends or family?  I work with a lot of Muslims and best you can get out of some is that &quot;you have to respect the laws of this country&quot;.  Most flat out say homosexuality is wrong and should be illegal.  Some say they should be murdered.  Some think they &quot;eat the poo poo&quot;.  I&#39;m not joking.  This is a mix of older immigrants and first gen younger ones, male and female.  The kids do not have more solid &quot;western&quot; values for the most part.  Of the Muslims I know, most will, if given the chance, vote to take away rights of the lgbt community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Identity politics has been pushed for so long and hard by the media that many people don&#39;t want to believe the party they identify with so strongly and is almost a part of who they are has lied, used and betrayed them. They close their eyes to their party&#39;s corruption and only blame the other side, never questioning their leaders and that is how they like it (both parties are guilty of this). Considering <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2017/01/20/billionaire-george-soros-has-ties-to-more-than-50-partners-of-the-womens-march-on-washington/">90% of our media is owned by 5 companies</a> (article is out of date due to recent merger) including all TV, movies, radio and news, most of which have a bias and agenda this is a big problem and they are all owned and run by the 1%. Obama contributed significantly to this by allowing these mergers to occur and <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/">by repealing laws that prevented fake news and government propaganda</a>. It amazes me how so much of the pubic just falls into line without even questioning who is pulling the strings. This deepening divide keeps people distracted from looking at the real problems of big business and the oligarchy who keep oppressing the public and taking away our rights and our money.  </p>

I don&#39;t think that muslim people actually understand sexuality as sexuality in general to them is not taught but instinctively learned.  I think that evolution of thought could happen, but not until the extremism attached to islam ends. Islam from my experience is a be all end all. People will proudly go to jail for islam, proudly die for islam, and proudly set fire to their friends for islam. I don&#39;t recall a time in history where any other religion was so defiant to social behaviour like islam.
Christianity may have been barbaric, but there was a human conscience attached to it for a very long period of time that allowed it to evolve. I don&#39;t see that conscience attached to islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This !!</p>

<p>Christianity got hijacked by dying rome and then Charlemagne. They hid some of the gospels from us and twisted some things like the church being between us and God.  Jesus said where ever we come together is our church even under the shade of a tree.</p>

<p>And yes many people used Christianity for their barbaric and despotic ends.  But they had to twist it to make it apply.  Love thy neighbor and the message of peace didn&#39;t fit their agenda so it was forgotten or added on stipulations.</p>

<p>Islam at its core is vile.  It&#39;s really the anti Christian belief system.  Killing and lying, slavery and rape are all encouraged.  Also pedophilia.</p>

<p>From what my research has shown me its not homosexuality to have sex in the giving end with young men or boys especially ones easy to dress up as feminine.  There is even poetry... sick poetry and I know soldiers who are haunted by the boys they saw turned into sex slaves. Even stories about them . being brought into the military encampments as rewards for their muslim guides and a see no evil, hear no evil etc policy too.</p>

<p>But any same sex couple in love and exclusive or devoted to one another is a death sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>KABUL, Afghanistan — In his last phone call home, Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. told his father what was troubling him: From his bunk in southern Afghanistan, he could hear Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought to the base.</p>

<p>“At night we can hear them screaming, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it,” the Marine’s father, Gregory Buckley Sr., recalled his son telling him before he was shot to death at the base in 2012. He urged his son to tell his superiors. “My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it’s their culture.”</p>

<p>Really? ...</p>

<p>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. (1 Timothy 2:12)</p>

<p>You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 )</p>

<p>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die. (Deuteronomy 21:18-21)</p>

<p>If a man has sex with an animal, he must be put to death, and the animal must be killed. (Leviticus 20:15)</p>

<p>No one whose testicles are crushed or whose penis is cut off shall be admitted to the assembly of the LORD. (Deuteronomy 23:1)</p>

<p>Whosoever … hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, Or crookback, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken … He shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries. (Leviticus 21:17-23)</p>

<p>I&#39;m no christian scholar, but let&#39;s not pretend Christianity is the all daises and lollipops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it a lie..? Amongst many other things, religion establishes a code of conduct that people agree on in unity, and that&#39;s far from fake.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m going to guess you&#39;re too atheist to believe me or whatever, but a decent  of Christian&#39;s actively recognize, including me, that god isn&#39;t really <em>there.</em> I&#39;ll grant that it isn&#39;t an easy thing to gauge, as saying &quot;so you get that god isn&#39;t there, right&quot; can potentially be pretty insensitive... but anecdotally, I haven&#39;t met any that actually thinks that way. A fine amount non denominational Christianity (which is the best I can speak to) has a degree of subjectivity. I can say I saw God, which in my eyes I have, and that sounds insane, right? It would be, if God didn&#39;t represent something else for me. To me, god is the essence of love and community coming together. I leave God responsible for the greatest achievements in my life- meaning, the love and support of a like minded community. Not some interdimenional omnipowerful universe creator or something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a lie, it&#39;s a thought box. Theres a reason bible study exists- for explaining every sentence and how it&#39;s a <em>symbolic</em> representation of something else. You make of it what you will. The disgusting aspect arrives when people manipulate foolish, malleable souls into believing they are solely controlled by some mad god, and the only way to please it and not burn eternally is to be a racist, hateful, usually anti-gay cunt. Whenever you have something lovely available to an insane amount of people, there are always some fuckers that will abuse it and bastardize it. Few are proud of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. THIS is the problem. &quot;God isn&#39;t really there&quot; means (by definition) you are no longer a theist. I can ask 100 &quot;Christians&quot; what they believe and get 100 different answers. But of course YOU are the enlightened one with all the answers. YOU (and your self-selected echo chamber) know HOW to read the magic book of riddles. But GOD FORBID someone else looks at the same book and -after CENTURIES of study by rabbis and priests and clerics- comes to a different conclusion; those fuckers just abused and bastardised YOUR holy book. Everyone else are uneducated fools that don&#39;t know better - but not you and yours.  </p>

<p>THIS is how and why religion separates us. YOU have the right to claim some kind of higher knowledge - &quot;because God&quot;.  And then you have this whacky, ill-defined, nebulous, impossible to nail down definition of &quot;God that is a symbol&quot;. If you&#39;re a Humanist (you sound like one), just say THAT. You&#39;re not a good person because of a carefully-studied reading of the Bible- you&#39;re a good person because that&#39;s the fucking obvious way to be a civilized human.  </p>

<p>Why choose the Bible if it&#39;s (by your admission) not the inspired word of God? Why not the Eddas? Or Gilgamesh? Or Harry fucking Potter? I can &quot;study&quot; The Lord of the Rings and come to all kinds of conclusions about deeper meaning in the world. The fact is you decided the conclusion first and then justified it by &quot;studying&quot; a collection of bronze-age myths that was mangled by several editings. Next time you &quot;look deeper&quot; in your &quot;study&quot;, ask yourself: &quot;if this book didn&#39;t exist, how would I live my life?&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... uh huh. Loving all the <strong><em>CAPS LOCK</em></strong> and quotation marks.</p>

<p>Did that not prove my point? That it&#39;s subjective, and you make of it what you will? You said it perfectly- you&#39;ll get 100 different answers. Being real here, I can&#39;t say mine is the best answer, but what I said what I did based on your statement &quot;Does God demonstrably exist in reality? If not, then religion is a lie.&quot; That makes absolutely no sense. That is such a trademark argument for someone who thinks Yep, religion is merely a tool for control and everyone who follows it is a monkey. Hoped I could relate to you in some way by saying otherwise, but hey, not everything works out.</p>

<p>Besides, I pointed out that he is there and isn&#39;t. Is depending on how you perceive what God is or may be, God is there. Existent. But, it&#39;s easy to recognize that with no feasible evidence for this current physical form existing, so that much can be pointed out.</p>

<p>The only people I said were bad or uneducated were people who use it to hurt others. It&#39;s wrong because it&#39;s fundamentally against the modern teachings of the religion anyhow, and severely against the way our culture is moving. I might call that generally incorrect. Not sure i&#39;m the only one who feels this way either? maybe it&#39;s just my church and priest or something...</p>

<p>Also only said I could speak to non denominationals, that&#39;s where all my experience is. You can believe whatever you want- you&#39;re not necessarily <em>stupid</em> for thinking there is a real, physical god- <em>maybe somehow there is?</em> But scientists haven&#39;t found anything conclusive yet, so it&#39;s pretty easily accepted to be that way, from those who are educated. So yeah, I guess you could say I <em>am</em> one of those godlike enlightened beings far above humanity for going to school and learning some simple science. If there&#39;s mounds of evidence that the world is billions of years old, there&#39;s no point in fighting that.</p>

<p>And uhh... That&#39;s a weird question for choosing the bible. Christianity had a lot of political roots in its founding, and there was probably a reason for having a unified text. Harry Potter wasn&#39;t around by then, and religious texts happened to be produced in a simple and easy to read manner for the general public. They weren&#39;t for a time, which i&#39;m sure was politically based. Easy to divide people when the uneducated populace of the streets couldn&#39;t compare to the holy educated priests who could read god&#39;s word, right? If you want to study LotR for deeper meaning, that&#39;s a pretty cool project. I get what you&#39;re saying, you know, but you can do that with anything. The bible is thankfully so rich in content and interpretive that it happens to be better for this than other texts, if anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an enjoyment to study and think about, for some, and for others, more. Some people think the bible is the way you should live word for word, others not... Which is again, where it gets confusing, but whatever.</p>

<p>Personally, if the book didn&#39;t exist, I wouldn&#39;t live any differently. <em>I don&#39;t even go to bible study man</em>, I sat in on some once and did some reading on specific texts. Through this, I can recognize why such a thing as bible study is important- it&#39;s fucking hard to understand at face value. It&#39;s taken a lot of people a lot of time to decipher what they find as symbolic, and it often makes lots of sense. I work and sleep, and help my comrades when I can I guess? It&#39;s always cool to get different perspectives and learn new things, especially from such complicated text. There&#39;s a lot of shit goin on in there.</p>

<p>Oh and uhh, as far as how it separates us, I already mentioned it&#39;s not worth going and telling others to disavow their beliefs, it&#39;s highly insensitive. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure this is worth my time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I value truth. But do not assume the same of others. You make the assumption that every person&#39;s thoughts are situated based on a search for truth. Each of us are one in 7.5 billion people on this planet, and many people have problems that go way beyond them having the time to pursue truth to the degree that you do. Most of those people don&#39;t have the time or desire to come to a place like /r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>If it was beneficial to us from evolutionary standpoint for our brains to seek truth over our other needs, then wouldn&#39;t that be the case? </p>

<p>Your definition of &quot;controlling humans&quot; seems pretty broad as well. Wouldn&#39;t it be controlling people to make them not to adhere to their religion through governmental force? How do you think that stopping people from lying, as you would believe it, would be helpful for the people who use religion to guide their lives or give themselves greater purpose or meaning? (Or even just a more intuitive understanding of the world that allows them to live their lives more easily.) How is potential for adverting human suffering not an excuse? What will you replace it with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You declare religion as &quot;a way for arriving at a functional society based on shared values&quot;. My question is, is this &quot;way&quot; built on actual reality - or a series of bronze-age myths with the same credibility as Zeus throwing lightning? Why not choose a &quot;way&quot; based on demonstrable facts and human compassion rather than &quot;This is bad because man in the sky says it is bad&quot;.  </p>

<p>Further, I see it is a BAD way at arriving at a functional society because now you claim you work God&#39;s will, and He may not be gainsaid. And the next town over has a different view of God&#39;s will. This &quot;functional society&quot; you propose inevitably has lead to violent &quot;us-vs-them&quot; conflicts for literally all of recorded history. Religion is a way of BREAKING society into fragments that then have more to fight about than agree upon.</p>

<p>According to Christianity, God said it was time to do away with old laws, and define new laws. That speaks nothing of fallibility. No mistakes, no errors. </p>

<p>Old laws for pre-Christ times. New laws for post Christ. In Christianity, Christ played a significant role for the &quot;rules&quot; on earth. So when Christ came to earth, and atoned for the sins of man, then died, it was time for new laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire Old Testament is really a big arrow pointing to Christ. Many of the stories are analogies of what Jesus was coming to do. For example, Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis (he is told to offer up his only son), Jonah (in the belly of the whale for 3 days, Jesus compares himself to Jonah in Matthew 14) and even the first Passover when they were told to put blood of a lamb on their doorpost and along the top of the door. It all points to Jesus. Bringing up random verses from Leviticus tend to void a lot of arguments because obviously we don&#39;t believe in stoning disrespectful sons. </p>

<p>As for the Timothy verse about women being quiet in the church, that is interpreted as women should not speak (as in teach) to a group of men. Basically a women shouldn&#39;t be a pastor. Some churches follow this, some do not. </p>

The Old Testament is more of the historical section of the bible, the laws of Moses were &quot;washed away&quot; through the death of Christ and his gospel is what is used as the new template for teachings in the church. Sure, an Old Testament story or passage is used occasionally in churches to teach a lesson, but it&#39;s mostly used as an historical account and absolutely does not represent what modern Christianity is, braised maybe some crazy southern baptists. </p>

<p>Those quotes, from those specific books of the Bible, are more of a reference of where Christians were, and where they have come to (New Testament) instead of actual rules they follow (minus the 10 Commandments). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I went to the comments section of that article and the most popular comment back when this article was written would have been downvoted in most political subreddits today for being insensitive:</p>

<p>&quot;Cultural relativity is completely bogus. Some things are just wrong--and some cultures are just inferior. (For example, cultures that allow &quot;honor killings&quot; of girls and women for sexual transgressions: those cultures are inferior, stupid, barbaric, and just bad. So are cultures that allow rape of little boys.) Why are we so afraid of saying so? I am so tired of hearing, for instance, about the abuse of women in countries like Saudi Arabia and of hearing that &quot;that&#39;s their culture.&quot; Abuse of Jews in Germany in the 1930s was part of the culture there, as was the abuse of blacks in South Africa in the era of apartheid. For some reason we are and were okay with saying those were human rights abuses. But when it comes to sexual crimes against women and children and the oppression of women, well, &quot;that&#39;s their culture.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s ALWAYS speak out against abuse--the abuse of anyone. These are our values. And cultures that value human dignity, personal choice, bodily integrity, women&#39;s (and men&#39;s, and children&#39;s) rights are just better than those that don&#39;t. Period.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just don&#39;t grasp what is really happening. The reason why liberals want to take in Muslim refugees, is because what else can we do to save the people in Muslim countries that are being oppressed? There is this divide between liberals and conservatives about how to stop the abuses of People in Muslim countries. We can start at world war, it doesn&#39;t work. We have tried it before, and it&#39;s not worth it. And those Muslim countries are too rich and too powerful. So we are doing the best we can. By taking in refugees and trying to integrate them into western society so they can have a chance to open their eyes to what freedom provides. It may seem like liberals are turning a blind eye to the abuses and oppression in Muslim countries, and in fact they realistically are and it would be akin to turning a blind eye to abuses in Germany or South Africa just like you said. But what else can we do? We aren&#39;t saying it&#39;s okay, but we also just don&#39;t want to start a world war. Liberals are doing what they see is the best option. Conservatives think we should either just bomb them to hell or close our boarders, remove our military and let them just look after themselves. Now who is turning a blind eye to oppression? </p>

That&#39;s about the same age as the medieval times in Europe. Now that wasn&#39;t exactly fun living was it. Most Greek philosophies survived because of Muslim translations. Islam nowadays is backward because of some lame decision back in the 19th century if I remember correctly. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can chip in here. Oh, I&#39;m Muslim with gay friends.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right~ish. Islam was much more tolerant of homosexuality even a hundred years ago. Much of early Islam was shepherded by the Turks, whose upper class enjoyed a cultural bisexuality and defined beauty as being genderless. There are some remnants of that around still, the dancing boys of Afghanistan, etc. </p>

<p>Muslim Society was seen as barbaric by European society because homosexuality was so tolerated.</p>

<p>However, some of the founders of radical Wahabism were actually students here in the US in the early 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. At least one saw the burgeoning homosexual rights movement(that&#39;s right, that shit was around in the 50&#39;s) in our urban areas as well as our preoccupation with maintaining perfect lawns(seriously) as evidence that American indulgence culture was the work of the devil.</p>

<p>After being a student in the US, he went back to Egypt where he tried to start a cultural revolution, he was imprisoned and tortured, and eventually died in prison(I think), but his message had already found fertile ground to blossom in the ears of the disenfranchised underclass of Egypt. </p>

<p>Christianity was barbaric. Overtime, they evolved, and became what we know today.</p>

<p>Islam hasn&#39;t had as much time to evolve, and it&#39;s evolving under some very different circumstances. It&#39;s much harder to be a dick to your neighbor once you learn that, just for example, he&#39;s gay after ten years of him being &quot;normal&quot; to you. You have to look at the reality that if a gay person can seem just like you for 10 years, then maybe, <em>maybe</em> he&#39;s really not all that different. Maybe he&#39;s a perfectly nice guy, just like anyone else. Maybe his selection of dicking partner doesn&#39;t really mean anything, in the long run.</p>

<p>But today, anyone who questions their faith, or the teachings of it can quickly retreat to an echo-chamber of people who insist that the faith is right, and that the gay man is evil, no matter how nice he seems. Facebook keeps all your old, prejudiced relatives in your ear all the time, and all the fundamental members of your church. </p>

<p>The moderates exist, and it&#39;s still possible to think that maybe we don&#39;t have to be an ass to everyone all the time, but the Social Observation is always there, always &quot;helping&quot; you back into the nest. You have to make a deliberate effort to find the contradictory information, while also hiding it from those who would denounce you for doing so.</p>

<p>You should respect <em>everyone&#39;s</em> human rights. Whether or not they feel the same way doesn&#39;t matter when it comes to the way <em>you</em> respect others&#39; human rights.</p>

<p>It is not hypocrisy to say that you should do the right thing even if everyone else doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that a subreddit ostensibly known for diligent truthseeking has wound up yet another bastion of right-wing bigotry. It&#39;s bad enough dealing with the corporate fake left shit all over the rest of reddit that drives you wingnuts, and while the discussions here are never entirely free from a political bent one way or another, this is pure propagandizing of a notorious historical variety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;m sorry but have you not seen every other sub on Reddit. Every single sub has a complete liberal agenda. I&#39;d say Reddit itself does.</p>

<p>This is the only sub where I have seen an alternative perspective. The only hope I have is one person might linger here and see not everybody on Reddit is completely liberal on all issues.</p>

<p>By the way, the labels aren&#39;t even that important. This is a gay man speaking, and I don&#39;t think it really matters how he identifies politically. He just finds something strange.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what we can do about divide and conquer, but I do think we should continue to search for the truth and question the agendas of large political forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, standing up for the rights of bigots (in this case Islamic homophobics) does not necessitate any hypocrisy on the part of the people making a stance. Yes, Muslims chanting for their rights while denouncing the rights of people in the lgbtq community is hypocritical.  But hypocrisy is rampant throughout society, and this case isn&#39;t that interesting.  People on the left (or any political affiliation) objecting to oppression is not necessarily hypocritical for those people.  For instance, I don&#39;t think either groups&#39; rights should be overlooked, and I condemn the generic Muslim stance on homosexuality (but my opinion is jack shit in the global scheme of things so w.e.).</p>

<p>Are there those on the left who overlook Islamic intolerance of homosexuality? Yes. Are there those on the right who protect the rights of corporations but ignore the same corporations attacking worker&#39;s rights ? Yes. Does either case require a conspiracy? No. It&#39;s just the result of a highly polarized partisan system that plays on people&#39;s basic tribal instincts. What you said does not require any conspiracy to be explained. However, there is an interesting conspiratorial thought to the fact that some groups or individuals are actually using these basic tribal instincts to obscure the discussion, resulting in bickering on forums and pissing contests. But in this case it&#39;s not the vague &quot;those on the left&quot; that is the culprit. </p>

<p>Further, my original point is that OP&#39;s post is not about a conspiracy, and they don&#39;t even make a weak attempt to show there is one. I thank you for at least trying to give the original post relevance to this subreddit but I stand by my original comment. (Also, I am aware that I am not a regular poster or subscriber to this subreddit. But I do enjoy reading conspiracies from time to time. Hence, my frustration with this low energy post). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question was why is this going on?  I think the answer does have something to do with conspiracy.  Order out of chaos.  Destabilizing the M.E was one step.  Letting in a flood of Salafi Muslims into Europe the next step.  Controlling/steering culture to accept all this even against their own best interests is another part of the plan.  People may have responded with political rants, unwilling to take to a conspiritorial level, but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the OP.  At the heart of this is conspiracy.</p>

We&#39;re letting people in who, in extreme cases, want me dead and in other cases will not defend my human rights yet they expect me to defend theirs. Fundamentally that&#39;s hypocritical.

They wait until their population concentration in an area reaches 5% or so, then they begin influencing local politics and bringing in more Muslim fundamentalists.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you would classify Snopes as partisan and thus dismiss them but link to an article published by Gatestone which is clearly just as partisan an organisation. </p>

<p>This is an excerpt describing the founder of Gatestone, &quot;Rosenwald, whom journalist Max Blumenthal describes as the “sugar mama of anti-Muslim hate”. A report by the Center for American Progress found that through a philanthropic foundation, Rosenwald and her family have donated more than $2.8 million since 2000 to “organisations that fan the flames of Islamophobia”. Examples of fascists she has funded include: Brigitte Gabriel, who in 2006 declared that Muslims “have no souls - they are dead set on killing and destruction”; former Pentagon official Frank Gaffney’s neocon Center for Security Policy (CSP), which has published conspiratorial pamphlets warning that American Muslims are engaged in a “stealth jihad” to install &quot;Shariah Law&quot; in the country; and most prominently, Middle East Forum founding director Daniel Pipes, who once described Muslims in the Netherlands as “brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and not exactly maintaining Germanic standards of hygiene.&quot;
<a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/white-supremacists-heart-whitehall-789183852">http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/white-supremacists-heart-whitehall-789183852</a></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t take Gatestone&#39;s opinion on anything Muslim related. </p>

<p>Also nearly every country has ghettos and areas that are unsafe to visit. Can you prove that sharia law is being enforced over the actual rule of law in these areas? That&#39;s the claim that I find hard to believe. </p>

<p>The entire article has quote showing the change in safety and security of their women</p>

<p>Police quote - &quot;On Monday, police in the Swedish city of Östersund advised women not to go outdoors alone following a string of public assaults and sex attacks in the past three weeks. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to the survey, 46 per cent of women aged over 16 felt either “very” or “somewhat” unsafe when they are alone in the dark, compared with 20 per cent of men.</p>

<p>Almost one third said if they were caught by sunset, that they would rather stay at a friend’s house than try to get home alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;“I would never go running by myself on a Friday or a Saturday night,” she told the paper. Another said she would never go out alone after 7pm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;“Loads of women here say they have been touched. We are tired of men thinking they can come to Sweden and molest women. We want to teach these boys how to behave and be left in peace to swim without being felt up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;National broadcaster SVT reports what police area manager Stephen Jerand described as a “worrying trend” of unprovoked violence on women in public places.&quot;</p>

You can&#39;t expect ideas to change unless you give them the space to change. Will that be uncomfortable at times? Definitely. But the net result is positive.</p>

While you may think 45% is low - only 54% of American Christians view homosexuality as morally acceptable (up from 44% in 2007) - and these are people who have largely lived here for generations.</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not. Nowhere did he imply that they shouldn&#39;t have rights. It&#39;s no one&#39;s right to enter anyone else&#39;s country. That&#39;s a privilege. </p>

<p>That&#39;s perfectly reasonable. Im not going to share a community or relationship with people that think it&#39;s ok to beat their wives and honor kill their daughters. Your conception of morals &quot;Everyone is right and everyone is good and let&#39;s let them in so we can all be happy together&quot; is naive and retarded.</p>

<p>You have the same moral conception as Sweden and Germany. Let&#39;s see what happens to those countries in the next 10 years. They will be unrecognizable. Protecting your culture and values from others that don&#39;t share your culture and values is perfectly reasonable. </p>

<p>On the other hand,  you can&#39;t assume that any given follower is &quot;with that&quot; until proven to be,  and even then,  that is not against the law.</p>

<p>So its like corporations,   religions get away with all kinds of messed up ethics.    Probably going to eventually have to impose sanctions on corporations and religions who sponsor outcomes the society does not want.    &quot;There should be a rule against that&quot;.    But humans,  on a case by case basis are probably going to be allowed to hold opinions and values that suck as long as they do not violate specific statutes that are targeted at humans.</p>

<p>I could see why a community would not want to be over run with outsiders.    I could see why a community would want to retain its own character.     I could see that a nation would want to have a policy that honored what its citizens preferred.</p>

<p>On the other hand,  Americans are going along with the slaughter of millions overseas.    They deserve to die in the same way,  and suffer in the same way,  and have their country ravaged in the same way they have tolerated happening to those their nation attacked.   This country is in for hell.</p>

I&#39;m absolutely sure of that, it&#39;s clearly visible.

<p>Please watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4">full video</a>. <strong>It can&#39;t possibly threaten the present time</strong> considering it was recorded so long ago, can it? <strong>it&#39;s from the different - cold war era</strong> you don&#39;t have to be worried about bias whatsoever because Bezmenov is not talking about Trump or the right wing of today whatsoever, he simply talks about the mechanisms Soviet Union used to undermine societies in another countries.</p>

<p>The eerie part is, how much of what he said over 30 years ago is true today, the fruits of the communist soviet subversion are clearly visible everywhere around us in the US and especially in the EU. I can&#39;t tell you the whole interview it is just too much to talk about.</p>

<p>Except that&#39;s not at all what&#39;s happening.  The left is trying to protect those who stand against what the left believes, namely treating all human beings with respect.  There&#39;s a huge difference between respecting differing views, and protecting bigotry.

<p>And when they come here, they continue to have the right to hate homosexuals, much like many Christians(including our political leaders). And despite this hate that some of them have, they can only express their hate in certain ways once in the US. They will not be allowed to throw homosexuals out windows or otherwise extrajudicially punish them. </p>

<p>This is not hypocrisy. It&#39;s completely consistent. Human rights for everyone whatever their religious beliefs. Should we not allow Orthodox Jews in the country because of their extreme anti-homosexual views? How about fundamentalist Christians who advocate gay conversion therapy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leftists are racists. This is why they consider Islam a race - because there&#39;s a lot of non-whiteys. Leftists don&#39;t really know where exactly Muslims they see are from, they just see they are a non-white race on the whole. White Muslims tend to blend in better, so lefties don&#39;t see them. Whites are irrelevant remember, unless they are to be blamed for something. </p>

<p>On the SJW concern scale, a gay white man is below a brown person from the Muslim &quot;race&quot;, and a gay non-white person is below a Muslim person who wears Islamic identifying attire. It&#39;s much easier to virtue signal to other self loathing middle class white 20 somethings if their cause is a person who is both brown <em>and</em> easily identifiable as a religion other than Christianity. </p>

<p>Sorry. Your cause just isn&#39;t visible enough any more.</p>

<p>Gay marriage is state by state, not country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the U.S., the federal government guarantees all people the right to get married.</p>

<p>Trump wants to undo this ruling so red states can strip marriage rights from gay people.</p>

<p>This is not a pro-LGBTQ position. It&#39;s the exact opposite. Taking away marriage rights is <em>bad</em> for gay people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump does not want to undo this, that&#39;s a blatant lie. He hasn&#39;t supported it in any way, but he clearly stated he will not in any way.</p>

<p>As seen in <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/2017/1/30/trump-backtracks-campaign-promise-wont-overturn-lgbt-protections">this</a> 15 hour old article, with a slightly misleading title, has changed his promise do undo all of Obama&#39;s executive orders, by not undoing the one that granted homosexuals the right of marriage. </p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-same-sex-marriage-231310">Here</a>&#39;s him saying he accepts the judgement of the supreme court and does not intend to undo it.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a supporter, far from it, but he also isn&#39;t the anti-gay tyrant you make him out to be. He will not strip away the right to marry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Dutch, being right has nothing to do with allowing gay marriage. Our most &quot;extremist right&quot; party, PVV, states &quot;the safety of LGBT individuals&quot; as one of their reasons the spread of Islam should be stopped in the Netherlands. They are predicted to become the largest party, and are very conservative, relatively speaking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the religious parties that are anti-gay. I&#39;m not sure about the Dutch CDA and ChristenUnie, two centrist Christian parties, but the only truly conservative, right wing Christian party, SGP, is against Gay Marriage. They get around 3 seats in the 120 seat counting Tweede Kamer every election because of the Dutch Bible belt.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Rightism, and conservatism to a lesser extend, don&#39;t influence LGBT rights. It&#39;s religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple, the Left is retarded. And by retarded I mean, their brains are not as functional as those leaning right. </p>

<p>But to get more in depth, I too have often wondered about why the left would be so anxious to help muslims, when muslims despise everything the left is about, to the degree of wanting to kill them for it (throwing gays off rooftops, setting them on fire, putting women in beekeeper suits, mangling women&#39;s sexy parts, stoning women to death after they get raped, etc. Oh yea, they&#39;re a bunch of fucking animals for sure.).</p>

<p>I have thought a lot about this, and I think that those on the left are missing a key part of their brain responsible for forward thinking and logic. They are able to see what is right in front of them, and make a half-way decent judgement as to the good or bad of it at that very point in time, but when it comes to projecting that judgement out over a time horizon, they are missing that part of their brain responsible for looking forward, and they literally cannot see the long term repercussions of the thing, especially negative repercussions, empirically speaking.</p>

<p>For example, the left wants to let this poor innocent persecuted refugee into their country so they can help them, but they don&#39;t think long and hard enough about the fact that this person has been ingrained since birth to hate and kill them, and one day, will try just that.</p>

<p>The left wants to let the person into the country, but they don&#39;t think about the fact that that person or their spawn could end up in a judge&#39;s seat, making laws in the country that would affect their children very negatively. </p>

<p>The left wants to let gay kids and adults into the boy scouts, but they don&#39;t think about the fact that having a gay kid in a tent with a straight boy is like having a girl in a tent with a scout, sexually. This is obviously against the BSA rules, but that doesn&#39;t matter to the left.</p>

<p>The left wants to get rid of guns because maybe they know someone who got shot once, etc, but they don&#39;t think about the fact that if we don&#39;t have guns, any crazy dictator that the people are dumb enough to elect to power, like obama, can then do anything they want to the people so long as they can get them to turn in all their guns.</p>

<p>The left wants gay rights, which may or may not have been so bad, but they don&#39;t think about what comes next. But the right sees the horizon. First the gays want rights, then the trannies want rights, then the pedophiles want rights... it&#39;s just a slippery slope right into the toilet. I&#39;m not bashing gays, just telling you what has happened. But I put the gay/tranny/pedo thing on a different level, it&#39;s just a social thing we have to work out. However, the muslim thing, that&#39;s a huge world-wide terrorist organization that wants to exterminate all the infidel non-believers, that is truly a big fucking problem. We&#39;re not going to see huge masses of GLBTP fuckers trying to kill everyone who&#39;s not gay, etc. But you easily could see a massive number of muzzies try to kill off everyone in an area or even the world eventually. That&#39;&#39;s why it has to be stopped fucking cold right now. Trump&#39;s doing the right thing locking them out. </p>

<p>You can go on and on with these analogies. It just proves my point that they can only see happy things in the present, they can&#39;t see the future negative consequences of present actions. </p>

<p>Because two wrongs don&#39;t make a right?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for all people on the left, but it seems to me like I can reasonably expect gays and muslims to have their human rights respected, all while working to correct misguided beliefs which people of all faiths and ignorances hold and perpetuate (racism, sexism, bigotries, nationalism, etc).</p>

<p>The Christian bible doesn&#39;t do a lot to defend homosexuality either. Plenty of Christians still use that fact to justify their bigotry against gays. But many others have evolved past that. Muslims are no different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for helping people, but why not start with people that need help in America? We have so many more pertinent problems within our own country that deserve priority over aiding refugees.</p>

<p>Millions of children in America go to bed hungry every night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Households with children reported food insecurity at a significantly higher rate than those without children, 17 percent compared to 11 percent.<a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over 94 million people in America are jobless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When President Obama took office in January 2009, 80,529,000 Americans were not participating in the labor force; since then, 14,179,000 Americans have left the workforce -- some of them retiring and some just quitting because they can&#39;t find work.<a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/record-94708000-americans-not-labor-force-participation-rate-drops">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you&#39;re lucky enough to have a job with benefits, the insurance is not enough to cover proper medical care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A report released this week by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that conducts independent research on health and social issues, finds that even though more Americans now have health insurance, many still avoid seeing doctors because of high out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Millions of Americans are jobless, starving, and perpetually sick. Refugees from foreign countries will only exacerbate this issue. You can be outraged about many issues, but you can only fix one at a time. It&#39;s not always so black and white, there are many angles to the issue of allowing refugees into America.</p>

<p>The way you avoid massive, expensive conflicts is by preemptively having smaller, controlled conflicts where the need arises before they get out of hand.</p>

<p>The way you prevent even these smaller conflicts is by giving people aid.</p>

<p>$10 of aid today saves $100 of small conflict expenses tomorrow and $10,000 of large conflict expenses next year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like yourself think we should prioritize domestic problems, which can be understandable. However rather than voting for politicians that have plans to solve domestic problems, people vote for politicians that ban the refugees, while those same politicians won&#39;t solve the domestic problems. Additionally, the resources taken up by taking in refugees, if used on domestic problems, won&#39;t be anywhere near enough to solve them.</p>

<p>To put this into preservative, The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) costs about $3 billion a year. <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/257056.pdf">[1]</a></p>

<p>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) which helps feed low income families costs $75 billion. <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-introduction-to-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap">[2]</a></p>

<p>You could shut down the refugee program and still not expand SNAP to cover the millions of hungry children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the issue where we&#39;ve caused an entire part of the world to be literally bombed into the fucking stone age is a bit more important than some people with bad drinking water. Maybe it&#39;s even part of the same problem. Too much money spent murdering people on the other side of the planet. Not enough attention spent on the effect our industry has on the environment. </p>

<p>There are probably hundreds of thousands of people in the part of the world where these immigrants are coming from that haven&#39;t had clean water or a steady supply of food for years. Our foreign policy has been a direct cause of the destruction of a vast amount of the Middle Eastern infrastructure. </p>

<p>We are pretty much responsible for all terrorism. </p>

<p>&quot;I say to you, God knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind. The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced. I couldn&#39;t forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy. The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn&#39;t include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn&#39;t respond. In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors. And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children. And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance.&quot; - Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>That&#39;s America, that&#39;s how they see us. We have a responsibility as Americans to support these people. It&#39;s our military, and our leaders that have caused their entire world to be literally destroyed.</p>

<p>Comparing the issues in Flint to what&#39;s happening in the Middle East shows a decided lack of perspective.  It&#39;s like saying your broken septic tank is worse than your homeless dying neighbors that are being murdered by insane members of their own family after you burned their house down and killed their Wife, son, brother, and uncle Habib. You then tell them it&#39;s their fault you blew their house up and killed their family and deny them shelter. You then tell them that it&#39;s better if we just set up an area in their yard to keep them &#39;safe&#39;, oh and that area will be staffed and ran by the same people that radicalized their crazy family members that are currently killing and raping them. </p>

<p>They just wanted to be left alone, but the West feared a united Middle East. So now all of their cities are smoking ruins. Go buy some bottled water you pussies. </p>

<p>More than 25% of Americans believe that homosexual relationships should be criminalized as of 2016. Although it is part of a downward trend, it is the most &quot;progressive&quot; number compared to the question of permittance of marriage, access to healthcare, and so forth.</p>

<p>Although there is no study I can find specifically targeting actively religious Christians within the United States, I would make the modest suggestion that considering two additional points of data - namely that 47% responded to Religion/the Bible says it&#39;s wrong, followed by 20% Marriage Should Be Between a Man and a Woman, - if an analysis was conducted on religiously fervent American Christians, say evangelicals, those numbers would skewer upwards. Bearing this in mind, it is my projection to say that it is insular religion which leads one to want the criminalization of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my idea as to why, though, Americans are downwardly trending, unlike say people from Saudi Arabia - it&#39;s because our &quot;free and fair democracy&quot; has allowed homosexuality a degree of public normalcy and a degree of free speech. This has slowly targeted the religious communities of the United States, leaving only the more insular and withdrawn (and conservative and antisecular, antidemocratic) elements to remain so bigoted.</p>

<p>So, it is not that the &quot;left&quot; does not see the hypocrisy to demand human rights for Muslims when Muslims do not demand them for gays, it is that they are demanding human rights for their fellow man - no differently than they have been for you or I as queer people. There is no vast number of people, despite neo-fascist rhetoric, that espouse the idea that Muslims are permitted to be bigoted towards homosexuality any more than Evangelicals are - it is a distasteful, aggressive and [in my opinion thoroughly intertwined] aspect of their religious identity, only treatable through integration into communities, dialogue and free democracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to say by your name, you run in relatively liberal Christian circles. Like others have mentioned, you also have to take into account that culture has pushed people left on the issue. The Bible is pretty clear about homosexuality. I heard many, many times growing up that gays should be executed under a theocracy. You can pretend it&#39;s a fringe belief all you want, but look back at what James Dobson and other lunatics had to say on the subject before they were hushed up by cultural changes. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve met plenty of Muslims who didn&#39;t have any problem with gay people. Plenty of Christians as well. The point people are trying to make is that it&#39;s not what the religion says that has caused them to ease up on gay rights. It&#39;s a cultural shift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even at the peak of publicly accepted bigotry towards LGBT people in the West, I do not think there are accurate parallels between the treatment in the Muslim world in the modern era. Gay sex is uniquely villified in the most conservative Muslim nations in a way that I can not see in Western history beyond the 1700s. Moreover, when this topic is addressed, a favorite argument is that these countries inherited extreme attitudes towards gay people when colonists changed their laws. Except, I fail to see how retaining that prejudice far beyond the imposed laws and the unchanging disgust at the idea of gay sex that goes beyond secret bath houses to actual loving relationships proves the influence of the West. But that&#39;s just a detour here.</p>

<p>Look no further than Maajid Nawaz to see how your binary view doesn&#39;t hold up. A Muslim man, who is outspoken against both conservative Islam and the oppression of Muslims by western military powers, he has been labeled as an anti-Muslim extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center and he barely registers as an important voice among most leftists. Surely there is a point where stopping American bigotry becomes most pressing, but could you ever imagine prominent Western leftists lampooning Muslim conservatives with the ferocity which is directed towards Trump supporters etc? Oh, there were some, and despite &quot;Je Suis Charlie,&quot; the serious leftists I know basically spun into &quot;blame the victim&quot; after the attacks in yet another common instance of leftists projecting their own cognitive prejudices onto the opposition.</p>

<p>But again, I digress. I actually agree with much of what you say here- but I am stuck on the part where you reference free and fair democracy as a changing agent for people losing their prejudice. Now, I&#39;ll put aside the amount of people who no longer respect my opinion after the primaries because I said that Trump supporters should be understood in their access to the norms of the contemporary leftist bourgeoisie and not villified for electing our current mess. No, a deeper issue here is how you address that this element of exposure and free ideas is a factor in changing minds, and yet (though this is not targeted exactly at your post) sooooo many leftists and particularly feminists would never ever ever want to say that free trade and neoliberal society has allowed them the kind of freedoms they organize for or that such systems might be more beneficial to outside oppressed groups than their small pockets of activist influence.</p>

<p>Overall, I agree that men like Trump coopt this dialogue. However, leaving out nuanced details and immediately going to words like fascist, in my opinion, does nothing to address legitimate cognitive dissonances that critics on Reddit notice among leftists. And you&#39;re right, most liberals are not jumping up in support of the views Muslims have towards LGBT people- they are, however, just as prideful and unwilling to concede ground to their demonized enemy ideology of blanket fascism as conservatives are known to be towards women and poc.</p>

<p>But I guess what really matters in the end is &quot;who has power and who is the oppressed minority&quot; because moral truth has finally broken postmodernism and once again there is a Grand Theory that explains everything in the world and that is intersectionality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying and agree to some degrees, but  you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree, man. I&#39;m a ML. I have a tremendous gripe with the way leftist institutions function in the united states, how they relate with postmodern throught, the eradication of absolute truth. I answered in a normie way bc this is conspiracy and figured this was a loaded question and I figured what I said was the most approachable way to attract people to the info w/o alienating them with convoluted explanation about the american left, the appropriation by bourgeois &quot;intellectuals&quot; and their shitty, unanalytical system of evidence and belief. </p>

<p>When i say fascists and evil men, I don&#39;t really ascribe that to the everyday conservative American, not even really these young adults who populated places like t_d. I disagree that neoliberalism bequeathed the freedoms modern liberals and feminists enjoy in their isolated bubbles, it has been the result of the battle between colonialism and the rise of the economic-racial consciousness within the united states to reconnect with the prevailing Leveler ideology which was spun into the dna, set in the foundation of the culture and government. </p>

<p>I have fucking broken up seven different fights between antitrump concerned, but misinformed people in my city and one (or two) trump supporters in the last week. It is exhausting and it is, imo on anecdotal firsthand experience, primal tribalism run amok and really confined to people who have never been involved in protest, nor considered their place in the world economically or have any real grasp of the justice movements in this country outside of a vague knowledge of MLK. Most real organizers / organizations at the grassroots level kind if get it. </p>

<p>I agree w you about the fucking victim mentality shit but I write it off (and most likely  wrongly) as an enshrined philosophy of the fragile intelligentsia that dominates the &quot;left&quot; media and halls of power and not something real working class, unified laborers would endorse - though I do think it&#39;s important to protect individuals from all right-directed criticism, even if their position is fucking insufferable, because I&#39;d rather work togethee to dismantle than continue to see tribalism, neofascism and neoliberalism divide people. </p>

A lot of people don&#39;t care.  If they do care however they have the right to live heir life as much as you do. Once we all figure that out we can ignore all the minor differences we share and just hate each other in the open. Thus having a shared value, our hate for one and other. </p>

<p>Islamists harbor ideas on homosexuality, thought crime, sexuality, sexual equality that <strong>will make your head explode</strong>.  Why are they going crazy OP?  personally I think it has to do with the modern ideas of racism on the left: every &#39;other race&#39; needs respecting and protection from the harmful whites.  It is such a toxic, internally contradictory condition that I worry that&#39;s a Hutu-tutsi moment is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s fine to believe whatever the fuck you want in your own head. Being tolerant of Muslims is not synonymous with tolerating discrimination against gays. Some Muslims do want to take away your right to sexual freedom, but so do a hell of a lot of Christians. Just because we crazy lefties think Muslims shouldn&#39;t be discriminated against doesn&#39;t mean we agree with all of their views. No lefty is saying we should let Muslim beliefs become law, we&#39;re saying that those beliefs should be <em>protected</em> by law. Just like anyone else&#39;s belief systems. Because when you start outlawing belief systems just because you disagree with them, that&#39;s how you end up with fascism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is such a joke. It reads to me like this: </p>

<p>&quot;hi I&#39;m from a severely marginalized group in the United States. I&#39;ve spent most of my life being ridiculed, and had to spend most of my life fighting to even simply obtain equal rights as my other fellow citizens do. Now those same people that were fighting against me, also don&#39;t like muslims. They&#39;ve been telling me about them a lot. </p>

<p>They say that apparently a small limited group of extremist muslims hate gays too, but EVEN MORE than the small limited group of extremist christians that hate gays here that would <em>only</em> love to send me to conversion therapy if able to. So naturally I&#39;m going to trust them and use that same hate that they used on me, and turn it towards another group of people that I&#39;m mostly generalizing as extremists, mostly the same way gays were here in the United States. </p>

<p>I mean I don&#39;t really know any muslims, sorta like how most people who hated gays didn&#39;t really know anyone who is gay. Go Trump!&quot;</p>

<p>Grow up. This is all so ironic because in the past I&#39;ve had to explain to people that just because someone is gay doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re a horny pedophile child loving sex fiend. And now I&#39;m having to convince a gay person that not all muslims are radical jihadists that want to stone you and throw you off a building. It&#39;s just stupid. Don&#39;t be like the people who spent so much time trying to make you go away, by trying to make another group of people you don&#39;t like go away. </p>

The MSM told them the free Syrian army was the good team, and neglected to report on their use of mustard gas, and evidence of citizen torture, or their links to ISIS. They literally are brainwashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m sorry if you can&#39;t get an actual discussion on this. My view is:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between political action and religious belief, and that difference is I think the best place to draw the line. So, religiously a lot of evangelical Christians don&#39;t believe homosexuality is not a sin. They&#39;d say they respect you, but not the choices you make, whatever. Religiously, this is absolutely 100% fine. Politically, we&#39;ve decided that gay marriage is legal in this country. We&#39;ve decided (except for Pence) that you can&#39;t be discriminated against because someone has the wrong religious idea, and we&#39;ve decided that people have no right to put negative beliefs from their religion into practice.</p>

<p>Islam right now has a <em>huge</em> number of followers who believe homosexuality is a criminal act. In fact, your statistic is as good as it gets; in many middle eastern countries I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to say that 40% stat would be more like 90%. But again, the same rules apply. We&#39;ve decided that American citizens who are Muslim can believe literally anything. But they don&#39;t have any right to put their negative beliefs into political action.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to toe this line whether or not we shut down our borders. We&#39;ve had this come up with Indiana, we&#39;ve had this come up with Kim Davis; we will have this come up with Islam. Our response should continue to be the same, that America will respect your religion and your beliefs, but in practicality you have to follow the rule of law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem angry.</p>

<p>We helped save their country so we have no obligation to them: that&#39;s some interesting logic. The fact that we were one of the victors of the war has no bearing on our failure of responsibility in refusing refugees that were later killed in European death camps. Germany, at least, has taken its responsibilities to heart.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t answer my question: If it were the choice between sending a refugee back to a war-torn country, or the reduced quality of life you <em>believe</em> you and your family will receive from that person living in the country, would you allow them in or send them back?</p>

<p>Selfishness is &quot;perfectly reasonable,&quot; after all.</p>

<p>Instead, you&#39;re flat-out saying: I don&#39;t want war refugees here even if they were created by our last President, and also the solution is to &quot;force&quot; other countries to take refugees. That is truly an amazing position - callous, selfish, and hypocritical.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say refugees would be staying for <em>free</em>. Where did you get that idea? The refugee services would pitch in for the first month or two then the refugee would have to pay their own rent with a job the service would help them get. We don&#39;t currently have any refugees. Our state government has done everything in their power, and some things that aren&#39;t, to keep refugees out.</p>

<p>Of course is sucks that Obama destabilized their country and created this mess. So we do owe them something in that regard.

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what they (Muslims or Atheist, Blacks or Latinos, Bigoted or Gay) believe, everyone gets these rights. This is what sets us apart as the United States. It&#39;s about principle, every person gets the same rights. I will fight just as hard for you as I will for them, you both deserve it.</p>

<p>However, you better believe I&#39;m not going to let them do anything to enact sharia law or any other bs like that. I&#39;m pretty far on the left side of politics but I get to enjoy the 2nd Amendment just like anyone else and I will exercise that right should the need arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since this is <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, let me give you an <em>actual</em> conspiracy theory rather than the political reasoning you&#39;re seeing here:</p>

<p><strong>They <em>are</em> brainwashed.</strong> At least more so than the others, and for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Look at the ages of the most heavily-brainwashed citizens. Ages 20-30. Now look at the timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting in 1986, the vaccine game got <em>seriously</em> out of control -- especially with the mercury / Thimerosal / aluminum.</p></li>
<li><p>This is when processed food <em>really</em> began to take hold. It&#39;s right around the time the obesity charts started to inflect upward.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, breastfeeding rates dipped around that time (although not all-time lows)</p></li>
<li><p>They entered their politically-aged lives during the Obama administration with a <em>severely</em> biased and unbalanced media</p></li>
<li><p>They don&#39;t know adult life without social media, and social media is controlled by the elites.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But it&#39;s really the first bullet point I&#39;m starting to consider is the strongest. I mean, these people seem mentally damaged. Why is that? Is it possibly because we&#39;ve been injecting serious amounts of known mentally-damaging neurotoxins in them???</p>

This is a similar argument used against homosexuals. Some say they don&#39;t mind homosexuals, just not the ones who get all upity and want &quot;special rights&quot; you know equal rights.

    <div class="md"><p>So I don&#39;t consider myself a liberal but on a lot of social issues I do tend to lean that way on social issues but I just figured I&#39;d post my oppinion on the matter as I suspect it&#39;s a fairly common feeling...</p>

<p>First I wouldn&#39;t say I don&#39;t see hypocrisy in it (and I know it&#39;s not all Muslims etc) although I&#39;m not sure I would call it hypocritical exactly because to their point of view the 2 aren&#39;t equivalent they would still respect people&#39;s rights they just don&#39;t see being actively gay as a right. I disagree and would even go so far as to say the are wrong morally(a position I could defend but it would triple the length of this post and I&#39;m assuming we all agree that being gay is normal and fine so I won&#39;t go into it) but in that way I would say it&#39;s not hypocrisy just incorrect-ness which is most likely a result of life experience and what are to them cultural norms.</p>

<p>So on to the defense of their rights, we&#39;ll honestly I would defend nearly anyone&#39;s rights and that nearly anyone should be treated with some amount of human dignity. I fully believe that people have more so than any other right the right to free thought by which I mean the right to think believe, or &quot;be&quot; anything they want. I may often not agree with people but as long as they don&#39;t act in a way that is significantly  harmful to people I don&#39;t have a problem with them thinking something  (though I do prefer people have an open mind and be open to discussion and evidence but even that is just my preference in people). So I will defend their rights to be treated fairly and if they were to try to pass laws or create an environment that harmed the rights of gay people  (or really anyone else) I would defend those rights also.</p>

<p>TLDR: I support the rights of people, their beliefs don&#39;t really effect their rights to me and if they tried to take away someone else&#39;s rights I would fight them in defense of that other persons rights as well</p>

<p>There&#39;s no tolerance. It&#39;s an illusion. People hate everyone who&#39;s not like them, that means black (whites hate blacks, blacks hate whites), any kind of lgbtbbq (everyone hates those), muslim. It&#39;s natural and it won&#39;t be ever changed. The stupid masses are just brainwashed as fuck and they&#39;re rolling from one thing to another, whatever media puts in their empty heads, a flavor of the month, so to speak.

    <div class="md"><p>Religions can have both good and bad aspects in them, like most things. This is not a problem just for Islam. If you search real hard, you could probably find some Christians who want criminalize/kill all gay people. So, the religions are complex and the believers have a range of beliefs.</p>

<p>That said, we know that these thought systems are 1000s of years old and basically they contain some truths (thou shall not kill!) and lots of bs. (&quot;You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.) They are basically prescientific thought. I do not know much about gays but it seems that gayness is not something that you have any control over (you are just born that way), so you can see that it should not be a basis for discrimination in the same manner as skin color (we have not yet solved this one either, but closer). So basically religion is screwy and science is more correct. i.e. your claim to rights is as strong or stronger than theirs. (But history and stupidity stand in our way)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is this in r/conspiracy? </p>

<p>I feel for you for the issues impacting the gay community but this isn&#39;t a Muslim issue, it&#39;s a global issue, Europe (including Iceland) and North America are the only places where gays are accepted or even close to accepted openly.</p>

<p>You can bitch about the noise on the immigration ban and how you feel like you&#39;re group is getting lost in the noise but you have to understand that both are important, human rights are human rights regardless of race, creed, or sexuality, you as a homosexual should know and understand this far better than any of us white straight people here. You need to embrace this, fight alongside them and then when everything settles down then say &quot;hey I sided with you, now it&#39;s your turn to side with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Also you&#39;re sentiment is probably such a small minority in the LBGT world, I&#39;m sure many of your peers are on the front lines of these protests in NYC as well as all of the other locations, this type of ban effects us all negatively, it&#39;s a test for other bannings if it stands, which could eventually come to banning gays themselves. </p>

<p>Lastly this is r/conspiracy none of this post has anything to do with a conspiracy, next time take this shit to r/rant or one of the other similar subreddits for outrage or one of the many for LBGT issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gay people and women (and foreign policy) are what made my vote go where it went. If I have a choice between one party completely refusing to acknowledge the savagery of Islam and its lack of place in western society, or a party who&#39;s got tons of Christians (most of which no longer believe gays shouldn&#39;t marry), I think I have a moral responsibility to vote for the party opposing the blood thirsty gay killing woman acid slinging cave people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just me. But more importantly, a propaganda campaign has been launched to equate a savage religion with a color of people and those who push it are convinced they are the <em>good</em> side in a black and white good v evil battle.</p>

<p>If you can convince people to think in absolutes (i.e. If you hate Islam you hate Muslims if you hate Muslims you hate liberals if you hate liberals you hate gays) then they will get angry.</p>

<p>Centuries ago they tried this in Egypt. It failed. The Muslims gradually gained the upper hand and became the majority.   The Christians who are the actual native Egyptians have been fighting for survival while being persecuted in every way imaginable. Do you have any Coptic Christian friends? I do. The reason they came here is because they used to have ideas of tolerance like you do. They paid for it when they lost control of their country. </p>

<p>Iran was gradually taken over by Muslims. </p>

<p>Lebanon used to be a Christian nation. Go talk to them about how tolerance worked out. They lost their country to Muslims. </p>

But since it&#39;s an EXTREMELY sensitive topic, and no one is really looking for help or something, we just treat it like if it was something YOU want to do. </p>

<p>Btw, gay sex is a <em>horrible</em> sin in islam. Is there a &#39;cure&#39;? I... think so. :/ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>رأيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فرج ما بين فخذي الحسين و قبل زبيبته
رواه الطبراني و إسناده حسن</p>

<p>Mohammed sucked little boy cocks. Yes he did. It&#39;s right in the Hadith. Islam is a disgusting cult. </p>

<p>Muhammad himself had killed men, women, and children when he raided villages and towns, mostly those whom he regarded as unfit for slavery, ill, elderly, disabled, etc.</p>

<p>He murdered men and male children as he considered them a future threat to him and his growing cult. Of male children, he murdered adolescents but spared only the younger boys, all those who hadn’t yet attained puberty. According to Hadiths, Muhammed had really ordered the killings of all adolescent boys and men from the raided villages and towns. None of the murdered males was ever given any chance to convert to Islam – the so-called religion of peace.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Muhammad held innumerable families as hostages and demanded ransoms for some of them. He split many families asunder when he murdered their menfolks and enslaved womenfolks and elderly people. He forced women and young girls into sex slavery – in other words, into forced prostitution. He forced the elderly people into dire labour; they toiled on until they dropped dead from exhaustion, malnutrition and dehydration.
Muhammad’s crimes against humanity are all recorded in the Hadiths.</p>

<p>Muhammad did not act as any exemplary Muslim in his own time. He was self-serving, greedy, power-hungry, lascivious, narcissistic, unprincipled, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rank left and far left on most social and economic issues, and I agree with you, and find it sickening.</p>

<p>The best way I&#39;ve found to make sense of it is that the mainstream left seems to follow a sort of hierarchy of privilege. Gay people went from Mathew Shepard and gay bashing to Will and Grace and Queer Eye and gay marriage, so, sorry, you&#39;ve got privilege now, you&#39;re mainstream, you&#39;re no longer as oppressed as you were 30 years ago. </p>

<p>But Muslims are! So they get whitewashed and details glossed over. I am still <em>absolutely disgusted</em> at how the left tried to <em>literally cover up</em> the German NYE sexual assaults. But Western women are less oppressed than Muslim refugees, so here we are. </p>

<p>It&#39;s repulsive. So one day when we have Muslim reality shows they&#39;ll be some other group that&#39;s being oppressed that hates Muslims, and we&#39;ll gloss over their hate in order to do our perverse virtue signalling for the new underdog. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the left generally demands everyone respects everyone else&#39;s human rights while in this country.  If a Muslim in this country was disrespecting gay rights, I would expect that they would be called out on this as unacceptable.  Right now they have virtually zero political power in the United States so focus is more on people who HAVE political power and are disrespecting gay rights.</p>

<p>I&#39;m under no impression that many of these Muslim countries are good places for civil rights.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also confused by the alternative to your argument.  You shouldn&#39;t be &quot;shouted down&quot; of course, but in general, are you saying that because some more fundamentalist Muslims don&#39;t respect gay rights that we shouldn&#39;t respect their rights?  This would imply that we couldn&#39;t respect Christian rights since a large portion of fundamentalist Christians don&#39;t respect gay rights either. Etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re conflating two issues. The OP is talking about human rights. All humans deserve human rights. I extended this to Americans deserving American rights because I associate &quot;the left&quot; with the U.S. (even though I know we all have leftist parties). </p>

<p>You&#39;re outraged over absolutely nothing. I think that all humans deserve human rights. I think all Americans deserve American rights. </p>

<p>No, their ideas shouldn&#39;t be protected. See my previous TWO responses. But their basic human/American rights should be. OP implies Muslims don&#39;t deserve human rights because (some) won&#39;t respect his. It&#39;s not an either/or. You can respect BOTH sets of people&#39;s human rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me this, why is the liberal left so hateful and dishonest about Christianity while constantly defending Islam and Muslims? If I went to Italy and tried to start a synagogue nothing would happen to me. Same if I went to Catholic dominated Mexico. Well, at least the Catholics wouldn&#39;t bother me. If I try that in a Muslim majority country I would be lucky to be allowed to live. Maybe live in a jail or be beat up or killed. I&#39;ve never advocated for killing Muslims or denying them their human rights. But Muslims constantly do this to other faiths. And yet, the liberal left defends them and wants unfettered immigration into the USA from these hell hole nations. It&#39;s insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/09/15/religion-and-race-among-democrats-and-republicans/">Most people on the left are Christian</a> (57%)</p>

<p>2) Those who are non-religious (me, for instance) are skeptical of all religions. But we recognize the first amendment allows us all to worship (or not worship) as we deem fit.</p>

<p>3) What the governments of Muslim-majority countries is not a concern to me, as an American, except to help those that want to escape it. Extremist Muslims hate moderate, peaceful Muslims more than they hate you or I. The ones that want to escape and live a life under a non-extremist government sometimes look to come to the United States. </p>

<p>4) No one is asking for unfettered immigration into the USA. Our vetting process takes 2 years and is more thorough than if you were getting a top secret clearance. On the other hand, the most effective thing for fixing xenophobia and fear of others is actually meeting and knowing those others. We know that people who have a gay family member are much more likely to approve of marriage equality. Those who know someone who&#39;s needed an abortion are more likely to be pro-choice. And people who have a Muslim neighbor or co-worker and can see that they are normal and maybe even boring people just trying to get through their lives are less likely to hate/fear Muslims.</p>

<p>OP isn&#39;t even referring to a conspiracy, so I&#39;m not sure why this thread is even allowed. But I can&#39;t help to answer after seeing the hysterical top-level answers. The fact that the left supports human rights for both gays and Muslims isn&#39;t hypocritical. It&#39;s consistent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muhammad himself had killed men, women, and children when he raided villages and towns, mostly those whom he regarded as unfit for slavery, ill, elderly, disabled, etc.</p>

<p>He murdered men and male children as he considered them a future threat to him and his growing cult. Of male children, he murdered adolescents but spared only the younger boys, all those who hadn’t yet attained puberty. According to Hadiths, Muhammed had really ordered the killings of all adolescent boys and men from the raided villages and towns. None of the murdered males was ever given any chance to convert to Islam – the so-called religion of peace.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Muhammad held innumerable families as hostages and demanded ransoms for some of them. He split many families asunder when he murdered their menfolks and enslaved womenfolks and elderly people. He forced women and young girls into sex slavery – in other words, into forced prostitution. He forced the elderly people into dire labour; they toiled on until they dropped dead from exhaustion, malnutrition and dehydration.
Muhammad’s crimes against humanity are all recorded in the Hadiths.</p>

<p>Muhammad did not act as any exemplary Muslim in his own time. He was self-serving, greedy, power-hungry, lascivious, narcissistic, unprincipled, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity has been a blessing to the western world. Sure, Catholicism is just hybridized extension of pagan idolatry  but in many ways Christianity led the way in human rights. So feeling the same way about Christianity and Islam also makes no sense at all. And no one is talking about taking away the human rights of Muslims. The problem is, Islam is AGAINST basic human rights. Muslims have it in their law to throw gays from the highest points they can find. Find one Christian nation that does this. And what of all the Islamic countries that deny people with an Israeli passport? We should deny all those countries access to USA in a show of solidarity with Israel. BTW, I&#39;m not Christian. Just so we don&#39;t need to go down that road.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Christianity is a religion that also makes zero sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s start with that. So, Christianity takes it&#39;s doctrines from the bible. Right? Let&#39;s be real first. The bible is a chronological history of the experience of the Israelite people and the writings of it&#39;s prophets and kings. So let&#39;s not use random excerpts as doctrine but rather focus on what the bible defines as right and wrong. </p>

<p>The Ten Commandments is a good start. Never mind the 600 other statutes and precepts that also have validity but are basic extensions of those ten core principles. And for brevity and argument&#39;s sake, lets leave off the first one which is to love God with all your heart and soul. </p>

<p>The next is to love your fellow man just like you do your own self. You have a problem with that? That makes no sense at all? </p>

<p>We&#39;ll leave off the Sabbath law because Christians can never get this right anyways. It&#39;s a long boring discussion and basically a waste of effort to discuss with most non Jewish people. </p>

<p>How about &quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot;. That makes no sense? Don&#39;t take things that belong to other people? Or that other people have worked for and sweated over and now consider theirs? Or taking someone&#39;s money at gun point? That makes no sense? To me it&#39;s the foundation of personal rights. </p>

<p>Thou shalt not murder: I know, Christians get this wrong too because they don&#39;t do Hebrew and they think it means &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;. It doesn&#39;t. And they demonstrate this by executing murderers and going to war with a gun. But that&#39;s another topic as to whether a war is unjust or not. So, the question is, are you ok with Murder. I bet you are not. So you don&#39;t think this is unreasonable and makes no sense. </p>

<p>How bout, &quot;thou shalt not covet&quot;. Covet means to want for yourself what your neighbor has rightfully worked to create. A house, a home, a boat, things he uses to live. His wife. etc. You are prohibited from allowing yourself to want what is his and more specifically, if you curtail your thoughts in that direction you will not be scheming to take it away. That goes right back to the law about loving your neighbor as yourself. You don&#39;t want someone scheming to take what you have. Do you? </p>

<p>Thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbor: Are you ok with people going to court and lying to a judge about you? Creating false charges? Does that not make sense to you? </p>

<p>It also is responsible for a ton of genocide and atrocities across the world. But, like Islam, I think its followers deserve basic human rights.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Muslims have been killing gays by the thousands. How many Christian nations have killed gays recently? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not gay but if I was, I would prefer to live in a Christian nation rather than a Muslim one. There&#39;s way more Christian nations that tolerate gays if not embrace them than there are Muslim nations. So your objection is spurious at best. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does it matter what other countries do to violate human rights? Why should that have any effect on what the West does on human rights? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one&#39;s human rights are being violated. You can&#39;t name one western country that has executed a gay. But you had to cite Uganda to support your assertions. And then you pivot right back to the Western world. You&#39;re all over the place. </p>

<p>Are you saying we should be as bad as those you would vilify? Or should we be better - a shining city on a hill as Reagan put it?</p>

<p>Tilting at windmills and making up things doesn&#39;t win an argument or prove a point. Show me where I said we should be as bad as Islamic countries? No. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(And I would never attack you for your faith, so no need for a caveat)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been attacked by my entire family for my faith. Lost jobs just for being Jewish. And yet, I still defend Christianity over Islam any day. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You left out the most questionable of the 10 commandments and you know it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I left out the most controversial ones because you obviously were raised a &quot;Christian&quot; and have been taught many things that just are not true and are basically illiterate on the topic and I don&#39;t want to spend all day educating you. </p>

<p>But, since you insist, here goes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) I am the Lord your God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not even a commandment but a statement and that&#39;s not even close to the original statement. </p>

<p>Shemot 20 Orthodox Jewish Bible (OJB)</p>

<p>20 Then Elohim spoke all these words, saying,
2 I am Hashem Eloheicha, Who brought thee out of Eretz Mitzrayim, out of the bais avadim (house of slaves).</p>

<p>And, right out of the gate you get it wrong since you took your talking points right out of Wikipedia rather than thinking and learning for yourself and looking up the original or as close to it as possible. </p>

<p>That opening verse and statement is an introduction when he tells the people who he is and that they are the ones he saved from slavery. So, if not for him they would still be back in Egypt under slavery and bondage. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-fox-on-parsha/hashems_names_and_their_meanings/">https://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-fox-on-parsha/hashems_names_and_their_meanings/</a></p>

<p>Just like when you are approached by anyone claiming authority they should explain who they are and why they are there. So it is here. So there goes your first commandment. It&#39;s not even what you think it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) No false idols 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not all of it and it&#39;s poorly translated as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Thou shalt have no elohim acherim in My presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, they were commanded to never bring false gods into his presence. It doesn&#39;t say false idols. That would be redundant. . </p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any pesel, or any temunah of any thing that is in Shomayim above, or that is in ha’aretz beneath, or that is in the mayim under ha’aretz.
5 Thou shalt not tishtacheveh to them, nor serve them;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we are still in the first commandment and it&#39;s being expanded to forbid the creation of physical gods and forbid the worship or adoration of them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>for I Hashem Eloheicha am an El kanna, visiting the avon Avot upon the Banim unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then he restates who he is and his basis for authority and punishment of visiting the sins on those that disobey. So the punishment of disregarding this command is to live under the results. Not much of a punishment if idols were actually a real thing. In other words, for those that want idols, don&#39;t ask for help from the living God. Go back to your idols. You earned it, you made it, so ask them for help. </p>

<p>6 But showing chesed unto thousands of them that love Me, and are shomer over My mitzvot.</p>

<p>And for those who listen and obey, mercy and kindness. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything crazy at all about that. You want his blessings, listen and obey. Disregard, and you are on your own and can not expect to be protected from the results of your own actions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not take the Lords name in vain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, another misconception by both Jews, Christians and secular people. </p>

<p>In all fairness though, it&#39;s easy to misunderstand. It&#39;s basically saying to not use His Name for something that is not true. Like pretending to have a message from Him or lying about what God said or instructed.   Using his name falsely. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way I think you could see this as being unreasonable is if you don&#39;t understand the word Shabbat or Kadosh. Kadosh means to single something out for a specific reason or purpose relating to spiritual matters. Shabbat is basically a day of rest. I don&#39;t know about you but I personally like the idea of a God that likes me enough to say, &quot;Hey, take a break. Do it every week. And then he reminds them that he brought them out of slavery and so they now belong to him and to give him back one day out of seven for a day of rest and reflection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, if you&#39;re going to limit Christianity&#39;s tenets to 6 lines in the Bible and disregard the crazy stuff,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Seems like you learned plenty of crazy stuff from going to church. You learned nothing but a bunch of watered down messed up preaching that taught you nothing. Sorry bout that. Not my fault. Those are the issues with Christianity. Most of the stupid stuff is not even in scriptures. It&#39;s mostly in your head. BTW, why not pick a crazy thing to argue about rather than make lame vague general accusations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why are you picking the crazy stuff from Islam? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean like Mohammed starting out as a refugee to Medina, the Jews tolerated him and let him stay and treated him kindly. IN five years he had butchered, killed, raped robbed and driven them out. Some refugee. Right? I&#39;m pretty sure Jesus didn&#39;t do that. His followers took his gospel all over the world. Got into Pagan idol worshiping slaughtering Rome and the Romans said to themselves, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could hybridize this crazy new peaceful religion and use it to increase our power? And the Holy Roman Catholic pagan inspired church was born. It took centuries of bloodshed and persecution before Martin Luther came along and pinned his refutation to the church doors for all to read. Those that could read that is. </p>

<p>Under Catholicism the people were forbidden to read a bible, owning one was cause for execution. It was after the reformation that the Protestants printed up millions of bibles and it became common knowledge. After that, sciences flourished. But you wouldn&#39;t know about that because you&#39;re so caught up with your left wing atheistic viewpoint you wish to sugar coat Islamic barbarism and demonize Christianity. You forget, the reason the Catholics forbid bible reading by the masses is that it would destroy their faked up religion and reveal it as a mass of lies and superstition. You really should read some books. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(The five pillars of Islam, by the way, sound pretty tame: recognizing Gods oneness, prayer, fasting, charity and pilgrimage).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a farce. They sound nice and pretty but those aren&#39;t commandments. Try reading and listening to what they actually teach rather than the propaganda they put out to ignorant westerners. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was raised in a Christian home and was a trained Christian apologist. I studied comparative religions in college. I am all too familiar with the crazy in Christianity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh right. You&#39;re the expert. You learned nothing. You didn&#39;t even get the scriptures right but copy pasted your bit from wikipedia. You got brainwashed. If you are going off what you were taught then you are no brighter than a muslim dupe. Might as well sign up to be a Mormon or a Four Square nut. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that&#39;s not the point. The point is that people who practice Islam are people. They deserve basic human rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then let them petition their government to get it. Not come to Western nations and demand to open the borders to unlimited immigration. They have all the rights they can ever want in their own country. It&#39;s their government. Let them change it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re arguing that they don&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you are a damn liar. You have not quoted one right that I have endorsed being taken away from a Muslim. It&#39;s Muslims that argue for taking away basic human rights. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what this boils down to. Take a step back and really consider your position. You think there are people in this world that don&#39;t deserve basic human rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are soo full of self righteous bullshit you can&#39;t even see it. Islam is all about denying basic human rights. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that is really your position, then you&#39;re too crazy to continue a discussion with. That is truly psychopathic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep. He has the answer already. The liberal left is mostly made up of people with closed minds. It&#39;s become a religion based on irrational ideology. They chant slogans like the Soviets and Chinese without giving thought. Nazis chanted slogans. Strange thing is, this time around they are more indoctrinated and thoughtless than ever before. They&#39;ve become the mindless hive mind. Their leaders tell them what to think and they all follow like lemmings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those Muslims who say : &quot; Oh no thats not true islam ; you are welcome to be whatever you want. We are the true religion of peace&quot;</p>

<p>Check this out :</p>

<p>Quran (7:80-84) - &quot;...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)&quot;</p>

<p>Quran (4:16) - &quot;If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone&quot;</p>

<p>Quran (7:81) - &quot;Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you?&quot; This verse is part of the previous text and it establishes that homosexuality as different from (and much worse than) adultery or other sexual sin. According to the Arabic grammar, homosexuality is called the worst sin, while references elsewhere describe other forms of non-marital sex as being &quot;among great sins.&quot;</p>

<p>Abu Dawud (4462) - The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, &quot;Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.&quot;.</p>

<p>al-Tirmidhi, Sunan 1:152 - [Muhammad said] &quot;Whoever is found conducting himself in the manner of the people of Lot, kill the doer and the receiver.&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;3 Religion of peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible to have a personal belief system, but not want that belief system to dictate government policy. We desperately need this principle in American politics.</p>

<p>I despise Islam, and every other organized religion, as tools of control, oppression and division. I, however, don&#39;t want to see people hurt for their personal choices. So, yes we should respect the rights of Muslims to believe Gays are criminals. We should, however, not pass laws that criminalize personal behavior, and we should treat people as equals, under the law, and protect them, even if they like things we don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about identity politics, but I want a freer and more open society and you don&#39;t get that by translating opinion, &#39;40% of western Muslims think homosexuality is immoral and should be criminalized&#39; to support for that opinion by people who don&#39;t want to see Muslims treated poorly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>religion is a brainwash and the level of brainwashing is depending if you are catholic, protestant, christian, muslim or even atheist. Science also plays a brainwashing role because people accept &quot;facts and studies&quot; presented as science no matter if they are fake or not exact. Ciulture is  made to hate people who thinks different to us and if we want to fit in the society we have to be another sheep in the herd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s answer the question regarding the left first.  The left is for equality.  When Christians stand up and say, &quot;these are our rights for religious freedom&quot;, the left says &quot;awesome, now all religions get those freedoms.&quot;  Laws put in place restrict what that religion can do to others, so we don&#39;t worry about what they think within their religion.  Regarding the right, they want to criminalize aspects of being gay.  Here&#39;s the fun that Pence has been up to in his political endeavors: <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/07/mike-pences-top-seven-homophobic-moments-many/">http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/07/mike-pences-top-seven-homophobic-moments-many/</a>.  The left would say, &quot;equality for all, regardless of their sexual orientation is what&#39;s important&quot;.  I think that focusing on the fact that muslims believe that being gay should result in criminal charges is like focusing on the KKK for wanting non-whites to go away (and by go away, I mean that they want them dead).  However, law prevents that from happening, so the KKK just talks a lot about it.  The same thing happens to muslims in America.  They don&#39;t like gays, but all they can do is talk about.  The left wants that equality to exist.  The right would rather have things be unequal for whatever doesn&#39;t fit their religious narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christians, Catholics, mormons, scientologist, all have their own brand of oppression and misogyny that I would love to see banned.  In fact,  as a left wing liberal that believes in rights for all humans, to me religion has brought more harm than good.  I see hypocrisy in all of human religions.  Just some are willing to disguise or control it better than others.  Muslims seem to be 1,000 years behind the rest of religions,  this means they need to be reformed.   In no way  shape or form are liberals in favor of seeding way to someone&#39;s beliefs over someone else&#39;s rights and freedoms.  You are making a false argument leading to a conclusion you accepted as fact before you did some real introspection.   How you would want to be treated if you were of Muslim faith and that is how you grew up and all that you have ever known.  Reform is needed.  Not a nuclear war to wipe the Middle East which is the preferred solution of the current White House.  </p>

Using culture as weaponry to divide people and to manufacture a false cause for police-state buildup through right-wing terror, which I define as corporate terror against civilian populations emanating from the military-intelligence arm of the State.  (if left-wing terrorism is primarily anti-business and what is called &#39;eco terror&#39; but isn&#39;t  (it&#39;s actually anti-ecoterrorism, like for example monkeywrenching/sabotaging equipment for mining operations))</p>

Religion is like a gun...are you going to use it to protect people or attack people?  Anyways, I&#39;m rambling, back to my point, yes, Muslim countries would oppress us, but the people who come to this country probably aren&#39;t here to...they&#39;re working, going to school, and (as a person who has lived abroad) are probably open to the culture they&#39;re visiting. What if other countries blocked us from visiting because we&#39;re ruled by oppressive fundamentalist Christians?  I&#39;m not defending the Muslim faith, or any faith for that matter; I see homophobia as one of the more troubling issues our society faces, but blocking entry to our country without notice to people entering our country legally is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I can explain this one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m (Western) European, we&#39;ve seen and felt the presence of Islamic migration very clearly and they&#39;ve protruded every aspect of our society, on a political and religious level (which is one and the same for them), within our city streets (shops and eatery&#39;s, never supplying Western products, always drapes for women and Kebab-like food), and on a cultural level (markets, religious holidays etc.)
Now you&#39;d think them being present within a country on these levels sounds good, they must assimilate quite rapidly...<strong>Except they&#39;re not. Not at all. Not even a little.</strong>
Their markets are by and for their own, their cafes are more like local hangout places for the cultural homogenous (aka muslims), their holiday celebrations are not inclusive, they don&#39;t socialize with people with other cultural backgrounds and If they do, they&#39;ll only do so within their paradigm (you better not be gay, against religion, against open borders, feminist etc.), their political agenda is solely based on defending their in-group preferences (Open borders, anti-Jew, mandatory Halal food in schools and business etc.)  Besides all these things, they&#39;re, on average, pretty low IQ people, which combining with their terrible religious moral compass, results in ignorant and aggressive behavior. 
The US doesn&#39;t experience these problems on this scale. You&#39;ve only felt the presence of Christian religious fanaticism, let me tell you, there&#39;s no comparison. A fundamental, deeply religious Christian is the equivalent of a normal, &quot;moderate&quot; muslim. A fundamental Muslim is just a straight up psychopath to Western standards.</p>

<p><strong>So why did modern feminism side with Islam, especially in the US?</strong> So, like I said, the first reason is these feminists have no actual idea how Islamic culture manifests Itself within society. Just like how leftist politicians in favor of non-Western migration in my country, never actually lived in the impoverished neighborhoods where the muslims wreak havoc. They&#39;re only propagating a gratuitous moral high ground based on utopian ideas. And the actual people suffer.</p>

<p>Second It&#39;s the visceral need for the &quot;us versus them&quot; sentiment. In the US &quot;Them&quot; is the Right wing. The same right wing who has protested Islam the loudest the past couple decades. The biggest &quot;Fuck You&quot; they can throw at the Right is embracing what they hate most. &quot;Look at how liberal we are, we even embrace what you hate, and what hates us as women and feminists&quot;. It&#39;s a moral arms race, they don&#39;t care about actual morality, truth, realism or context. They&#39;ve totally lost themselves in their pathetic little race of who can be the most liberal. It&#39;s like driving as fast as you can on a highway and missing your actual exit.
I&#39;ve seen this behavior in myself actually. I wasn&#39;t for Trump, but very much against Hillary, I hated everything she stands for, I hated the way she used identity politics and sexism in her favor, the way she presented herself as a caring woman while actually being one of the coldest, opportunistic and most calculated career politicians in recent history. I hated everything about her, and It was the first time I didn&#39;t side with a Democrat, although I was pretty much indifferent towards Obama, for the same way he used Identity politics to sway the US.
Throughout the campaigns I started to be more and more in favor of Trump, which would&#39;ve never happened If there was any other candidate running against him. I started to hope he&#39;d win, although I deeply dislike religion (Pence and his other backers). I rooted for someone I would&#39;ve never rooted for in any other situation but this.
I think this Is what happened to modern feminists in the US, they&#39;re so full of hatred they&#39;re willing to accept a Trojan Horse as their ally. because If you&#39;re against them, then you&#39;re with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree with the whole last paragraph. Because I lack the same experiences as you with muslims, I have to ask: Is the problem that they don&#39;t assimilate completely, or is it really that their lifestyle is that incompatible with Western culture?</p>

<p>For example, in America there are many cities that have China town, or a portion of town that is highly concentrated with one ethnic group, and it hasn&#39;t seemed to cause too many problems. My experience is with mini Mexican/Spanish speaking communities. They all speak very little english, have their own shops that sell tortillas &amp; tacos, mostly keeping to their selves. Doesn&#39;t bother me even a little and their generally very friendly despite the language barrier. This is America to me. The blending of all the cultures of the world within the western framework of constitutional democracy. Is it so bad that an outside culture needs some time to find their place? I know if I went to China or even England I would seek out the American bars and locations because it&#39;s what I know. </p>

<p>That being said, do you feel this way about all cultures that don&#39;t fully assimilate, or are Muslim communities really that much different? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points and questions, thank you.</p>

<p>Let me clarify some things and give a little context. (Sorry, long text incoming, it&#39;s an important subject so I wanted to be thorough)</p>

<p>First, (Western) Europe doesn&#39;t have the same historical context the US does, we&#39;re not (mostly) built from diversity and are historically pretty ethnically homogenous. The American &#39;Melting Pot&#39; is not an actual thing here, we did however, starting from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, invite guest workers from North Africa and Turkey which was a catalyst for what we call &#39;multiculturalism&#39;.</p>

<p>The first problem is the false premise upon which these workers came here. In my country we invited about 20,000 workers, the thought was these workers would stay here for some years, maybe even decades, making more than they could ever make in their homeland, and eventually go back to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
Except, they never went back. Due to our careless lack of political preparations, we never adjusted our policies, resulting in a climate where people could come here, stay here, bring their families and use our social benefits.
20,000 quickly became 40,000, 40,000 quickly became 100,000 and 20 years later we were at almost a million. Problem is, we never wanted 40,000 let alone a million. Crippled by leftist policies originating from post WW2, we couldn&#39;t do anything about this influx of guest &#39;workers&#39;, except they weren&#39;t workers. The first 20,000 were workers, the rest of these immigrants got the news that our country was giving away free money, free healthcare, free social benefits, personal freedom and freedom of religion (aka no need to adjust or conform to local culture).
The problem here is incentive. American Mexicans go to America because there&#39;s more opportunity for them to work, Muslim immigrants came here because there&#39;s more opportunity to <strong>not work</strong>.</p>

<p>Second, speaking for my own country but It applies to lots of European countries, the segregated cultural silo-effect is somewhat present here, but don&#39;t have a similar effect because our countries and cities are a lot smaller.
We do have neighborhoods that are predominantly muslim, although not nearly as dense and homogenous as US Chinatowns and little Italys, but because it&#39;s all so close to each other here, there&#39;s no actual isolation. They go to our schools (although the past years there&#39;s more of a trend amongst muslims to send their children to Islamic-centred schools, facilitating a bigger gap in language and culture), walk around our neighborhoods, go out in our clubs etc. Their Mosques are scattered throughout our cities, and there&#39;s Kebab places everywhere. This Isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, wasn&#39;t it that they cause a lot of annoyance. They use/deal drugs, are aggressive towards people (you can&#39;t look them in the eyes without being scoffed at), leave a mess everywhere they go and drive like our city streets are Nascar tracks making It impossible for kids to play on the streets like i used to when I was a child.</p>

<p>Regarding your last question, the problem with muslims in particular is the incentive on which they came here. The incentive was clearly money and It shows through their actions. They don&#39;t like It here, they don&#39;t like us and they don&#39;t like our value system. And that&#39;s causing a lot of friction. Their children embrace these sentiments from their parents resulting in generations with a disdain for this country and It&#39;s citizens, the only thing they care about is getting rich. But because they generally score low in education, there&#39;s a problem where their culture requires respect quantified by income and no intellectual means to acquire this money legally. resulting in lots of crime. 2.5 percent of muslims are responsible for 40 percent of our crime rate.</p>

<p>The religious aspect is a big one, even our smartest members of the non-Western community remain muslim (which I find baffling), and they refuse to live by, or even try to understand the values of a secular enlightened society. I&#39;m pretty well versed (pun) in Islam and It encourages a very sneaky and hypocritical behavior very typical of muslims, it&#39;s all incredibly shallow and morally vapid. Actual moral and intellectual inquiry just Isn&#39;t a thing within their culture.
Plus, probably because of an inferiority complex combined with a religious paradigm, they evolved a kind of God-complex where they think they&#39;re better than us, with better morals (funny, because of their crime rates) and a more meaningful understanding of life.</p>

<p>A great example of this hypocrisy is what I experienced with a muslim friend in my teens (I used to hang out a lot with Arabic and Turkish people back then, giving me lots of insight on the way they think and act). He was from Lebanon. Always bragging about It being the best place, with the best universities of the world. best food, best culture etc. (It&#39;s a thing all Muslims here do regarding their home country). One day he said to me us Westerners are cheap and greedy and If you stay with his family you can always stay for dinner, something that allegedly doesn&#39;t happen in Western culture because we&#39;re selfish and frugal. later on I found out he was receiving a scholarship he didn&#39;t earn (you get money from the government when you&#39;re studying and not living with your parents) because he pretended to live with his brother while living at home and his parents both received medical benefits that they shouldn’t have gotten for over 20 years. They lived off our benefits without actually being sick or not fit to work.
It&#39;s easy to feed guests with money our society gives you for free. And I&#39;ve got tons of stories like this one.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel this way about every culture at all, It&#39;s just the toxic combination of wrong incentives and religious and cultural friction with the host country that makes this a particularly bad situation. I don’t share your sentiment where you would pick out American bars when living abroad. if I would migrate to America, my children would get American names, American schooling, American values. It’s the best thing for them, to not cripple them within the society I brought them to (whereas muslims always give their children a muslim name, mohamed Is one of the most frequently given names in my country by national statistics). Why would I visit European bars? I left for a reason. Maybe a couple times a year for special occasions or the European/WorldCup, but not solely like European muslims do. I just don’t understand why they want to mimic the grave environment they left in the first place.</p>

<p>I welcome everyone that actually wants to be here with open arms, people that come here, not because of benefits, but because It&#39;s a beautiful place with opportunities and freedom. Not just to abuse and stretch our freedoms to Its breaking point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like your personal experiences have your shaped your core opinions of all Muslims. There are plenty of Muslims who&#39;ve assimilated into western society, who don&#39;t have a &quot;low IQ&quot;, &quot;God-complex&quot; or any other negative label you&#39;ve branded them with. Granted that they&#39;re mostly second/third generation Muslims, but they&#39;re definitely there - and I&#39;ve personally met numerous first generation immigrants who are fantastic human beings first and foremost, ones who are involved in charity work to be precise. And I&#39;ve also seen ignorant imbeciles and benefit fraudsters from all walks of life, why do you seem so insistent that this is a Muslim only problem? I really think your own negative experiences have made you bitter and prejudiced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your thoughts. Like I&#39;ve said above, I knew lots of muslims, from the whole spectrum and all walks of life. From only culturally muslim to fundamentalists. My experiences with muslims are completely in tandem with the statistics, and the statistics are absolutely abhorrent. Remember, I&#39;m talking about specifics here, I&#39;m not saying muslims worldwide are low IQ, violent or bad people at all (kind of low hanging fruit to be pointing that out tbh) . What I am saying is the muslims that came to my country are disproportionately violent, criminal, badly assimilated and have low educational levels. Those are facts and backed by our independent  national statistics bureaus. Besides the statistics, I&#39;ve experienced this behavior very, very closely, so I can also confirm this on a personal level (not the other way around). I&#39;ve seen a huge amount commit fraud, I knew muslims working in our police force that tipped off drug cartels, I&#39;ve been to their homes and met their families, I know about their culture, how status and shame are interwoven within their culture and thus their actions. And these were not your typical thuggish, low level dudes. These were generally decently raised low-middle class second and third generation kids.
Another fact is we have a lot of immigrants from Berber (a Moroccan region), Morocco has an average IQ of 84 and Berbers score even lower. My country has an average IQ of 100. Now, telling me you&#39;ve met a muslim with a high IQ and therefore my arguments are invalid is misleading at best. I&#39;m not talking about muslims, I&#39;m talking about a very large part (again, not all, but a disproportinately large amount) of the Muslims that came to my country, generally with the wrong incentives and from specific areas. The religious aspect Is just another variable that further complicates the problems of how they manifest within our society and, but this is somewhat of an assumption, is one of the main reasons they have a hard time connecting with the country and Its customs even throughout multiple generations.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met great, smart and generous muslims, really nice people. From first to third generation. But even then, I&#39;m always surprised to hear their view on democracy, secularism and equality. I can count the muslims I&#39;ve talked to that really, really embrace our value system on one hand and I would still have fingers left to pick up a drink. Which is expected because you can&#39;t be muslim and feel democracy is the best solution to govern, or think being gay is admirable. It’s just not part of the set of ideas they adhere to.</p>

<p>I think you’re conflating hurtful facts with being bitter. But let me assure you, I’m very much aware of my confirmation bias and I try to see the good, It’s just not happening an awful lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the honest responses. I&#39;m sure other people would see this and just call &quot;racist&quot; like the first response was kind of alluding to. But this is a different case, it involves a set of cultural values that can be vastly different at times, and I guess you answered my question here, values that directly conflict with the ideals of your home country. I do think it&#39;s fair to say that what you&#39;re talking about is the type of people that sought to migrate to your country, and what their motivations were. Open borders and generous social benefits tend to encourage these behaviors which is certainly the reason people reject it as policy. Being a white American, I try to resist painting people with a broad brush, but it doesn&#39;t invalidate your experience at all. It&#39;s just hard to say on the one hand, &quot;America accepts all ways of life&quot;, and on the other hand, &quot;except this one&quot;. Another issue for America is that most of the people seeking to immigrate are doing it for two reasons: increased opportunities to study or gain skills, or because we just bombed the piss out of their country that is now in shambles. It is very difficult to reconcile American values of personal liberty, inclusion, and self-determination while simultaneously maintaining the most aggressive foreign policy in modern history. Definitely something worth deeper consideration here, and you definitely had one of the most honest accounts I&#39;ve seen. Interesting times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So either you clearly didn&#39;t read what I wrote, or you got instantly triggered by the word &#39;muslim&#39; and got in defence mode, because your reaction Isn&#39;t relevant to what I said even in the slightest.</p>

<p>First of, I clearly stated I met lots and lots of muslims, and not on a superficial level either.</p>

<p>Second, because you didn&#39;t actually read what I said, you completely missed the context of my message. I&#39;m not talking about muslims in America or even worldwide, I&#39;m talking about the specific muslims that migrated to my country based on dishonest incentives from specific regions. And yes, the religious element is undeniably a large part of their inability to integrate. And yes, It’s more than “a few sketchy muslims” as per our statistics.</p>

<p>Third, the muslims that migrated to America are, just like the muslims who migrated to Western Europe, not exactly a representable average of the entire muslim population. They&#39;re both on opposite sides of the spectrum. There&#39;s lots of data to back that claim up.</p>

<p>Lastly, I don&#39;t understand why muslims keep telling people to not generalize them as muslims. Islam is a fixed set of ideas, in my opinion, horrible ideas. Of course I&#39;m going to generalize people that adhere to the same set of bad ideas, just like I&#39;m going to generalize every person who thinks raping children is fine, or murder should be legalized.
Then you throw the 1.6 Billion number out there as an argument, except, It&#39;s not an argument. because bad ideas don&#39;t become good ideas the more people adhere to them. At one point almost everyone believed the earth was flat and dancing could evoke rain.
Besides that, the European numbers on Islamic fundamentalism are shocking with more than half stating that being gay should be illegal and Sharia should be our system of law. That&#39;s not &quot;a few sketchy muslims&quot;. And even so, 5-7 percent of all muslims worldwide are actively participating in some form of Jihad, that&#39;s somewhere between 75 and 100 Million muslims. Not &quot;a few&quot; either.</p>

<p>Congrats on being a great, smart and valuable asset to your society, but that doesn’t illegitimate the reality of my statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he writes is painfully accurate. You&#39;re not from western Europe, are you? A friend of mine teaches latin on one of the best schools in the country. There are Muslim kids as well who are the intellectual forefront as it is one of the best schools. He had to be invited to history lessons because the kids would deny everything about Israel, Holocaust and at the same time only accepted Islam doctrine. He was invited to teach how ancient texts are being passed on and do not form a reliable single truth. I should ask him if it had effect. I hoped the kids learned some critical thinking.</p>

<p>I too have met friendly Muslims and worked with them. The amount of people that are completely insane is just to damm big. But it&#39;s not a surprise. Western Europe imported people who where antisocial in their own country and allowed them to form a layer of population in the lowest regions. Don&#39;t know the proper English words for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t be thought police. People are allowed to <em>believe</em> what they will in a free society. 40% of western muslims may believe being gay should be criminalized, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that 40% of western muslims would resort to violence (or even political activism) to achieve this goal. If western muslims actively try to limit human rights to the LGBT community, I will stand against them just like I stand against western christians who try to do the same.</p>

<p>Also, beliefs change over time. If we allow people to come to our nations and let them experience for themselves that gay people are just people like everyone else, then we can change minds. Banning people from entering our societies because of what they already believe is counter productive to globally improving human rights for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you argue against a cause that is essentially fighting for completely open borders... I don&#39;t support the ban for people on student visas and things but 100 percent any illegal should be deported, there&#39;s no middle ground. They are taking a spot of someone trying to go through legal channels to immigrate and I have 0 sympathy. We should be taking in 0 refugees, especially Muslims. There has been nothing but negatives from accepting refugees in any country that they have and it&#39;s the same thing I argue with people who want open borders. We don&#39;t have an obligation to take in refugees and should not be, they will not accept how we treat women and other groups fairly. That&#39;s not some guess, look at all the countries taking on refugees. Constant issues of gang rapes and murders and it just creates slums. Everyone doesn&#39;t have some universal right to be propped up for their entire life. I feel lucky to be born in the US and sure I have empathy for those people who weren&#39;t but also they need to realize if you are being taken in by another country you need to accept their norms and people. Muslim refugees have overwhelmingly proved to be the opposite of that, ask Sweden how they are doing with refugees. Honestly I find it ironic that there are any women protesting this Muslim ban at all... you can directly tie rises in rape statistics to refugees... Agree or don&#39;t, I couldn&#39;t care less. You can care about people and not be blind to the ramifications of actually helping those that don&#39;t want to be helped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I am pro or against any of the following arguments, but here are some that I can think of that people may be thinking in some combination or other:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even if they show prejudice, us being prejudice against them isn&#39;t right. The reality is that most Muslims are born into and conditioned into their beliefs. Demonizing their entire culture doesn&#39;t solve a thing. There are over a billion of them and they are increasing (compared to other populations). They aren&#39;t going anywhere. Engaging your opposition is the only way.</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing any room for prejudice is a slippery slope. MLK said it his way. We have all pretty much heard the &quot;they came for...and there was no one left&quot; quote from the 1930s (I&#39;m too lazy to look it up). Even if Muslim beliefs are determined to be wrong, we know that the majority of people that hate Muslims are doing it out of prejudice.</p></li>
<li><p>A very large percentage of non-Muslims still don&#39;t respect gay rights. I also believe a very large number on non-Black Americans are prejudice against African Americans. I see it around me every single day. The difference is that American culture is primarily pro-business and we have learned to be more careful about how we reveal our personal opinions to others. I see bigots around me daily. I am a minority, but due to chance, I look pretty white bread and have zero accent. It is amazing the things people will say and do around me before they figure out my name is not English. So, the point here is that I believe we are close to being just as bad here in the USA, but we simply hide it better. That means the difference is just presentation. Muslims are simply more frank about their prejudices. Perhaps then singling them out as particularly anti-gay is not beneficial to us because it may be simply be a case of us trying to make ourselves feel better about ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite all the things that Muslims do and say that is wrong, if we were honest about it, we know that the majority of people in the USA that have a problem with Muslims are bigots. Many people that don&#39;t want Muslim culture to become part of the USA are not bigots. But the reality is that most of the anti-Muslim talk comes from bigots. These same bigots are easily bigots against other groups at different times under different situations. We really don&#39;t want to align ourselves with or give any strength or validity to these bigots. There is a quote whose source I don&#39;t know, but it says something like &quot;the best lies are 90% true&quot;. A bigot may say something that looks like truth at a particular time and place. But allowing the bigot&#39;s statement to stand give legitimacy to the bigot, which then will turn around and their future or other bigotry.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I used have this same belief. Now I&#39;ve changed. You don&#39;t have to agree with me, but here&#39;s what changed my mind.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between having a belief and being able to enact that belief as a matter of public policy. Similarly, there&#39;s a difference between discouraging a belief as a culture, and enacting laws and policies to hurt people who have a belief. </p>

<p>No one in America with any political clout is advocating allowing for Islamic religious beliefs about homosexuality to be imposed on American citizens. However, there are people in America calling for us to not allow people with Islamic beliefs to escape physical danger and persecution by entering our country as refugees. </p>

<p>I will protest and vehemently oppose any new law that hurts gay people because of any religious belief. Similarly, I am against laws and policies that put muslim <em>people</em> in danger because our society doesn&#39;t agree with their beliefs. American culture is so perfectly designed to allow for diversity of belief and assimilation (I&#39;m not sure that Europe shares this trait, so if you&#39;re European, my opinions on Islamic immigration are slightly different). For example, in the last poll I&#39;ve seen, muslims in the US are more likely than Evangelicals to support gay marriage being legal. </p>

<p>I believe that we should accept Muslims into our country as we would any other migrant or refugee. This is an entirely different thing from changing our laws and culture to be more like Islamic culture, which I  would oppose as loudly as anyone. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the key to it. The left, despite everyone claiming they&#39;re obsessed with identity politics, judges people as individuals. They&#39;re not willing to hate an entire religious comprising 1/6th of the world&#39;s population because 40% of them according to one poll want to criminalize being gay.  I can guarantee you that 50 years ago the number of Christians supporting that would be much higher than that, and the left <em>with the help of some Christians</em> dragged the shitty ones kicking and screaming to basic tolerance.</p>

<p>You have to ask yourself how to ease homophobia out of the Muslim community. Either:</p>

<p>A) You follow the model the left did to get regressive Christians to do the same. Fight regressive Christianity while doing your best not to alienate progressive Christians.</p>

<p>B) You commit to the idea that <strong>all</strong> Muslims are irredeemable because of that 40% and marginalize/oppress/exterminate them</p>

<p>What sounds better to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>firstly: you are making one of the most fundamental errors that everyone who is not familiar with islam makes.  there are no moderate muslims because islam cannot be practiced in moderation.  muslims do not have a choice as to what parts of their religion they can follow and what they can ignore.  muslims must follow 100% of islam.  the muslims who don&#39;t are doing so not because they are moderate but because they need to establish themselves.  they have an exception in the koran called taqiyaa which allows them to lie about their beliefs.</p>

<p>secondly: you have to understand that the leftists/feminists are mere fronts for islam now.  they are tasked with creating maximum unrest, dissent and disruptions.  you can see that not a single one of these feminists is taking up the cause of freedom for muslim women.  on the contrary you have muslim women who wear hijab and support sharia now leading most of these womens movements.  the left does not care about equality or workers anymore.  their only job is to weaken law and order and increase immigration as much as possible so that muslims can be moved into electoral districts and start voting for muslims.</p>

<p>finally:  the right wing is the place to be.  ask milo.  he knows what he is talking about.</p>

<p>If you think Saudi Arabia or Iran follows the correct Sharia, you&#39;re certainly wrong. Both of them using religion as to control middle east and mainly for political reasons. </p>

<p>In Islam, a person being gay isn&#39;t a Sin and isn&#39;t punishable at all. In fact, homosexuality is considered to be a test by God and one who controls his desires will be successful. As you might know, adultery is punishable in Islam and only applies to Muslims, not non Muslims who don&#39;t follow Islam. According to Islamic traditions, gay marriage isn&#39;t possible therefore homosexual sex is punishable for Adultery(lashes) and applies only to Muslims and to non Muslims if they do it publicly. I think that&#39;ll explanation the polls.</p>

I dont care if we allow in +1 Million muslims who need protection.  My ONLY criteria is that we ask them if they: 
1. support genital mutilation for women (+75% of muslim countries support this practice)
2. Believe that gays/lesbians should be imprisoned or killed
3. Believe sharia law is a good thing
Non-assimilation into the greatest country in the history of the world is not something we can take for granted.  If we let you in, and pay your healthcare/rent/etc, you need to respect the values that we have had since our inception.

I, myself, am not religious but when you start to hate a group of poeple because it said to in a book thats when we have a problem. People are brainwashed. They dont realize how old that book is and if you think about it, it was written more as to be seen figuritively. People pick and choose things they want from the bible without analyzing the big picture. Its mostly the older generation. Us, as the new generation, will get over racism and gender soon enough and focus on advancing as the human race. At least I hope this can be started. This is just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This right here is my problem with citizens aligning their political affiliation with their religious views. In my humble opinion, it&#39;s why I feel the GOP is REALLY irresponsible for building their platform on pro-life, prayer in school, anti-homosexual, etc values. When I ask someone why they vote Republican, and they say one of those values, and I inquire as to why, and they say because those things are against their religion, it frustrates me. I try reasoning with them and saying that there should be a separation of church and state, civil rights shouldn&#39;t involve religion beliefs but nothing makes sense to them. I&#39;ve even tried saying things like, &quot;Let&#39;s pretend this country was founded by Muslims, or the majority of the country was homosexual, would you feel ok being straight or a Christian and being chastised for it? Not only chastised, but treated like a lesser human being?&quot; To which their only reply is, &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like that&quot;. What the fuck? How is that an argument? The BEST thing the GOP ever did for themselves is tricking the masses that they somehow give a flying fuck about their religious values. This behavior and thought process has really affected my own personal views as a Christian and even swayed me from once being a fiscally conservative person to a very liberal minded individual. I just can&#39;t look past the ignorance. I still consider myself a Christian, but not at the detriment to another person&#39;s civil rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad someone is saying something. I find it ironic that these American SJW and feminists and shit are supporting muslims, but the very religion that they believe is anti-woman and anti-gay, I mean Jesus fucking Christ, this religion is fucking barbaric. And yes, Christianity is anti-gay too, while there are pro-gay Christians, except even that defies the laws of the Bible. This is why all religions are fucking stupid. You can&#39;t pick and choose what you want to believe. The Quran literally says that non-believers should be killed. Sorry for the rant. I believe everyone should have equal rights, and I believe in freedom of religion, but fuck off with barbaric murderous religion at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically there has been a lot of homophobia in the black community, for instance, but this is becoming much significant now as black people are becoming more educated and gaining better access to information, and our more inclusive society is becoming more open towards black and gay people. I think it would have been unfortunate if not morally wrong to attack black people in general for being homophobic or to say it&#39;s hypocritical to defend black human rights when so many of them are homophobic. </p>

<p>I think that unless we have an inclusive society and don&#39;t target people or discriminate against them based on their beliefs, then we can&#39;t expect them to change or listen to us. If we&#39;re attacking Islam and treating them as dangerous then we can&#39;t have an open and productive dialogue; we&#39;re enemies, and people don&#39;t listen to their enemies or people they feel threatened by.</p>

It&#39;s all about the people under its wing who are brought up in a way that they won&#39;t listen to reason and try to think about humanity for a second and terrorize in the name of justice ( they think they&#39;re right up to they&#39;re religion , though it&#39;s inhuman). It&#39;s not their fault , it&#39;s the fault of their upbringing. No one can blame them , but they&#39;re hostile to other humans. So it&#39;s bad for some people.

What makes Muslims so much worse?</p>

<p>More importantly in that pew article there is clear proof that <em>all</em> us denominations have become more accepting of homosexuality, which fits in with nationwide trends. I don&#39;t think Muslims are so special that they won&#39;t also grow more tolerant on average on living here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about protecting ones rights to be hateful. Actually it&#39;s about the opposite. It&#39;s saying if we want the right to have someone stand up for the respect of our lives, we better be ready to do that for other citizens. </p>

<p>More importantly, it&#39;s about not causing race wars and creating a panic and phobia towards an entire group of people. </p>

<p>The Christian religion also disapproves lgbt and we have Pence as prime example of a dangerous threat. But we protect Christians right to religion and don&#39;t place a religious ban on them in a country where we practice freedom of religion. We have the ability to say, there are some toxic Christians but many want to live their lives like you or me. </p>

<p>The fact is most people these days, regardless of their religion, are not dangerously anti gay, and when they are, we speak out. We fight for our freedom and we tell people we are not here to cause harm, and we won&#39;t stand for bull shit either. Not here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty simple. The left is against banning homosexuality and against banning Islam. Some Muslims, like some Jews, Christians, or even Atheists, are for banning homosexuality. The Liberal point of view is that the answer to &quot;is X allowed?&quot; should always be &quot;yes&quot;, unless there&#39;s a very good reason not to allow it, and as long as you&#39;re not restricting other people by allowing X. So according to the left, people should be free to practice Islam or homosexuality or whatever else they want.</p>

<p>Muslims who want to ban homosexuality should be dealt with by the same way Christians who want to ban homosexuality should be dealt with - ignored, unless they&#39;re violent, and then jailed. Democracy is about having different populations with conflicting views living together successfully.</p>

<p>My view is that trying to solve the problem of one in a million being violent by treating all Muslims as potential terrorists can only worsen the situation. Not only will it will create most extremism with Muslim society, it will also make the country less free and open-minded, inhibiting the gradual process of moderation throughout society, Muslim or otherwise. The Western society has come a long way with its views towards gay people, and it wasn&#39;t done by counting on a very anti-gay vice president to select who&#39;s allowed in and who isn&#39;t, but instead by working on acceptance as a value in society - which most Trump supporters see as a negative thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re being shouted down. On the Internet, usually the person with the most radical opinions will be heard the loudest. I wish the left would be able to acknowledge in a more pronounced way where the right-wing opinion is not wrong, and that mostly the left is trying to solve the same problems in different ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, they are. And there are two main components of it in my mind.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Multiculturalism is inherently postmodernist. By saying that every thought and belief has the same value, we&#39;re also saying that they have no value. This is a dangerous belief because there are cultures where child rape or genital mutilation are okay. Those aren&#39;t okay to me and most people would agree. People seem to have forgotten that your rights end where mine begin and that applies to everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Identity politics and the pity party. You are a marginalized person, being gay. But a Muslim person just had his house blown up. They&#39;re going through a harder time so their culture is given a lot more free passes than you. Even if that includes hate crimes against gay people or women or whatever.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Where we once had a country of people mixing cultures, we now have barriers around cultures. Until gay people are higher on the pity scale, society will say it&#39;s okay for Muslims to hate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The democrats believe the best way to build acceptance is through integration.  As mentioned earlier, when another commenter who visited Malaysia was outed, the muslims in the area saw that gays were not the devils they were told to fear and accepted him.  It&#39;s easy to be told by IS that gays are the bane of existence and they should all die.  But once you live with them and have a couple as friends, they see you as just another person and you see them as just another person.</p>

<p>As for the fear element, there hasn&#39;t been a single hate crime committed by a refugee in America by a Muslim refugee.  There have been dozens of anti gay hate crimes committed by citizens.  Why would people who risked their lives (and their family&#39;s livres) to flee religious oppression throw that all away in the name of religious oppression?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gay marriage was illegal in the US until a couple of years ago. Not even ten. I find it funny how people right away turned towards other countries to insult them, flaunting their progressive values of acceptance. It&#39;s like if we&#39;re doing it, it&#39;s okay, but if we&#39;re not than you&#39;re a barbarian stuck in the past for doing something we don&#39;t. Not saying I agree with it-- I certainly don&#39;t. But this has less to do with standing up for values than it does ostrasizing people who are different. America is still full of people against gay marriage, in fact there are rumors the current administration is about to roll out some anti-lgbt legislation and here we are talking about a hypothetical Muslim these based on polls. When it comes to the election, the polls were all wrong, but when it comes to Muslims clearly the polls are 100% accurate and representative of reality </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what they want, it&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

<p>What is going to happen by demonising Islam is an idea of the clash of civilizations... or rather a continuation of this idea - as it began with the Bush administration&#39;s neo-conservative, neo-straussian idealism.</p>

<p>In brief the idea that in order to create a cohesive society, you need an outside enemy to fight.</p>

<p>They are setting up Islam as that enemy, and the victims of this policy are reacting in kind, because who wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What you are saying, may or may not be true - that 40% wants to criminalize homosexuality, but it doesn&#39;t matter because it will NEVER happen in the west. It may happen in their home countries, but fuck them, who cares what happens in their home countries at their own hand, as long as we aren&#39;t responsible they can suffer for their own idiocy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing you can do about people&#39;s opinions here, be they religious or secular, other than to use the tools provided in this free nation, freedom of speech. Anything else is an a front to their religious freedom. You can turn around and say &quot;They are infringing my freedom to be gay!&quot; but quite frankly they aren&#39;t. They have opinions, but they are opinions that will NEVER be implemented in this society because its an anathema to what we stand for. It isn&#39;t illegal to want homosexuality to be illegal. It isn&#39;t illegal to hate homosexuals, homosexuality or religion or religious people. It is illegal to act in a violent manner on that hatred and you can use whatever influence you have to try and make those things legal... but its never going to happen - because it runs contrary to the very foundations of what this nation stands for. </p>

<p>There is the increasing dangerous trend in the conspiracy community of anti-islamism. Falling right into the hands of the very plans those we deem &quot;the powers that be&quot; wanted us to act on 15 years ago. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all fear. Its all hyperboly. You wanna know why there is a global jihad? You wanna know why there is an Islamic threat where there wasnt before? </p>

<p>Its our actions.</p>

<p>Go look at a list of terror attacks in Wikipedia and see the frequency spike to ludicrous levels AFTER our occupation of Iraq began. Look at testimony from top intelligence members in the UK and US including members of parliament in the UK - Al-Qaeda didn&#39;t exist. It was a phantom created out of thin air for us to fight and we actually created an enemy with the terrible things we&#39;ve done in the name of fighting this phantom. Torture, holding people without trial, mass murder, indiscriminate killings, funding lunatics, sparking sectarian conflict.</p>

<p>Its no different than every time I hear someone talk about the dangers of Sharia law in the west. THERE IS NO FUCKING DANGER. The only real danger is the panic fomented by hyperbolic morons who I honestly believe want to see a conflict.</p>

<p>You are gay. You are free to be gay and people are free to hate your homosexuality and free to hate you for it. As long as they don&#39;t threaten you or hurt you physically - its all gravy. It may not be the best tasting gravy, but its edible and we all get to eat it.</p>

<p>You wanna change their minds? Use the tools this nation provides you to change their minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re attributing a characteristic from some people (muslims who demand their rights), applying it to all (all muslims), and then mixing in different ones (call them more extreme muslims) but still attributing them all to be the same. </p>

<p>Put differently: the ones demanding basic human rights are not likely the same ones demanding fewer rights for gays. There might be some overlap but I think these are a very small minority (but also the most discussed because we love to point out hypocrites and make an example). </p>

<p>Put yet another way: they don&#39;t all think the same anymore than you think the same as Joe-Bob in Alabama or Tim from the accounting department. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve entered strange times. The name of the game is guilt and temper tantrums. Honestly in this situation you could use Muslim interchangeably with any minority group,  and the narrative stays the same.  I&#39;m gonna throw a tantrum because you won&#39;t respect me,  and because you don&#39;t agree,  your opinion isn&#39;t valid. I don&#39;t know that the way we&#39;re treating the Muslims is really OK,  either,  but I&#39;m fundamentally unable to understand racism. It really doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I feel the same about all isms,  really. This is just the current hot button. Also, fearing the I influx of refugees doesn&#39;t make you racist. It&#39;s human nature to be afraid of what we don&#39;t know. Im just afraid we&#39;re going to have another manzanar if we don&#39;t pump the breaks a bit. That can&#39;t happen. That would effectively make us the modern equivalent of nazi Germany. But the fear is what keeps us docile. </p>

<p>I appreciate that you mentioned being gay.  I feel like the gay community is under fire from almost every direction right now . This rise in trans activism is, somewhat surprisingly,  rather exclusive of the gay community. It&#39;s as if it&#39;s no longer in Vogue to know yourself. I especially feel for the lesbian community. Where I&#39;m from,  there&#39;s no such thing as a lesbian with a penis. Yet the charge is being led by an xy &quot;lesbian&quot; with a penis. We have so many distractions right now, and I feel as though that is being leveraged by anybody with the presence of mind to notice. </p>

<p>Somewhere we started worrying less about the greater good, and more about the feelings of individuals. Again, use Muslim interchangeably with any minority group and the it&#39;s the same story. I fear we&#39;ve fallen into a state where standing up for yourself isn&#39;t accepted. We need to be able to voice our opinions. I don&#39;t agree with intellectual &quot;safe spaces&quot; either. Burying our heads in the sand is how we got here. Everything is starting to feel a little too Orwellian to me. Less trigger warnings and more speaking out seems in order. </p>

<p>I have a  feeling some people aren&#39;t going to appreciate my opinion. If it gets your gears turning, good. I&#39;m not trying to make friends. I&#39;m done worrying about offending the intersectionals. I really feel like oppression can&#39;t be how we deal with oppression, and by invalidating the opinions of other groups, that&#39;s pretty much what&#39;s up. I&#39;m a pro lgbt heterosexual cisgender male. That pretty much makes me the enemy, and I understand that. I&#39;m also an American citizen with a first amendment right. The left doesn&#39;t see the hypocrisy because everything about the left is hypocritical. Definitions get bent to better serve their narrative. They&#39;ve legitimately vilified the white American male ad nauseam. Look at people like gazi (or black hitler as he&#39;s more commonly known). There is absolutely no reason we should be celebrating people like him. He&#39;s peddling hate, and somehow gathered a large audience. We need to stop living in fear. If you feel a certain way about something, but choose not to act, you&#39;re not really advancing your struggle. I&#39;m not going to go so far as to say you&#39;re hurting it. That would be fear mongering. </p>

Just like how America&#39;s interventionism overseas has generated sectarian conflicts (with ISIL, watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/26718047">https://vimeo.com/26718047</a>) to spike proxy wars, and buff their corporate cronies in the Military Industrial Complex.

They may not like that your gay, they may actually hate you for it, but so long as they know that they can&#39;t act on their feelings or personal beliefs in any way that infringes on your rights then it&#39;s all good.</p>

<p>Should they hate you? No. Absolutely not, but regardless of that people hate people, and some do it for a lot of really stupid reasons that don&#39;t make sense to anyone else.</p>

<p>Citizenship classes should address this, immaginants form to this country for a number of reasons, but something they have to learn and accept that we as Americans are made up of every type of person imaginable, and we pride ourselves on a person&#39;s freedom to pursue whatever kind of life that makes them the most happy.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Muslim and in my faith, homosexuality is forbidden... FOR MUSLIMS!!! Another person has no right to tell you who or who not to be attracted to. I might believe homosexuality is forbidden but that does not give me the right to go around and tell homosexuals not to be homosexual. I honestly have no issue against gay people because at the end of the day, your life is just that... Yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t pretend to represent left or right, but I want to try to represent me fairly, so you might see there are people like me.</p>

<p>I want to respect the rights of gay people, as well as a variety of other lifestyles that are different than mine and are clearly not harmful.  That is important to me because I have family that has a variety of lifestyles whom I love and want to protect, and I am not someone who feels only one lifestyle is correct.</p>

<p>I also was married to someone who has Muslims in their family, and I met a lot of very good people that I still love and want to protect.  I don&#39;t know how many Muslims you have met, but they are quite the varied crowd.  In Turkey, some of this extended family were a part of the Women&#39;s Rights movement of the 70&#39;s (when American women were fighting for the ERA - late second wave feminism).  Others from Lebanon ran nightclubs where many lifestyles were welcomed.</p>

<p>Turkey had Ataturk, though, and many of their people were quite socially liberal before the regional disruptions.  Lebanon had been a very international city before the bombings.  Iran... you know, they still have a pretty active punk scene.  I met in college a doctor from Iran who loved rock and roll and felt she had to leave because of the fundamentalisation that had been reaching even into the cities.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve seen a lot of Muslim people in my life.  And loved ones have travelled and worked around the world and shared their own.  I think some of the ideas about how &quot;all of them&quot; are - I think they&#39;re often overgeneralizations.</p>

<p>Sure, like with white Americans, the further you get from a Metropolitan area, the more regressive their ideas can be.  But there are many Muslims who are progressing with the rest of humanity in tolerance - many who specifically come to America because that is the place that best represents their thoughts.</p>

<p>If you go into making change having an honest view, and you seek out the rural areas and look to teach tolerance and acceptance, I doubt anyone would have any problems outside the residents themselves.  That is a good effort, and I certainly support it.  But if you come into an interaction abusing a Muslim for the sins of their fellow Muslims, if you fail to recognise the spectrum of thought, if you are abusive for something they never did, or you generalize your abuse to the innocent, then you are wrong.  And I will stand up and defend against that bigotry.</p>

<p>So I guess it&#39;s how you use your voice.</p>

Even prisoners, even your enemies on the battlefield, even people who don&#39;t share your opinion on humans having human rights. Human rights are not a reward for good behavior. They are basic minimum moral standard. Either they apply to all humans or they aren&#39;t human rights.

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody knows &quot;not all Muslims&quot; and that crap is getting tiresome. The problem is there is a tipping point, when a population reaches it, the culture changes, the politics change, the laws change, the schools change, the stores change — and there is very little chance of going back.</p>

<p>And the number is not very large at all. Cities in the UK with just 8% Muslim look like downtown Mecca. And their jails and prisons are overwhelmingly Muslim. </p>

<p>Muslims have a history of complaining they are oppressed when they are the minority, then overtaking the country to the exclusion of (nearly) all others when they are the majority. And look at how countries devolve when that happens. Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iran, and so on.</p>

<p>Just listen to them. They are very clear in their intention to take over Western culture, to convert or kill the infidels, and have little regard for our ways except to exploit them. <del>We</del> The left are the ones making excuses as if they are only reacting to the oppression we impose. Everywhere in the world? Even in Muslim countries there is sky-high crime and religious strife. Why aren&#39;t they resettling there? Why must they come here? If they are such a positive influence on the economy, we should encourage them to go to those countries who need that most, no?</p>

<p>So when people whine that the Muslim they know is a good person who just wants a better life, they should remember the tipping point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in human rights, then you also believe that they should never be denied to a person. And this includes not denying the human rights of others because of their beliefs. Human rights are not granted to those of a particular ideology, they are granted to humans because they are humans. </p>

<p>Applied to another topic: I can&#39;t understand why the left don&#39;t see the hypocrisy of refusing to torturing terrorists when they don&#39;t respect our right to not be tortured?</p>

<p>In your case: if you think you have the right to deny some one else&#39;s rights, then you must not think those very rights you are upset about are truly inalienable. And at that point, why do you have a right to them at all? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly though you&#39;re free to be gay, but it doesn&#39;t mean every body has to like it. If someone doesn&#39;t like gay people, then don&#39;t associate with them. We should all respect each other the same regardless of what groups or ideologies we adhere to. If a Muslim doesn&#39;t like gay people, respect that and move on with your life. As long as they are not impeding on your right to be happy there is no problem. Fortunately for the gays  this country was established on the premise that religious creed will never dictate the law. Again this is a non issue. Everyone is free to establish their own beliefs and opinions. I&#39;m pretty sure most religions do not condone homosexuality, not just Muslims. You kind of sound like a drama queen making an issue out of nothing for attention. Oh look at me I&#39;m so oppressed because a religion doesn&#39;t accept my lifestyle. Malarkey I tell you. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t own empiricism or critical thinking. In fact with all your alliances with evangelical Christians and the KKK, I don&#39;t see a hell of a lot of critical thinking on your side.</p>

<p>So suck it up. Your side has been given the reigns, and Trump is the best you can do. So the conspiracy movement will now skew left.</p>

<p>Just a heads up, our side fights with empiricism and reality, not fake outrages, so you&#39;re about to get hit political with some heavy weight punches. It&#39;s not right wing kindergarden slap fights anymore people.</p>

Eventually, their toxic ideals will die out when the new generation understands that we all want the same things, for people to respect us regardless of religion, gender, sexual orientation, or race. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with Islam as a religion, the toxicity I referred to was specifically about their attitudes towards gay people and women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This continues to be somewhat of an issue within the gay community with people who only consider their identity through their sexuality &quot;As a gay person&quot;. It&#39;s rather self centred. </p>

<p>If I were honest (I imagine a lot would be inclined to agree) religion (regardless of Christianity or Islam etc) has no place in my personal life and organised religion should not be state affiliated in this time of flourishing secularisation. However, I understand that everyone is entitled to their own free thinking as long as this does not impede on another or society in general. </p>

<p>Regardless of religious belief (therefore behaviour) or sexuality (therefore behaviour) a person remains human (this also extends to criminals) because the most important fact (FACT) is that we are all human.</p>

<p>So no, its totally understandable that you fail to understand as a &quot;gay person&quot; the same as it&#39;s understandable that a person may fail to understand human rights as a &quot;religious person&quot; because you should be trying to understand another human because you are human. </p>

<p>There exists no hypocrisy in this instance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) well actually right off the bat you are clearly mistaken and delusional nowhere does it require anyone to change or integrate or adopt your shitty culture in order to be a guest or visitor to your land.  Thats just a figmant of your bigoted imagination </p>

<p>But no one&#39;s talking about a visitor we are talking about Muslim in the West who  voice disagreements and rejection of certain aspects of Western culture, and they tend to be overwhelmingly citizens of whichever particular Western Country they are criticizing because first generation immigrants almost never voiced public criticism for obvious reasons because of lunatics like yourself.  But according to all statistics it&#39;s overwhelmingly second generation who were either born in the West or almost certainly grew up there from a very early age and they&#39;re the ones who tend to openly criticize the West and or become more religious and islamist and ideology than their parents. It just shows your bigotry that you believe most Muslims in the west are recent immigrants which is absolutely untrue</p>

<p>So you believe that criticizing Western culture and policies is in human behavior? On which principal did you decide what is and is not human or in human behavior? Because that seems to me to be quite literally almost the epitome civilized human behavior but of course in your insecure bigoted mind you believe 25% of humanity are less human then everyone else totally regardless of their behavior or specific criticism because remember neither one of us clarified any particular criticism but you simply believe any criticism Muslims have is by definition illegitimate and even inhuman. </p>

<p>And as for protecting freedom from super secret Muslim plan to implement a totalitarian Theocratic government in Western, this is quite honestly one of the most hilarious and absurd things you&#39;ve said and I assure you that&#39;s saying a lot.  Can you give me any particular example of the Western Muslims attempting to impose a dictatorship? This is pure and utter delusion and fantasy even in the few handful of countries which had a tiny percentage of openly radical and revolutionary islamists and jihadists there is nothing to suggest that there is a significant possibility of Zen imposing anything on a western governments unless you believe that the three guys putting on a yellow jackets and yelling at drunk people once a month is a serious threat to Western democracies which would really only show how pathetic and utterly useless your system is</p>

<p>So in order to protect your freedom you need to take away the freedom of dissent and to disagree and criticize? You need to take the way the freedom to practice whichever form of religion you desire? You need to take away the freedom from government discrimination? You need to take away the freedom to voice minority opinions and opinions which many people might vehemently disagree  with? That is so pathetic beyond belief</p>

<p>And what freedoms are you protecting in particular? Which freedoms are you so close to losing is that you find it necessary two deny these fundamental and basic Western rights two a particular religious and a handful of ethnic groups?</p>

<p>Well if you&#39;re to intellectually bankrupt and dishonest to see the lack of logic and contradiction then let me explain it to you.<br/>
You are claiming that you need to protect your freedom from a non-existent imaginary threat which doesn&#39;t exist and the only way to protect these Freedom&#39;s is to take away the most fundamental and Elementary Human Rights and Freedoms from a chunk of your population in fellow Countryman</p>

<p>And yes there are plenty of examples of laws and post upon Western populations which are hated by the population such as the majority of right wing economic policies like free trade treaty with Latin America or loosening of Financial and banking regulations or tax policies which benefit the rich and screw the working class or the privatization of services relied upon by the working class or the cruel austerity policies or the welfare and they last for billionaires and bankers or the invasion of Europe or the spying on every citizen online Behavior and I could keep going for a very long time</p>

<p>So How does Barack Obama being president refute my arguments the vast majority of working-class black people have serious grievances with you&#39;re Western culture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off. Let&#39;s be civilised here and try and avoid personal insults.  I don&#39;t care what views people born in the west have. They are entitled to hold whatever views they like and, equally, others are free to disagree. However, I do have a real problem, personally, with anyone - be they Muslim, Christian, atheist or a giraffe - who seek to impose their views on others. Aka, anti-LGBT views that seek to limit the life choices of LGBT people.  But equally anti-religious views that seek to limit the life choices of religious people. The state should treat everyone equally and not be a tool for religious zealots or anti-religious zealots.  But the state should also protect the rights of people and that means, for example,  protecting women who are discriminated against by their religion or are subject to female genital mutilation and the state should also stop anti-religious zealots seeking to impose their world view on others. Human rights must be protected and defended. That is a fundamentally western tradition. A gay couple should be able to adopt and walk arm on arm down any street in the west and equally a Muslim couple should be able to do the same and the state should prevent anyone who tries to make either group from living their own life. </p>

<p>The same rule that protects your freedoms, also protects the freedoms of those you disagree with. If you seek to remove their freedoms, then your freedoms should also be removed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because doubting the humanity of muslims, if they voiced criticism isnt insulting to...u know...Muslims.... 
But sure, fine with me. i prefer dialogue without degrading the other. </p>

<p>Okay, to clarify, do you mean citizens or only specifically citizens born in the west? So if my sister came to U.S as a 4 year old and became a citizen at 15 and grew up westernized,  clarify for me where she stands in your view.   And if i may ask, why do u only have this distinction between citizens and non citizens? These seem pretty elementary principles of democracy, why is it necessary for non citizens to hide their views and beliefs? Does this include european immigrant or mexican? </p>

<p>And okay, i think we agree the government should protect your right to be gay and protect my rights to be a religious muslim and an Islamist politically.  But since we are being intellectually honest, tell me who you think is more terrified &amp; fearful of state sanctioned violence, is it western gays at the hands of Salafi Jihadi Muslims? OR is it western muslims at the hand of extreme xenophobic nationalists (supported by many liberals)? </p>

<p>I agree actually that western government&#39;s should stop anyone,Even Muslims  from imposing their morality by force, however my issue is, seems to me, many liberals  are focusing on a totally hypothetical threat, while ignoring the MUCH MORE real threat of right wing bigots &amp; secular liberals imposing their views on muslims.  </p>

<p>can u see why many muslims might be a bit doubtful about your  intentions and claims of protecting &#39;freedom&#39;?  To us it can also  means &#39;Our freedom to impose our beliefs, traditions, culture &amp; dress code on you muslims.&#39;</p>

<p>Again i think we agree on stopping things such as genital mutilation, which isnt really a muslim issue to begin with but mostly an African issue but yeah, regardless  All government should stop this, whether western or islamic.  </p>

<p>But when u say &quot;women oppressed by their religion&quot; that&#39;s a very vague statement and could mean many things to many people. Again, try to comprehend how that might worry muslims in the current climate of demonizing muslims and pretending Muslim women are all begging to throw off their hijab and become bikini models if only the progressive rich westerners would fulfill their white mans burden. Maybe ur not intending it that way but u have comprehend when a specific community is constantly demonized and put under extreme pressure.  They become paranoid, feeling under siege &amp;  will resist almost anything from people they fear.  </p>

<p>and finally, if you &quot;seek&quot; to take away others freedoms? So do u think this applies to me for example saying, &quot;I believe, under islamic sharia, womens dress codes should be imposed by law&quot;? I dont ever try to implement it myself nor do i call upon others in the west to do it  its purely an issue of belief &amp; ideology. Not an actual plan to do so. </p>

Sure, an Old Testament story or passage is used occasionally in churches to teach a lesson, but it&#39;s mostly used as an historical account and absolutely does not represent what modern Christianity is, braised maybe some crazy southern baptists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuck are you talking about? Putting Muslims on a pedestal of protection and support? Is that really what it&#39;s about? Or is it more about due process and the rule of law? Are people celebrating Islam or simply trying to be fair to people? Putting someone on a pedestal means putting them above everyone else. Yeah, really put them on a pedestal by honoring their visas and our own laws and values. </p>

<p>Nope. Utter bullshit. There&#39;s nothing that hurts gay rights or women&#39;s rights by letting more Muslims into the US. When muslims in the US are accepted, they become much more moderate or liberal themselves. And again, letting them in does not have any impact on rights of gays or women. Right wing policies do, though. Nothing about asking for the constitution to be upheld puts Muslims above anyone else, as you imply. Supporting one group does not logically follow that you&#39;re supporting their religion.</p>

<p>You want real hypocrisy? There&#39;s a giant movement to outlaw abortion from Christians. None of them give a fuck about the death penalty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, and so I get a reply of out of context quotes that can easily be explained. Good job proving my point.  </p>

<p>You quoted two verses that both pertain to times when Muslims were being attacked, times of war, not general everyday living. The first one, the verse directly before it says that if you kill one person, it is as if you have killed all of mankind. Why didn&#39;t you quote that as well? Does it not fit your narrative? It then says the punishment for waging war against God and his prophet for no reason other than their religion, and the punishment for spreading disorder or corruption, should be judged and carried out according to the nature of the transgression. The punishments might sound harsh, but all the verse is saying is there should be punishment for those who wage war or cause disorder. It doesn&#39;t give Muslims carte blanche to attack or kill non-Muslims. The next verse then literally starts by saying &quot;Except for those who repent&quot;, and that God is all forgiving. Meaning that punish those who attack you for your religion, but if they repent, then show mercy.  </p>

<p>The second verse, I don&#39;t even know what to say since its clear you didn&#39;t even read the verses you are quoting. That is also a bad translation you are using. Again, why didn&#39;t you quote the verse just before it that says to fight those that fight you, but not to exceed the bounds set by God. It then goes on saying that IF THEY FIGHT YOU, then kill them because disorder/attacking God is worse than killing. The next verse says if they desist from fighting, then God is all forgiving. But if they continue to fight, then continue to fight against them until there is no more disorder. It then again repeats and says if they desist, then to stop fighting them.  </p>

<p>So, both verses are in relation to Muslims being attacked because of their religion, both say to fight those that wage war against you because of your religion, and both say to stop fighting when they stop fighting you. Neither of these verses gives Muslims divine right to kill non-Muslims, not even close. But then you already knew that and quoted out of context verses anyway to try and prove a lie. Well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those quotes are actually from the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch (minus Timothy) or.. otherwise known as THE TORAH.  Those are actually Jewish beliefs, systems and laws that were incorporated into the Christian Bible.  They are hardly acknowledged for more than historical uses and known to be barbaric and just a fading trait of an older, obsolete religion to Christians.  It&#39;s also another reason why most Jews were kicked out of numerous countries through out time; those books detail how they (the Jews) believe they are superior and can treat non-believers as cattle (can rape, enslave, murder, cheat, lie, steal etc Goyim).</p>

<p>Those quotes, from those specific books of the Bible, are more of a reference of where Christians were, and where they have come to (New Testament) instead of actual rules they follow (minus the 10 Commandments). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you with a whole heart: for about a week it&#39;s weird, cause it&#39;s something you&#39;re so used to checking. But that in itself makes you realize that you <em>needed</em> to do it. After that one week (or maybe 2-3?), it&#39;s like a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders, and you won&#39;t be able to understand why the fuck <strong>anyone</strong> is still on it. And then, maybe, just <em>maybe</em> you&#39;ll look at everyone who still is in a different light. One thing I can guarantee: you WILL be much more healthy mentally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the honest responses. I&#39;m sure other people would see this and just call &quot;racist&quot; like the first response was kind of alluding to. But this is a different case, it involves a set of cultural values that can be vastly different at times, and I guess you answered my question here, values that directly conflict with the ideals of your home country. I do think it&#39;s fair to say that what you&#39;re talking about is the type of people that sought to migrate to your country, and what their motivations were. Open borders and generous social benefits tend to encourage these behaviors which is certainly the reason people reject it as policy. Being a white American, I try to resist painting people with a broad brush, but it doesn&#39;t invalidate your experience at all. It&#39;s just hard to say on the one hand, &quot;America accepts all ways of life&quot;, and on the other hand, &quot;except this one&quot;. Another issue for America is that most of the people seeking to immigrate are doing it for two reasons: increased opportunities to study or gain skills, or because we just bombed the piss out of their country that is now in shambles. It is very difficult to reconcile American values of personal liberty, inclusion, and self-determination while simultaneously maintaining the most aggressive foreign policy in modern history. Definitely something worth deeper consideration here, and you definitely had one of the most honest accounts I&#39;ve seen. Interesting times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont lose your ballsack dude. I dont want to here from why anyone voted for him, but why did you. Gee.
Furthermore, I explained why someone, me, who wants to understand the political mess, has to generalize, when no one explains shit.
Additionally, I will not go to his plattform. I dont believe propaganda from anyone and if you think that he of all people, doesnt do propaganda, than you are naive.
And lastly, yes, I am making a lot of assumptions. What you gonna do? Forbid it? Is that the &quot;less restriction&quot; part Trump supporters stand for?
Or the restriction on decisions made for them? I mean, they want to restrict the freedom of a woman who wants to make an abortion, after all. And they really think this cell cluster is life? But they have no moral problem with eating meat or plants? That&#39;s the part which is insane! And it is just that. saying: I love life! So I am gonna destroy the life of some stranger, by forcing them to get the baby she cannot care for, so it may be starve to death painfully, but goddamnit better this way than killing this poor thing when it doesnt feel anything. Gimme my brutally murderes cow sandwich.
You dont see the insanity, right?
The other things are pretty reasonable. A little naive again, but reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds of millions that are not so innocent.  Who is the one living in an echo chamber?  A little criticism of Islam is met with defensiveness.  Islam needs to be open to honest criticism if it is to reform.  It&#39;s true that people are lumping Islamism with all Islam, but people that are just trying to make sense of all this are less to blame than the Islamists themselves and liberal politicians and pundits who have misinformed and apologized.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether the prophet waged war defensively or aggressively.  There is enough evidence that it was aggressive to keep it uncertain, yes?  Even if defensive, good or bad, this is a militancy that is completely absent in the NT gospels.  Do you not agree that this is ripe for twisting by those that wish to?  I&#39;m sure Sharia was in some ways a brilliant system in medieval times, but it&#39;s time to update.  </p>
