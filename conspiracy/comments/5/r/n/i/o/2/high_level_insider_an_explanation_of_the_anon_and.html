<p>&quot;<strong><em>Is is the mark of an educated mind to be able to enterain a thought without accepting it.</em></strong>&quot; - Aristole</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you understand the above quote and is open minded while being skeptical of things, you should find the series of posts from 4chan anon, High Level Insider, very interesting. Even if you believe this is fiction, there are very valid posts/ideas to use to question the world with. Proceed with caution. </p>

<h1><strong>Who is High Level Insider?</strong></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>High Level Insider is a 4chan anon who began posting in early July 2016 and talks on various subjects such as Politics/Geo-politics, Psyops, Agency/Self-deveoplment, Technology, History, Psychedelics, and more. He claims to be part of a secret society, &quot;Three&quot;, akin to &quot;watchers&quot; who believe in <em>The Law of the Jungle</em> and <em>The Long View</em>. Their current goal is to retake the U.S. and forward the progress of mankind through a reorganization of the government such as unleashing the public domain technology currently not being used, restructuring of the government into a small entity that &quot;does big things while being small&quot;, diminishing(and later removing) the powers of the agencies/groups have major influences on the U.S, establish energy projects to forward the GDP via new Nuclear plants/Hydro plants/Solar Space Arrays (via space elevator)/High Speed <em>Platform</em> Rail system, and more. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Is this a good or bad guy? And how does this anon contrast from other anons?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, the anon and his supposed group doesn&#39;t view themselves as good guys or bad guys and leaves it up to us whether or not to make that assumption. &quot;Three&quot; is not interested in &quot;exposing&quot; the government in the way fellow Conspiracy members do and is invested in more reasonable methods (also, the anon says that exposing the government could lead to the destruction of the U.S due to it&#39;s hidden operations/history). </p>

<p>One of the key differences you&#39;ll see is that he doesn&#39;t entangle the viewer with <strong>Doom Porn</strong>. The anon is focused on giving examples of possibilities and ideas on what an individual can do and gives a particularly surprising outlook for mankind. He talks about causes and effects of the subjects asked and provides provoking topics uncommon in circles. Contrast this with other anons/Alt media and you&#39;ll find it strange that none of them talk about the things this anon does. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Why did Princess Diana die?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: She found out about 9/11 beforehand and tried to stop it. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106675505">https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106675505</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: What&#39;s the deal with Antarctica? Is there anything?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Antartica is a distraction much like aliens. It is a blank slate for your imagination to run wild on, but too far removed for reality checks to interfere with. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106658953">https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106658953</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: [Topic of Illuminati] This. What about the French Revolution? The South American liberation movement? etc.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Pretty much every revolution since the American one has been co-opted if not instigated by British intelligence / freemasonry through bodies like the Young Turks, Young Italians, most ideologies are synthetic (even naively anti-establishment ones like Marxism and Libertarianism are both outright creations of and cultivated by them). None of this should surprise you because you can judge it all by its fruits quickly. Nothing much has improved in the world since the American revolution other than a drip drop spread of a longing for the values embodied within to the peoples of the world. That&#39;s great progress no doubt, but all of singular origin. The methods and principles of the revolution are poorly understood and articulated today, but we will change all of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: What would be considered reliable sources of US media nowadays? Any networks or magazines etc. Can any of them be trusted(perhaps on some issues more than others)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: There is no good media. Some media is more accurate in describing the world as it is (from 9/11 being a fraud to pedophiles running rampant) but there is no media that describes the world as it could be, which is the most important part of describing the world as it is. This, none of them are allowed to do. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106658764">https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106658764</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: Will their be any major ISIS attacks in the next couple of months?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: The terrorism meme is something the old world order would very much like to drop at this point. Did you read the news about the fire in Gatlinburg? A couple of kids with a dollar of matches did more damage than any so-called terrorist act. There are a couple important things to draw from this. One, terrorism isn&#39;t real. It is trivial to do massively more damage than any so-called terrorist attacks have. Two, awareness of this fact is penetrating into the public psyche. People are increasingly aware that a small group of individuals are capable of tremendous force multiplication, which has the potential to cause a cascade of individuals attaining agency and therefore dealing a deathblow to the old order.

<p><strong>Q: Do you know how the Clinton fbi case is going? Any chance at all she&#39;ll be indicted? How&#39;s the mood in the Obama administration.=?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: It is now widely acknowledged that the reason for Clinton&#39;s server was to sell secrets to foreign and non-state buyers. One of the primary buyers is China and the establishment would like to pivot away from focus on China towards a Russian-US conflict. Trump is acting correctly in not allowing this. The reason indictments are unlikely is that the establishment is glued together by a web of blackmail. There are a limited number of possible scenarios as a result. You can make it clear that Hillary (and only Hillary) will be taken down as an example to keep everyone else from panicking. The establishment all turns on her as a scapegoat and kills her to stop a domino chain. This doesn&#39;t accomplish much however. You make her a martyr, and tell the rest of them they are free to go. She is already past her prime as an operator, so really nothing is gained. Alternatively, you can move to take down the whole establishment. This requires the competency to replace it in chaotic circumstances, which Trump does not have. As such, he doesn&#39;t really have this as a playable card right now. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106653841">https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106653841</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Something that has been bothering me about the Pizzagate... Why did Wikileaks leave the Pizza emails inside? Was it supposed to be a distraction or was it a mistake?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Are you suggesting wikileaks should remove the pizza emails if they are CIA controlled? The government likes to have these pedophile scandals in circulation on a regular basis to keep everyone part of the regime in check and frequently reminded of the vitriol and disgust the general public has for them if their activities were to come to light. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106734861">https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106734861</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: Do you think Trump would have won if /pol/ and anything like it would not have existed? Did memes over those 2 years really help?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: The regime is thoroughly discredited to most people. They will continue to yearn for and support perceived insurgent candidates, and places where such disgust can be vented will be common as long as the masses are abused. It seems as though you are treating the election as if the result was close, that one or another factor could have swayed it. In fact Trump won in a huge landslide, as Obama did in 2008. Neither election was remotely close, the public results are fraudulent. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106718409">https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106718409</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Q: [Topic of Global Warming] Now I know there&#39;s no problem because I can read the geological record and negative feedback modes. But as an insider, you should know specifically WHY the alarm-Lysenkoists are trying to make it a problem. Do you?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: You can take the efforts to use it as a mechanism for inhibiting growth off the table by talking about cheaper ways of dealing with it (if the assumption is granted that global warming is real) than constricting energy supplies. You won&#39;t get anywhere quickly by arguing with people whether it is real. One of those things people have made their mind up on already and confirmation bias is available either way. You can, however, neuter the efforts by showing that things like a sun shade are vastly cheaper and therefore preferable alternative to restricting energy consumption. This is objective fact that no one can question, which means you have an easy time in calling into question the motives of the global warming alarmists. You need to break with Overton windows on issues like this and create new frames. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106661951">https://yuki.la/pol/106651502#p106661951</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: I get that we&#39;re supposed to be thinking for ourselves and all, but in your opinion what are the most constructive things we could be doing on a daily basis that would help. Meditation? Research? Creating?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Start changing the narrative in conspiracy circles. Why spend so much time harping on about the exact same bad stuff over and over and over again? Everyone already knows, it is doom porn distraction and needs to be called out as such. Demand positive, concrete changes. &quot;More freedom&quot; isn&#39;t a concrete change. Building NAWAPA is. It is straight forward to look at an infrastructure project, figure out if it generates more wealth than it costs, then just build it if so. There are countless examples of this already on the books, so massive economic booms are hardly more complicated than flipping a switch. Demand them, and ridicule what is obviously poorly directed attention to harping on dead horses. (<a href="https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106731729">https://yuki.la/pol/106714664#p106731729</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q: You had mentioned in the past that the Regime is actively working towards &quot;taking out&quot; people who write anything that dares to criticize them? Question: Who is actually doing the &quot;taking out&quot; part? It seems crazy to me that merely publishing an article or book, even if fiction, could get someone in trouble.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: It depends on exactly what you are saying. With respect to consciousness issues, it is masonic organizations loyal to the British lodge that do most gangstalking and assassination. Then you have the NSA focusing on disruptive technology, the CIA on weapons and drug flow, etc. A lot of compartmentalization of interests.

<p>I&#39;ve kept up with HLI Anon from the beginning. I&#39;m still undecided if he is legit, however, he has remained consistent and he isn&#39;t bothered by trolls nor does he get involved in any &quot;drama&quot;. </p>

<p>Odds are he is a really intelligent LARPer, but it is still worth reading up on his posts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a different anon from the other Space Elevator anon </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is actually a bit more complex. </p>

<p>There was anon &#39;Space Elevator&#39; - the original and real anon whom users apparently loved, posting various science stuff at 4chan for several years. Very, very occasionally he posted about space elevator concepts as well. Anon &#39;Space Elevator&#39; had several impersonators though.</p>

<p>However, in December 2016 another anon(s) appeared and posted only &#39;space elevator&#39; stuff, interestingly under several identities such as hijacked &#39;Space Elevator&#39; user name or &#39;Red Pill 101&#39; or simply &#39;Anonymous.&#39; Unironically, the youtube video &#39;Orbital Ring Space Elevator&#39; was posted at a channel called &#39;Anonymous User.&#39;  </p>

<p>Now, the point is that one of these above mentioned anons is assumed to be - physically - anon &#39;High Level Insider.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason I read that &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter&quot; in The Rock&#39;s voice lol. </p>

<p>You are right, research is key. I&#39;ve done some research on what he has said, but not enough yet to be convinced that what he says is truth. </p>

<p>One thing that did strike me, was when he said that his organization has someone lined up to be installed as our President in 2024, 2020 if things keep going sideways. He said this person was widely unknown, but would become known this year to begin getting them in the public eye. He did not say if this person was male, or female. I&#39;m wondering if that person is Tulsi Gabbard? I honestly don&#39;t know a whole lot about her yet though, but I still found it interesting that he said that, and then she kinda pops up out of nowhere. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure other people knew of her, but I had never heard her name until she went to Syria. </p>

<p>She nominated Bernie at the DNC and then got disowned by the democrats and threatened by democratic donors as revealed by wikileaks. Now she is a Republican. I am a big Tulsi Gabbard fan too. She is very based.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how I approach this anon too. The book by Julian Jaynes alone has revealed some fascinating things of our reality that kind of put everything else in a more relatable context. How the capacity to formulate and understand metaphors is what truly makes the human mind exceptional for example, and that this mechanism allows innovation, imagination, self-reflection, and thereby consciousness. </p>

<p>There is still so much we need to wrap our heads around, and this anon is full of ideas. Another is the potential of orbital space elevators. Seriously, why is nobody talking about this? Common, Elon Musk, where is your ambition? $450 billion for the first elevator, $1-2 billion for every additional one, as rockets won&#39;t be needed from that point on for most things. That&#39;s a game changing idea! We could safely fling spent nuclear fuel straight into the sun while placing solar arrays in orbit or somewhere between earth and the sun, fulfilling all our energy needs! </p>

<p>Terraforming could even become feasible on Mars if we built an orbital space elevator there and fed a strong current through it, creating a shielding magnetic field over the entire planet, protecting the surface from further solar stripping. The rest would be a matter of a few decades for it to become habitable without life support units.</p>

<p>So much potential, so little ambition. Something so easy to change once we come to recognise what we&#39;ve been missing out on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That one was the one that really made me question my judgment. It seems such a silly idea, just too satirical to be real, and yet... fuck if I don&#39;t believe it on some level.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That&#39;s another point of contention. With the sheer amount of testimony from both civilians as well as military and aerospace personnel, his quick dismissal of alien visitations to earth doesn&#39;t seem very convincing. From what I can tell he never made an argument as to how he can be so sure of this negative. Is he saying it&#39;s an impossibility for some reason?</p>

<p>The only explanation I can conceive is that he was trying to get us to inquire about the idea that aliens equal demons or beings from other dimensions. Still. If that were the case, it would have helped if he simply said &quot;They&#39;re here, but they&#39;re not what you think they are.&quot; or something along those lines.</p>

<p>The moon is a whole nother can of worms I won&#39;t go into now, but your version of what might have happened seems reasonable enough. My main contention is still the Van Allen Belt, but I&#39;m not too convinced either way on this conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a bummer, by the time I caught onto the Van Allen Belt issue it had been too tainted by what I consider disinfo agents to extract anything useful. 10 years ago this was not something I had heard at all, even in the faked moon landing conspiracies, which have existed for some time to a degree, but have made a recent resurgence. </p>

<p>My mother worked for Lockheed, and as a kid she was dating one of the scientists there who gave me tons of pictures and negatives from various Apollo missions, as well as a ton of satellite imagery. In the context they were given it is really hard to believe that this man would have been involved in faking the landing, but was in a position where he would have undoubtedly had to have been a part of it. So, I have a very specific anecdotal reason for not believing the hoax theory. These images and related materials, and the demeanor of that scientist, carried an aura of credulity that is hard to convey.</p>

<p>I also had some bound tomes of the geography of the moon, with 3D and stereographic images that were so detailed, I dunno, no one will ever convince me that was a hoax.</p>

<p>My aunt got to go on a tour of JPL with her friend who works there. I asked her to ask the tour guide if there were plans to develop space elevators. The JPL guy said NASA has started initial plans for space elevators but they can&#39;t find a material strong enough to use for tethers. I think high level anon suggested kevlar tethers or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the kicker though, and I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re aware of this, I certainly wasn&#39;t up until a few months ago.</p>

<p>When speaking of space elevators, almost everyone immediately jumps to the model where a very long tether with a counterweight attached in outer space, anchored directly to earth (or alternatively to a barge along the lines of OCISLY by SpaceX, to allow for maneuvering). This version of the space elevator has been discussed in the media as though it was the only theoretically possible version of the idea, which is far from the case.</p>

<p>The tether version would require massive amounts of carbon nanotubes to make it conceivable, and even then, the model has a few disadvantages over the orbital ring space elevator model I mentioned above. This model was introduced by Nikola Tesla, but was largely suppressed. It is possible to build such an orbital ring now using Kevlar for comparatively little money (especially when compared to the US black budget for instance), and it would pay for its investment exceedingly quickly.</p>

<p>To be honest, the deeper I delve down the rabbit hole, the more suspicious I grow of NASA. While I admire what they publically represent, their actions (and lack thereof) raise some very red flags in my books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. You are thinking of the counterweight tether version of a space elevator, in which case you would have a point. The orbital ring version of a space elevator is very much feasible using current materials, technology energy and monetary requirements, as well as physical understanding. A rotating ring (moved by a kind of inverted maglev train system) would self-balance and stabilize, and even in the worst case of a deliberate or accidental structural failure, the parts would scatter outwards due to inertia.</p>

<p>It certainly would be a bigger undertaking than the hoover damage, but roughly equivalent in terms of risk, reward and feasibility. </p>

<p>2/11/17</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: ... if the United States had $5 trillion worth of electricity pouring out of the sky, wouldn&#39;t that pretty much crash the value of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Ultimately, we would like to drive the price of everything down to zero. That is to say, we&#39;d like to live in a post-scarcity society where you can have what you want.</p>

<p>Collapsing the price of input commodities is among the greatest achievements that mankind can strive towards. It means you in turn collapse the prices of food, housing, health care, cars, whatever. This is where we want to go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do you have any idea how difficult it would be to sign up the whole world to receive all of their energy costs from the United States? We wouldn&#39;t even have time to enjoy any benefit, because of World War III. Petroleum is one fourth of Russia&#39;s GDP. Their export earnings from oil and gas are 14% of their GDP. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be as casual as you are about eliminating that industry and buying all of their energy from us at an arbitrary price we set. Not to mention other countries who rely much more on energy resources. This is exactly the kind of stuff that starts wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: The US already does this in effect - it is called the petrodollar regime. We force the world to trade energy supplies in dollars, propping up the value of the dollar, which we in turn use to effectively skim a cut off of every transaction for free.</p>

<p>The present circumstances of world geopolitics in other words is that the US is committing highway robbery by force.</p>

<p>The only real geopolitical shift we are talking about is one of mutually improved circumstances, i.e., energy is cheaper and more abundant for us all. The usury class and the degenerate politicians who depend upon economic hardship to suppress and distract the masses would be in serious trouble, but no one else really. </p>

<p>A: Whether it is or not, you&#39;d not be able to tell based on me telling you so. One of the first principles of anonymous boards is that you should judge by the merits of what is said, not the identity of the sayer. With that in mind, you might as well go ahead and ask what you wanted to ask and see what kind of response you get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, </p>

<p>First, thanks for doing this. It&#39;s god&#39;s (your) work.</p>

<p>I have started reading Jaynes book and just in the first few chapters he is shattering things I think (thought) about consciousness for awhile. I studied chemistry and philosophy in school and was a nietzsche-holic and thought I had shrugged off most of the nonsense that history and psychology teach us formally. </p>

<p>But man, I fell like I&#39;m back at the top of the well. </p>

<p>One thread I wanted to get some thoughts on, he mentions NAWAPA, a huge public works project to redirect water through Canada and the US to set up hydrodams along the way, including pumping water UP the rockies and then back down again to harness as much of the gravitational potential energy as possible. </p>

<p>As I was looking into this, I read a lot about Lyndon LaRouche and his style of political activism. There is very much muddy about him and the labor party, but I suspect most if not all of this is disinfo.</p>

<p>Do you guys know anything about LaRouche or his political movement? This is my first hearing of it, but he has run in every presidential election from like the 70&#39;s until 2004. Do you think he is connected to the Three?</p>

<p>They get slammed a lot for being &#39;Anti-semetic&#39; but it appears the ADL may just be slamming them for disinfo. He claims they are anti-zionist, not anti-jewish, which I think most people who are awake are as well. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome. There was a few people who said that they have had their perspective and thoughts change after reading through the threads and a few who became curious and wanted to test the anon. I wonder how much we don&#39;t really know... Makes one wish that he can just sit and read the entire true history...</p>

<p>Lyndon LaRouche and his style of political activism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about LaRouche but I think someone else could give you something... I don&#39;t recall which users talked about him though. Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the kicker though, and I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re aware of this, I certainly wasn&#39;t up until a few months ago.</p>

<p>When speaking of space elevators, almost everyone immediately jumps to the model where a very long tether with a counterweight attached in outer space, anchored directly to earth (or alternatively to a barge along the lines of OCISLY by SpaceX, to allow for maneuvering). This version of the space elevator has been discussed in the media as though it was the only theoretically possible version of the idea, which is far from the case.</p>

<p>The tether version would require massive amounts of carbon nanotubes to make it conceivable, and even then, the model has a few disadvantages over the orbital ring space elevator model I mentioned above. This model was introduced by Nikola Tesla, but was largely suppressed. It is possible to build such an orbital ring now using Kevlar for comparatively little money (especially when compared to the US black budget for instance), and it would pay for its investment exceedingly quickly.</p>

<p>To be honest, the deeper I delve down the rabbit hole, the more suspicious I grow of NASA. While I admire what they publically represent, their actions (and lack thereof) raise some very red flags in my books.</p>
