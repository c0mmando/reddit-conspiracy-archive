The outbursts feel like he&#39;s selling one of his sponsors. Its in a bored kinda voice, like someone&#39;s paying you to say the stuff and you&#39;re just getting on within it.
Well then, maybe he is,yknow? <em>Selling one of his sponsors</em> that is .. <strong>winks</strong></p>

<p>I respect Rogan for calling him out on it, he literally said &quot;let&#39;s not go off on these crazy rants&quot; Aka &quot;stop with the bullshit Alex and stick to the topic&quot;.</p>

<p>The way I figure it, you need people like Jones as an entry point to the rabbit hole. He&#39;s well versed &amp; connected enough to touch on all the major conspiracies with some degree of veracity. But if all you&#39;re digesting is him, you&#39;ll find yourself bitter and deluded, with not much more additional insight than when you first came across him. In that respect, he&#39;s very much the essence of a Gatekeeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he called them &quot;psychic vampires&quot;. At first this threw me off as well, but when you break down what he explained, it truly is the quickest way to describe who the elites are. I think the best way to describe AJ is efficient. The guy goes 100 mph and won&#39;t slow down for anyone. When he speaks he creates a million different sound bytes at a time to make a myriad of points. </p>

<p>When he spoke about the elites, he talked about the aspects of human trafficking for the means of organ mining. Essentially, the elites are leaching off of their underlings hence the vampire part. The next thing he talked about was the effort by google/Amazon to create a technology which combines us all into one collective hivemind. Because we keep contributing to different social networks and use the internet on a daily basis, we are being collected by these different companies. Because it&#39;s behind the scenes, we don&#39;t actually think about it too often, but we essentially are lending the elites our consciousness in exchange for convenience and entertainment. That is where the psychic part comes in. </p>

<p>So in closing, the elites literally use some of our bodies for trafficking, young blood, and healthy organs, and they also use our data to create a central intelligence application which will allow them to accurately predict the future and therefore shape it.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t have put it better. Another user - u/cyberindustrialist expressed it well - he makes the truth unpalatable for normal listeners. The madcap delivery, unbelievably fantastic claims, the army of sources .. each higher level than the last. I mean, it&#39;s a bit much. </p>

He does drop some realness from time to time, I&#39;ll give him that,yes. But lying by omission is still deceit. And for every nugget of truth Jones presents, he throws Ina nothingburger, that&#39;ll expend more effort than the distance you travelled with the aforesaid truth.

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones knows exactly what he&#39;s doing. Look how he addresses the Bill Hicks questions. Wether you believe that theory or not Alex certainly does whatever he can to make you question it. He doesn&#39;t straight us answer the question and then says &quot;is it just me or it is hot in here&quot; and then changes the subject. He knows people notice that, he knows that seems weird and it&#39;s all intentional. He deliberately gives us good info mixed in with horse shit as well. </p>

<p>Examples of other people like Jones (Non-official covers) </p>

<p>These are just a couple recent examples.</p>

<p>Tom Clancy is a good example, they give him real tidbits of secret information that he then puts into his fiction books. Now the publics first exposure to the secret info is in a spy thriller book, taking away credibility that it could be a reality and making it harder for people to believe if it were to come out.</p>

You have to research Aleister Crowley and the illuminati though, because that really is what those people are doing (believe they&#39;re doing). As for some of his other crazy ideas about interdimensional entities and the government&#39;s involvement, go on to the CIA&#39;s website and look at the declassified documents under &quot;Stargate&quot; project. Everything Alex says in this interview can be traced back to cold, hard facts. The reason he sounds &quot;crazy&quot;, because he knows so much truth and he&#39;s trying to get people to listen. Hell, I tried explaining all this to my fiance and I even pulled an Alex Jones. Bro is woke as fuck and if you don&#39;t see it, it&#39;s your fault-- not his.</p>

<p>Now do these observations categorically out him as a shill? Not really. But are they concerning enough to alter my stance on his credibility? Yes, most definitely.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make me or him any less <em>woke</em>. In fact , I&#39;d say we&#39;re both actually pretty woke.

    <div class="md"><p>The Stratfor connection to InfoWars is real in their former editor, they employed an IT guy also named Alex Jones.  Possibly relation with his other admitted family members in military and civilian intelligence?</p>

<p>Jones employed a former Stratfor employee who also worked for Parkerhouse Media, a rumored CIA multi-media front, named Molly Maroney who was working on InfoWars magazine for several years before she was let go after a furor.</p>

<p>Lots of corporations and information firms are registered as user in Stratfor and if you look at the AnonHacks from Stratfor&#39;s members list you will find <a href="mailto:1oldpath@infowars.net">1oldpath@infowars.net</a> is a registered receiver of StratFor updates.</p>

<p>Stratfor is a private intelligence service also based in Austin, Texas, with a known Neo-Con and state of Israel slant.  They do some really good work on occasion but it does call into question his interests and even further links back to American intelligence services.</p>

<p>Joel at ISGP has done some excellent research into the Alex Jones disinformation phenomenon that can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="https://isgp-studies.com/alex-jones-of-infowars-is-cia-army-disinformation.php">https://isgp-studies.com/alex-jones-of-infowars-is-cia-army-disinformation.php</a></p>

<p>Furthermore Jones is also tied to the Council of National Policy and the American Security Council, right wing intelligence and religious think tanks.</p>

<p>You can find the most updated available membership list for the CNP at:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf">https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf</a></p>

<p>It looks curiously like a list of Trump appointments or the appointments that Ted Cruz would have made if he would have been successful.</p>

<p>Jones is agitation propaganda giving nuggets of truths wrapped in fecal sandwiches.</p>

<p>You will find such curious names as Major General John Singlelaub, Josh Duggar, Steve Bannon,  Kellyanne Conway, Jerome Corsi, and tons of other far right religious, political, military types.</p>

He&#39;s a multimillionaire.  He&#39;s in the entertainment industry.  And when he uses factual information, it loses its power because he&#39;s using it.  His predictions of doom and gloom are followed by sales pitches to buy survival stuff from his website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I like when he acts crazy and silly&quot; You&#39;re touching a point here : Alex Jones does what his audiences want him to do. They want to see him act crazy and silly. He&#39;s not controlled, he does that because he wants the views, he wants an easy audience and has always been a kind of attention-whore. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the sadest part of the system : Audiences are used to fast-thinking, goofy content and entertainment, the system does not have to buy or control anyone, a lot of minds are already setted up to what Alex Jones offers. People link conspiration with crazy people, hence why a crazy/goofy conspiracist have such a success. </p>

<p>Guys like Alex Jones discredits the true free minds, the level headed guys and girls that are just searching for the thruth and justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at people that try to upend the status quo with truth that are considered conspiracies, they often become more paranoid and radicalized as time goes on. This ends up discounting their worldview with the public as their behavior becomes more erratic and paranoid. The other side of this coin is, these people usually are facing very real covert action against them and surprise, it makes them appear stranger and radicalizes them. </p>

<p>People/groups I have noticed this with:
- Ross Perot (read about his pres run. Him quitting and re entering, loyalty oaths.)
- Julian assange (obvious trumped up charges)
- Hugo Chavez (became much more radical after he survived a coup attempt backed by the United States)
- Students for a Democratic Society. (After COINtELPRo persecution they splinter off into a domestic terror group, the weatherman. None convicted cause they never killed anyone and the civil rights violations for cointelpro meant no evidence was admissible) </p>

<p>Ones that I have noticed off the top of my head. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more and I&#39;ll edit as/if I remember more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Protocol XII </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Literature and journalism are two of the most important educative forces, and therefore our government will become proprietor of the majority of the journals. This will neutralize the injurious influence of the privately-owned press and will put us in possession of a tremendous influence upon the public mind .... If we give permits for ten journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same proportion. This, however, must in no wise be suspected by the public. For which reason all journals published by us will be of the most opposite, in appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating confidence in us and bringing over to us quite unsuspicious opponents, who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless.</p></li>
<li><p>In the front rank will stand organs of an official character. They will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence will be comparatively insignificant.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose part it will be to attack the tepid and indifferent.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third rank we shall set up our own, to all appearance, off position, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what looks like the very antipodes to us. Our real opponents at heart will accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their cards.</p></li>
<li><p>All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions - aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even anarchical - for so long, of course, as the constitution exists .... Like the Indian idol &quot;Vishnu&quot; they will have a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions as required. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all power of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who will think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable for us. In the vain belief that they are following the organ of their party they will, in fact, follow the flag which we hang out for them.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we must take special and minute care in organizing this matter. Under the title of central department of the press we shall institute literary gatherings at which our agents will without attracting attention issue the orders and watchwords of the day. By discussing and controverting, but always superficially, without touching the essence of the matter, our organs will carry on a sham fight fusillade with the official newspapers solely for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more fully than could well be done from the outset in official announcements, whenever, of course, that is to our advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>THESE ATTACKS UPON US WILL ALSO SERVE ANOTHER PURPOSE, NAMELY, THAT OUR SUBJECTS WILL BE CONVINCED TO THE EXISTENCE OF FULL FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND SO GIVE OUR AGENTS AN OCCASION TO AFFIRM THAT ALL ORGANS WHICH OPPOSE US ARE EMPTY BABBLERS, since they are incapable of finding any substantial objections to our orders.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>ONLY LIES PRINTED</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Methods of organization like these, imperceptible to the public eye but absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed in bringing the attention and the confidence of the public to the side of our government. Thanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from time to time may be required, to excite or to tranquilize the public mind on political questions, to persuade or to confuse, printing now truth, now lies, facts or their contradictions, according as they may be well or ill received, always very cautiously feeling our ground before stepping upon it .... WE SHALL HAVE A SURE TRIUMPH OVER OUR OPPONENTS SINCE THEY WILL NOT HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSITION ORGANS OF THE PRESS IN WHICH THEY CAN GIVE FULL AND FINAL EXPRESSION TO THEIR VIEWS owing to the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. We shall not even need to refute them except very superficially.</p></li>
<li><p>Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press, in case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our semi-official organs.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>A great YouTube clip of one of Copper&#39;s last shows calling out Alex Jones, The Alex Jones deception:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHXdz4ApxOQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHXdz4ApxOQ</a></p>

<p>Saw Bill speak several times and he told a great story but something always felt off and not just from a deeper research of his biography.  Going all the way back to his jump out of the UFOlogy community and into the militia milieu.  He was a human like most of us but had his faults on display several times on shortwave which may have tainted his legacy.</p>

<p>Fortunately if you go back to his archive of shows and give a listen... He was totally correct about the national security state he was just unaware of how far technology would come just a decade since his death and how we are being oppressed by a technocratic tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s why that whole Alex Jones is Bill Hicks bullshit came out. I think Jones was getting tired of people bringing up the Y2k and Bill Cooper shit so now anyone who googles something like &quot;Alex Jones&quot; with the word &quot;Bill&quot; will be directed to the Bill Hicks nonsense instead of the Bill Cooper calling Jones a fraud. </p>

If any of you guys havent watched his show or listened to him talk for longer than 5 minutes do yourself a favor and just try listen to one of his daily shows. Then ask yourself if you would even be able to hold the mic for a fifth of the time for a once off event (like a wedding), then consider that he does kind of thing for two hours every single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given this some thought.</p>

<p>What about the whole Bohemian Grove exposé? Recording a certain ritual there? What was his motives? Has he in fact been trying to expose it from an anti-government standpoint, but at some point was bought by someone? I don&#39;t know this guy&#39;s history or former affiliations, so I&#39;m curious.</p>

<p>/If/ he&#39;s bought opposition, why expose people to an idea that seemingly didn&#39;t have the same amount of traction until the cremation of care footage saw its first light?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with OP. Was never a fan of Jones, he is over the top, exaggerates and quite frankly turns into a lunatic too often. He often tells half truths, diverts the conversation and spreads disinformation. Basically the perfect shill, sprinkle some crazy into the truth and detract others. I just don&#39;t know if he is meaning to do it.</p>

<p>His Trump shit was retarded, Pizzagate he deflected comet pong pong, space he told some Buzz Aldrin nonsense story, spirits from dimensional planes dictating to our elite? Reagan was good? Secret coups? Thats from the top pf my head and I know there was more. I really wish he took Joe up on the DMT offer.</p>

<p>This podcast pretty much confirmed why i should not bother with him, you won&#39;t be getting the truth or any real insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex always said that the does in on purpose to wake the public up. If he were to take a more moderate approach he would just have 400 views in his videos many of the conspiracy channels. The public that isn&#39;t aware or &quot;woke&quot; don&#39;t normally watch conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>So yes, there&#39;s a win-lose dichotomy with doing this, you look insane screaming and ranting but at the same time it sparks interest in the average person to search on the internet if whatever &quot;this luntaic&quot; said was actually true. And most of the times, it is. </p>

You just have to keep in mind that he&#39;s trying to make money. If he was boring/tame, etc. then way less people would pay attention to him, and he&#39;d make less money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think this. Then I realized that&#39;s the far simpler explanation is that Jones makes tons of money doing what he does, so he continues to do it. There&#39;s no ideology involved--other than greed. He&#39;s on no one&#39;s side but his own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call you woke, just suspicious. I&#39;ve read the thread you linked, it doesn&#39;t give real proof. Alex Jones says in the podcast that he&#39;s always been open that he has had family that worked for the government. Honestly, it makes sense that he would have family working for the government as they&#39;ve probably leaked things to him too. Believe what you want.</p>
