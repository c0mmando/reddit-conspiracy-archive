        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million, but lost the electoral college by a couple of thousand votes in a few states. How did this happen? A major part was James Comey. When addressing the E-mail issue a few months before the election, Comey had a press conference where he took the unprecedented step of outright criticizing the candidate for irresponsibility. There was clearly not enough evidence to go to trial, but instead of just saying so he made sure to make the most politically damaging statement he could. Now I believe that he would have loved to indict, but anyone with any legal knowledge would have been able to see that it was an absurdity. So it couldn’t have worked. </p>

<p>After the non-indictment, Hillary’s poll numbers tanked. That was the first time that people really believed that Trump could have a chance winning the election. Remember, most Trump voters weren’t really voted for Trump, they were voting against Hillary.
But a week before the election, it looked like Hillary would pull it off anyway. But then Comey releases a super damaging letter at literally the worst possible time. It was far enough from the election that everyone would hear about it, remember how irresponsible Clinton was, and let that affect the vote. It was close enough to the election that the retraction couldn’t have been spread around until it was too late.</p>

<p>Why did Comey want Clinton to lose so bad? </p>

<p>Let’s talk about Trump for a second. He won the election, but now seems to still be caring about the popular vote. Why would he have such a fragile ego about this? He won. He’s the winner. Oh sure, not winning the popular vote must sting, but he beat the system by being smart, shouldn’t he be basking in that? And he seems obsessed about this popular vote thing. Does he have some information that points to actual voter fraud?</p>

<p>And last question before we start answering them. Where has Mike Pence been this whole time? We never see him anymore.  He stands behind Trump during signings, and he has made all of one serious public appearance, at the March for Life. In it there seemed to be serious difficulties in getting the rally going again after Pence left. Sure, setting up for a vice president seems like a lot of security work, but him leaving should have been easy. Another strange fact? Pence barely mention god during his appearance at a pro-life march. The man who is one of the most openly religious people in vice-presidential history not mentioning god in his speech? What’s up with that?</p>

<p>Here’s where we get into speculation, but all the evidence is pointing here. Donald Trump is correct that there was voter fraud, he just doesn’t know that it was in his favor. Mike Pence has had a nervous breakdown, and he could barely hold it together at his appearance. After he went backstage he immediately collapsed and that caused the delay in the proceedings. And there was a concerted effort by James Comey to swing the election in Trump’s favor.</p>

<p>But why? </p>

<p>A little known fact about Hillary? She was obsessed with UFOs. In fact, she had promised, if elected, to open up all of the information that the US had on UFOs to the public. And this wasn’t just some sort of plea to get votes from the conspiracy crowd. At an appearance on Jimmy Fallon she had asked for him to ask her a question about UFOs and was disappointed that he didn’t. Why didn’t he? UFOs also made an appearance in the Podesta E-mails. So this wasn’t just a little thing. She really cared about this. She wasn’t going to let it go.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aliens.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aliens.html</a></p>

<p>James Comey knew that. He is also the head of the FBI, so he would have all of the information on UFOs. </p>

<p>Donald Trump is obsessed with this voter fraud issue. What if he’s right? Remember, the popular vote wasn’t even particularly close. He would need millions of people to have voted illegally for him to win that, plus they would likely be voting in California. Why would anyone illegally vote in California? It’s a huge risk when California is 100% guaranteed to go to Clinton. Yet Trump pushes on. What if it doesn’t all add up. We heard about so many first time Trump voters, 538 had a whole segment on it. So maybe Donald is right about voter fraud, just in the wrong direction. Only a couple of thousand votes in a few states would have pushed the election to Trump, and he won states that most did not give him a chance of winning.</p>

<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/missing-white-voters-could-elect-trump-but-first-they-need-to-register/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/missing-white-voters-could-elect-trump-but-first-they-need-to-register/</a> </p>

<p>To pull that widespread voter fraud off, you’d need a massive amount of coordination and a lot of manpower. You’d also need access. What if you claimed that Russia tried to hack election machines and used that as an excuse to inspect those machines, maybe doing a little hacking of your own in the process. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/fbi-james-comey-election-cyberattacks/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/fbi-james-comey-election-cyberattacks/</a></p>

<p>Now remember how Donald Trump didn’t care about managing the day to day issues of the presidency? Guess who that was going to be left up to? Oh right, Mike Pence. He would have learned all of the US secrets, and would be heavily involved in the work behind the scenes. But he makes no public appearances. He seems to have switched his rhetoric from God loves everything to a much more humanistic message. Has his faith in god been shaken? Maybe by something he has recently seen?</p>

<p>Let’s put this all together, and I’m sure it’s obvious where I’m going right now. UFOs exist. Aliens exist. Hillary was going to let the cat out of the bag. Comey couldn’t let that happen. He tried his best to make her lose votes. But it wasn’t enough. So he had to commit widespread voter fraud to make the numbers work. Trump senses something is off, but his ego won’t let him accept that he was helped. Pence was told about the UFOs and can’t really handle it. He’s had a nervous breakdown and his faith in God has been shattered. Once again the government has been able to pull the wool over our eyes, but eventually it will all break open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, do you know about James Comey&#39;s connections to Hillary?  His brother Peter Comey was the accountant-lawyer for Clinton Foundation.  So he has a HUGE conflict of interest in saying anything about Clinton.  He should have actually stepped down in the investigation, imo.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg with Comey.  Watch George Webb&#39;s stuff or read my cliffnotes (just search this sub for &#39;cliff notes&#39;) and start at the first one.  It&#39;s worth your time, trust me.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll see how James Comey is actually a cia cutout that has infiltrated the FBI to run a JTTF situation in america (basically CIA infiltrating all the government agencies and blackmailing people into controlling them).   Comey has some long ago dirt on him.  He&#39;s spent 30 yrs not doing his job (foot dragging).... if someone with a brain looked at his trajectory, he wouldn&#39;t have been Peter Principled up the chain but instead fired for abject incompetence.  I mean, if you&#39;re a normal person fuck-up, then you fuck up maybe 50% of the time.  You&#39;re just a marginal employee then that maybe they keep on becaue the government is really bad at firing underperformers and &#39;losers&#39; as Trump would say.  In private industry those people would be ejected at high speed fromt he company like a bullet, in the public sector, they stay on for 30 yrs and actually get promoted.  Anyway, James Comey sucks so bad at his job he&#39;s like a 100% failure at prosecuting the biggest, most damaging cases to ALL us citizens, over decades.  It&#39;s literally his job to protect us from vast conspiracies, but instead, he&#39;s a part OF those vast conspiracies so to my mind he&#39;s worthless</p>

<p>and if I were a judge, I&#39;d order a 1000 man team to investigate Comey and if they decided he&#39;s part of hydra, I&#39;d publicly rip him apart and televise it, because that&#39;s the only way youj&#39;re going to fight high treason, and grand-grand theft of the american way of life, putting us in great peril and basically ruining our culture</p>

<p>No really, I&#39;d have him drawn and quartered for treason.  Now it&#39;s possible that he has to walk on the wild side because the people he&#39;s &quot;let slip&quot; have done so, so many times that he&#39;s got to infiltrate them like some kind of double or triple or quadruple agent.   Seems silly, and occams razor just says he&#39;s a corrupt dick versus some kind of hero.  He could always take one for the team and give up his blackmailable offense if promised immunity deal.  In which case, maybe he&#39;s just put on permanent house arrest or witness protection and never allowed to work anywhere NEAR government ever again</p>

<p>Sorry but we were talkiong about UFOs.  Yeah I think that&#39;s just carrot-on-a-stick stuff.  They have not given us 650k huma abedin emails to which we are absolutely entitled under FOIA, I doubt they are going to tell us about jfk, 9/11 or UFOs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting point of view and I appreciate your imagination. Cheers. I would go the complete opposite way myself. I put it to you that there was indeed voter fraud, on a massive scale but that it was for HRC. The landslide was so immense for Trump that she still could not pull it off. Comey was chosen by the Dems so he was their man. The initial failure to charge her with crimes was met with mass resignations and a mutiny within the alphabet agencies. He had to deal with the situation for the sake of the country and tried to put it to bed before election time and failed because of the apparent collusion and damage caused by his inaction suggesting corruption. The good guys in the shadows that knew of the immense corruption, revolted and won the day and are the unsung hero&#39;s. OK now for the UFO&#39;s...who knows what is going on there but HRC sure as hell is into some weird shit (black magic). I still like your story, I suppose it is possible. Why did the Dems lose? They lost because the lost touch with the people. They didn&#39;t listen to the average citizen and they were not acting in the best interests of the common man. They got lost in their own echo chambers and people are tired of constant war, they wanted change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that literally hundreds of private polls said that Hillary was going to win. Hillary didn&#39;t really have any power, she couldn&#39;t have affected that. But Comey did have the power, and he admitted himself that he had agents going into polling places. Those agents didn&#39;t even need to know what they were doing. Just plug something into the machine for 10 seconds, wait for it to say everything is &quot;hack free&quot; and then leave. Only a few people need to be in on it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree this election was not won or lost because of Comey.  He didn&#39;t collude with the msm to give the primary to HRC.  Nor was he given any subpoena power because BHO directed the doj to disallow this crucial aspect of a proper investigation.  Furthermore the Russian government involvement is still speculation as no evidence exists that they were responsible.  The dems don&#39;t seem to realize that the identity politics they have embraced over the last 8 years has alienated many voters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the FBI programmed the voting machines to skip every 10th vote for Hillary, or whatever they needed to make sure Hillary lost, then yes, we would see smaller voter turnout.</p>

<p>Considering that prior to the election we were told that there was record Hillary turnout in certain areas of the country, including the most liberal parts of Florida, that could explain the discrepancy.</p>

<p>Comey had a press conference where he took the unprecedented step of outright criticizing the candidate for irresponsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well even her most ardent supporters would agree that she acted irresponsibly with regard to her emails. She was sending messages containing sensitive US information to a guy with no security clearance whose server was hacked by terrorists. The only thing unprecedented about it was the fact that someone so inept was continually praised for her experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was clearly not enough evidence to go to trial</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the former head of the Justice Department. Not really a credible source with the infestation of corruption that&#39;s been exposed with regard to &quot;Obama&#39;s&quot; (Citibank&#39;s) cabinet appointments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, most Trump voters weren’t really voted for Trump, they were voting against Hillary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And most Hillary voter weren&#39;t voting for Hillary, they were voting against Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but now seems to still be caring about the popular vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen that. He is merely trying to illuminate what the Podesta leaks already exposed. That a) she has a history of cheating in elections (vs Bernie), and b) there was already a plan in place to cheat in the general election using Google AI, mail in ballots, and the vast database they&#39;d compiled through the spyware on the Hillary for America website and their Catalist algorithm (which has the ability to determine within a margin of over 92 percent certainty whether a person listed as active on the voting registry is actually deceased. This is fleshed out in fairly precise detail using merely court records and wikileaks.</p>
