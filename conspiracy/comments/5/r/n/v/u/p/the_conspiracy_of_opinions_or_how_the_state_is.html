        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many awoken people I speak to IRL erroneously believe modern State propaganda - including shilling on the Internet - is meant to convince us what they&#39;re saying is real. This is not the case, and I can make that demonstration.</p>

<p>First it is important to grasp the importance of what game theorists call <em>common knowledge</em>. </p>

<p>Please consider the following puzzle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On an island where everyone knows each other, there are 100 people who have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. Since the beginning of times on that island, no one has ever known their own eye color, as there is no mirror (and no one ever talks about eye color, it&#39;s very taboo). By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers he has blue eyes, he must leave the island at dawn on the day of the discovery. </p>

<p>At some point, an Internet troll comes to the island, calls all the people together, climbs on a podium, and makes the following announcement in a bullhorn: &quot;At least one of you has blue eyes&quot;. </p>

<p>The puzzle: assuming everyone on the island is completely logical and lawful, what is the eventual outcome of that public intervention?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Think about it for a few seconds before reading further. Remember everyone already knows what he just said.)</em></p>

<p><strong>The answer:</strong> on the 100th day after the announcement, at dawn, all the blue-eyed people leave the island at once. It works with any other positive number of blue-eyed people (that is, if there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave on the kth day). The explanation is actually quite straightforward and is at the end of the post. </p>

<p><strong>The point is this:</strong> a troll came and didn&#39;t teach anyone anything. In this case everyone knew at least one islander had blue eyes, as they could all see it (although they didn&#39;t speak of it). Yet, they were living happily since the beginning of times; and now all the blue-eyes companions had to exile. What changed?</p>

<p>The answer is common knowledge. Not what anyone knows, but what everyone knows that everyone knows. What counts is not the fact the islanders heard the troll say what he said, it&#39;s the fact they all saw all the other islanders listening to him say it. The individual&#39;s perception of the crowd.</p>

<p>This concept is at the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">precepts of propaganda</a>; and it also embodies the role of the MSM (and fake polls); not to convince us of anything, but to convince us that others are convinced of something. The MSM is the metaphorical loudspeaker; if it&#39;s been on CNN, everyone knows that everyone knows. It&#39;s a terribly potent weapon.</p>

<p>Think about this: does Apple try to sell us an iPhone by convincing us it&#39;s cool, or by convincing us everyone else thinks it&#39;s cool? Do people buy Nike sneakers because they&#39;re good shoes, or because they think others think they&#39;re good shoes? Answering that question is unnecessary, as we know brands use celebrities to promote their products. </p>

<p>One doesn&#39;t need to believe Beyonce is convinced the product she&#39;s promoting is cool - just that others think she thinks it&#39;s cool. That&#39;s why people will buy a product promoted by Beyonce, although everyone knows she&#39;s paid to do it and doesn&#39;t really &quot;like it&quot;; they know others have seen the ad, and believe they&#39;re the only ones knowing the truth. </p>

<p>Do you see how effective this can be? </p>

<p>Again: to achieve their goals, and to guide action, the propagandists don&#39;t need to convince us that anything is real, apart from the fact that everyone else thinks it is. (They push the concept philosophically quite far, &quot;perception is reality&quot;, &quot;if everyone thinks something to be true by definition it is&quot;, and other nonsense, I won&#39;t get into that).</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, how does this work in real world propaganda? </p>

<p>First, they understand their enemy (the people) can have two very different types of intelligence:</p>

<p><em>Dependent Intelligence</em>: comprises most with university degrees. It manifests as a fact-based erudition, knowing lots of stuff about many things. This intelligence doesn&#39;t depend upon one&#39;s own mind or one&#39;s own senses; these can be delegated to the collective, the identity group. Its level is measured at the linguistic proficiency at repeating and summarizing, in a more or less elaborate or subtle way, what everyone agrees other intelligent people think. These are usually people educated beyond their intelligence (it does that).</p>

<p><em>Independent Intelligence</em>: all those who rely on their own eyes and mind to interpret the world. No need to spell it out, as most on this sub belong to that category. </p>

<p>For the first category, the propaganda is straightforward. From a position of authority, and with nicer words than mine, scream in a loudspeaker: <strong>Everyone who thinks bearded acrobatic pilots didn&#39;t pulverize the skyscrapers in New York on 911 is an utter dumb fuck and here is what he looks like.</strong> The loudspeaker is the TV. The screaming is daily. The picture shown is that of a lunatic. The dependent thinkers are thus immediately taken care of, as they rely on other people&#39;s minds, and such other minds have spoken. Whether they have private opinions when they&#39;re alone on the toilet nobody knows, and it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>For the independent thinkers, the goal is otherwise: first, they need to convince us other people are sheep. That&#39;s why they multiply the labels and the categories, and then caricature every label for every other one. That&#39;s also why the shills/tourists are acting as they are. The goal isn&#39;t to convince us we&#39;re wrong, but rather that most others are wrong and idiotic; that we&#39;re alone, confined to a small world of people who question/know the truth. </p>

<p>That happens to be false IMO, but that&#39;s what <a href="https://xkcd.com/610/">many still believe</a>. In the <a href="http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/psychology/social/asch_conformity.html">Solomon Asch conformity experiments</a>, only one third conformed when confronted with peer pressure about obvious geometrical questions (he argues that&#39;s quite high, and it was 1958).</p>

<p>But the Internet, and by extension this subreddit, is changing that status quo. First thanks to anonymity. One doesn&#39;t need to &quot;project an image&quot; that hard if one doesn&#39;t divulge who he is, or if he can have multiple identities. Second thanks to the abundance and free flow of information; free-markets always favor the emergence of innovation; the free market of ideas is bringing about the emergence of truth.</p>

<p>Know this: I love speaking to hairdressers and cab drivers when I get the chance. They&#39;re interesting because they speak to lots of different people. <strong>Many more humans are awake than we are lead to believe.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s the solution to the puzzle I promised:</p>

<p>Imagine there&#39;s only 1 blue-eyed islander. When the troll speaks, that islander understands he must have blue eyes, since he doesn&#39;t see (and has never seen) anyone else with blue eyes. So if there&#39;s at least 1, there can only be 1, and it must be him. He therefore logically leaves at dawn.</p>

<p>If there are exactly two blue-eye islanders: when nobody leaves at dawn on the day of the announcement, they understand they must be blue-eyed too. Indeed: they only know of one other blue-eyed islander. Therefore, he should have left on that first dawn. Because he didn&#39;t means he, too, sees another blue-eyed islander. But that blue-eyed islander can only be him, because he can only see one. They both leave on the second dawn.</p>

<p>If there are 3 blue-eyed islanders, they expect the other 2 to leave on the second day as per above; because they don&#39;t, each one knows they must have blue eyes, and all 3 leave together at dawn on the 3rd day. </p>

<p>This inductive argument holds for k &gt; 0, where k is the quantity of blue-eyed islanders. When k &gt; 1, no islander learns anything new from the announcement; the upheaval happens solely based on common knowledge. </p>

<p>Would you rather me restrict posts to anything related to the Left only? </p>

<p>CST has diversity of opinion. You may notice some Right stuff there because this website itself has a large liberal bias  (particularly due to the user demo). Perhaps your perception of something that doesn&#39;t pop in your echo chambers appears more prominent than it is? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Many many people know the truth but don&#39;t really know how to spell it out well enough (or so they think) - so they abstain from doing so. If you probe them however you find out.</p>

<p>Note also the dependent/independent thinker argument is not anti-intellectualist. Intellectuals by definition should have intellectual independence <em>and</em> know how to express themselves clearly. Pseudo-intellectuals are the ones who have the latter quality, but miss the former; the socialization of higher education has created hordes of them. They know too many words for what their minds can handle, so they regurgitate pre-cooked ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t responsible for what others do. You are however responsible for what you do. On a beach that&#39;s littered with garbage, you refrain from throwing your own garbage not because it will make a difference if you don&#39;t, but because it&#39;s not right to do it. There is no greater goal, there is only one&#39;s own conscience.</p>

<p>So that means first and foremost IMO refusing to participate enabling/financing the war criminals. Not because we&#39;re part of a collective action, but because we individually prefer living in conscience and in truth than to be liked.</p>

<p>in a society, don&#39;t we need to be somewhat responsible for others?  </p>

<p>If I see someone else throw trash on the beach, what is my responsibility as a member of a society where I know we don&#39;t want to have a beach full of trash?  And what if there are other people who also saw the person throw trash?  Do we have a collective responsibility to deal with that trash or that person, or an individual responsibility?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have an individual conscience (i.e. responsibility) of doing what&#39;s right. That means naming the wrongdoing when you see it, and calling it out.</p>

<p>Think about it this way - the most generous people are the ones who do good for their own personal, internal satisfaction. Because doing good makes them feel good. There can be no other virtuous reason to be generous (other possible reasons include for example: looking good, going to heaven, or making money).</p>

<p>Would you prefer being praised for having done the wrong thing, or criticized for having done what you know is right?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>well that&#39;s kindof subjective, right?  There are many contributors that can prompt generosity.  but &quot;generosity&quot; has a pretty broad array of potentially conflicting definitions, so I&#39;m going to re-adjust to &quot;altruism&quot; for sake of argumentation.</p>

<p>Altruism is, by definition, &quot;selfless&quot;.  And it&#39;s also a zoological term used by evolutionary biologists when trying to understand interactions of social animals, particularly those who self sacrifice.  At this point it&#39;s no longer about self preserving or necessarily experiencing a &quot;good feeling&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of &quot;others&quot; toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions.</p>

<p>The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with egoism, which is defined as acting to the benefit of one&#39;s self.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>behavior of an animal that benefits another at its own expense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when we extend this concept of altruism from a sociobiology perspect, we want to know what might make a &quot;moral animal&quot; be act in a selfless way- as a martyr.</p>

<p>One secular traditional perspective particularly preached by adherents of &quot;scientism&quot;, such a Gould or Dawkins, would be &quot;kin selection&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kin selection is the evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism&#39;s relatives, even at a cost to the organism&#39;s own survival and reproduction. Kin altruism is altruistic behaviour whose evolution is driven by kin selection. Kin selection is an instance of inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can produce by supporting others, such as siblings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection</a></p>

<p>another take on kin selection is that it goes beyond the protection of direct familial genetics, to a protection of the of a larger group- dubbed &quot;multi-level selection theory&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no &quot;greater good&quot;. It is an evil, collectivist concept. It means &quot;what the king says is best for everyone&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok, I hear the niche in there and now it sounds to me like you&#39;re preaching Objectivism- am I right?</p>

<p>&lt; Objectivism&#39;s central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one&#39;s life is the pursuit of one&#39;s own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans&#39; metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.</p>

<p>I mean, i think i objectively disagree with you if that&#39;s your philosophy.  I&#39;m with you as far as the whole &quot;rejecting tyranny&quot; thing, but I just don&#39;t think you can necessarily define &quot;the greater good&quot; as tyrannical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this perspective and these links.</p>

<p>I love Ayn Rand, for sure. But she&#39;s a materialist, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy">mechanist</a>). I don&#39;t ascribe to these views - and in particular their implications as to why we would do good (be altruist/generous). Because she&#39;s a mechanist, she has a nihilist and reductionist viewpoint: our prime goal is survival (oversimplifying much, but that&#39;s the gist). </p>

<p>I agree with the individualism embodied in her novels, the John Galt hero. But Galt should be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/5oof5i/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">spiritually enlightened</a>. He understands there is Good, Truth, and Beauty (with capital letters). There are absolute constants in the universe, and they are not only mathematical. In this sense I completely disagree with her.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree with this. When Jonas Salk refused to patent the polio vaccine, he said he did it for the greater good - he wanted everyone to have free access to the vaccine. There really are altruistic people in the world who believe in doing things for the betterment of mankind. Maybe their ultimate motivation is immortality or &#39;to get into heaven&#39; or just plain egotistical stroking, but ultimately they act for the greater good and not what &#39;the king&#39; wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry. All of your hard work will pay off in the future. My only advice, is don&#39;t force it on them. Send them a brief warning about the state of the world and if they are interested to hear more, follow up. That is the best technique. If you try to force it on them, they will shut down. When they invite you to hear more about this worldwide pandemic, then they will ingest whatever you tell them and later go do some research to see if its all real. </p>

<p>Still, everything will pay off in the future. People who think your wrong now will see the truth as it surfaces and it surfaces through people like you or anyone else exposing the truth. </p>

<p>This is where &quot;they&quot; got you - the shackles of social acceptance. Some have found they&#39;re happier once they have freed themselves from others&#39; judgements and expectations. You know, the whole &quot;dance as if nobody is watching&quot; thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what can I do to help? I&#39;m feeling completely helpless right now </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 15th century buccaneers of the North Sea said &quot;help yourself, then the gods will help you&quot;. </p>

<p>I found a similar thought in a book about Ayurveda: you can impossibly help others if you&#39;re miserable yourself. </p>

<p>Eat well. Read intelligent books. Meditate. Go on long walks, work out, live. Don&#39;t &quot;be yourself&quot;, it&#39;s a trap, the trap of complacency - become your better self every day instead. Set an example for others to follow. Expect resistance proportional to your progress. Overcome it. </p>

<p>Thus, you give others the opportunity to prove their greatness in admitting their need for help, instead of humiliating them with your offer. </p>

<p>If that sounds like Nietzschean reverse psychology to you: it is :) But this is a CST thread anyway, so just the usual disclaimer: this is no medical advice, try at your own risk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not alone. Don&#39;t give up hope. I kind of stumbled into a discussion of conspiracy theories randomly a few weeks ago. I was with a bunch of straight-laced older people, so I didn&#39;t expect anything, but an older woman--well educated, very religious, politically moderate--started sharing her theories about the moon landing and the CIA. A totally blue-pilled guy (a pastor) laughed it off at first and looked over to me incredulously expecting me to back him in thinking her theories were ridiculous, but I was like, &quot;Eh, the CIA has a recorded track record of things like experimenting on US citizens, I wouldn&#39;t put it past them.&quot;</p>

<p>Another middle aged woman was nodding along in agreement. The two people in the group who were skeptical at first had never even heard bad things about the CIA, and by the end their demeanor had changed and they looked very consumed by thought. I&#39;ve found that making people aware of MKULTRA and COINTELPRO, two things that they can easily learn about on Wikipedia, makes them infinitely more receptive to any other conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Stop telling people for a bit. You don&#39;t need to convince people. Your duty is to plant the seeds, not to evangelize. If you evangelize, you&#39;ll aggravate people.</p>

<p>I went a bit too hard and it had very negative consequences. Then I just... faded away. And focused on regaining people&#39;s trust. People who were starting to wonder about my mental health because of the things I was saying. I had to reaffirm my status in their minds as a reasonable individual, and obsessiveness is NOT mentally healthy.</p>

<p>Once I stopped preaching is when people started coming to me and telling me how they had started to notice things that I had mentioned. Some of them even started to preach to me exact things I had to tried to tell them before; they didn&#39;t even connect it in their minds that they were mirroring my previous words. But they connected me with openminded and when they started to recognize things for themselves, they felt comfortable coming to me to share.</p>

<p>Others were like... &quot;Hey, remember what you were saying about (x or y)? I see what you were saying now. Holy shit.&quot;</p>

<p>Look at it like this... we all were sleeping on a train track. You wake up, and you see loved ones sleeping on the train tracks next to you. You know a train is coming so you want to wake them up. But they&#39;re having pleasant dreams and don&#39;t want to be aroused. The more you shake them, the more angry they get at you.</p>

<p>Eventually, you have to walk away. If you try and wake the ones who don&#39;t want to be woken up, you&#39;ll still be down at the tracks when the train comes and you&#39;ll die along with them. And it&#39;s oddly counter-intuitive, but perhaps some of them will notice a lack of warmth where your body used to warm them and that will rouse them more than you jabbering at them.

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice submission. </p>

<ol>
<li>As an educated independent thinker, I found a major inconsistency in your categorization. :)</li>
</ol>

<p>You clearly state that educated people are likely to be dependent; then you imply that others (uneducated) are independent. I suggest that the correlation runs the opposite direction.</p>

<p>This submission itself is educational, and relies upon studies of academia to make points. So, if your characterization of dependency is correct, you are defying your own idea. </p>

<p>Why do you think it is that &quot;common knowledge&quot; that sociology and psychology are not important or even fake? Precisely to prevent people from studying these areas to enlighten them with more information to improve both their access to facts and their abilities to process facts.</p>

<p>BTW, the term &quot;common knowledge&quot; itself is undefined. </p>

<ol>
<li>I also wondered about this line:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>free-markets always favor the emergence of innovation; the free market of ideas is bringing about the emergence of truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <em>is</em> propaganda. You might want to remove it from the information. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your interesting inputs.</p>

<p>I said most with university degrees are dependent; your inference that means &quot;most without are independent&quot; is mistaken. I could be saying <em>most</em> with degrees are dependent, and <em>none</em> without degrees are independent (I&#39;m not, just illustrating the error you made). </p>

<p>But on the main point: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mine is not an anti-intellectualist argument (see <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/dd8wihq/">this</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m sure the average botanist is more intellectually independent on the controversies arising in botany than, say, the average pawn shop clerk. The point is there isn&#39;t much controversy in botany - or, at least, it does not really affect that many people.  </p></li>
<li><p>So I&#39;m not talking about botany, or any other sub-category of knowledge where independence/dependence may exist. I&#39;m implicitly referring to what we could call the &quot;world view&quot;. The dominant meta-paradigm humanity &quot;agrees on&quot;. The existential, political, and economic consensus. That field of study is resolutely in the hands of the State (institutional press/entertainment, subsidized education, etc.), as the title of my OP assumes. </p></li>
<li><p>In that regard, the common knowledge discourse is peddled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier">courtier</a> intellectuals. They are people with no courage, no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panache">panache</a>, no truth; they are traumatized, ugly people, utterly unproductive, who would be ostracized (or forced by nature to do an honorable job) if wealth was fairly distributed. </p></li>
<li><p>About the millions who parrot what the courtier intellectuals says, I harbor no hostility towards them. It is partially a consequence of the collectivization of higher education. Someone who would have been happier as a woodworker or a oil plant foreman is now a bank clerk or an assistant diplomat. They don&#39;t trust their own mind and ideas, because they forgot who they are.  </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not discounting education, or knowledge, as a tool of independent reason. In the contrary, I am praising the mind. The mind of the solitary man (or woman), alone with his thoughts, in conscience. I am a philanthrope, for I trust individuals; I distrust collectives. I trust the individual knows right from wrong. IMO you could prove evil is mostly done by those who have <em>delegated</em> their mind (and conscience) to the group - be it the government, a church/sect, political party/candidate, or other form of institution. It explains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">SS syndrome</a> at the very least.</p></li>
<li><p>Historically, great minds have tended to be abhorred they their profession. Geniuses are individualists, who don&#39;t conform. From Mozart to Molière, Galileo to Tesla, da Vinci to Coluche. The same thing is true for great academics, for there exists in &quot;academia&quot; the same mind-hive and propensity to conform as can be found in other artificial groupings.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern sociology and psychology (and macroeconomics) are pseudo-sciences. More precisely, they are garbage, different regurgitations of the same reductionist and nihilistic view of man. They rely on the wrong fundamental existential axioms.  (For the most part, of course there are exceptions).</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that freedom of exchange favors the quality and value of the good being thus exchanged is neither propaganda, nor is it an opinion. It is an observable fact in nature. We might dislike it but we cannot deny it. This is how nature works; trial and error and competition. </p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the exact balance, that&#39;s why. I don&#39;t want to give a percentage, it&#39;s not the point.

<p>I&#39;m done answering questions about my opinion on the ratios of dependent/independent thinkers as a function of education. It&#39;s a subsidiary detail, one sentence in the OP some cling to for whatever reason.</p>

<p>I will say this: there exists many who can express ideas in a more elegant, subtle and elaborate way than the ideas their minds come up with. Not necessarily because they&#39;re obtuse, but because they focus on form/appereance rather than substance. They will tend to parrot others, because their eloquence will thus enable them to easily project an usurped false image of erudition/wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an easy way I like to explain it. Imagine three neighbors decide to hire a security guard together; he will look after their homes while they&#39;re gone; each neighbor chips into the guard&#39;s salary; he&#39;s their employee, he works for them.</p>

<p>The neighbors <em>delegate</em> their right to defend their home and property to their guard-employee. He can stop burglars, but he cannot re-arrange the furniture in the living room of one neighbor on behalf of another neighbor. He doesn&#39;t have that right, because the one asking him to do it doesn&#39;t have it either, and could thus not have delegated it to him.</p>

<p>The guard in this example can be called the sheriff, or the government. Either we live in a tyranny, and we work for the guard, or we live in a democracy, and the guard works for us.</p>

<p>If he works for us, if he&#39;s <em>under us</em>, he cannot have any right that could not have been delegated to him. He cannot, because two-thirds of his employers ask him, loot the other third&#39;s garages. He cannot force you to pay for / to participate in a war. He can&#39;t send armed bullies to your door if your actions have produced no victim.</p>

<p>So either we live in a democracy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_sovereignty_in_the_United_States">People are sovereign</a>, and the government can&#39;t &quot;collectively&quot; do anything we can&#39;t individually do. Or we live in a tyranny. </p>

<p>Nationalism is a way to amalgamate free, sovereign individuals into a collective (in this case, the nation). Neo-nationalism must be a new way to do that. It would still put the collective above the individual.</p>

<p>This was a simplistic attempt to explain the <a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">idea of liberty</a>. People like Jefferson, Bastiat, Tocqueville, Mises, Hayek, or Rothbard have done a much better job at laying it out already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Trump means we will know for sure when the monetary event happens. He can either attend an international conference (&quot;Bretton Woods 2.0&quot;) and sign the US into a neo-bancor global money system (and say &quot;I negotiated a great deal&quot;). Or he can adopt an unilateral approach, e.g. confiscate foreign gold at the NY Fed and introduce a gold-backed &quot;dollar 2.0&quot; and fuck the world (a bit like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">1971</a>).</p>

<p>In terms of foreign policy, it mostly sums up to whether he&#39;ll do Netahyahu / Sheldon Adelson&#39;s bidding in regards to Iran, and in the slightly longer term whether he&#39;ll prosecute the foretold &quot;war of civilisation&quot; with Islam.</p>

<p>In the mean time, we can only <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">speculate.</a>.

My suspicions are that he earnestly means to attack (I don&#39;t mean militarily, at least not overtly) the EU because it&#39;s considerably weaker in various regards than Russia. Once the EU is disassembled the angry hegemon can then line individual parasite states in the EU and wider region to continue it&#39;s opportunistic undermining of Russia. Hillary wanted to do it the other way, first go after Russia and more leisurely after the EU, or have her successor(s) handle that. In any case, competitors to American political and (what amounts to the same thing) economic hegemony must be reduced to non-competitor status. The EU is the largest competitor, China then follows, the Middle East must remain an Anglo-American dominated sphere to the direct economic detriment of the EU. The only way the U.S. can retain its quasi-hegemonic status is if it destroys economic blocs that are not centered around it, that don&#39;t have it as the center of the spokes.</p>

<p>Brzezinski explained it well in his book <em>The Grand Chessboard</em>. </p>

<p>That continental power is the only possible rival for world domination to the anglo-American maritime empire (successor of the British Empire of the 19th century - it has taken an American and Zionist tone, but it&#39;s still fundamentally the same). </p>

<p>Today the EU is a vassal to the unipolar world structure (mostly centered in Washington DC). They need to keep the EU far from Russia, hence the sanctions the European were forced to impose on Russia, or the American destabilization of Ukraine. </p>

<p>One of the ways astroturfing changes minds is by sowing doubts in the minds of the target. This is how climate change denial became widespread,  oil industry knew they couldnt win by science so they spread doubts about science itself.</p>

<p>So it isnt wrong to say astroturfing changes minds, it does, just not through pure argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you bring up climate change denial. Even if it&#39;s not a 100% man-made contribution to climate change, the move off fossil fuels is action all intelligentsia supports.</p>

<p>There are scientists that acknowledge we are exaggerating man-made contributions to climate change to push an agenda of clean energy. I agree with the agenda of clean energy, however, we should be cautious in saying &quot;the science is settled&quot; because science is never settled. We should always question and push forward. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only way to convince the masses that we need clean energy is with doomsday fear-mongering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the way they use taxpayer cash is thru the fed reserve which prints it out of nothing and that system is set up so they can pretend we&#39;re in too much debt for things like socialized medicine or infrastructure anything to help the common man. spending it on fixing hurricane damage is better than the illegal wars at least but yeah taxpayers service the debt thru wage slavery either way.

    <div class="md"><p>well if it was just a natural phenomenon I doubt it&#39;s something that causes a huge rise of world temperature coinciding with the start of the industrial revolution and will cause mass extinctions in a matter of decades. if it was an ice age or I should say reverse ica age where it gets warmer it&#39;d be a much slower gradual change. So I think only options are it&#39;s fake and made up, or real and caused by humans. And I don&#39;t know which is the case.

<p>We can do a lot to stop it, but there is not enough incentive for rich people to throw money at it. Economies would decline, temporarily, if we immediately banned all use of fossil fuels until we adapted to alternatives.

<p>If you look at the internet culture then, and look at it now, i feel like the dress story is critical. It literally made people question their optic perceptions and their minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is all true, but i would make a distinction with what the troll who points out reality&#39;s goal is, and that of the propagandist. these are not mutually exclusive, but they are not the same.</p>

<p>your scenario was shown in real life in a class of a 3rd graders. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott</a></p>

<p>their teacher wanted to teach them about racism, so she divided the class into the blued-eyeds and the brown-eyeds. the initial sort had no effect on the children because what was pointed out had no more significance to them than the fa t that the sky is blue and the grass is green. the voicing of the mundanely obvious, which is where you example stops, has no effect on people, because no significance is assigned to it.</p>

<p>the crucial step occured when the teacher told the class that the blue-eyed kids were less than the brown-eyed kids. almost immediately both groups internalized this and began acting accordingly. in your scenario, the blue-eyeds in your scenarion will not leave because the obvious is stated, they will only leave if a negative association is assigned to being blue-eyed.</p>

<p>your scenario is the first step of the oldest and most effective method of population control--creating arbitrary divisiveness. further trolling along this line entrenches the divisiveness and keeps the population&#39;s attention focused on their hatred of each other, blinding them from the evils of those dividing them and controlling them.</p>

<p>propaganda has a different goal. its goal is not to sow divisiveness, but to shackle people to someone else through cognitive dissonance. propaganda must be false to work. the more blantanly absurd, the stronger the bind. also, the intended audience is not the population as a whole, but the small subset of insiders and those who are employed to protect them.</p>

<p>the easiest illustration of propaganda to comprehend this is the story of the emperor&#39;s new clothes.</p>

<p>the propaganda was aimed the court and it attendants. the propagandists were the tailors seeking power at court, which they got.</p>

<p>the emperor knew that he was naked. the emperor went along, because his ego would not let him acknowledge he was being made a fool of, and out of the very small, off chance he was not naked. he was literally exposed. the cognitivel dissonance this caused him forced him to suppress his knowledge of this to protect his ego.</p>

<p>the court and its attendants (including guards) went along out of fear of being singled out and literally expelled. they went along to protect themsevles from becoming nobodies with nothing. l</p>

<p>ike the emperor, this made them cognitively dissonant. they knew he was naked, but to protect their egos they convinced themselves he was not. those who could not do so, pretended to dobso, which also led to cognitive dissonce from shame.</p>

<p>broadcasting the court&#39;s absurdity to the public by having the emperor parade naked down the street followed by the courtiers oohing and awing, did not make the masses to believe the absurdity, it made them uncomfortable and unsure as how to react. everyone was waiting for someone else to say something. </p>

<p>this is where the sowing of divisiveness paid off. no one trusted anyone else to back them up and feared backlash both from the court and from those around them trying to avoid the court&#39;s wrath being directed at themselves.</p>

<p>it took a young child to point it out, because the child had not yet learned to distrust everyone and to fear the court. in real life, the masses wouldn&#39;t have laughed breaking the spell, they&#39;d have silenced the kid.</p>

<p>in 1984, orwell was trying to demonstrate the fact that propaganda must be absurd to work--war is peace, slavery is freedom.</p>

<p>the german masses were never going to not go along with the govt whether they believed the propaganda or not. they were always going to be good germans. the greater the fear and divisiveness, the greater the towing the line.</p>

<p>all of these hoaxes bei g staged--sandy hook, boston, orlando, the moon landing, are not for the public per se, but to bind the oligarch&#39;s handmaidens to them. every participant knows, or at least strongly suspects, that they are liars and that their charade was not even well excuted. their collective coginitive dissonance has bound them tightly to the elites--from police officers to reporters to mayors.</p>

<p>the elites know the public at large won&#39;t even pay enough attention to these hoaxes to see the absurdity. the story will flash on the screen and they public will accept it just as they do the sky being blue and the grass being green because they attach no significance to it. in fact these &quot;tragedies&quot; actually subvert divisiveness, because the inspire concern and compassion for the victims, and the bad guy is never remembered as the perp, but as the gun.</p>

<p>however, the effect of this is muted, because people already know that guns are dangerous, it&#39;s an insignificant truism, and because these guns are always wielded by mentally unstable people whom the public cannot relate to, even the fear the gun is muted because almost no one knows a homicidal madman or assumess one is anyone near them. people don&#39;t question the hoaxes because they have no reason to do so, and tbh, the hoaxes only interest them for the same reason car crashes do. it&#39;s just nationwide rubber necking. </p>

<p>most average ordinary people do not react with hysterical vitriol when presented with a conspiracy theory, at worst they usually just scoff. however, all it takes is a good oliver stone movie to sway them to at least question the official narrative.</p>

<p>the spittal drenched screeching comes from insiders, like bill marher. people who may even know the truth, but who bury it in layers upon layers of cognitive dissonace. the more violent their reaction to a statement, the more cognitive dissonance is wrapped around their ego.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve never bought into the theory that the hoaxes are staged to get rid of guns and abrogate the 2nd amendment. if they wanted to do that they would since somethin like 80% of americans already support stricter gun laws. they aren&#39;t afraid of us. and really, why should they be? they have the ability to crush us right now...your semi-automatic rifle isn&#39;t going to make a dent against their drones...just ask the poor folk in the 7 countries we&#39;ve leveled.</p>

<p>I think it is important to remember that the &quot;Independent&quot; and &quot;Dependent&quot; intelligence labels are just useful tools to give us a frame work within which we can discuss these issues.</p>

<p>It is possible for a person with the &quot;Independent Intelligence&quot; style to go through the university system so I would say just because a person has an academic background does not mean they are guaranteed to have a &quot;Dependent Intelligence&quot; style. These thinking style labels are only rough guidelines and are possibly changeable in a person as they go through life and as they find themselves facing different challenges in different contexts.</p>

<p>Most i talk to don&#39;t follow politics, i wonder how many people are as skeptical as i am</p>

<p>Then i remember the vaccine debate - only on the internet do people say you should be jailed for not vaccinating your kids. IRL how many people do i know that trust vaccines?</p>

<p>Nearly goddamn 99%, your homeless, poor, your officers your nurses or doctors</p>

<p>None of them buy it, I dont buy it</p>

<p>Where are the rabid pro-vaccinators IRL?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point, thank you.</p>

<p>I find that&#39;s true for most state violence. When you ask someone, do you think it&#39;s right for a guy with a gun to come and force me to do this thing you think is a good idea, if I don&#39;t want to, if I&#39;m peaceful if I&#39;m causing no harm to an identifiable victim? Most people say you&#39;re right, you shouldn&#39;t be forced, it should be voluntary. </p>

<p>Except of course if you harm, kill or steal from someone: then that someone (and by extension government) has the moral capability of seeking justice. </p>

<p>The vaccines example if perfect, because <em>injecting</em> some unknown substance into a healthy toddler&#39;s circulatory system intuitively sounds violent.</p>

<p>Note also how the common knowledge works in terms of responsibility: if you vaccinate and something happens to your child, you&#39;re not to blame, because you did what was commonly accepted. If you <em>don&#39;t</em> vaccinate and the child falls ill of the disease you could have (supposedly) prevented, then all the blame lies on you alone (even though you acted in conscience when you made that choice, and regardless of the actual balance of probabilities).</p>

<p>This delegating one&#39;s mind to the group, thus escaping individual responsibility, is what enables the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">SS syndrome</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why &quot;manipulation&quot;? one mod saw it on cst, asked me if i could post it on conspiracy, said that he was even in favor of putting it atop, if he could get 2 other mods to agree. i obviously agreed to mention cst in the title, since that&#39;s where it got noticed in the first place. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t see where&#39;s the problem. this deliberation took place publicly, everyone can see it in the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">original posting of this very same OP</a>. refering cst was a way to credit the curation value of cst subscribers, and to attract people who like more abstract conspiracy talk (my educated guess). Again, i see no problem with that, insofar as it is transparent.</p>

<p>as a submitter i was flattered to be told by an old-timer &amp; moderator that my posting was worthy of more attention. as a subscriber to r/conspiracy i expect the mods to do exactly that - helping distinguish relevant topics, which means 1) removing obvious shitposting/spam and 2) identifying exogenous content that could be interesting to this thread and ask OPs to repost them here.</p>

<p>if however you think my OP is not relevant enough, or imprecise, or wrong, I would gladly read your contradictory views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine there are 3 blue-eyed islanders: Alice, Bob and Charlie. Here is what&#39;s going on in Alice&#39;s mind after the announcement (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/ddaqera/">provided</a> the outsider&#39;s truthfulness is common knowledge):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, I hope I don&#39;t have blue eyes. I don&#39;t think I do, the outsider must be talking about Bob and Charlie. Bob will be surprised not to see Charlie leave on the 1st day, and Charlie likewise vis-à-vis Bob. So when nobody leaves they should both understand they both have blue eyes, and they should both leave tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when they don&#39;t, Alice understands the only logical explanation is that she has blue eyes too (and Bob and Charlie, as everyone else, know she has blue eyes). So she leaves on the 3rd day. Bob and Charlie also leave on the 3rd day, because they underwent the exact same though process as Alice did (vis-à-vis the other two). The green-eyed islanders expected them to leave on the 3rd day, and are all individually relieved when they do, because that means they don&#39;t themselves have blue eyes.</p>

<p>Now add a fourth blue-eyed guy to the lot, call him Dave. </p>

<p>He has no clue whether he has blue eyes; he sees Alice, Bob and Charlie, he thinks the outsider was talking about those 3. So he expects them all 3 to leave on the 3rd day, as you just imagined yourself expecting above. When they don&#39;t, he understands he has blue eyes, and leaves on the 4th day, together with the other 3 who underwent the same thought process as him.</p>

<p>Hopefully this clears it up. Note you are right to question this puzzle. It is a mere thought experiment, utterly unrealistic, and definitely counter-intuitive. Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic">better explanation of it</a>), together with the formalism game theorists use. Also look at the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/ddcijat/">links provided</a> by u/trumpetspieler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the explanation. I do understand the logic. I just think that enough blue-eyed people combined with logic would be effectively the same as the troll&#39;s public statement. I agree that every dawn n, you know that there aren&#39;t exactly n blue-eyed people. But, if there&#39;s enough people, then everyone knows that everyone knows that there has to be more than 1. Maybe it&#39;s because the &quot;everyone knows&quot; stretches into infinity, and the human brain can&#39;t handle it. I know it&#39;s hard to visualize a 5th dimensional vector. You can do 4 if you think of time as the 4th dimension, but even then it&#39;s hard.</p>

<p>There are probably holes in the following logic, but I spend a really long time on it, so I&#39;ll put it up anyway so it doesn&#39;t go to waste.</p>

<p>Compare what the people know from logic and what they can see, to the effect of the troll&#39;s statement in more restricted situations.</p>

<p>If I see at least 1, then I know there&#39;s at least 1, but I don&#39;t know what anyone else knows. It&#39;s as if I heard the troll, but I don&#39;t know if anyone else did. For example, maybe the troll is at the center of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a>, and I&#39;m in one of the cells. There are other people there, but I can&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>If I see at least 2, then I know everyone sees at least 1. It&#39;s as if the panopticon is made of glass, and I can see through it, but it could be one-way glass for all I know, so I don&#39;t know if anyone else can see through it.</p>

<p>If I see at least 3, then I know everyone sees at least 2, and I know everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It&#39;s as if I know the panopticon is made of regular glass, so I know everyone can see through it, but I don&#39;t know if the other people know that.</p>

<p>If I see at least 4, then I know that everyone sees at least 3, and I know everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It&#39;s as if I know that everyone knows the panopticon is made of regular glass, so everyone knows everyone can see through it, but I don&#39;t know if the other people know that everyone knows.</p>

<p>If I see at least 5, then I know that everyone sees at least 4, and I know everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It&#39;s as if I know that everyone knows that everyone knows the panopticon is made of regular glass. At this point, the walls might as well not be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now is a media war in America.  Trump&#39;s victory has proven how out of touch the media is with American citizens.  The problem is that deceptive tactics have a short shelf life.  Both sides right now are blaming the media for it.  Groups are becoming more polarized and quite a few are caught in the middle.  Both groups have major flaws.  Key information about the Muslim travel ban is that it is temporary yet the media is misleading their viewers into thinking it is permanent by not mentioning this.  Then, the Republican side tries to manipulate current evidence of information that makes them wrong.  Right now both sides are basically indoctrinating their followers against the other.  They know how to play the game and this needs to stop.  Otherwise, I will have to get involved and both parties will lose majorly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post except;</p>

<p>Your understanding of marketing and what companies like Starbucks or apple are trying to do is a bit underdeveloped. The reality is that it&#39;s actually more sinister than a blind popularity test. If popularity was the only metric, then niche brands or counter-culture brands would be severely disadvantaged, but brands such as Converse, MTV etc manage to maintain an atmosphere of being outside the corporate grind despite being literally billion-dollar enterprises. How?</p>

<p>Marketers today focus on &quot;lifestyle&quot; marketing. The finesse of building a brand since the 1980s has focused on creating a perception around the brand and it&#39;s perceived place in society. This perception or ideal is what the consumer actually desires, and they purchase the commodity in order to reach for this ideal.</p>

<p>For example, what seperate Starbucks from say, McDonalds coffee? Starbucks has successfully marketed its brand to appear as more elite, more cosmopolitan, and more sophisticated. When a person chooses Starbucks over McDonald&#39;s, it&#39;s because they desire to be the kind of worldly, sophisticated urbanite that they associate Starbucks with. Conversely, when they choose McDonalds, perhaps other desires drove that purchase; cost sensitivity, speed, etc. The pursuit of the &quot;ideal&quot; sold at Starbucks was either unwanted, or seen as an unaffordable premium.</p>

<p>This model works for most brands today. It&#39;s a huge part of the modern marketing strategy, and at the extreme end of the spectrum, the biggest brands don&#39;t even sell a product but just a lifestyle; Nike is for people who like sports, it&#39;s not just about the shoes anymore. </p>

<p>This system is infinitely more profitable than simply selling commodities. To reach the ideal, the Nike consumer has to buy dozens of products accross multiple categories, and even then, the ideal is not achieved; it remains a carrot dangling at the end of the stick.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very sinister. The modern marketting strategy a not to become most popular. It is to literally sell your dreams to you through selective purchasing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Trump means we will know for sure when the monetary event happens. He can either attend an international conference (&quot;Bretton Woods 2.0&quot;) and sign the US into a neo-bancor global money system (and say &quot;I negotiated a great deal&quot;). Or he can adopt an unilateral approach, e.g. confiscate foreign gold at the NY Fed and introduce a gold-backed &quot;dollar 2.0&quot; and fuck the world (a bit like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">1971</a>).</p>

<p>In terms of foreign policy, it mostly sums up to whether he&#39;ll do Netahyahu / Sheldon Adelson&#39;s bidding in regards to Iran, and in the slightly longer term whether he&#39;ll prosecute the foretold &quot;war of civilisation&quot; with Islam.</p>

<p>In the mean time, we can only <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">speculate.</a>. What is for sure is that he was the only non-war criminal running among lead contenders. He may acquire that inglorious title soon (he may have already) - let&#39;s hope for the best.</p>
