       They're slowly taking over here as well (today's attack etc.) with the new $40 million budget.

       Who said civil war? More like failed state. Big war, we run out of money, it's over. Or more likely, huge market crash, economy fucked. Already spent 8 years with crisis level interest rates. That's literally all they have in their arsenal to fight a recession. Lots of means to a different end, and I think we'll see it soon.

       Part of what's so scary to me is how people are talking about their fellow countrymen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been somewhat of a divide between "sides" and for the most part, that's never bothered me too much. Everyone has their own opinions and ideology. It's expected that various groups will clash every now and then, especially during election years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been okay with this because in general, even if some of your friends and family have a different political or social ideology than you, they were still respected. People have been able to bridge that gap and that divide. People still loved their friends and family members, respected their coworkers, still viewed the other "side" as human and always remembered we all have the same rights.
       <em>
        For the most part.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The past few months though, to me, definitely feels different. There has always been a little chaos everytime there is a new President, but this is
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       . People are losing their respect for one another and speaking about the other "side" as if they aren't even people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are way too many people who seem to be legitimately suggesting assassination or a coup, subtly and not so subtly. Not even just regular citizens either, but people who have the eyes and ears of thousands and millions. Again, people have always said some dumb shit, but this is a different magnitude altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people actually
       <em>
        suggesting
       </em>
       civil war even on reddit. Not just in the political subs, but all over the defaults and receiving thousands of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even
       <em>
        fully
       </em>
       notice how bad and scary it's starting to get until I actually saw someone getting upvoted, and not even reprimanded, for asking someone to kill a lot of Trump supporters for them. Those "Trump supporters" include quite a lot of my family members..
      </p>
      <p>
       It hammered it home when someone was getting downvoted for commenting that no one is going to want to fight a civil war over Trump and just how ridiculous that idea is. A person replied that it wouldn't be a civil war, but a revolution. My reply was that the 62+ million people who voted for him would absolutely view it as a civil war. To me, that seemed like a reasonable comment and distinction to make especially considering it was a legitimate election. The reply to that though, was "well stupid people think stupid shit."
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, I'd just brush something like that off.. but it occurred to me that that really is how a lot of people are viewing the people who voted for Trump. They're not regular Americans who won this election cycle. They're uneducated idiots who
       <em>
        voted wrong
       </em>
       and that it must be corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of people right now who are starting to (or already do) view and talk about tens of millions of their fellow Americans as completely inferior beings who no longer deserve respect, and whose
       <em>
        deaths
       </em>
       would be worth it to "fix the mistake" of voting for the wrong guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to generalize here, or accuse all anti-trump people of thinking and acting like this. There are plenty of people who don't support him, but still respect their fellow countrymen. There are plenty of people on every side who realize that if we want to make our country a better place, we all have to work together. We all have to keep seeing each other as humans who have valid reasons for voting the way we did. We all have to legitimately try to understand why so many people voted one way or the other and figure out how to bridge this widening gap. Everyone needs to realize that all of us, every single one, wants what's best for our families, our friends and ourselves and try to build off of that similarity somehow. But there is a scarily large amount of people who are completely rejecting that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really didn't mean to make this so long. It's just sort of been building up. Hearing and reading people talk about how dangerous and evil people from one specific group are. I don't have any racist or misogynistic friends or relatives, yet they voted for Trump. The vast majority of them were lifelong Democrats and Independents until this election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It definitely hurts to see so many people lump my very sweet mother into a group with nearly 63 million other people and who are being viewed as stupid and irresponsible. She doesn't have a racist bone in her body and she taught me things like giving a homeless person my lunch or the few dollars in my pocket is a good thing and that they need it more than I do. It makes me sad that so many people are wishing for her death while she would never wish harm on anyone.

       i don't think everyone agrees with everything Trumps says (i know some do), i don't think he's
       <em>
        all there
       </em>
       , but that's my opinion. the problem is that others assume that his supporters 'must' feel the same way because they voted for him. the same can be said for any politician. the
       <em>
        chasm
       </em>
       that we face now, imo is a backlash against the previous admin. stereotyping is a means of making someone 'the other', the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       this 'anger' that arises, when the 'old' is replaced with the 'new' isn't something new, it's more pronounced now because of the complicated mess that was engineered to take place. i don't like it &amp; i certainly don't agree with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's time for people to realize that all this has been planned, to continue to keep people attacking each other, which won't solve the problems we face. i'm sure more chaos is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       the blatant racism &amp; hate i see/hear disgusts me.
