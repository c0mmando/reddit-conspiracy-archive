    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a shill sir, but nice topic divert tactic you threw in there. Mixed with just enough circular logic to get me to bite. Yum!  </p>

<p>Trump had no choice but to run. The Ruskis, the Rothschilds and the Clintons made sure of that.  </p>

<p>Russia - gathered enough dirt to blackmail him into running and also offered him some sweet business deals in exchange for the (soon to be) lifted sanctions.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds - Trump was saved from bankruptcy by them in the late 1980s. One of the Rothschilds henchmen is now Trumps Commerce Secretary pick - Wilbur Ross. </p>

<p>The Clintons - Long time friends of Trump and the Rothschilds. Bill Spent multiple hours on the phone talking to Trump before he announced he was going to run. He was forced to convince Trump to run by the Rothschilds. This is evident in the Clinton email leaks, where hilary acts like a subservient lapdog to Lynn Forester de Rothschild.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 1987 Donald Trump purchased his first casino interests when he acquired 93% of the shares in Resorts International.  Resorts International has a sordid history which began in the early 1950’s when it evolved from a <strong>CIA and Mossad</strong> front company which had been established for the purpose of money laundering the profits from drug trafficking, gambling, and other illegal activities. On October 30, 1978, The Spotlight newspaper reported that the principle investors of Resorts International were Meyer Lansky, Tibor Rosenbaum, William Mellon Hitchcock, <strong>David Rockefeller</strong>, and one <strong>Baron Edmond de Rothschild</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>“In 1987, upon the death of longtime CIA front man James Crosby, the nominal head of Resorts International, up-and-coming young New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump stepped into the picture and bought Crosby’s interest in the gambling empire.”  </p>

<p>“Trump soon became a household name, with his colorful personality and his insistence upon naming a variety of luxury hotels, apartment houses and other commercial ventures after himself. But while the name “Trump” appeared in the headlines, the names of the real movers behind Resorts International remained hidden from public view.”<br/>
<a href="https://americanfreepress.net/who-towers-behind-trump/">Source</a>  </p>

<p>&quot;After quickly expanding the reach of Resorts International to Atlantic City in the final years of the 1980’s, Donald Trump found himself in financial trouble as the real estate market in New York tanked. The three casinos in Atlantic City, like other Trump assets, were under threat from lenders.  It was only with the assistance and assurance of Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. that Trump was allowed to keep the casinos and rebuild his threatened empire.&quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it&#39;s the age of the bots, shills and general agenda pushing I&#39;m use to it.  </p>

<p>And didn&#39;t even mention this part, in relation to Russia:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I want to highlight a story that many people haven’t noticed. On Wednesday, Reuters reported (in great detail) how 19.5% of Rosneft, Russia’s state oil company, has been sold to parties unknown. This was done through a dizzying array of shell companies, so that the most that can be said with certainty now is that the money “paying” for it was originally loaned out to the shell layers by VTB (the government’s official bank), even though it’s highly unclear who, if anyone, would be paying that loan back; and the recipients have been traced as far as some Cayman Islands shell companies. Why is this interesting? Because the much-maligned Steele Dossier (the one with the golden showers in it) included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions. The reason this is so interesting is that the dossier said this in July, and the sale didn’t happen until early December. And 19.5% sounds an awful lot like “19% plus a brokerage commission.”</p>
