<p>Nobody is saying that, but at least we aren&#39;t so cowardly that we turn people away from a safe place when they trying to escape wars that <em>we</em> created.  </p>

<p>You said &quot;look what happened to Europe, specifically Germany&quot;.  What do you think happened?  What is your personal experience in Europe that you are taking this from?  Which refugee centres have you volunteered at in order to inform your opinion?  Have you participated in any discussion panels regarding the crisis?  What were the opinions shared by the people who are actively trying to make a difference?  Why do you believe that the country that started this refugee crisis now has the right to close their border to those suffering?</p>

<p>You mean through biased media perspectives from thousands of miles away?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What does this even mean?  I sleep at night by helping those in need on a daily basis and not defending the cowardice of people turning away those who are most vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A country has a right to do whatever they want with their borders.</p>

<p>This point would be a lot more salient if the entire crisis didn&#39;t arise from a country imposing its will across the borders of another country ...</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t start with Europe, it started with the destabilization of the Middle East by America following 9/11.  Seriously, where are you getting your information??? Fox News???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s people suffering all over the world. There are other steps to take that don&#39;t involve completely opening up our borders.</p>

<p>These people <strong>need a place to go</strong>.  What are these &quot;other steps&quot; you would take when they are freezing to death in overcrowded camps in the most economically disadvantaged countries in the EU???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, though this is POINTLESS. I have never had a conversation with you where you change your perspective or anything like that. So why even argue with me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you are spreading ignorant cowardly nonsense.  People who spout the same nonsense that you do foster hatred and create an unsafe environment for a number of people.  I feel it&#39;s something that needs to be countered, I can do my part to make sure that lack of knowledge and ignorance doesn&#39;t start to dominate discourse that I participate in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least for me, I agree, I feel for those people suffering, but there are times where we need to put security first. Besides, Trump didn&#39;t start those wars.</p>

<p>But he is continuing them.  So your point is once again grounded in absolutely ignorant hypocrisy ... </p>
