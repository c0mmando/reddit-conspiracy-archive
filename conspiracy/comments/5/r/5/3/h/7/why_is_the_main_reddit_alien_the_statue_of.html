       I'm not really asking.   This is more of a request for new free speech platforms.  There seem to be a tech-monopoly from only 'one voice' versus an American panoply of viewpoints.

       I find the support of some for illegal immigration to be very odd, but right now the main issue now is about the banning of immigration from specific locations, especially those which aren't the among the prime cause of terrorism.

       You said "look what happened to Europe, specifically Germany".  What do you think happened?  What is your personal experience in Europe that you are taking this from?  Which refugee centres have you volunteered at in order to inform your opinion?  Have you participated in any discussion panels regarding the crisis?  What were the opinions shared by the people who are actively trying to make a difference?  Why do you believe that the country that started this refugee crisis now has the right to close their border to those suffering?

      <p>
       There's people suffering all over the world. There are other steps to take that don't involve completely opening up our borders.

       Again, though this is POINTLESS. I have never had a conversation with you where you change your perspective or anything like that. So why even argue with me?

      <p>
       At least for me, I agree, I feel for those people suffering, but there are times where we need to put security first. Besides, Trump didn't start those wars.

       This point would be a lot more salient if the entire crisis didn't arise from a country imposing its will across the borders of another country ...

        Again, though this is POINTLESS. I have never had a conversation with you where you change your perspective or anything like that. So why even argue with me?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because you are spreading ignorant cowardly nonsense.  People who spout the same nonsense that you do foster hatred and create an unsafe environment for a number of people.  I feel it's something that needs to be countered, I can do my part to make sure that lack of knowledge and ignorance doesn't start to dominate discourse that I participate in.

        At least for me, I agree, I feel for those people suffering, but there are times where we need to put security first. Besides, Trump didn't start those wars.

      <p>
       But he is continuing them.  So your point is once again grounded in absolutely ignorant hypocrisy ...

       Well, you're in luck! Given the American spirit, you can certainly create a new free speech platform of your very own! You can do it! Go West, young man!

       You're requesting free speech platforms, there are many of them. If those don't you, feel free to make one. If you can't make one, learn how. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. That is the American Dream.
