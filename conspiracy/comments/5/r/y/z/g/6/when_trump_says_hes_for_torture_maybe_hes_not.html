       No, I don't believe torture is effective, doesn't matter the person. It's actually quite irrational and illogical. Slap some cords to the ball sack of anyone, and hook it up to a battery, and you will get whatever "info" you want, merely because the person wants it to stop. If you want someone to say x, they will say x even if it's not true. Do it long enough, Whoopi Goldberg will admit she is not African but, Chinese and Polish.

       Don't get me wrong, my Earthly being says we should, but my Soul being says it's not right, and will not do any good in the long ru. I wish them the most hellish of existence if they are tried, found guilty and served justice for their crimes. Methinks hard labor above the Arctic circle is in order, and once they die, they can warm up in the firey pits of hell, until they are puked back into existence as a fly slopping up dog shit....

       I agree. But I might be wrong about the afterlife. And I'm not the one that is going to be torturing. And there may be 1 million pedos out there.

       Karma is real (I know this), and I don't necessarily believe in "heaven" and "hell", just giving an illustration of what I'd like to see/what they deserve... When committing such atrocities, you descend in conciseness, rather than ascend (which is the goal - to keep ascending). I believe in a mixture of many different things...

       You just need to look at his history, his words,  his past and current actions. Like seriously. This is a guy that has lived by wealth and power. He is literally part of the elite. He's a past donor to the Clinton's, the Clinton's attended one of his weddings. He himself has been accused of raping a 13yo girl at NYC party hosted/organised by Epstein. He is a clear narcissist and I believe he is ALL about power and money
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are too many coincidences in pizza gate, so I believe there may be something to it. But I also believe trump and his team have their own power grabbing agenda. I believe there are two big narratives that people should be paying attention to. Pizza gate is one, trumps power grab is another. I believe it is a coup, and I believe it has been successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has not drained the swamp, he has just filled it with his own swamp. He wants total control and his actions speak more to this than his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me there is infighting between two really really bad sides, both fighting for control of the system, and here we are the people, thinking that we need to take one of their sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       FUCK THAT. You can fight against two atrocities at once. Global citizens are doing good work to uncover both, but everyone thinks they need to be on one side or the other. You think trump has the best interests of commoners like me and you at heart? If you're putting all your eggs in the trump basket, you will be extremely disappointed.

       Cool so you gonna provide me with sufficient evidence that trump is on our side and fighting for us? Got proof he's gonna take down pizza gate and free us from control by the system?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool. Not gonna sit down and write an essay with references for you mate. But your comment doesn't help your own case. Where's the evidence to disprove the possible scenarios/narratives I laid out? Good discussion bro. Thanks for your valuable input

       Hey bro, I'm all for taking down pizza gate. If it does get done, it'll be done quietly. General pop would literally not be able to handle the truth, think those up top wanna handle the fall out of citizens hanging elites in the street? I don't even know what Share blue is, but given your such openness to civil discussion, I'll assume it's a dig at me. Good stuff buddy

       Says the 'open minded individual' having digs at a comment he disagrees with rather than discuss. As I mentioned in a different comment, Ur exactly the type that literally repelled me from pizza gate initially. Ur exactly the same as the brain washed liberals you love to dump on. Ur not gonna win anyone's support for pizza gate with your approach. But whatever dude. You are 100% right about 100%. Keep going

       I just wanted to make the point that people shouldnt see things as black and white, two sides therefore you have to pick one. I just think that way of thinking is wrong in these situations my friend. Being critical of one side shouldn't make you not criticise the other, that's all. And both pizza gate and the Russian dossier,  yes there are many coincidences!
      </p>
      <p>
       Really not sure what you're getting at with the question I'll be honest. But I'll play along. I'm gonna say trump a peso for $5000 Jimmy.

       Critical thinking means that when a grouping of trump rumors is so weak that it includes a 4chan piss goof...you can conclude the document does not deserve any thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's rape allegation...could it be a smear campaign? What happened to those charges? Where was this lady before? Where is she now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's relationship with Epstein is easy to learn about. He kicked him out of a golf club.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been outspoken about pedos for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is going after pedos this week. Their will be arrests as soon as Sessions is confirmed. Trump just tweeted about "evil". That means pedos.

       What if Trump didn't know the Clintons were bad OR he was pretending to be with them? Also, the accusations against him could be the other sides way of discrediting him.

       This is the problem with unsubstantiated claims against both the trump situation and pizza gate though isn't it? A lot of 'what ifs' at the end of the day without hard evidence linking everything together. The same argument could be made that accusations against Clinton and co have been fabricated (elaborately with great detail) to discredit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that's the case, but healthy scepticism is a good thing. But. In my opinion I don't think he's a good guy in any of this. Maybe I shouldn't have made such a definitive statement on the matter, when really it's mostly my opinion, but I the amount of blind following of trump is not a good thing. I was originally repelled from pizza gate, because a majority of those pushing it, would let their blind acceptance of trump bleed into their arguments. But once I removed the right/left filter I could see that both narratives are definitely possible.

       One thing about Pizzagate is that we know the elite in government are filled with child predators. So it definitely seems there needs to be an investigation. And I agree that we shouldn't ever condemn people completely unless the facts are overwhelming, but we should definitely explore the evidence and try to understand all the possible scenarios.

       I agree with everything you said there.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more point I'd like to make why I think pizza gate needs to be viewed with bipartisanship though, is I suspect a lot of republicans have ties to it somewhere along the line as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went down a rabbit hole many years ago. Rituals at bohemian Grove to the owl God Molech etc etc blah blah. Alleged footage of rituals appeared during the time of Republican rule. I have no doubt both parties engage in some fucked up fuckery. They're all 'elites'
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey if trump takes down those even inside his own party with ties to pizza gate, I'll give him credit for that. But that doesn't mean he can't continue with a power grabbing agenda in parallel.

       There's no doubt about that.. they control both sides. But the left sides mainstream supporters seem to be much less open to the worldwide conspiracy it seems. I guess their agenda aligns with the new world order - socialist - so they are more invested in the whole thing and less open to the conspiracy.
      </p>

       Have you read Trance Formation of America? She says high level people on both sides are involved but there is always the possibility she could be trying to smear one or both sides so it's tough to know what to believe.

       Or what if trump is an operative. Maybe he was groomed from a very young age to fight against a corrupt system. But the system is so fucked that it's almost impervious to anybody that's not already compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ppl could see what was coming an they knew the only way to get any power is to go undercover. So thats what trump did he went undercover and took on the business man persona    hes brushed shoulders with darkest parts of this system he's may have at time even taken part in some dark things but he never forgot what the end game was. Its possible that we are witnessing one of the biggest and longest cons in history.  He always stayed away from politics becuas he knew at this point we would not trust anyone in gov.
      </p>
      <p>
       He played us all. He played everyone and used the estric real estate mogul as his beard to hide his real intent the whole time. And now he has made it into what some call the most powerful position in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say trump is not our friend and I'm inclined to agree. He's a sleeper agent that just wanted to restore our great nations place in the world. And dare I say change the world. For the beer or worse only time will tell
      </p>
      <p>
       *this is just a wild speculative theory laced with heavy optimism . it goes deeper but I think this I will just end it by saying I thought he recently flipped on torture becuas one of his genrals said it's not effective

       He is mason but he belongs to a cretain order of the masons that are for Jesus .I'm not preaching here just pointing out they are diffrent from the run of the mill Masonic order. I think they might be called the nights Templar. And is it not possible that this fraternal order had a plan all along to fight against what they saw as evil or wrong.
