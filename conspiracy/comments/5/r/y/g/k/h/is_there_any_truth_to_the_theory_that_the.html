    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy you have a sense of humor. You don&#39;t sound like a moron at all, it&#39;s tough to soak it all in at once, especially when it can be such an emotional experience. Let&#39;s see...</p>

<p>Consciousness... focus. Our consciousness is a mystery to &quot;science&quot;. You could spend a lifetime thinking about awareness and focus. But most importantly we are taught we use &quot;5 senses&quot; touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing. Right now we are using the internet which we cannot experience using any of those senses except in the very specific circumstance where we have a computer specifically for downloading 1s and 0s and converting them into information we can understand. This is similar to the universe where &quot;visible light&quot;, what our eyes can see, is tiny compared to the other parts of the Electromagnetic spectrum. So we have a very powerful mind however it only has tools to experience very little of what is actually happening around us. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum</a></p>

<p>With wage-slavery it goes to a type of property is theft argument which assumes that without a government that uses force and incarceration we would simply be able to farm, trade and pursue happiness without the need of taxes. It seems most compelling to me because we are born into a country with an ID that demands that we pay its tax collectors money. It&#39;s a scam from the start that you didn&#39;t get to agree to. </p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of this whole situation is that all it takes is for people to realize these things and demand to not be poisoned and have control over their resources and faculties. The powers that be keep people fighting and abusing each other to distract them from these aspects of living.</p>
