       With that Seaman guy talking about all that bs Adrenachrome and seeing a lot of commenters not know their shit let me explain some things for you
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hunter S Thompson talks about Adrenachrome in his book fear and loathing in Las Vegas which I'm sure everyone knows but what most people may not know that whole drug he made up and by that I mean the effects from taking it he never took it in the first place but added to his book to just make it that much more crazy
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is Adrenachrome? It's adrenaline in your body it has no psychoactive effects on the human brain meaning it doesn't get you high.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Go buy an epipen and inject yourself with it basically the same thing. Now that you did that did you get high, stoned, buzzed? No you didn't
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then these fucks who have a following and usually also say they have the insider knowledge on shit you can't prove spew it up and put it in their books so people will listen to them. "Oh by the way buy my next book to read more about the subject" ya these guys go and spew their shit so they can get what? The money and attention
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are all looking at the wrong substance, Alex what is N,N-Dimethyltryptamine for 500 please.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Alright ready to start being called a shill and all the typical bullshit cause I used facts and dissed people's idols and what not.

       I am actually wondering if the powers that be have been exploring with DMT for a while now, and are hiding what they found from us.  It seems very odd that people have similar trip reports.  How can that be?  "Look at this!"

       Naw I have a hard time believing that those stuck up ignorant self absorbed assholes have ever done heavy psychedelics
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT shows you things that would weigh so heavy on your conscience if you ever became a high ranking politician, to be in that position and know all the harm you were actually causing... to have the mental depth to be able to emotionally relate with every person and animal that your votes and acts negatively effected
      </p>
      <p>
       Nah those assholes may do stimulants and opiates but there's no way they are open minded enough to be psychedelic people, not enough heart

       A little bit of K is like being drunk but without the naseua or hangover
      </p>
      <p>
       And lots of K is a very very intense psychedelic experience that's almost impossible to explain, it's complete disconnection from everything you know and everything you are, it really puts things into perspective

       But why would anyone settle for the mediocre effects of placebo high when they are rich enough to afford real drugs
      </p>
      <p>
       If they like killing that's one thing
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have enough experience with both meditation and drugs to say with absolute confidence that a placebo effect is when you put your car in neutral and push it down the road, doing drugs is like putting gas in the engine and flooring the pedal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had infinite money, political connections and vast resources I'd be spending it all on scientists to develop the perfect research chemicals like MXE or 2CB, hell if I wanted to just be high all the time I'd hire my own personal ayahuasca brewer and just drink that all day
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems alot easier than trying to find enough kids to kill for their blood, anyone who thinks blood would be a preference clearly isn't aware of the marvelous New drugs science has been coming up with lately

       Only thing matters is what they believe, not us. Like their spirit cooking, moloch, whatever.

       Plus, everyone has felt the rush of adrenaline in their life and know how powerful it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we know from victims they rape and abuse these kids so bad they have out of body experiences, why wouldn't they think killing them at the moment then drinking the blood would give them that rush?
      </p>

       Idk to me it sounds like something they would believe.

       Sounding real and is real aren't the same I agree they do fucked up shit but for people to just blindly accept what people like Seaman and Icke are saying as truth in this sub none the less is disappointing. When their are us who understand psychs and use them on a regular basis not to mention facts is just asinine to believe otherwise

       You said yourself most people don't know. These people have access to the same information as everyone else, heard the same stories, same movies, and I'd argue are even less of what you would call a critical thinker.

       And you really can't argue the effects of adrenaline, how do you explain thrill-seakers, or adrenaline junkies. It's powerful stuff man.

       David Icke has access to the same info as you and me they just like you to think they know more and you can hear and learn all about it in their book, just say that shit to make money when in reality they don't know shit
      </p>
      <p>
       And yea man I'm a adrenaline junkie I got long boarding down big ass hills go snowboarding hitting big as jumps nothing like floating in the air for a few seconds but to think drinking blood will get you high from the adrenaline is dumber then a box of rocks seriously go get an epipen its synthetic adrenaline and inject into yourself then let me know if it gets you high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or cut yourself and drink the blood let me know if your tripping nuts after.
