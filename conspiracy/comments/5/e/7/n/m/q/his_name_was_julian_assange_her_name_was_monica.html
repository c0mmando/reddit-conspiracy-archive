<p>Source for Danny Casolaro</p>

<p>Questions about the death of Alan David Standorf, a Whitehall High School graduate whose corpse was found at a Washington, D.C., airport 10 days ago, may never be answered because of the highly classified nature of Standorf&#39;s Army job, his brother said yesterday. Standorf&#39;s body, with no visible wounds, was found the night of Jan. 28 under clothing and luggage on the back floor of his small car, Sheehy said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dad died almost two years ago of Parkinson&#39;s. IIRC, the reporter had been lured into flight by a Johnson confidant, with the promise of more about the story. He was thrown out of the plane somewhere over Texas. </p>

<p>To put it bluntly, my dad was probably as much of an asshole as Johnson. But he kicked ass at his CBS job, and as a result, he had a first hand view of history. In addition to being stationed at the White House for all of those years, Dad covered the Watergate hearings, and was also one of few people in the room when Nixon resigned. He went with Dan Rather on that first trip into the former Soviet Union (a test of &quot;glasnost&quot;). </p>

<p>Dad also did some side jobs for the government, mostly around DC. The jobs involved wire tapping and powerful mics to get info from and about foreign governments. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of my dad and other CBS guys with RFK. <a href="http://www.cbsretirees.com/Pumo%20Gallery/image9.html">http://www.cbsretirees.com/Pumo%20Gallery/image9.html</a>
Dad is on the far right. I was surprised to see him without his suit jacket; Mom says he lent it to RFK for the photo.</p>

Hey, would you happen to remember the name of that reporter that Johnson had killed to help cover up his part in the JFK assassination?&quot; </p>

<p>On a much less sketchy note, I will see my mom for Thanksgiving, I&#39;ll ask her, and maybe she&#39;ll remember.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday with Mom (my husband has to work today.) She was reminiscing on the past, and how my dad always had to work the holidays... when I saw my &quot;in&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;Mom, remember the story dad told about the reporter that Johnson had thrown from the airplane, because he knew something about Johnson&#39;s role in JFK&#39;s assasination?&quot; </p>

<p>She knew <em>exactly</em> what I was talking about - except it didn&#39;t happen in Texas, she said it happened north of Washington, DC. She confirmed that it was a friend of Johnson&#39;s from Texas who took a male reporter up in a small plane; they flew over a body of water, and when they landed... the reporter was gone. </p>

<p>Considering the geography of the area, the reporter could have been tossed into the Potomac (not likely), the Chesapeake Bay or the Atlantic (more likely).  </p>

<p>I asked Mom if she remembered the name of the reporter, and she responded, &quot;No, it wasn&#39;t someone well known - but the guy must have been affiliated with CBS somehow. Your Dad and the other guys from CBS were really rattled.&quot;  I asked if others in the Press Corps outside of CBS knew about it, and she said, &quot;Oh, yeah. Word spread - it was used as a warning.&quot;</p>

<p>I probed for a few more minutes, hoping to get more. But that was it. </p>

<p>So, yeah, no name of the reporter. If I ever run into one of Dad&#39;s co-workers from back in the day, I&#39;ll ask if they remember a name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for all of your efforts here. I really think it would be worth-while if you could find out more info from his co-workers. The reporter&#39;s name would be useful of course, but the friend from Texas&#39;s name would also be interesting. They keep on doing the same old things over and over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story about Monica Petersen is a lie.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p><a href="/u/rutkdn">/u/rutkdn</a> has been claiming for days now, that Bella, a friend of Monica Petersen corroborated his claims that Monica had been investigating Clinton in Haiti and that her death had been suspicious. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a statement form Bella which she sent to me after I asked her on Facebook</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to help get Redditt to take down the thread and stop disrespecting Monica and her family.   Her death had nothing to do with a Clinton conspiracy and she wasn&#39;t even researching that.   The details of her death are not anyones business, this is private information that some jerk posted on Reddit after he was asked to keep it private.  Monica was researching sex trafficking which is when a person pimps out a minor for prostitution, and it has nothing to do with Clinton or pedophile rings.  These people have posted this crap all over redditt which is totally disrespecting the family. None of you people seem to have a clue what Monica research was about because you are so quick to jump on the trafficking narrative.  Here is a audio show that interviewed Monica a few months before her death.  Stop tagging Monica name into this shit.  It is all over online and is upsetting to her family, especially since its not true.  Episode 26: Fighting the Trafficking Narrative from </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me then ASK HER YOURSELF. DO YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION BEFORE BLINDLY BELIEVING SOME ANONYMOUS GUY ON THE INTERNET.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I have now been contacted by 3 different people privately trying to convince me that there is no link to the foundation. This is really bad. Something is going on.</p>

<p>I repeat, Monica was clearly investigating Clinton.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Back in January 4th Bella shared Monica&#39;s findings: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png">http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png</a></p></li>
<li><p>The day before, on January 3rd, she re-shared a post originally made by Monica with a link to a blog post critical of Hillary Clinton (second item here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png">http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png</a>). <strong>&quot;Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ...  This is the theory my masters thesis puts forth&quot;</strong> ----&lt; how do you not see what Monica was up to? Are you blind?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Also FYI, the family has NOT RECEIVED MONICA&#39;S BODY. I repeat, they did not bury her and an autopsy was not done in the US. They are trusting misinformation coming out of Haiti.</strong></p>

<p>If anything, Bella must be very scared at this point. I tend to agree with that gut feeling.</p>

<p>Also, the link you sent is work that Monica and Rex were involved in many months ago, not anything recent.</p>

<p>I never denied that Clinton has dirty business in Haiti. .</p>

<p>Show me where Monica connected Clinton to child trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange is still alive, its a setup to pressure the embassy to get is internet back. All the small evidences of wikileaks being compromised is part of the plan to get people to protest in front of the embassy and the bigger plan is to get him out of there, people need to talk about him, especially now that Trump is president. Assange is a genius. Just think about it for a minute, the typos, the reddit sub being compromised, the hash of the unzipped file instead of the zip, the bitcoin message for 8chan, the edited interview... etc... Assange is a genius!</p>

<p>And ignoring people like john Pilger stops us from having any power and makes this sub look like a circle jerk of conspiracy nuts.</p>
