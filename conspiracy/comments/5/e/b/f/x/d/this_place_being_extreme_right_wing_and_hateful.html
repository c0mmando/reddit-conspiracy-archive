<p>During the Bush years it was lefties for 9/11 truth and exposing war crimes, FEMA screw-ups, and Big Oil and Military-Induatrial corruption etc perpetrated by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>Now that Obama has been in power for 8 years it&#39;s swung the other way with the far right posting about shootings-as-false-flags, Clinton&#39;s corruption, beltway pedophiles, and George Soros&#39; open border NWO. </p>

<p>Conspiracies follow current events. Its cyclical just like the politics it&#39;s a reaction to. I&#39;m sure Trump will swing it the other way again with all the potential for conflicts of interest, outsider corruption, and inevitable alt-right civil rights baggage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you&#39;re saying it&#39;s unfair for this sub to go after the (far more than the GOP at this point in terms of power/scope) corrupt DNC. I mean. What is a conspiracy sub if we are not going to discuss corruption at the highest levels of government? The DNC literally rigged their primaries. We&#39;re supposed to go easy to be &quot;fair?&quot;</p>

<p>So, when I&#39;m writing a legal memo (keeping it to what I know), I find a LOT of cases. I try them all out to see if they&#39;re valid case precedence for whatever claim I&#39;m investigating. </p>

<p>Extrapolating that, people are fighting the bad guy for the first time in any meaningful way. There are pizzagate fanatics, where is julian fanatics and it&#39;s a thing of beauty. </p>

<p>Wow, you mean I get to come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and not just feel an  overwhelming sense of dread? I get to see people from all over the world digging for the truth because they GENUINELY want to save lives? Hell yes. I&#39;m sick of being the nut for knowing 9/11 was funky. Sick of folks ignoring the corruption of the Clinton&#39;s, Obama&#39;s and Bushs.</p>

<p>If i have to dig through some wild speculation, that&#39;s fine.
If I have to be vigilant in making sure I&#39;m not being insidiously mislead, that&#39;s fine.
If I have to skip the threads on demons and selling souls, that&#39;s fine too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you on this, and I&#39;ve commented on it quite a few times over the last year. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people have well-informed discussions about psychological techniques for public manipulation in one thread, go into other threads and fall for the very tricks they were just discussing.  Unfortunately, what we&#39;re witnessing is the creation of useful idiots. Some of them absolutely <em>do</em> know better and will wake up to themselves once things calm down... I hope. Others have had their &quot;eyes opened&quot; to the Good News and for them to take off their newly-tinted glasses it will be just as hard as it was to discard the last set of spec&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the hunger for scandal shutting off people&#39;s fucking brain filters </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if Pizzagate is 100% true, it is being used as a distraction. While the right-whingers have been screaming about the Dem&#39;s plans to destroy the Second Amendment, they&#39;re now deeply involved in something that looks tailor made to shred the First. Remember Huma Abedin, the potential Saudi spy? Some do, but most are more interested in her husband and the bulk of attention is on Podesta. </p>

<p>&quot;Poor Podesta. Remember that time reddit went on a witchhunt over the Boston Bombing? Now they&#39;re teaming up with that notorious hacker 4chan to besmirch the good name of Hillary&#39;s campaign manager. He&#39;s such a swell guy, these are all just lies. They&#39;re peddling Fake News. Fake News is bad. There&#39;s nothing to see here folks. There&#39;s no spies hidden among the really real Satanists. We should just get rid of Fake News. Huma who? That&#39;s just Fake News. &quot;</p>

<p>Again even if it&#39;s all 100% true, Pizzagate is a honeypot. People are actually being <em>encouraged</em> to expose their computers to potential child porn. Genuinely honest cops, all over the world, are paying as much attention to this as all the paedo&#39;s hoping to hit the jackpot. Beyond that, the NSA has a list and you&#39;re all on it. A list of everyone that has had any involvement in this. A list that could be used to blackmail people into keeping their mouths shut. A list that could be used to manipulate public opinions.</p>

<p>&quot;The notorious paedophiles reddit and 4chan have made it apparent that something <em>has to be done</em> about Fake News. We should just get rid of Fake News. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeNVoozb0KE">Maybe a little re-education is in order.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Same thing with CTR. How could it have a name if it didn&#39;t exist yet.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when I saw CTR first start being used, but I remember seeing the alt-right being discussed about two years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4He3klbJNf0">Here&#39;s</a> a guy who identifies as part of the alt-right last I checked, and he&#39;s been on YouTube for like four years. Did he have some secret media access to the term?</p>

<p>Just because you hadn&#39;t heard the term doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t exist. Also, how else would you propose distinguishing ideological schisms? You might have a point that the media is over covering it, but, again, that doesn&#39;t mean it was made up.</p>

<p>Again, I agree. When I was out of school and working part-time I kind of went down a rabbit hole of looking into it. Not necessarily just the alt-right but neo-nazi stuff, &quot;dark enlightenment&quot;, race realism, all that stuff.  It mainly started when I came across a user submitted film review of Lord of the Rings on Stormfront. My main takeaway was &quot;Wow these people are pretty dumb and I know a few who actually think like this&quot; not &quot;This is a political movement that is gaining ground and needs to be stopped.&quot; Not all of the YouTubers, bloggers, alt-news sites, etc. used the term but they had enough overlapping view points that it works as kind of a catch all.</p>

<p>The thing is Trump&#39;s immigration stance, agree with it or not, did align with a lot of those people&#39;s. And, the fact is, Richard Spencer is big in those circles and he came out and supported it. Does that warrant coverage? I don&#39;t know, but should we be in the business of telling news stations what they can and can&#39;t cover? There&#39;s always going to be a spin whether intentional or because writer&#39;s are human I&#39;ve always advocated for sifting through multiple sources and trying to figure it out on your own even if I fail at that sometimes myself. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s people who have been using it as a hashtag from Nov. 1st 2011-November 1st 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ~40 mentions in an entire year back in 2011?  Compare that to just this November.  Hundreds and hundreds of mentions in 23 days.  So many in fact that I just scrolled for two minutes and didn&#39;t even reach the end of them.  That&#39;s the point I was making so thank you, the publicity and popularity of the term in 2011 is not even remotely comparable to the explosion over the last four or five months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sub reddit has been around for six years (click the page a ctrl + f &quot;a community for&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it existed, but interestingly there isn&#39;t a single save on the waybackmachine for this sub at any point between 2010 and July 2016.  And if you check July 2016, you&#39;ll see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711091803/https://www.reddit.com/r/altright">this</a>.  Note the stickied post: &quot;<a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a> has now hit 500 subscribers&quot;.  This is July of this year, 500 subscribers.  The sub now has <strong>7.5 million</strong> subscribers.  That&#39;s in four months.  Over 7 million new subscribers in four months.  Again that proves my point so thanks a second time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The movement is getting more coverage, but the media didn&#39;t invent it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t need to invent it.  In fact it seems like this guy: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/ayrnieu">www.reddit.com/user/ayrnieu</a> might&#39;ve invented it seeing as he created the subreddit in 2010 and made weird posts trying to explain what it was even though there were no subscribers.  Who knows who the hell that even is though, his post history is sketchy and he&#39;s no longer a mod there.  But regardless, the point is that the media has influenced this crazy explosion of &quot;alt-right&quot; garbage in the last four months.  It came out of nowhere and is now everywhere.</p>

<p>If you would have just said this originally instead of saying it was invented originally I wouldn&#39;t have said anything. You might have been being tongue and cheek but this is probably the hardest sub I&#39;m subscribed to tell when that is happening because, by the nature of this sub, people post some pretty weird theories.</p>

<p>Anyway, we probably agree on more than we don&#39;t. Again, I&#39;m probably influenced by the fact I looked into all that stuff well before (in media terms) it blew up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, most ideas exist in some form, at some level, on some scale.  Take any idea you want, no matter how outrageous, and if you put it into google the odds are you&#39;ll find some results of people who thought of the same thing before you.  You might even find groups of people who all agree about that one thing.</p>

<p>The conspiratorial aspect comes into play on the social engineering level - when you see something like this &quot;alt-right&quot; literally <em>explode</em> in popularity almost overnight, you have to consider whether that explosion was organic.  More often than not, explosions like these are being guided and helped along from behind the scenes by the media or by internet astroturfers or by subliminal programming or dozens of other ways.  Social engineering is an advanced science at this point and the internet is its greatest tool in history.</p>

<p>And yes, a lot of social engineering strategies do come out of places like Langley and the Tavistock Institute, so we need to ask the question when we see things like this.  We need to consider where these ideas come from, why they&#39;re suddenly so popular, and what effects they have on a large scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people&#39;s standards for what actually consistutes racism or sexism have become insane.  There is a vendetta against people acknowledging literally any form of distinction from each other whatsoever, and labelling that as bigotry, when it is nowhere close.</p>

<p>If you want to see stuff that can justifiably be called sick, then go and watch the neo-Nazis in /pol/.  Nobody here is like that however, and if they are, the mods come down on them like a ton of bricks.</p>

<p>I wish I hadn&#39;t been born in this time period, most of the time to be honest.  I am sick of political correctness.  I&#39;m sick of the Millennials, their mobile phones, their tearful, suicidal, continual self-pity, and their inability to psychologically cope with literally anything that they either haven&#39;t predicted or disagree with.  They&#39;ve been out physically bashing people for voting for a political candidate who they don&#39;t like.  They don&#39;t believe in democracy at all, despite what they say, because democracy offers the possibility of an outcome that they don&#39;t want.</p>

<p>If you are one of them yourself, then you won&#39;t have an enjoyable time in this sub, but none of us will apologise to you for that, either.</p>

<p>I am disappointed, though, that this subreddit seems to think Trump is different from the rest of DC.  He may have had a voice at one point but he was compromised by the establishment when he became the nominee.</p>

<p>Not to mention how people seem to accept the things he says at face value. That is troublesome. We should be worried when the majority of people believe the politicians are being honest. </p>

People not basing their whole political ideology on gender, women&#39;s rights and immigration is not hateful. People being dicks is not hateful, it&#39;s just people being dicks. Also, people have the right to be a dick and base their political ideology on whatever they want. Sorry, rant over.</p>

Meh.</p>

<p>How invested are you in shaping this subreddit?</p>

<p>I personally wish the hyperpartisan Americans would get over the entertainment division of their Military Industrial Complex and this contrived divide with it&#39;s specifically vectored Messiahs.</p>

<p>Trump is the alt right Obama.
After the 8 dismal years recently endured the other side gets to feel good about the illusory matrix of &quot;American Democracy&quot;.</p>

<p>They can all Hope but the real power of the Military Industrial Oligarchy will not essentially Change.</p>

<p>Trump has been sold as a Change agent but beyond cosmetic rancour the real &quot;Changes&quot; will not be his to make.</p>
