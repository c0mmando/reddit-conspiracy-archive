       Oh idk. Maybe because the entire dnc is in on it? Someone from the dnc resigns they just appoint someone else to do the dirty work. It's not just a select group of corrupt individuals. All political parties are corrupt to their core. Their goal is to get elected and once elected they focus on their campaign for reelection.

       I understand that.  But when your hand is caught in the cookie jar in broad daylight, these corrupt organizations have to at least
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       they work for the people.  It would set a bad precedent to not fire her, but I don't expect that they will.  It will come back to bite them, I can guarantee that.

       technically she committed voter fraud and manipulated information. Getting fired is not good enough, since what she and DNC did was against the law.  Also the GOP stated several time that they openly rigging the system against Trump and still failed.  So yeah both partys do shady shit and worst people get is a slap on the wrist.

       I agree completely.  People should be pissed, and part of the real blame lay with the DNC.  Right now they are trying to set the narrative, and they need to be called out.

       The only other group worthy of blame for this fucked up election cycle beyond HRC and the DNC is the MSM.  They colluded with the DNVC directly, placed pro-clinton stories for the DNC and clearly avoided talking about Bernie altogether.

       It’s not voter fraud either way, voter fraud is when a voter cheats, this would be election fraud because it’s an official doing something shady.  That doesn’t matter though, because I don’t believe there are many laws that restrict party politics.

       PS-- Have a look at her Twitter feed.

       I've been watching it for weeks.  You'll notice some patterns.  Brazile uses
       <strong>
        her religion, her ethnic background
       </strong>
       and other people's comments to protect herself now.  She feels unaccountable.  If she lies enough and ignores her detractors, they'll simply go away.  Never mind the DNC is the most to blame for this election cycle, and for their role in destroying Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most current comment is a re-tweet commenting on nazi's and racists anti-semites and bigots having some kind of meeting in DC.  Interesting that the DNC head should speak about fellow citizens in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brazile is also using Gwen Ifill's death in an unseemly way on Twitter.  She's not "celebrating" her life, she's trying to compare herself to Ifill and shouting down her detractors with a disgusting ploy.  It's nauseating.

       And it's so frustrating! As someone who sides more with Dem values (or at least what they've been pandering to, idk if they actually believe in any of that anymore) than Rep values, I want to see the Dems do really well (speaking in blue pilled terms of course). But there's absolutely no way I can ever support an organization this corrupt, and acts so childish about it.

       Instead of looking at themselves and asking why they lost the election, they point fingers and blame everyone else. "Fake news," Racism, Russians, etc.

      <p>
       Instead of answering serious questions dealing with shady ass evidence, they completely disregard the question or just blatantly lie about it.

       i dont know how anyone saw here as the answer. She has failed in everything, literally everything. Not one supporter of hers can point to a cause she championed that didnt end in sheer fuckery. People say, well shes a woman and thats a good touch. Nah, Tulsi Gabbard et al would have been the move, but Tulsi doesnt appear to be apart of the system.

       Well I think people were influenced by propaganda, and that's essentially it.

      <p>
       The saw the headlines but didn't read the articles.

      <p>
       They saw the polls and voted for who they thought would win instead of who they wanted to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       They met the candidates, but never asked about their resumes.

       As for the DNC, I think they just wanted a continuation of Obama's presidency. For whatever reasons those might be.

       Exactly.  People aware enough of the truth refused to vote for her.  Clinton is a status-quo, corrupt to the core war hawk, darling of wall street and a straight up republican except for roe v wade and some gay rights.  Looks like at least 6 million refused to vote for that horror.

       This is something I've been wondering myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donna Brazile should be in prison for a subversion of democracy to meet her desired results.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything could be considered illegal voter manipulation its gotta be this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to get this issue to gain more traction is by conflating Brazile with the DNC
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way you get CNN to issue a statement saying that they had nothing to do with the potential subversion of democracy and then the issue is at least in the news again.

       the real answer is that this is how the clintons operate, they incentivize their people to be loyal and break laws because they will cover for them, give them a job at the DNC, at the very least , if the heat becomes too hot like with debbie wasserman schultz , a job at the foundation

       Came from a strongly Democrat leaning background, and voted predominantly Democrat my entire voting lifetime. I do not recognize what the DNC has become, there is a sense that the party has been completely hijacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my west coast Democrat leaning cable-car riding perspective, this infiltration has to be purged and the party returned to something recognizable before moving forward.

       There was a good point made

       that we're having difficulty getting rid of the Wasserman's and the Brasile's because they know where all the skeletons are buried. In response to that one strategy might be to expand the review of what role everyone in the DNC was complicit, and shine some bright public lights, to draw attention to it. There are people down the chain that have future career prospects to consider. Raise the pressure across the organization so that it's more palatable to allow a sacrificial lamb as appeasement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a wonderful visualization of the Podesta emails breaking down the connections within his contacts. It would be informational to review a similar illustration of connections within the DNC along with organization chart as a basis for exploring who are the players closest to Wasserman, Kaine, Brasile, and closer scrutinize what we know of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasserman and Brasile have to go in order to move on from the HRC campaign and bring back Democrats soured by the experience. The work Sanders is doing is solid foundation for the long-game that will payoff over the next decade. In the short-term we need more heads to roll within the DNC to send a clear message that this unethical "we got to win this thing, not come out unscathed" will not be tolerated.

       They will pay the price for their willful ignorance and hubris.  Either by way of more lost elections and the eventual collapse of the party or by the complete overhaul of upper management, and most importantly the purging of all Clintonites.  We need a total “DeClintonization" of the DNC.

We need third and fourth and fifth parties to be taken seriously.  Now is one of the only opportunities in our lifetime where this is even feasible.  Let's get on it.

       Fuck it let her stay. DNC can have as many weak links as they want until they overhaul their entire structure and focus on things that can actually get someone elected like: unify and empower the increasingly marginalized "middle class" of 250 million (mostly poor) americans to do rewarding shit like save the world. Till then... keep looking bad... you're good at it ;)

       Most of that "poor middle class" is in the top 5% of the world.   Also, I think the rest of the world has had enough of your "saving the world" over the last century.  Maybe it's time to stay in your own country and STFU for a while, k?

       I believe you're right.  They had already ousted 3 others along with DWS, so don't want to highlight that it happened again in rapid succession.  I'm glad I wrote this thread because it reminded me that I really shouldn't care.  They are still doing themselves a lot of harm by underestimating the number of people who read wikileaks, etc.

       2 firings in 5 months? They look like rejects from a circus clown car already, think of what another firing would do. Besides, muslim brotherhood already circling the wagons looking to get their man Keith in. It won't be long.

       If the DNC fires Donna, they'd have to admit their is a problem with their internal personnel.  The DNC is not done blaming everyone else and once they've finished they might self-reflect and fire her. Though I doubt it.  The DNC is said to be primed to use identify politics with another female front runner soon.

       She did EXACTLY what she was supposed to do.  They don't want to fire her.  Why wasn't the whole DNC leadership arrested and charged with fraud for colluding with Hillary against Bernie (and by process, the rank and file who financially supported Bernie thinking that the system wasn't rigged)
