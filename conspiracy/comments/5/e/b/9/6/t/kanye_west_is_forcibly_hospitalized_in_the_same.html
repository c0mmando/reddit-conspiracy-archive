        A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at

        Louis Jolyon "Jolly" West

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in grants from the federal government, channeled through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a major funding conduit for CIA programs. Many millions more poured into the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute that West headed, including over $14 million in federal funds in one fiscal year before he stepped down.

       And they all seem to go in with similar symptoms. I remember when Britney Spears had this weird
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uegvMPjZizA">
        British accent
       </a>
       (it's a bit later in the video but this was during her meltdown period), and here's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZtFoq10lBU">
        Lindsay Lohan
       </a>
       's quasi-Irish/Canadian accent. You can tell by looking at both of them that they're totally out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the MK Ultra program one thing the "programmers" do is compartmentalize the person into different personalities. This might be that aspect "leaking."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why it's interesting to hear of celebrities with alter egos.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9PYL2sGzKk&amp;amp;t=28s">
        Nicki Minaj
       </a>
       (start at 3:09-ish) has at least 3
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRgTACQ6Cp0">
        alter egos
       </a>
       , Beyonce is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHnOKUTwinE">
        Sasha Fierce
       </a>
       ("out there" video but interesting), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think when that starts to break down, they start having meltdowns.

       Late reply, I know, but Bret Easton Ellis wrote the inspiration for Zoolander? I had no idea.
      </p>

       I can see where the ideas about subversive mind control came from.

       No problem on lateness, always happy to talk about BEE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia page here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama

      <p>
       Yeah, and it's fantastic. Imagine American Psycho, but instead of 1980s Wall Street it's 1990s celebrity/model/club culture. Perfectly hits the zeitgeist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main character in Glamorama is also in The Rules of Attraction. His main part in the movie is a montage of his travels in Europe, which he did in character. One of the people he ran into while doing that was actually reading Glamorama (and a lot of the plot of that involves film crews and questions about reality). She freaked out and phone stalked him across Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can watch the montage here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an unreleased (and probably never to be released) feature length edit of that montage:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Zoolander is stolen directly from Glamorama like the model-slash-actor vs actor-slash-model joke. Glamorama is funny, but it's super dark and intellectual, as opposed to Zoolander's goofiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just finished reading everything BEE wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       My order:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lunar Park - Post-Modern homage to Stephen King. Plays a lot with authorial identity and perception. BEE is the main character, and there are a lot of similarities between character and author, but other clear differences (real BEE is gay, BEE in novel has a wife and kids and lives in the suburbs) -- makes you question what is real and what is not. Has a lot to do with father-son relationships. The first chapter is very different stylistically from the rest, so keep that in mind if you decide to read it. Probably the most novelistic and easy to read of his books. One of the books that has had the greatest emotional impact on me. Everyone I've recommended to (and who followed up and read it) has loved it -- they note he's a master of pacing, and he manages to shift gears at just the right times to keep a grip on you. It references his other books, but it's not necessary that you have read them as he sets you up with the info you need to know.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Glamorama - Stylistically similar to American Psycho, another book that perfectly nails the zeitgeist. Models as terrorists. Conspiracies galore. His personal favorite book of the one's he's written.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         American Psycho - His most well known book, so probably not worth saying much about it. Second best film adaptation
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Less Than Zero - His breakout book, High School age. Bleak and minimalist. Film adaptation tones it way down and is a fairly decent forgotten 80s teen flick.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rules of Attraction - His book about college. It alternates being told through the ideas of some different people. Some of the scenes overlap slightly, and it's interesting to see what different way in which people perceive things. Great film adaptation, the most faithful to his writing style.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Imperial Bedrooms - Sequel to Less Than Zero, 20 Years Later. Pretty meh.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Informers - Collection of short stories. Obviously done to fulfill a contract. The film is completely unwatchable.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I can talk more on this, but that's probably good for now.

       With the risk of sounding like a complete illiterate, I'm not a a big reader, but you're certainly convincing me. I have a great deal of respect for writers like William Burroughs and Brett Ellis, so I do have some level of interest here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any suggestions? Excluding Glamorama, of course. I'm definitely going to read that. It sounds incredible.

       I said it before in this thread, but read Glamorama, the book Zoolander ripped off. It's almost as if Zoolander is the limited hangout/whitewash of Glamorama, which gives you an idea of how dark and deep that gets it into programming and false flags.

       I'm a big BEE, his podcast is great. I've also read all of his books. Glamorama and Lunar Park are my personal favorites. Glamorma is for 90s and fashion as American Psycho is for 80s and wall street. As great as American Psycho is, he really perfected that particular writing style in Glamorma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lunar Park is a beautiful post-modern homage to Stephen King. It plays a lot with the author's identity. The first chapter basically is written as if every bad review and piece of gossip about him is true, as well as adding him having an out of wedlock son (with the same name as his father.) It's an incredibly touching book, and the one that makes it most clear that BEE is not a sociopath, but rather he is very familiar with the worlds of sociopaths given his upbringing and celebrity status.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Informers is garbage, short stories written in High School and College submitted to fill a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imperial Bedrooms is the sequel to Less Than Zero. It's not that great, but it's short and deals a lot with exploitation and satanism in Hollywood.

       What kind of drugs do you think they put these celebrities on? There's reference in a couple of Kanyes songs to lexapro (ssri) and he says something about how crazy he is when he doesn't get his lexapro.. I think Amanda Bynes was for sure going thru adderall psychosis and Brittany most likely as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can speak from personal experience that psychiatric drugs will absolutely change your personality and I imagine a lot of these celebs are on several different medications. These drugs can make people extremely manic over time and what I just watched Kanye go thru and the others is uncomfortably familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not only put on these drugs to be controlled by the industry, but also to be able to function on that level of magnitude as a human being you would need some kind of substance. To survive in that world you would need to be sedated in some form.

       Sure is. One thing I just happen to notice that doesn't make sense to me is Acetylcholine.. That's a neuromuscluar transmitter that makes your muscle tissues able to "fire"/contract. I don't see how it would be used for amnesia. It's antagonist Scopolomine can cause Amnesia effects. Not sure why I decided to actually write this, it just occurred to me. I guess though it is used in EEOM so could just be more to it I don't know about it. Just thought it strange right up there at the top.

       I work in vet medicine, and sometimes we give intracardiac injections to very small animals to euthanize them since hitting a vein would be too difficult. The drug also works a lot faster then as well. Hitting the heart is a lot easier than hitting a small vein. Though this is rodents and other small animals I'm talking about.. I don't know how small of children they are talking about, but possibly it could be easier than trying to inject into their veins, I don't know. Need a nurse to chime in here.

       that list is not just drugs used for amnesia/mind control, its a list of drugs they use for all aspects of their thought and behavior modification programming. in fact if you scroll down they detail how they use drugs to produce strange or painful physical reactions like blood pressure increases, histamine reactions, heart rate changes, and other painful or uncomfortable reactions to reinforce their programming. It's absolutely within the scope of their practices to use muscle contraction manipulation as part of behavioral conditioning. Scroll down below the list and they go into detail about several of the techniques used.

        I think Amanda Bynes was for sure going thru adderall psychosis and Brittany most likely as well.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why do they get psychotic? Is it just a side effect of adderall, or is it because they take too much or is it when they stop taking it? Do this happen to school kids on adderall that aren't in mk-ultra aswell? Sorry for bombarding you with all these questions, but i don't really have any personal experience with adderall and its effects

       Adderall increases dopamine in the brain. It's used for people with ADHD who are theorized to have less dopamine than they need to stay on task etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much dopamine (or sleep deprivation) leads to psychosis. Those with very high dopamine levels are more likely to end up psychotic. Adderall keeps you awake, which leads to sleep deprivation if you aren't careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Improper use of adderall = sleep deprivation and increased dopamime = temporary psychosis.

       Another artist that speaks truth, Z Ro, refers to being put on lexapro also. That's wild. It's also probably the reason that the rundown areas of cities have so many drugs easily available. Depress and sedate the population so they don't do shit. Keep them running in circles.

       Nikki isn't the first rap performer to have multiple alter egos.... e.g. Eminem - Slim Shady, MF DOOM - Viktor Vaughn - King Ghedorah, Madlib - Quasimoto, Tupac - Machiavelli. All examples of people who have different styles and personas depending on the name they are using.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Beyonce one just looks like a load of bollocks IMO, a lot of the comments are taken out of context and it makes sense that a performer who has to have an agressive/powerful stage presence would adopt a persona for such times if it differs from their normal personality.

       I've seen that prick Gavin McInnes on Fox News. What an enormous racist tool, and I don't say that lightly. I'm fine with criticizing Islam, but saying Arabic looks and sounds stupid, that all Muslims are insatiable killers, etc. should be a hint to everyone that many criticisms of Islam are based on hatred and not rational thought.

       Whoah. Let's not drag Madge into all this. I know a regular person who lived in UK for years and developed an accent. I will lay odds I'm not the only person here who says "tl/dr" irl...there's something to be said for picking up language from your environment.

       For the average person everything has become a celebrity driven society. These celebrities through mass media can reach out to tens of millions of die hard fans. These are die hard fans that love their favorite celebrities. They want to be, look and think like them. They want to buy what they are wearing. They want to buy the products they are using. They even want to have the same views as them. Katty Perry has 94 million twitter followers. You think a single news channel has the same amount of viewers as that? ...No. If Katty Perry endorses a political candidate, you don't think millions of her followers would agree with that choice? These are average people we are talking about who don't dig deep into politics and spend hours of their days researching and reading both sides of political issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask me. These celebrities have so much power and we don't even realize it. With a single message they can boycott and bankrupt small-medium business. With a single endorsement they can make someone a millionaire. I don't think it's crazy that the government has at least some control or power over them. I would think it's even crazier that they wouldn't control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not even talking about outrageous conspiracy things. The government has the power to snoop out any shady things that these celebrities might have done and use that as blackmail/leverage to control them. They don't even need to find out anything, they can just make up a fake story and end their careers overnight. They can arrest them on false charges. Look at Assange and the fake rape accusations used to discredit him. There are so many celebrities that were also falsely accused for something they didn't do like Tupac. Then once their public image is tarnished, you can just kill them off without a public backlash.

       You can rape someone and be a freedom fighter. Personally I think he probably did do the no condom sex which is despicable but I also think he is awesome at his job.

       I just have a real hard time believing that celebs, especially the trashy irrelevant ones have anything to do with these sorts of  experiments. I like to see proof that's believable and/or reputable. Be skeptical of everything and research for yourself. And if you're sure of your conclusions, try to debunk them before you believe it wholeheartedly.

       Who would have thunk that demanding careers sometimes lead to drug abuse or emotional breakdowns. It really is the simplest answer, people do experience stress and act out. Another conspiracy theory floated is that he is just really sick of his role and making his escape into a mental health issue could be a way to get insurance to cover the losses for other stakeholders like venues.  The most far fetched ones are particularly popular lately. Personally I think he is politically minded and aware of conspiracy theories and he knows he hasn't having the positive impact he would like to and wants to break from his current path, be more of an activist.

       Critical thought led me to apply logic. How logical is it that washed up celebs are being brainwashed as a part of some conspiracy by the NWO. These celebs are fucking jokes with no influence, they're the butt of jokes. The burden of proof would be on you if you believe this. Provide a good source that isn't Batshit insane. Otherwise you're  just resembling the tin foil hat crazy caricature.

       Brittany Spears and Lindsay Lohan have influence? I guess if the goal is to brainwash young teenage girls. Would you find that logical and a good use of any program/experiment? If there is such a sophisticated program, it would make more sense to use on celebs that have some credibility with actual tax payers. I also would say it's much more logical to conclude these washed up celebs went off the rails due to drugs. Occam's razor.

       Spears and Lohan are so famous even you know who they are. Youve probably been exposed to their work as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find logical has zero bearing on the potential reality of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celebs have more credibility with tax payers than politicians. America just promoted a celebrity to the position of President. And its not even the first time that happened.

       Yes, it is more logical to conclude that celebs simply overdose. But this sub is about theorizing further than the observably logical.

       Yes I understand this sub is for such subjects. I suppose I prefer plausible conspiracies that have actual tangible evidence and not wild speculation. Like 9/11 truth movement vs flat earth theory. One is clearly more plausible than the other with actual sound evidence.

       Okay so I watched the Britney video, and it doesn't even really look like her to me, which is confusing because none of the comments mentioned that, so maybe I don't have a good reference for what Britney Spears looks like. But was the video posted after it happened? Late December of 07 wouldn't have given her hair enough time to grow back after the infamous February 2007 head shaving meltdown. And the guy she was with (weirdly? Why would she hangout with paparazzi?) seemed to have the same accent.

       I'm gonna have to agree with nisaaru on this one.  Yeah she was influential in the sense of how to style your hair or what to wear but she never attempted to change any political narrative.  She was a pop star.  How has Katy Perry influenced our generation?

       Katy Perry was HRCs right hand woman for teen and milennial outreach during the Presidential campaign.  Her music always played at the rallies and perry constantly appeared publicly to support HRC.

       In terms if influencing a generation ... The song "I kissed a girl and I liked it" probably was an attempt to make that behavior more acceptable.  (I don't have a a problem with it tho).

       If by young, you mean preteen kids then that's pretty normal.  Kids that age usually don't, and shouldn't have to, think about politics.  Now if an adult becomes completely oblivious to political changes in their country because they're too distracted by pop-stars, that person probably would not have been interested in politics to begin with.

       The Politics that you see promoted in mainstream media is the adult version of pop music/celebrity. It's the same mechanism. It's meant to distract one group and turn another group off politics, in a more general sense, altogether.

       I think in the grand scheme of things that's probably close to true.  I think to really start learning more or making changes we have to stop dealing in generalities and start sinking our teeth into specifics.  One step at a time.

       As someone who was a bit older during the rise of Britney Spears, it's my opinion that the hyper-sexualized teen girl thing DID indeed have a profound effect on the youth, and lead to an increase in the  objectification of the human body and general egotism/selfishness/greed.  Adults at the time were not spared either, and those kids who grew up on that type of carefully constructed bullshit are now in their 30s.  Some have managed to wake up, but plenty of others don't realize what damage was done.

       Granted, I didn't consider the meme idea. Spears standing for sexualization. Not sure what Lohan should stand for? How drug abuse destroys careers and personality?
      </p>
      <p>
       I surely acknowledge that both persons seem to have imploded in similar ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. But then I still don't consider any of them to have the power to truly establish a meme and influence the culture. Their function would be replaceable. If you want to establish a meme through nobodies why invest into MKUltra when you can hire/fire these non-artists?

       I understand the concept.  I just think it's flawed in certain areas.  Britney Spears didn't promote political change because she was told not to, she promoted sex because that's what would make her the most money in her position.
       <br/>
       I think our shitty pop music would exist today whether there was someone pulling the strings or not.

       Yes yes thats all true.  I'm just of the mindset that those millions of dollars spent promoting it is just so producers get a return on their investment and make lots of moolah.  Not pacifying the public.  I think  were just still evolving creatures and a lot of us like girls with pink hair shooting whipped cream from their tits cause.....well that's hot as shit.

       Some people yes, others no. The rise of the internet has had a lot to do with that.  It will stay ugly for a while, but ultimately I think the internet is what could alter this trajectory a thousand different ways.  I'm 21 years old.  I'm one of the first generations in the history of mankind to grow up with access to virtually all human knowledge on my desk.  This, plus the internet being impossible to control is a game changer if you ask me.

       I don't even know if that's true.  Net neutrality is a hot issue right now and most people, myself included, think its the best way to avoid someone controlling how people perceive the internet.

       Open source is becoming increasingly more popular, and yes a ton of misinformation is out there, but if you think about it people really seem to be recognizing that more today than ever before.

       I get the reason but I just don't see the value in wasting resources on them. In the end there must be some cost/benefit ration which makes it profitable. Just doing it for the sake of it lacks substance I would expect for such serious activities.

       The true elite aren't doing things for profit. They're doing things for power and influence. They're way above the level of power that worries about money. Money is a tool. When you run entire industries, own politicians, can affect national politics, and can influence public opinion you're not worried about only "profit". You're worried about how you can WIELD the resources you have to attain certain goals.

       They're not doing it "for the sake of it". They're doing it to influence and direct society by influencing the culture and the youth. Things like social liberalism, the gay agenda, accepting certain ideas and concepts, promoting hedonism, glorifying certain lifestyles, etc.

       Music, television, and movies are massively influential. You honestly sound like a bit of a fucking moron to refuse to even entertain the notion. I understand skepticism but you sound like a shill with how blatantly obtuse you seem to be acting toward this.

       had the relevance and power to influence the generation and

       investments into MKUltra because I assume there's a cost/benefit analysis somewhere and these programs aren't just candy they treat every hack in the entertainment industry with.

       With cost/benefit I don't necessarily mean money but
       <em>
        resources

       I believe there is a gay agenda. Hollywood and western entertainment are purposely promoting homosexuality and demonizing public opinion against those who would question, disagree with, or go against its public promotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between condoning and promoting a behavior. I have no issue condoning homosexuality but I don't want to see it promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you know about the darkside of Hollywood/entertainment industry you'd know how deep it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many popular actors and singers are molested/raped by the big time execs and money in the industry in order to get where they are. Lots of the big players behind which stars get to "make it" and which ones don't force male stars to engage in homosexual acts before they are allowed to "make it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the "gay agenda" and what I just mentioned are two different subject areas.

       Teaching children in kindergarten about sexuality and continuing that education through high school makes me livid, and I agree about the liberal agenda. They did it in the 60's with the cultural revolution and the advent of birth control.

       I am not sorry that this makes me sick and is absolutely batshit insane.  I don't CARE whether you are gay, stop telling me; I really don't fucking care. But I draw the line when you start teaching my kid about transgenders. It took how many years for hetero sex-ed to get taught in HIGH SCHOOLS... but within the space of about ten years the less than two percent of the population who are gay or trans managed to get this curriculum pushed through the entire school system K-12.  How'd they do that? Easy. To deny them means a fucking media shitstorm. Funny how that works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incredibly self-absorbed, selfish people who don't give a rat's ass about what used to be called social mores.  Just chuck that entire cohesive functionality out the window so a tiny minority can mutilate themselves because they are mentally ill. AND THEN TEACH MY KIDS THAT IT'S OK.
      </p>

       Homophobic individuals that attack and bully deserve to be criticized and vilified. If their response is to double down on their bigotry... fuck them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no "agenda." Do you think the civil rights movement and suffragettes were a black agenda and female agenda? They're just people wanting to be accepted, treated equal and not subjected to institutionalized abuse and degradation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality should be promoted as much as heterosexuality. Do you complain about straight sex permeating every facet of that entertainment industry?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are not influenced into homosexuality. Sexuality is a spectrum, some have zero sexual interest in the same sex. Others are curious. Even children experiment with their peers. It's as healthy and natural as puberty. Some will discover they're bisexual, some will find that they're open to the opposite sex in the likes of threesomes but would never go one-on-one, etc. There is more to it than a series of boxes. Treating homosexuality equally allows homosexuals to actually be acknowledged by society instead of being relegated to "Don't Ask Don't Tell."

       Nothing wrong with that. Merely stating I don't want to promote homosexuality doesn't make me a bigot nor is it threatening anyones rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe homosexuality is as natural as puberty. And I'm allowed to have that opinion. It's not a hateful belief nor does it infringe on anyones rights. In what ways is anyone gay being oppressed right now in the US?
      </p>

       Gay people have this strange notion that anyone who isn't a cheerleader for homosexuality is a hateful bigot.

       Your opinion is objectively wrong, so it's not an opinion, it's a fantasy. Homosexuality is 100% natural, observed in countless species, and acts as a natural barrier to overpopulation and increases the amount of viable workers with no children to be tied down to, but also having the ability to adopt orphaned children. Homosexuality creates a significant amount of foster parents. These are pretty ingenious in terms of design by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize gay marriage was only just federally legalized? And now there's a VP advocating crackpot electroshock "conversion therapy" with no scientific basis. This is pure evil. Gay people still need to look over their shoulders.

       If it was 100% natural it would be the norm. Homosexuality is an aberration, a glitch. Saying it's 100% natural is like saying mental illnesses are 100% natural because they occur naturally in a small percentage of humans.

       When Pence sends squads out to capture homosexuals and put them in camps to force conversion therapy on them I will stand up and fight next to my fellow Americans. But until someone actually does something to gays or stomps on their rights, enough with the fear mongering and the value shaming.

       Something different from you is an aberration? Comparing homosexuality to mental illness? Out come your true colors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, homosexuality is extremely common. Sexuality is a spectrum and even those who identify as heterosexual have had gay experiences. What people identify as and what they do is not always congruent, as you'll find from the amount of gay-bashers who happen to be gay themselves, or at least are turned on by it but refuse to identify as homosexual.

       Because it's wrong and spewed purely out of the bile in your mind? Are you a psychologist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Transgenderism is actually down to, among other things, in-vitro hormonal allocation. The brain develops as one sex but the body develops as another. There is no illness involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can speculate that the massive amounts of environmental estrogen, poor estrogenic diets, testosterone-killing pesticides, etc contribute to it, but at the end of the day, these people are just people. How they self-identify or who they have sex with has no impact on your poor little self.

        Not necessarily. But people who take either of those to the extreme is certainly exhibiting the signs of someone who is mentally ill.

       I'm not "scared" of transgenders or gay people... Got plenty of gay friends and even had a fling with a trans chick haha. Doesn't mean they don't have a mental illness. You seem to think me saying that something is a mental illness is a demonization or somehow "hatred" against something. I have no problem with transgenders or gays. But the behavior, especially transgenders, are signs of someone who is mentally unhealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who is mentally healthy doesn't castrate themselves and undergo hormone treatment to switch genders. Period. That's not a sign of sound mental health.

       There's nothing natural about transgenderism. I'm not being hateful. I'm simply saying there's nothing natural about a human being changing genders with surgery and hormone treatment.

       You're giving an emotional response to the fact that I'm not a cheerleader for what I see as a mental illness. There's nothing scary about it lol I live in one of the gayest cities in the US the idea of it scaring me is laughable. But I'm still going to acknowledge the obvious fact that homosexuality and transgenderism are a sign of mental illness and mental trauma.

       You're still missing the entire point. A transgender person doesn't suffer just by being transgender, they suffer when they are not acknowledged as such, prevented from changing as they desire, or humiliated, ostracized and abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transgender individuals don't kill themselves or suffer in anguish just because they don't have the right genitalia. Societal problems are why they suffer. It has nothing to do with illness or trauma. A hermaphrodite is not sick. A homosexual is not sick, nor is a transgender individual.

       Lol.... Britney Spears was huge. Lindsey Lohan was even bigger with her movie and tv presence. Stars with global presence and fan bases. Stars that were extremely relevant to women age 8-28.

       If you seriously think that 17 year old Britney was not a good dancer, than you need to watch this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think she is a better dancer now, you must be one of those fans that became a fan after her meltdown. I've been a fan since day one, so I know what I'm talking about. Her dance moves are mediocre at best. She is still extremely stiff on stage. It looks almost like she is counting her steps. She is constantly doing the same moves with her arms. She pretty much walks from point A to point B the entire time, very robotic. She is not terrible, but she is far from the amazing perform she used to be before her breakdown. The lip syncing never bothered me, but she uses vocals from 20 years ago on her shows which is just ridiculous. At least use some recent pre recorded vocals if you don't want to to sing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personality wise, she was always kind of shy, true, but during the Oops era, she really blossom and became a lot more outgoing. Just watch her SNL skits, and her Hawaii TV Special and you will see what I mean. After her meltdown she was never the same again, and that's a fact. Just some of her fans are too in denial to see that.

       I remember when I was like 13 and watching Spears getting taken in the ambulance. It looked like she was afraid and didn't want to go. There's videos where the paparazzi got close to the window of the ambulance. It's also annoying how everyone just believes so easily that "oh he's different since his mom died" yes it's possible, but the the way things happened makes me want to ask questions

       I hate that I know this... The Spears one is interesting because her father has complete control of her life. She isnt in charge of making decisions, if he says you have to go to the doctors she has to go. He can sign shit on her behalf and its the same as if she agreed to it.

       Don't believe the comments you read in the main sub's of reddit.

       I guarantee you most if the "mom comments" are shills pushing this agenda.

       I read them too... They post those mom comments, then lock the thread.

       Well... that's not really the question, because the status quo we live isn't the same as the status quo of the people who are enforcing OUR status quo... if you catch my meaning...
      </p>
      <p>
       The people at the top... the very top... 0.001% of industry, finance, government, wealth, influence... Bilderbergs, Bohemians, Skull+Bones... they have a desire to consolidate power and wealth, and these people compete with the upper echelon of other societies (Russian, Saudi, Chinese) who also want to consolidate power and wealth... They do this by manipulating people to continue the grind... working the menial jobs for shit pay to line the pockets of the guy at the top so he can buy the next guy's business for the extra 1% share of the yearly profit, and the ability to swing his dick that little bit harder... These people are likely sociopathic as their lack of empathy for their fellow humans/the planet has lead to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye yelling out that the media is lying to them, and that they need to wake up is not helpful in this regard, and by saying "oh he's just upset because his mom died" is an easy way to bypass the logic loop in someone's brain by supplanting it with the emotional loop.

       Actually yes. Critical thinking means thinking critically. If you throw literally everything against the wall you aren't thinking, you are being the crazy conspiracy theorist that questions everything with or without any evidence or thought beyond "I'm being told x by the government/media/reddit? It must be Y!"

       Exactly my point. Believing someone is "losing it" when someone is being highly skeptical seems to be poor judgement imo.

       I think to say it's "obvious" is a stretch.  I don't see a difference between these situations and say, Charlie Sheen's, for example.  Charlie took a lot of drugs and lost his mind for a bit.  What makes you think it's more likely these people are being "controlled"?

       Maybe so, but I've seen enough to know. They are captives/slaves suffering from Stockholm syndrome after being pumped full of drugs. They are under hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pity them. They are tortured souls and many of them don't deserve it. They were just unsuspecting, attractive "actor" looking for a "big role" till they fell into the abyss of pedophilia and gay sex magick that their bosses dabble in.

       Okay this is rude but I have to say it.  I'm getting down voted for saying gay sex magic doesn't exist.  I think we could all actually learn a lot more about whats really going on in the world if we stuck to real things.  Gay sex magic people should really find their own sub cause it's making this one suck.

       Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones I have done research on.  Both are very real things and very much shrouded in secrecy.  Now, show me some evidence that they're sacrificing children or worshiping the sun, and not just getting together for a camp in the woods.
      </p>

       I agree, those things are very strange and interesting to me, but I try to ground my theories in the realm of physical reality.

       You simply have to read their books and study their teachings. The giant owl that they sing around at bohemian grove is a depiction of Moloch. God of fire and the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only video footage we have of the grove is from Alex Jones who is most likely an insider.

      <p>
       They want us to know
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of their teachings so that they can  a)  absolve some of their bad karma for doing these disgusting things and b) to recruit some intelligent people who are willing to go along.

       Thats true, they would never admit to that.  So just curious, do you believe these elitist just worship this stuff and kill kids, or do you have more of a reason to believe this Moloch guys actually exists and thats why these people stay in power?

       I believe in thoughtforms, and the illusory nature of reality. What you and I consider "real" is just what we can perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important point is that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       believe he's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just it isn't it? Belief
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       power at least that's what they believe. Do you see where I'm going?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure. He could be an alien or an ancient human king or hero of some kind, but the political and religious leaders of the modern world revere "him" as a god, as well as many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think their just thoughtforms, sapped from the natural energies of life (mountains, rivers, electricity, gravity, etc) as in, they use those forces' power to channel archetypes, like Jung said.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a billion people on earth believe Yahweh
       <em>
        is god
       </em>
       then doesn't that
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       make whatever is, god? In a way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you get it? It's about perception and energy and illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are masters of illusions.

       I like this guy.  Very interesting.  Seriously.  Here's my thought, about a billion people probably DO believe Yahweh exists.  Way more people on earth believe in Yahweh or God, than the people who believe in Moloch or whoever.  So do you think the elite just have more "powerful" thoughtforms or something? And if that were the case, would they deserve to keep their status as elite and "above" us?

       This one will blow your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yahweh
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Moloch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you disregard this statement, understand that Yahweh or Elohim comes form El in Canaan meaning, the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       El, Baal, Moloch, Yahweh, Zeus, Odin, Brahma, Ylaldabaoth, are all the same; the demiurge; the false creator in Gnosticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, all the gods you've ever heard of are just personalities within one false god; duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's the voice in your head that tells you when something you did was good or bad, according to your ego and your cultural background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan/Moloch is the voice that tells you, "hey just fuck her anyway".
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite "worship" the negative/male/evil/strong/north side of the paradigm we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end it's the same voice.

       Yeah we're getting deep here.  So you have most of the world worshiping the good/positive/passive side of this "duality" and a very small select few worshiping the evil side.  How come that tiny group has so much more power than the other?  And what type of god doesn't want its message spread to the world, aka why all the secrecy?

       Well first off I can't really answer some of your questions; as much as the "darkness" has tried to allure me I have only tip toed around it's soul-damning lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be good, they want to live peacefully and let others do the same. They don't really care about the inner workings of the universe (we used to know much more in ancient times by default, so they needed not care as much as we do) because life is easy, and happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       God has done some fucked up shit; Canaan, Sodom and Gamorrah; millions killed by Israelites, the crusades, jihad, inquisition, sexual control, parental control, pedophile priests, and keeping secrets from the masses..
      </p>
      <p>
       These are only the
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       crimes the Church has committed. God knows what we don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people could not face these harsh realities. Those who can either
      </p>
      <p>
       a) die trying to fight it
      </p>
      <p>
       b) are forced or coerced into joining the cult
      </p>
      <p>
       c) experience victories but are shortchanged by historians (I.e. Jesus, Buddha, Rumi, Ghandi, MLK, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The church isn't good, it's evil. They invented the "good guy narrative" (stolen from the real healer, Jesus) so it would sell. Ther god is Satan, at least the guys at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the secrecy goes, the things these people do would make your stomach turn. Torturing and molesting children and babies, forcing them into scary situations to sap their innocence, and their fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think so many children go missing? Are there really that many kidnappers? Like millions of them? Or is it a concerted effort?

       Alright my ever curious associate,
      </p>
      <p>
       A) as above so below magick ritual of your choice, done at certain times, preferably when the moon is full or new. Done at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) kill someone, violently, a child. Do it in the name of Satan. I won't go in to the details of what must be done here. It's horrifying. Certain environmental aspects matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeat until your satisfied wth the results; I.e. Power, money, control, sex etc all those dark things we were talking about on the negative polarity.

       This is programming. I don't think you actually have any idea what happens in jail. You are told this is what happens. I know a murderer/pedophile and he WAS the rapist in jail. So, there's that. but continue u/ihopeitsround you're doing a smashing job.

       I honestly feel like theres a part of me that wants to believe all the black magic shit, cause then I feel a little safer knowing theres nothing I can do about it.
      </p>

       The scarier thought is that there are just a shitload of corrupt people in power and everyone below just sucks at catching them in the act.  Or looks the other way for their own interests.

       Honestly in reading through here it almost seems like there's a more active effort in progress to paint the conspiracy community with a crazy brush than usual.  There are people talking about spirits and magic and hypnosis and all sorts of whacky shit.  I've seen lots of whackjobs in my time lurking here but this is a new level for me.

       Yeah but I bet it made your parts tingle, almost magically, through a medium that is repeated and blasted for every generation, through several avatars, 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

       You'll have to suspend your belief, and have to assume a few relatively outlandish things if I'm to continue. Remember that the mark of an intelligent mind is the ability to entertain a thought without accepting it. I am not saying any of the following is true, but you must assume it to be true for the following thought experiment. I do not personally believe this, and have only gleaned the following through my time on r/conspiracy. Once again, the mark of an intelligent mind is the ability to entertain a thought without accepting it. Please, entertain the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is Real. The Devil is Real. The battle between Good and Evil in the classic sense is Real. There are demons and angels and they battle for domination over our world. The people at the very top of this food chain - the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc, are all really into this shit. They are Satanists and attempt to live in an affront to the True God. Everything they work to do is to loosen the grip of God (and Good). They perform mass rituals to harness energies to strengthen the force of evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still with me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok. So, because they live as an affront to God they do blatant things like supercharge the media with sexualized imagery to turn people away from God and Purity and towards Satan and Sin and Lust and Selfishness, and for the most part it works. That video above is just a small example of "sex magic".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is all kind of pulled from my ass (honestly I swear), in regards to things that I've read on this sub and other places. I'm sure I did a piss poor job of summarizing it, and I'm sure that someone with more information can point you in a better direction if you're so inclined. Let me know if you are, because I'd love to hear their response.

       I'm just tapping in here but maybe the lifestyle of drugs money and the feeling of doing whatever you want and getting paid and praised for it can really sink into somebody (like kanyes)  ego. The people who run your gigs, publicity, and source of money have the power to take it all away and what else should they do besides continuing to act as how society thinks they should/can.

       This is where I think you are very much on to something.  Sure music and art can shape culture and society but drugs affect the way people think more than anything else.  Digging here is where I'd think people would start to find some answers.

       This isn't a conspiracy, celebrities talk about it all of the time. Keeping up with Joneses makes them go broke. It's a lifestyle thats idealized so they try hard to stay in the spotlight to keep it going.

       Yes, and your right, that could have contributed. It just doesn't make my point any less valid; he is dedicated to being "Yeezus" and being sacrilegious; not that the Christian path is without faults, but the satanic one? Don't get me started.

       Honestly I think maybe they are just some good doctors. They probably build up the patients public and personal persona. Helping them feel grounded and connected to people close to them, while still being able to be in the lime light for their careers.

       Just being skeptical here, what have any of the people on that list done to actually change the publics perception of anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just seems more likely these would be legitimate mental breakdowns due to their excessive fame.  I mean, if all those celebrities were actually being "controlled" to push some narrative, then it's a pretty fucking vague one.

       Music has international influence, sometimes even more than politics. Kanye is a powerful man, going up against everything Trump stood against and more (except with less resources)
      </p>
      <p>
       He called out Zuckerberg and Facebook, he called out the radio, he called out Hillary Clinton, he called out Jay Z, he called out Beyonce, he's called out Nike, the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people would love nothing more than to shut Kanye West up, and that is exactly what they have sought to do.

       I agree, music can be incredibly influential, I'm pretty sure the FBI admitted to spying on John Lennon, but I don't think anything Kanye has said indicates he's in on some secret or something.  And didn't he ask Zuckerberg for a ton of money recently to start a company?

       I haven't seen a single comment about what he said about Jay-Z, that he knows hes got killers, and please don't kill me just talk to me like a man. Can't believe this is not a debate here, the dude is basically the baron of hip/hop which controls pretty much everything. That "please don't kill me" was protection so he could not get killed or else jay-z would get the blame.

       Music is a timeless influence.  The message from a musician still rings through your ears regardless of if it came from their voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot more information travels through one's voice than what travels through the text we're reading now.

      <p>
       Reading a speech isn't going to provide the same information that hearing it will.

       Influential positions are typically tied up the confusion of the words, not the message.

       The only difference between reading a speech and hearing one is emotion.  Sure you can emphasize a message more with your voice, but what is this message you think were getting from all these pop stars?

       The message from pop stars isn't their own words a lot of times, but the words of someone who's trying to make something profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how other people hear music, but for some reason I've only been able to be interested in music that conveys an aspect of authenticity that I can't always understand or put to words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the feeling comes with the voice.  People can feel the emotions you feel based on how your vocal chords send the message.  They might not really understand it but sometimes they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all slaves to emotions, so transferring those between each other seems to be far more effective since we can't control them over the words we choose to focus on.  We are a bag of chemicals that produces emotion through its own motion.  Communication between us happens at levels we aren't often conscious of.

       I wouldn't call it a conspiracy really, just saying that it makes sense that someone who is authentic can't handle the pressures of an unauthentic society that they rise to a position of importance in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see politicians having the mental breakdown because they're distanced from their emotions and aren't authentically feeling as much as a musician who speaks in emotion does.  It's easier to play along with the system when you're emotionally distant from things outside of it.

       Have you seen any of them perform? Listened to their lyrics? The whole body of culture is what defines the people that grow up in it. You don't notice anything wrong because we've accepted it as the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could easily turn your question around and ask yourself how many of the artists who are popular with kids ever speak up about something meaningful?

       Just because some artist doesn't sing about political issues doesn't mean anybody's hiding anything.  It means preteen girls like songs about fireworks and high school which is very fucking normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you CANNOT turn that question around because hundreds of artists DO write songs about political issues and change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only point I'm making here is that it seems more likely that pop stars are singing songs about what kids actually like instead of singing about "whatever the government tells to."

       It's not that there aren't artists writing about those issues but that they seem to take a backseat to cheap trashy things, they aren't as omnipresent. I'm not saying it's intentional, but if you feed a pig trash for its entire life and then offer them an option of a nice meal, they'll still eat the trash.

       I'm not going to claim that the government is behind it. At some point this system keeps itself in check and you start to wonder whether the chick or the egg came first. You don't need to tell people what to do at that point, if you don't fit the bill you just don't get to be in the position to become big anyway. That is the case for an artist but just as much for a politician or a journalist. You don't need to approach anyone in the prime of their career to tell them "and now you're going to hypnotise the kids with this song!" or "don't write about the twin towers!", the people who would write about the twin towers never get to be in a position to make that mistake in the first place, and if they do they only get that opportunity once.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that is the case is exactly because of the culture around us, it's a result of the movies you see, the news you hear and the songs they play on the radio. It's that body of culture that makes most people believe that an Arab attack in NY is the norm and the false flag attack is the crazy explanation. Those beliefs don't just spring into existence from the news after the facts, that is built up over an entire life where every movie has the dark skinned guy as the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So of course, when most popular artists are more in the business of selling their body than their music or real ideas, it will affect the perception of the people who see them as idols or role models.

       Eh...pop music hasn't devolved but what is considered "acceptable" in pop culture has...For example..Obesity in our society is normalized and encouraged. From the food we eat to the access of food...Our society is encouraging us to be overweight. In order to maintain a normal human efficient weight...one must be brought up in a household that avoids fast/processed food (which is a dying practice) or one has to actively search for info regarding BASIC HUMAN NUTRITION.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally...on a day to day basis...the average person doesn't get near enough vitamins/proteins on top of all the absolutely terrible BS they shovel in their mouths. The average cookie? Definitely shouldn't be consumed by humans. We are eating things that aren't food product but is being served as a food.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not about what's currently available..It's about how we got here and where we're going...ffor instance...It used to be a "CAAARAAZZYYY" idea to give pop tarts FROSTING. Too much sugar...takes away from the purpose...blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have Orange Crush Poptarts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to finish...a solid movie quote from Jurrassic Park "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is where we are as a society. We are "doing things" without thought and it's leading us down a path of mindlessness.

       but the thing is, someone with lots of money and power obviously thought it worked because they trotted out every celebrity in hollywood and had people like john oliver destroy his credibility and likely his career in the long run, for clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       it didn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that's important for us to figure out and understand. all marketing, regardless of product, is by definition manipulative propaganda designed to make us want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       there can be no doubt that there is an intensive post mortem going on to figure out why it didn't work this time and how to make sure it does next time. we need to figure it out too, before the new and improved meme machine rolls out.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think it didn't work this time because Xers on down have been saturated in marketing our whole lives, far more than boomers.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to work hard to sell us anything, and it always comes down to the actual product now. every product, even polical products, have to be sold like cell phones to us to have a chance at all. the thing itself has to wow us.

       This is true, but what would the secret be?  I don't listen to Kanye but aren't some of his songs kind of anti-government/independence themed?

       as a rapper maybe he's not talented, but the guy was part of the industry as a producer for years before he tried as an artist, and if I remember right he was not just any producer, he was one of the best.  So he might not have been the up front celebrity but he was definitely getting paid.

       kanye has issues. itd be one thing if his rants were sensible or logical, but theyre just incoherent ramblings.
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesnt take a scientist to analyze his behavior and go dude takes himself incredibly serious. and so, with that, youre going to have issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, i seriously dont like to judge people in the limelight. i have issues on my own without people on this entire planet saying my name and mocking me...i cant even imagine the strength it would take to recover. if three friends of mine in a room make fun of me non jokingly, id feel depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       i hope kanye finds some serenity, because i think hes in pain. i also do not think he knows some crazy secret and is being reprogrammed.

       yes i do. but a less romantic idea, like the dave chappelle one, is just as feasible.

       infact, if we want to be sensible skeptics, we should pursue the more likely, provable, logical conclusion. which until you can prove any sort of conspiracy, i would say is the one i put forth....

       IMO More evidence pointing towards the fact that MK begins and is largely carried out during a person's youth. She was a real rising star for a while. When I was younger she was in

       So what am I remembering wrong to justify my point? You said I'm wrong but then say "many others were just as big as her" which is borderline contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       "...she was in fucking everything..." is obviously exaggeration, she wasn't in EVERYTHING. Is that what you're disputing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you arguing my point that she was a "rising star"? if that's the case, believe it or not, I'm going to decline any further argument regarding amanda bynes' popularity in the mid 90s ...

Lamar Odom and his drug problem, Bruce Jenner gets a sex change, Kanye and his ordeal, Tyga... Well Tyga sucked regardless. He's broke now but that's no surprise.

       Awesome post! I'm pretty sure Kanye was glitching or bugging out from his programming with all the negative comments towards Jay-Z (the dude who sold him out to controllers). What makes this interesting is Kid Cudi's recent breakdowns and disgusted rants towards his superiors, resulting in him turning himself in to a "rehab" center for "mental-instability."

       Is that a real question?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hip hop in 2016 is being used to control the millennial generation into being sexual, materialistic, self-centered, insecure and addicted to either drugs, alcohol, money or all three. But mainly targeting young males from as young as 16 to 30. You know, fuck em up at the point in their life they need to be making themselves into REAL men.

       And young males 16-30 have been "sexual, materialistic, self-centered, and insecure" since the fucking dawn of time.

       You've been listening to the wrong hip hop then. Hip hop was for the most part pretty on point with bringing up social issues back in the day. There's some really good stuff out there, you should check it out.

       Okay that's fair, but the level of selfishness, lust and a materialistic mindset by the youth nowadays is way worse than what it was 100-200 years ago. Each generation continues to degenerate far worse than the previous by design. Why? Because those in charge want a dumbed-down, servile, unhappy and domesticated population that will flock to the next "best thing."

       The youth of this generation are the same as the youth of any generation. Look at the hippies back in the 60s. Free love and drugs for everyone. Today's youth culture really is just a downplayed version of that. Sex and drugs have been in pop music since the 60s and upcoming youth subcultures over the decades are just generationally inherited and adapted. I think present day the pop culture is more hypersexualized and glorifies drugs a little more, but I'm of the opinion today's youth lack the hardiness and boldness older generations had in terms of openly flaunting their debauchery.

       Nope, the youth of the 60' and up to the 80's had values, they were "stupid, reckless and made a fool of themselves". They also made alot of fucking noise, protests etc. Myself as a 90's kid and most around me? Afraid of having values as to not be ridiculed. Herd-mentality over individual values is what we are seeing.

       I agree 100% with that entire post.  It's absolutely in the interest of corrupt orgs to keep people from asking too many questions, but the leap from that to mind-controlled pop star singers is a little too sci-fi for me to believe.  I could be wrong.  Just seems unnecessary since pop stars are going to sing about that shit either way.

       I beg to differ. There's a reason why many people believe Bob Marley was taken out by the CIA... his music promoted peace, positivity and unity; the EXACT OPPOSITE of what is in our mainstream music of today, which is heavily controlled by corporate America.

       That could be true, and John Lennon would be another good example of that.  But I hear a lot of music today still about peace and positivity, and honestly most of the songs on the opposite side today are about government itself and how we need to change it.  I see that as a step forward, not backwards.

       I believe today's message of "anti-establishment and change," is all just a farse. Because it is still controlled by the same people who controlled our industry 20 years ago, so why the change? It's all a false-movement if you ask me. Probably to round up those who really want change, and just shove them further down the rabbit hole.

       Hip-hop was not always about materialism, it spawned as a genre of dance music. Kurtis Blow "The Breaks", sugar hill gangs "rapper's delight".
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream hip-hop was about dealing with struggles and how they had to sell drugs to get by but didn't like it. Public Enemy preached anti-govt... Damn I'm not even gonna continue.

       Yeah, think about it logically. Take away all the mindcontrol/mk ultra bullshit (not saying it's not plausible) and really look at it, they are promoting something for other people and get paid for it. Now, if they disagree openly and try and tell the sheeples, they will fall from fame and get excluded from the "gang". Don't forget what their managers and agents have invested in them, it's not just themselves. And who owns them again? Make it a thought-experiment.

       It's not like this is out of the blue either.  He's had bouts mania lots of times in the past.  He's also been on and off medication before.  But the people in these comments will use the fact that he's back on his meds, and no longer acting manic, to claim he's being controlled by the government.

       This angers me. Was he hospitalized against his will? This morning I figured he was just going to take some time off to hit the studio and see his family. Turns out he's been hospitalized... Fucks the reasoning for this? Was this latest "rant" (which I saw as a rallying cry in all honesty) out of character?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
Dude speaks his mind all the time. And his latest speech was on point, from my perspective. I appreciated him pointing out the vapid nature of pop culture, particularly radio play. The need to see past politicians who don't outwardly say racist shit but are racist all the same (just see the "needy mexican"/bill richardson emails in the Podesta leaks).
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
And
       <strong>
        most importantly
       </strong>
       there's a need for emotional connectivity and awareness. We act/interact based on emotions. When you have a divided country fighting over what appears to be misunderstandings, bravery and care for your fellow man is essential. That's why he praised ASAP at his concert recently, because that's a dude who gets that
       <strong>
        we are all in this together
       </strong>
       . Who gives a fuck if he's brash while saying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
I can't believe that nobody ever cares to break down the actual content of his speeches. They're not incoherent, maybe just a tad rambling.

       this for real... i disagree with a good amount of what Kanye says... but a lot of it seems pretty no-brainer. i can't say for sure if that rant was 100% true, but most of it was barely a rant. it was a speech, and one with decent flow too. my theory is he's fairly woke, but the shit they do to try to keep him in line messes some of his perceptions up. this may all be some of the most damming evidence of celebrity control, imo. the difference between a speech from someone feed up with bullshit is way different than a rant from someone"going off the rails" (as we are led to understand the phrase) tho i suppose that might actually be a very accurate phrase for this on a way. hes going off his prescribed rail, he veered from the narrative in a major major way. i do not like what this whole thing implies one bit.

       Good points. But you need insight to understand his speech, if not it will just be a rant. What really bummed me was all the people screaming and calling him an idiot and "shut the fuck up", why not leave? And the morons who said they paid a fortune for his tickets should have gotten reimbursed. Do they think he's the one in control of the tickets etc? FUCK NO. I mean, how selfish and ignorant can people really be before someone calls them out on their shit?

       Yea watching the video pissed me off too. I kept thinking that they must've been drunk/fucked up off whatever and just wanted to get their money's worth, but I think they and many others have failed to realize the meaning behind this speech. Kanye even stated that he was risking his life by exposing too much! That statement itself says it all. I hope he's alright.

       , i seriously doubt 15 people upvoted your opinion, especially on this subreddit.
It is a very interesting story, first they say he was forced, then that he went by his own free will. Idk man, his speech sounds like he was mentally exhausted (drugs and/or no sleep) and that could have been easily drug induced psychosis but i seriously doubt that. Very interesting story indeed, i never liked Kanye, no reason, never listened to him, dont know one song, i just have a bad opinion of him but i cant find a reason.
My theory: his rambling was intentionally induced to discredit him and hospitalize him.

       Ninja edit: OH SHIT this guy used government funding to experiment with using cattle-prods on CHILDREN
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cattle Prod Therapy
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in  grants from the federal government, channeled through the  National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) a major funding conduit  for CIA programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before stepping down as director of the Neuropsychiatric  Institute, West reportedly allowed psychiatric “treatments” that  were more suited to brainwashing, “mind control” or a torture  chamber than for resolving mental troubles. It was reported in  1976, for example, that Neuropsychiatric Institute psychiatrist Ivar  Lovass had used electric cattle prods for “aversion therapy” on  children.

       Jesus Christ. This is dumb.

       Kanye West was a gifted and talented Rap star. He got into a massive car accident which basically left him 35% brain damaged. Crushed Skull, full frontal lobe bruising; Like Gary Busey. The Kanye who came out of the surgery room and rehab was not the Kanye West pre-2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back story:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://globalgrind.com/3880177/kanye-west-car-accident-11-years-ago-full-story-photos/">
        http://globalgrind.com/3880177/kanye-west-car-accident-11-years-ago-full-story-photos/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly all of the Kanye West we know and love, from Late Registration to 2013 was mixed and produced during the early period of rehab. His brain was still adapting and the major neurological damage had not set in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pr-accident, KW was a pretty normal guy. You would consider him a proto-Drake, heavily influenced by Religion and family (his mom).
      </p>
      <p>
       Post-accident, KW suffered partial memory loss, aggressive outbursts and most of the symptoms of both a Brain Trauma case and early onset BiPolar disorder. He was strongly encouraged to leave the rap game due to his lack of integration with the East Coast scene and his dwindling social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye was flying (coke or aderall, nobody knows to this day) the night he drove head into that car. Kanye also has enough mental presence left to recognize there is a stark difference between who he was pre-2003 and post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter treated KW like shit while he was under contract at Roc. That is well known inside the industry. For his entire run he was originally paid US30,000. A pittance and an insult even in 2001 standards. While KW views JayZ and his crew as his friends, the feeling is most definitely not reciprocated. Quite the opposite infact.
      </p>
      <p>
       For industry insiders this is a shame, as KW is literally a mentally ill man being paraded around by "friends" &amp; family for their own gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       UCLA is an advanced treatment center. Its not a MK Ultra brainwashing program. If only the world was really that cool/Hollywood Movie-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIMH works on psyche repair for war trauma, amid other programs. None of which remotely are tied to Black Programs. All the research is lit, and you can see exactly what 3 PD's are working on Kanye at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       His sleep schedule indicates this is likely a chemically generated breakdown. Nobody stays up for 48 hours naturally. If you listen to the 3 recorded "outbursts", he likely was on cocaine or aderall again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy who pulled him off was the stage hand who likely was told to step in before Kayne totally lost it. This was likely done by the tour manager who pulled funding after seeing Kayne for the second night on uppers and off his bi-polar's. KW is over $55mm in debt, so the manager stepping in to pull the tour bridge loan is the most likely reason for explaining the cancelled shows. Line this up with the underwhelming record sales of St Pablo and most of the conspiracy theory becomes a benign story of stress + brain damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kris likely checked Kanye in, with the approval of his local manager out of fear for what he could do on microphone. KW has no signing authority over his own accounts for the above reasoning. Lack of impulse control means you cant get a corp loan. Between his understanding of the Roc Fella 1990's and the Cocaine trade and the LA 10-Oak sex rings, he knows just enough about the dirty underside of the entertainment industry to be dangerous to himself and Kim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TLDR:
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye is a literal insane man who is being enabled for declining record sales. He has no friends and professionals not inside the Rap Game (aka. circle jerk) legitimately feel sorry for him. His unchecked mental decline has made him hard to deal with, but it does not negate from his tragedy. You can witness this and how "normal people" interact with KW most clearly in the Bloomberg leaders series events alongside Ben Horowitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kayne is a product and this is not the first time mental illness has been paraded around for an agenda. Nor the last. Its just RedPill's can start to see what your Celeb's are, in all their busted glory.

       I'm a huge Ye fan and agree with you on most of this, but you need some sort of sources. There's almost 0 factual, concrete info on the claims you make about him being 35% brain damaged.

       As dumb as this sounds Will.I.Am should be stepping in about now to help Kanye out of this mess. For much of the same reasons he took on Fergie and collaborated with Beiber &amp; Spears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stepping back out to watch the threads. While Kanye is a tragedy, the "Alt-Right" should focus less on the distraction that is Kanye in a brain-trust and back on what matters to the millions of US voters: Sex Crimes, Bribery and your Government's non-sanctioned Grey areas. (I'm so funny ~sic).

       So we are just supposed to over look the already proven fact of the existing MKU infrastructure within the building? Are we also over looking the cornucopia of non celebrity admittance? You seem so intent on shifting the narrative of this to focus his personal  disability,  granted his physical disability does effect his mental state.  What boggles my mind is anytime anything negative is said in the light of the public about this building and its past/present operations the sock puppets come out in staggering force. What is it that they say about covering up misconduct,  the harder you focus on telling a lie the more you slip up? Something of that nature, I could be off on the wording though it is pretty early here.

       He doesn't need to be on uppers to be acting like that.  A bipolar person during a manic episode is pretty indistinguishable from someone on coke/meth/whatever.  Mania mixed with sleep deprivation can be pretty bad.

       It's not early onset bipolar if you're past your teens. Also acquired brain injuries are worst at the time of injury and get better as time passes and with treatment (to an extent). It doesn't take time for the damage to set in, the damage occurs at the time of injury and then shortly afterwards if there's any swelling in the brain.

       No see, it's much more than that.  We have here indisputable proof here of 4 things, each wilder than the last:
1. Celebrities like LA
2. Celebrities occasionally "go nuts" "do drugs" "overdose" and other "things" that require hospitalization 
3. There exists a well respected large hospital in the rich part of LA (Westwood is dead center of all the rich neighborhoods).  Supposedly, it has some connection to a large public university, and there is evidence the government has given them a lot of money to research "public health"
4. Some celebrities go to said hospital for "treatment" of their "issues," and return "better"
      </p>
      <p>
       One would have to be willfully blind to not connect these dots and realize that the government controls and owns Kanye's and our lives, and silencing Yeezus is CRUCIAL to the continued success of their plan.

       I came across this quote while researching CSMC (a hospital Ye's Dr was associated with in the past):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As of 2013, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Cedars-Sinai #13 out of hospitals across the United States and #3 in the western United States, behind only UCLA Medical Center and UCSF Medical Center.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe there's something to it but I don't see it here this time.

       I'm absolutely shocked.  I can't believe these famous people go to the hospital right by bel air, beverly hills, and not far from hollywood hills.  It doesn't make sense, there must be something more to it.

       Awesome, I actually just watched a pbs special on black history since MLK called And Still I Rise. It glossed over conspiracies about creating divisions among blacks but with my knowledge of that, this rant actually dovetails really well with the special. Music should be more political and it is sad how black music was once anti establishment but has lost a lot of that power despite their being really political black and other artists around. Blacks ought to be a natural ally of the conspiracy minded people that question authority.

       So I'm thinking that the "deal" these people make with "the devil" to "sell their souls" is actually sort of true. In exchange for being allowed to achieve fame and success, they must agree to be programmed and give away their control over themselves. That is how these people are able to accumulate wealth/fame- be it able to lead groups of people, see patterns in the stock market, perform in front of millions of people, navigate successful companies, hit three pointers, etc. Sometimes, one of the programmed people who are too familiar in the public eye glitch out, and have to be corralled into one of these facilities and "fixed," or reprogrammed.

       That's what always gets to me--the sophistication of this stuff dating back to the 70s is
       <em>
        astounding
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a little 'woo woo' but I'm especially interested in what theta programming (psychic warfare) was about. It reminds me of the movie, "The Men Who Stare at Goats" and the preface that more of this movie is true than could possibly be imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time I watched "The Men Who Stare at Goats" I thought it was ridiculous. The second time I watched it after getting red pill'd I thought, "ho lee shit." Some of the victims said that the agency claiming theta programming was a failure was absolutely untrue; that it
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       work. It's actually something everybody could do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gave me a lot of consideration of reiki, which is manipulating energies for healing rather than harm.

       Side note, Michael Jackson was already dead by the time the ambulance even reached his house. He had already been experiencing rigor mortis and it was Conrad Murray who forced the EMT's to bring him to the hospital (so the house would not be declared a crime scene until days later and could be tampered with).

       Otherwise, good points.

       The trend could be discretion.

      <p>
       Is that the complete list of celebrities that have used that hospital or are you cherry picking the nutters?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you're not onto something, just offering a plausible alternative. If a newspaper would pay a fortune for inside details of your condition, would you not also go to a hospital that has a good track record for discretion? A hospital that other celebrities have used in the past. What are the chances that hospital is also situated close to their target market?

       Actually, I remember thinking, "what are all of the celebrities I can remember that had serious mental breakdowns requiring a psych ward?" And crazily enough, almost ALL of them ended up here. So much so, that it struck me as very bizarre (I also forgot to add Mary Kate Olsen, who also went here).

       This is all true, MK Ultra at Ronald Regan UCLA Medical Center is exactly where they take these poor celeb's, they are REPROGRAMMING HIM as well as KIM K., I escaped the program back in 1999 before 9/11. I shouldn't even be posting here but the truth needs to come out. Breakdowns are the key word to the world, he didn't have a breakdown, they are breaking him down and then reprogramming his mind along with Kim K. What actually happened is that he tried to see through the first programming by what he said, and that was his first mistake. They then post headlines that read his mental stability was compromised, ie. "fake news", it is fake news, all of it, the election, 9/11, boston bombing, cop shootings, school shootings, all of it. They are BLACK OPS, CIA, carried out by MK Ultra programmers. This is a sign that something huge is coming, prepare you and your families, do not believe anything the media tells you, they are using the media in the from of the most deadly MK ULTRA programs, I can not tell you the name, but it is the most deadly form of the program, it involves you and your families and children especially, may God find you, who ever you believe in, because this is the beginning of the end, the other sign is when Donald J Trump won the election. Also notice the names of Kyane and the doctor, same last names. Wake up sheeple, the final curtain is being raised finally unveiling the NEW WORLD ORDER way of life right in front of your eyes. AND YOU ALL FELL FOR IT, that is true MK ULTRA PROGRAMMING, it has already been embedded in your HEADS, BRAINS, EYES and ACTIONS. YOU ARE ALL SHEEP!

       You've gotta wonder about these celebrities. The more I read about them, the more I feel bad for them. If they truly have been brainwashed and programmed, then most (if not all) of their crazy leftist political / SJW bullshit isn't actually coming from them. They are victims.

       So... One source from "the voice of scientology" and the others just saying these celebrities were admitted at the hospital. OK? Am I supposed to take the scientology source seriously? By the way the Ronald Reagan medical center is not the same place as the UCLA medical center. They are close but different.

       Well first off I can't really answer some of your questions; as much as the "darkness" has tried to allure me I have only tip toed around it's soul-damning lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be good, they want to live peacefully and let others do the same. They don't really care about the inner workings of the universe (we used to know much more in ancient times by default, so they needed not care as much as we do) because life is easy, and happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       God has done some fucked up shit; Canaan, Sodom and Gamorrah; millions killed by Israelites, the crusades, jihad, inquisition, sexual control, parental control, pedophile priests, and keeping secrets from the masses..
      </p>
      <p>
       These are only the
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       crimes the Church has committed. God knows what we don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people could not face these harsh realities. Those who can either
      </p>
      <p>
       a) die trying to fight it
      </p>
      <p>
       b) are forced or coerced into joining the cult
      </p>
      <p>
       c) experience victories but are shortchanged by historians (I.e. Jesus, Buddha, Rumi, Ghandi, MLK, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The church isn't good, it's evil. They invented the "good guy narrative" (stolen from the real healer, Jesus) so it would sell. Ther god is Satan, at least the guys at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the secrecy goes, the things these people do would make your stomach turn. Torturing and molesting children and babies, forcing them into scary situations to sap their innocence, and their fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think so many children go missing? Are there really that many kidnappers? Like millions of them? Or is it a concerted effort?

       If you think she is a better dancer now, you must be one of those fans that became a fan after her meltdown. I've been a fan since day one, so I know what I'm talking about. Her dance moves are mediocre at best. She is still extremely stiff on stage. It looks almost like she is counting her steps. She is constantly doing the same moves with her arms. She pretty much walks from point A to point B the entire time, very robotic. She is not terrible, but she is far from the amazing perform she used to be before her breakdown. The lip syncing never bothered me, but she uses vocals from 20 years ago on her shows which is just ridiculous. At least use some recent pre recorded vocals if you don't want to to sing.

       Personality wise, she was always kind of shy, true, but during the Oops era, she really blossom and became a lot more outgoing. Just watch her SNL skits, and her Hawaii TV Special and you will see what I mean. After her meltdown she was never the same again, and that's a fact. Just some of her fans are too in denial to see that.
