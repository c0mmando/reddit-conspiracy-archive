       As readers of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       I believe many of us have a much deeper understanding of 'the way the world goes round' and the truth behind the mainstream narrative. In most cases we have a good grasp on the truth behind world events and this is because we question everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, I personally believe that we have an obligation to at least try and wake family / friends up from the mass deception that is our mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been seeking the truth from alternative news sources and journalists for the best part of 10 years and during this time have had to deal with the usual attacks that many of us have become accustomed to.
       <em>
        This
       </em>
       , I don't mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does bother me however, is when people are presented with
       <em>
        the truth
       </em>
       yet
       <em>
        refuse
       </em>
       to believe it, even when the subject would be of importance to someone that maintains an understanding of world news / current events and
       <em>
        professes
       </em>
       to hold a high level of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kind of people I'm talking about are those who read what I call "highbrow" publications such as "The Guardian". These publications are generally read by a well-educated audience. Given this, they lap it up without even questioning the motives or truth behind any given article. I'm sure you know people like this, we all do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can hold a debate and argue a point without it getting heated and always listen to the other persons point of view without interrupting them. This is crucial when trying to ease someone into the truth. After patently listening, I then present my opinion and lay out the facts. Quite often I'll show them or email supporting articles and evidence to back up my argument. These usually don't even get read properly (if at-all) as the next conversation we have ends up stagnating on the same differences in opinion despite the facts I've presented which refute their claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this I find myself getting increasingly worked-up when holding conversations with these people and I'm even struggling to have
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       conversation with them as I know it will end up with a disagreement, which is normally fine, but when it keeps happening despite the facts and the truth being right in fucking front of them it leaves me completely raging inside with my pulse going 200bpm.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you personally deal with this and what have you found to work? I think this is an important subject to discuss as it's all well and good us agreeing with each other on here but surely the best way for us to propagate our message is by word of mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is thank the internet Gods for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I understand your frustration, but I think something I have learned is that I don't know the truth any more than they do. I hardly even believe there is such a thing as truth in geopolitics and world events. However, what I do know is not to trust any source implicitly. If you can instil in someone the desire to seek secondary and tertiary sources independent of the primary source you have just won. If you think your alternate sources are 100% truth then how are you any different from them as far as media consumption goes? The world is made up of shades of grey.

       Very good point. You're right, what we read and discuss isn't "the truth" but it's a lot closer to it than the mainstream narrative. I don't really think there is any single "truth" to many of these issues but we can get a lot closer to facts than the media wants us to. "The world is made up of shades of grey" is a really good way to describe it! I think I could have communicated my point a bit more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm really trying to say is, it's deeply frustrating that people who are quite intelligent are forming their opinions based on what the media tells them. This would be somewhat forgivable if they didn't pretend to know what's going on in the world but media outlets such as The Guardian speak to a certain audience who
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       pretend to know what's going on. Now I don't believe for a second that we know anything close to
       <em>
        the real
       </em>
       truth but we're a damned sight closer to it than most.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Syria conflict is a good example, the media are ignoring what independent journalists and
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Yc-RmAVK8Pg?t=16m52s">
        The US Peace Council
       </a>
       are saying. It's really scary watching these people believe the lies and fall for the propaganda which is drumming up support for an invasion of Syria. We've seen this done time and time again as a preface to war, yet people still fall for it! Again, I'm not saying I know the "truth" about Syria as I don't think there is any single truth, like you said with "shades of grey", what I do think is that the mainstream belief of Assad being a monster is
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       from the truth and that's what angers me so much. It was a conversation on this subject that led to me writing this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: When I say "truth" the point I'm trying to get at is a collection of "truths" that point to a different conclusion than what CNN, BBC and The Guardian for example are trying to tell us.

       I have never once convinced someone that the news they read/see/hear is wrong. What I have convinced people about is that bias exists in the media, that the media is detrimental to their mental health, that most "news" is inconsequential and merely there to sell ads or papers, and is mostly salacious gossip mixed with opinion pieces. I don't think one single person in my 20+ years of researching alternate history has ever actually gone and done more research on their own after we talked. Maybe I am a bad rhetorician, maybe I just gave up trying to change minds long ago. However, my friends and family have noticed I am happy pretty much no matter what the news says, I sleep fine, I don't take any pharma, I am in good shape mentally and physically. I think this has far more of an effect than anything else. Whenever anyone asks me how I stay healthy I reply "I got rid of my TV a decade ago and do not read/watch/listen to the news". Invariably they then ask me how I keep up with current affairs, and I ask them for an example. Then I tell them in gory detail all about the example they gave. They soon understand that I do know what is going on despite not feeding at the media trough. Show people there is another way to live. Lead by example. Realize people are stubborn, and the TV is a mind control device stronger than what you yourself can wield. You can't break that programming in a few talks with people.

       It will
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       stop being an uphill battle. Most people aren't aware that from their conception, they're conditioned to be wage slaves rather than free thinkers. Free thinking is bad for business. Most people will live their entire lives never questioning what the news tells them; they will die believing the 9/11 official story and they will die thinking Sandy Hook was a real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most are too far gone to ever change. I'm lucky that I'm 25 and was able to catch what was happening a few years ago. It's completely changed my way of life. But most aren't that lucky. People like my mom will be happy eternally thinking only in the terms of "what should I buy next?" and she will never change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the frustration. I'm surrounded by people that think Hillary lost because she was a woman, people that think Trump is one of the "good guys", people that think Trump voters are racists, and people that think Hillary voters are informed. The purpose of the CIA and government propaganda in general is to let the American people believe whatever they want, just so long as none of it is true. It has worked spectacularly. No one asks the right questions because most people have been conditioned to be afraid of asking them or they simply don't even know what they are and "fake news" has just solidified their stronghold over the minds of the people. Of all the things that have happened in 2016, "fake news" is by far the most dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've just taken a giant leap in setting up a world where people will only be allowed to read and watch things that are pre-approved by the CIA and written by dopey hat-rabbit magicians in Langley.

       Here's what worked for me (after many failed attempts!) with my roommate regarding 9/11...I gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
       He, as a graphic artist, a skilled draftsman, a self-taught mechanical engineer, recording/audio tech and skilled musician, twenty-five years in heavy construction etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, I thought he could help walk me through all the videos I was trying to explore concerning 9/11 but he just got really angry at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's an avid shooter. Very well versed in all things firearms but I wasn't about to broach Sandy Hook with him! Then the Charlie Hebdo event happened and he was watching it unfold on his TV and he was all kinds of captivated watching CNN and or FOX...so I just sat back and waited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seemed as if he was going to talk about this event just because it didn't happen here and I felt very sick! So I jumped on line and the videos were being analyzed and they were explosive!
      </p>
      <p>
       The sidewalk head shot should tie it up nicely but I kept looking for other videos that showed analysis! The Deli one was really good! There were others, I lined them all up and prefaced the viewing with no sound and no interruptions until he watched them all the way through.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was pretty quiet. We started through the second time with stop and pause discussion, especially the head shot and the Deli. This was a way for me to ask him what he was seeing, with his own eyes!
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing out of his mouth was the head-shot was blurred out on National TV. Okay, this one isn't blurry...what do you see? Not a head shot at close range with a rifle...no bounce, no blood. The Deli one blew him away as well!
      </p>
      <p>
       I loaded a bunch of stuff up for him on a thumb drive and turned him loose. He came out the next morning pretty ashen faced. He said the Sandy Hook fire house video looked like a damned circus, and the fat mutt mishandling a high powered rifle was obscene...
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have very constructive discussions, even when we disagree. As for 9/11 he made it past the horror by looking at it head on, rather than from fear induced TV telling him he shouldn't look!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, finding out what makes a person
       <em>
        tick
       </em>
       in the real world is a big key, IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then too, often you just plant a seed, walk away and hope nature does the rest!

       Social isolation is an effective tool to control narrative.  The more destructive your message to their daily life, the harder they will resist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't underestimate a false comfort narrative to blind someone from rational thought.  When approaching a family member/friend with fact; I find it best not to let the dialogue venture towards a narrative that will degrade their comfort but rather try to enrich their position of empowerment over a false narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give them tools but don't try to steal their blanket.
Otherwise risk losing credibility in their mind; thus silencing your own voice.  Been there.

       Instill in them the seed of doubt and have them research it out of curiosity. Show them a picture of building 7 collapsing side by side a controlled demolition. See if they ask if it was hit by a plane, and say no.(If they don't, just state it was not hit by a plane) Then just leave it at that, and eventually they will research it and discover the truth.

       I was showing a video of an aluminum aircraft piercing through an entire skyscraper.  It comes out on the other side, pristine.  Intact.  It disintegrates, while the building behind it explodes.  I show multiple angles of the same "miracle of physics."

       The response is, "so what?".

       If people ever realized just how stupid and deluded they were, there would be mass suicides around the globe.  Fortunately for them, they'll never know.

       OP, there comes a time when you have to actively choose those with whom you're prepared to associate
      </p>
      <p>
       If your friends and family were gangsters, killers, etc., would you continue to associate with them and be pulled down with them?  No.  You'd cut them loose
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it's the same with those of low-IQ
      </p>
      <p>
       Lie with dogs, get fleas
      </p>
      <p>
       Walk with cripples and you learn to limp
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a choice
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of idiots
      </p>
      <p>
       Few with nous
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose and don't look back
