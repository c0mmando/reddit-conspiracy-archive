        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Amen_ds.html">Amen_ds</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have reached a point in our progress that we have for the first time in human history decentralized information. Since society&#39;s conception information has been centralized through a leader, monarch, religious institution etc. FOREVER. </p>

<p>This means that the peoples who run a society have always by in large dictated the knowledge base of the society. This motif can be seen in the book burnings that were a rampant occurrence during instances when two or more societies clashed. This served as a literal expression of controlling the knowledge.</p>

<p>Through most of the Industrial Age it was much the same. The printing press&#39;s invention at the dawn of the scientific revolution had helped the masses become literate but in the early days they were only printing bibles. As time went on a multitude of works became published and the rulers of societies recognized their problem. Simply controlling the information being no longer feasible they switched to controlling the narrative. </p>

<p>You need not control the information one obtains as long as you control the filter which it passes through. That&#39;s why societies form these domestication rituals for children (here in u.s. Pledge of allegiance etc.). Even though there may be so called outliers of this process of domestication they are easily ignored by the masses whose filters &#39;stuck&#39;. </p>

<p>Now I could argue that the Industrial Revolution is over (at least in the u.s.) and we&#39;ve already become a post-Industrial nation. I could also argue that at this point we have DECENTRALIZED information via the internet and that the powers that be are in a check mate on this front. </p>

<p>We have all seen the multitudes of misinfo, disinfo, shilling, and trolling that has absolutely flooded this relatively quiet and often mocked corner of Reddit we call r/conspiracy and we would be fools to think it&#39;s all CTR. Truth be told post campaign CTR may be but a drop in the bucket of all the Web PR firms here now. But here&#39;s the kicker - it isn&#39;t working. Subreddit to subreddit, chan to chan it isn&#39;t working. People have woken the fuck up to the indignities of those powerful and have, to this point, remained unfettered in pursuit of their goals. </p>

<p>So what does that mean if a societies rulers cannot control our information, or warp the narrative, or confuse us with mis/disinfo? I don&#39;t know. Maybe we&#39;ll see more internal website &#39;closures&#39; like we&#39;ve seen at the daily sheeple and another site I&#39;ve forgotten. Whatever they do they will not allow us to consume/distribute redpills in these venues forever. We are essentially on the event horizon of their downfalls here in this sub.</p>

<p>Prepare yourselves for censorship, REAL censorship. Not just mods taking down threads, but ISPs taking down entire servers. Think off shore servers are safer? Not when we start exposing elite international trafficking of children. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is stock up on facts fast. Stock up on redpills because there maybe a situation unfolding where you will have to be a regional red piller. For your family, friends, shit even for the dick from sales because when it comes down to it there is only ONE enemy and we must stand as ONE people to defeat them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off the top of my head I can&#39;t think of anything related to conspiracy and the Jesuits etc that I would recommend, however I&#39;m thinking specifically of the book &#39;the Phenomenon of Man&#39; by the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, which is essentially a discussion of the ultimate realization of man&#39;s evolutionary potential in the form of noosphere. It was published in 1955. </p>

<p>As I said, I can&#39;t think of a great source to recommend regarding Jesuit conspiracy at the moment, but I&#39;ll put some thought into it. But Chardin&#39;s book (and the scholarship around it; it&#39;s not the most accessible read) is a great starting point to understand the metaphysical beliefs that are central to their philosophy. </p>

<p>Also look into the topic of their use of torture methods in the Inquisitions as a precursor to modern mind control programs like MK Ultra. If you read about them from some diverse historic perspectives you will notice some patterns and come to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>&#39; seeing jews comprise less than 2% of various nation&#39;s populations, their participation/ownership/control of the media should ALSO be no more than 2%</p>
