<p>Can you imagine how powerful these gang members must feel when there is absolutely no reprecussion or consequences to any crime? They would feel so untouchable that they would be unphazed when committing more crime. People with unthinkable power committing crimes without consequences can lead to very serious problems. </p>

<p>Once again, the people have to step in and straighten out the power holders that we entrusted with power. To top it all off, they abuse the people who gave them that power like they did in the Dakota protests when cops sprayed freezing water on the citizens to torture them or when they give someone a 25 year sentence for selling crack thereby ruining an entire family in the process while they continue to murder and destroy our planet. </p>

<p>These people are insane. That&#39;s the problem. Oceans of power always attract savage, insane brutes like Bill Clinton or George Bush. </p>

<p>The good guys in the FBI/CIA/PD etc are sick of this shit as much as we are... but until the internet came along they had no way to communicate without the bad FBI seeing what they were saying and ending any investigation. Now they are assembling a huge series of cases to rip the baddies out of the system... from the bottom up and top down simultaneously. Stay calm and don&#39;t be afraid... everything will be just fine... better than fine actually.  </p>

<p>The NY times articles, people still dying left and right (Clinton Body Count), noone getting prosecuted, upcomming -attempt- at censoring our internet, ...</p>

<p>I really hope we, the people, have an unseen ace up our sleeve, because the way I currently see all this play out is either every reddit user and friends/family going out to Washinton for perhaps the biggest protest in human history (aint gonna happen) or the establishment sweeping this all under the rug and preventing the people from ever doing such a thing again.

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  </p>

<p>Comey, McCabe, Lynch, Kadzik and their cohorts are all complicit or corrupt. They have been in the past, and they continue to be now. </p>

<p>If anyone in the FBI or DOJ was not complicit or corrupt, they would come out publicly and demand justice. Their corruption and complicity to corruption has enabled, condoned and endorsed corruption at all levels. America is lawless. The rule of law is dead. They have zero integrity. </p>

<p>Comey is a liar and a deceiver. Any child that is or has been killed or tortured since he has known about this, and any citizen who has been killed or threatened or had their rights violated or lives ruined, is his direct responsibility. He is a &quot;pussy&quot;. You cannot take that job and be such a &quot;pussy&quot;. You have to willing to sacrifice it all for the rule of law, and he is doing the opposite. </p>

<p>Trump better be bluffing, and he better drain the swamp and end this his first day in office, or there will be no future in a lawless America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello friend! I have some reassuring news: <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/10/19/FBI-rescues-82-children-arrests-more-than-200-in-sex-trafficking-sting/1151476859195/">http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/10/19/FBI-rescues-82-children-arrests-more-than-200-in-sex-trafficking-sting/1151476859195/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not the authorities are sitting on their thumbs. It&#39;s that they&#39;ve been working with Interpol to first of all rescue all these innocent children that have been abducted and trafficked globally. And then the intelligence officers have had to make hundreds of arrests. It&#39;s a gigantic house of cards that&#39;s been taking down behind the scenes. Apparently they have somebody on the inside who&#39;s talking. The above article took place just a few weeks ago but is relevant to your anxieties and so I posted. The one thing the inside sources keep saying over and over again is just keep spreading the info about the Clinton Foundation and Pizzagate until the information tsunami can&#39;t be contained. This is all we the little people can do for right now because the powers that be that are in a position to do the heavy lifting are moving heaven and earth as we speak. Besides independently investigating and spreading the word all we can do is stay vigilant and be prepared for anything. </p>

Think the UN, and the EU combined, then slowly stir in the Middle East, Asia, Russia, India, Indonesia, etc. It is done by controlling the money, which is done by the international bankers, and controlling production which is done by the mega corporations. The politicians, intelligence agencies, military leaders and academics are brought under control using money, sex, drugs, power, and influence. They are kept under control using bribery and extortion. The ones that get caught, die, disappear or are discredited strayed to far from the message or had a change of heart. 
This is just a theory of course, I know nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t prove it but here&#39;s how it works. All of life is conscious. God has nearly an infinite amount of personality attributes.  Each of those attributes is given independent freedom and each one takes a turn falling into decent and evolving from scratch back into their total selves. The whole point of it is to adventure. </p>

<p>Right now we are a bit separate, but when we evolve back to the very top in totality, we will melt into each other and become our total self again. That total self is who we really are. </p>

<p>When you meet interesting people, you are learning a part of your self that you disconnected from. In the end, there is only one person experiencing all of life in an endless array of variety. </p>

<p>We humans are considered savages right now and for a very long time we have been. This is all about to change within 1-18 years from now. As humans evolve, we learn about this great secret of life and then realize that anything we do to harm each other, we are really just doing to ourselves. Why would anyone beat themselves? It just doesn&#39;t make sense. At that point, we start day 1 of the golden age of man. </p>

<p>There is a slight possibility that we might destroy ourselves but the odds seem reasonable that we are going to make breakthroughs as a planet in the coming years. This is necessary and 2016 was pretty active so it looks like we are on the right track. </p>

<p>As we evolve mentally, the rest of the planet evolves with us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes all possibility is already played out, but we are looking through a view point that can only focus on a specific section of possibility, so we don&#39;t get to perceive all possibility, only some, we call the unfolding of said limited possibility &#39;time&#39;</p>
