<p>Yes. It would be nice to see her get investigated for any number of things. But the main thing is that her political career (and her ability to cause further harm) has been ended.</p>

<p>Seeing her put on trial and convicted would be the icing on the cake. We might not get the icing, but we&#39;ve definitely gotten the cake.</p>

<p>This.</p>

<p>He also might not need to get involved. Technically, the investigation is still ongoing. It&#39;s still possible that justice will be served without him having to get directly involved and rile up a large chunk of Clinton-supporting lefties and create more divisiveness.</p>

<p>Yes and no.  The AG works autonomously, this is true, but do you really think any AG has ever gone after a political figure without the president&#39;s nod?</p>

<p>With that said, you and others are counseling for a wait and see attitude, which is fine, but if he doesn&#39;t hold up this campaign promise, what then?  He&#39;s already suggesting lobbyist after lobbyist for his cabinet positions, from Steve Mnuchin to Jonathan Gray, both having their hands in the &#39;07 Too Big To Fail bullshit, as well as others.  You don&#39;t drain the swamp by buying more alligators.</p>

<p>So I just wonder, how many of you wanting to wait and see will go quiet or act like you were never supporters once he disappoints you like every other politician ever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right now, the situation is that many people within the FBI want to prosecute Clinton and her cronies. They would, but loretta lynch and the rest of the obama appointed DOJ have stepped in the way and refuse to let them go farther. Comey is just the figurehead of the FBI, he cannot get around the DOJ. </p>

<p>When Trump&#39;s people are in office, with a new DOJ, the FBI can continue with whatever investigations they see fit, and most likely the new DOJ will not prevent them from investigating hillary. Trump is telling the truth that he is not going to be leading the movement to  lock her up (which would generate lots of bad press, and protests even during inauguration, calling him a fascist)   - he simply wont interfere with the FBI</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for sure, no one knows except Trump. </p>

<p>I do know that he will do what is in our best interest and he does listen to his supporters and the American citizens in general.</p>

<p>My belief is that he will allow law enforcement to do their jobs. If law enforcement sees problems, he will let them indict.</p>

<p>Politically speaking, it&#39;s not in his best interest to take a personal stand in going after Clinton. If he were to do that, we would see many politicians start going after people who disagree with them... That is what dictators do.</p>

<p>It is in his best interest to keep distance between his political aspirations and law enforcement matters.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s administration had been accused of encouraging the IRS to go after conservative institutions as well as quashing investigations into Clinton foundation, to me and to many people, that looks like corruption.</p>

<p>He will keep his hands clean of anything that looks shady like that. We cannot have politicians getting involved in law enforcement matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>is it not obvious by now that Trump was just saying whatever he thought would get people to like him, that he was only motivated by his thirst for attention and power? He flip-flops and gives indefinite answers so much, the phrase said most frequently by him is probably &quot;I&#39;ll take a closer look at it&quot; because he rarely knows about or has an opinion on a topic. Immediately after the election he started saying things like Clinton&#39;s a good person, the &quot;beautiful, terrific&quot; wall is now going to be a chainlink fence, and Obamacare has gone from &quot;the worst bill ever&quot; to &quot;we&#39;re gonna try keep most of the bill&quot;. <em>He didn&#39;t actually care about whatever crimes Clinton may have committed, or give a damn about what you wanted</em> - he knew it got people fired up if he pretended to. Why would he keep up the act after he&#39;s got what he wanted? What are people going to do, unvote for him? It&#39;s obvious if you pay attention to what he often says: absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>For a sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where people are meant to question everything, it&#39;s strange the amount of people here who take what a rich guy, with shady connections and history, says at face value.</p>
