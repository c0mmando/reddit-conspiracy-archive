+2000’s • 9/11 2001: nation-wide shock as A=B interactions nationally are broken; ‘terrorism’ repeated - unifying ideas are easiest to plant in chaos, patriotism is the collective thought, war ensues. Important for later; American people barely told about specifics, just war. Wikileaks shows that Afghanistan was the wrong place to attack, perhaps other reasons to invade.
• Flight logs show that Bill, without telling the secret service, visited the Jeffery Epstein&#39;s island 26 times between 2001-2003 <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/</a> • mid-2000’s: pedophilia allegations start stacking up against Sigmund Freud’s grandson, Clement Freud. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/</a> IMPORTANT Freud had a villa in Portugal, important for later.

• John Podesta’s start May 4th, 2007 the day after Maddy was abducted, and it’s his assistant answering emails because he is out of town. Scotland Yard in 2013 digitally developed the faces of the two men who supposedly abducted Maddy <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Chk4Af">https://i.sli.mg/Chk4Af</a>. It is in this very same town in Portugal that the Podesta’s good friend, Clement Freud also had a holiday home, and oddly enough hosted the parents of McCann after the abduction <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3643373/PICTURED-sinister-holiday-villa-paedophile-MP-Clement-Freud-hosted-McCanns-weeks-Madeleine-vanished.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3643373/PICTURED-sinister-holiday-villa-paedophile-MP-Clement-Freud-hosted-McCanns-weeks-Madeleine-vanished.html</a>
• 2008: John Podesta, who was chief of staff to Bill C was appointed counselor to Obama.
• Maddy McCann case never solved, originally it was said to be a theft that went wrong leading to the thieves to take McCann, but that has been disproved. Now, Scotland Yard claims to know exactly who the people were but due to international protection laws, can not pursue the people <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485524/Portuguese-detective-says-MI5-spies-know-what-happened-to-Madeleine-McCann">http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485524/Portuguese-detective-says-MI5-spies-know-what-happened-to-Madeleine-McCann</a>.
• Sept 13 2007: Bush says 168,000 troops will reduce to 5700 by the end of the year (146,000 remained at the end of the year)
• Feb 27 2009: Obama changes plan to leave 35,000-50,000 troops in the Middle Eastern nation as a ‘transitional force’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq</a>. Important for later; Syria.

It is estimated 7000 children could leave the country in the next year. In many cases the parents have not met the children, just picked from photographs”.
• Laura Silsby and Jeffery Epstein were both at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding.
+2010-Present • 2010: Laura Silsby and 10 missionaries caught trying to smuggle 33 children, who still had parents, out of Haiti. Jorge Puello was her legal advisor. He at that time also under investigation for smuggling people across the US border and later found guilty <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/americas/12haiti.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/americas/12haiti.html</a>. Silsby was found guilty in May of that year <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/02/laura_silsby_haiti_orphans_wou.html">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/02/laura_silsby_haiti_orphans_wou.html</a> and upon the leaking of Podesta’s emails, we found that Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin would frequently forward articles to HRC and that HRC inquired several times about the organization prior to 2010 and additionally emails showing HRC contacting a lawyer in regards to 10 people arrested in a child trafficking ring <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a> (should be noted WikiLeaks is a precise organization with a 10yr track record of 100% authenticity, they would not just mindlessly retweet clickbait) &amp; <a href="http://www.charismanews.com/politics/elections/61050-redditor-clintons-connection-to-laura-silsby-discovered">http://www.charismanews.com/politics/elections/61050-redditor-clintons-connection-to-laura-silsby-discovered</a>.

• 2011: Syrian Civil War begins. Syrian Government vs. protest groups to overthrow the President, Assad. Protest groups merged into one, Free Syrian Army. US Government funded the Free Syrian Army, which would later split and form ISIL. Many foreign powers funded either side, making this a manufactured crisis, a proxy war <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War</a>.
• Prior to the civil war, proposed pipeline plans <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74">http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74</a> both pipelines would need to go through Syria. Russia supported Iran’s pipeline, US supported Qatar/Saudi’s pipeline. An anonymous twitter account pieced together all the pipeline strategy in addition to tying in Benghazi and also the $6B the US Government gave Iran (which was NOT for hostages… even though we got hostages in return) and how Iran in turn transferred the money to Russia which pissed our Res &amp; HRC off <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/792935309285613568">https://twitter.com/i/moments/792935309285613568</a>. The 6 Billion could have also been for this deal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-to-sign-6-billion-gas-field-deal-with-total-cnpc-1478525034">http://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-to-sign-6-billion-gas-field-deal-with-total-cnpc-1478525034</a> in which Iran took the money, gave the US the middle finger, and then signed with France. Qatar gave the C Foundation a $1M gift which the Foundation didn’t notify the US Government, and since 1997 Saudi Arabia has donated between $10-$25M to the foundation. And while the US Government no longer funds the Free Syrian Army which turned into ISIL, Saudi Arabia still does <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-clinton-foundation-isis-same-money-saudi-arabia-qatar-funding-a7397211.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-clinton-foundation-isis-same-money-saudi-arabia-qatar-funding-a7397211.html</a> and so for HRC to implement a no-fly zone over Syria, it would cut Russia out of control which would lead to conflict as they are supporting the Iranian pipeline. However, even if the pipeline is the main Middle Eastern issue, there are other reasons to be creating conflict &amp; war.
• Assuming US involvement in the Syrian proxy war is NOT what they talk about (liberating Syria from Assad) but rather to get a cut from a pipeline’s profit, the C Foundation involvement in an issue that involves displacing people (moving Syrians all over the world) is a pattern.

• In the recent week: 1) Iceland kicks FBI out after authorities lie about visit to protect Iceland from a cyber attack against government databases; turned out they were only there to gather information on WikiLeaks <a href="http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-iceland-kick-out-fbi/">http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-iceland-kick-out-fbi/</a>. 2) Norwegian police infiltrate a pedophile network, arresting 20 and having 31 more suspects. It’s said they met on the dark web to run this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/11/20/world/europe/ap-eu-norway-pedophile-network.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/11/20/world/europe/ap-eu-norway-pedophile-network.html?_r=0</a> 3) Within a day or two, it came out that the FBI was in control of 23 child porn sites on the dark web <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/12/rbi-child-porn-sites-sting/">http://fortune.com/2016/11/12/rbi-child-porn-sites-sting/</a> 4) Today (11/20/16) Norway announced unprecedentedly that it will be cutting its donations to the C Foundation next year by 90% <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/norway-donations-to-clinton-foundation-to-fall-nearly-90-off-peak/">http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/norway-donations-to-clinton-foundation-to-fall-nearly-90-off-peak/</a> 5) Obama &amp; Merkel hold conference to call for internet censorship <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvWIaFR7I4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvWIaFR7I4</a> days after it came out that Germany was missing nearly 9000 children. 6) Turkey, who has a vast internet censorship, moves forward with legislation that states if a man rapes/abuses an underage person, nothing will happen as long as that man marries that underage person <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38041510">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38041510</a>. 7) After reexamining emails from the Pedesta leaks, people started noticing repeated, oddly worded food-related emails coming up, which lead to PizzaGate.
+PizzaGate • Pretty much summed up here:<a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5da0kp/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/?compact=true">https://m.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5da0kp/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/?compact=true</a> and with this short video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo</a> and this longer, more detailed video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8YdSvyp89E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8YdSvyp89E</a>
• Leading up to the strange, seemingly coded emails leaked, along with the senders and recipients of the emails, there were 2-3 decades filled with undebatable pedophilia in DC, and around the world in elite places. These are to serve as anchoring facts.
• People started to look into the coding when Anthony Weiner’s (he himself is a pedophile, and husband to HRC’s top aide Huma Abedin) laptop was confiscated by the NYPD, and handed over to the FBI.
• handkerchief pizza <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a> email sender (Sandler) pays him $7000 a month <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/john-podesta-donor-foundation-230571">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/john-podesta-donor-foundation-230571</a> also talking to Sandler <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613</a>
• Email with Marina Abramovic about coming over for Spirit Cooking <a href="http://wearechange.org/spirit-cooking-disturbing-podesta-email-yet-warning-graphic-content/">http://wearechange.org/spirit-cooking-disturbing-podesta-email-yet-warning-graphic-content/</a>
• Emails showed communication with Comet Pizza, which is owned by James Alefantis who was the boyfriend of David Brock who founded Media Matters for America, and then Correct The Record (CTR), which was widely used during HRC’s presidential campaign.
• Comet Pizza and the next 3 businesses are owned by HRC people. The head of the child trafficking branch of the FBI owns a pizza place 4 doors down from Comet called Besta (Beast) Pizza which recently changed it’s logo; the old one was a pedophile symbol for ‘boy lover’. The store in between Alefantis’ owned Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s is owned by a man who is hired by the owner of Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore, an associate/speech writer for, which is strange since he’s running Little Red Fox and also helping fun the bookstore <a href="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.pnghttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png">https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.pnghttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png</a>.
• Comet pizza has a password access part of website
• George Soros gave them $11,000 dollars
+Future • Salon magazine (who vehemently calls to end ‘fake news’ and yet posts things like this, HRC’s 95% of winning…which is owned/funded by IAC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAC_(company)#Publishing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAC_(company)#Publishing</a> a company that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of members) published this article in May 2016 <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/05/17/im_not_a_monster_a_pedophile_on_attraction_love_and_a_life_of_loneliness/">http://www.salon.com/2016/05/17/im_not_a_monster_a_pedophile_on_attraction_love_and_a_life_of_loneliness/</a> essentially calling be open minded towards pedophiles as an ‘orientation, using phrases such as “an ‘out’ pedophile” much like a non-closeted member of the LGBT community. Perhaps an interesting conversation if we’re considering it a mental ILLNESS or cause/effect of an emotional trauma taking place in ones childhood (not an orientation) but then in Sept. of 2016 Salon followed up with this article about how the previous article “outraged The Right” <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/im_a_pedophile_youre_the_monsters_my_week_inside_the_vile_right_wing_hate_machine/">http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/im_a_pedophile_youre_the_monsters_my_week_inside_the_vile_right_wing_hate_machine/</a> mixing in politics which automatically gains support because if one side finds this gross, the other side should, therefore, be supportive and thus this article is trying to arm-bar The Left into a potential future where pedophiles are viewed as a sexual orientation and that its absurd/bigoted to disagree.
• The additional argument has been made that in the Middle East it is not uncommon to see a man marrying/owning a girl as young as 12 <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28250471">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28250471</a> “1/3 of marriages in Jordan are of girls under the age of 18” &amp; also <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2001029/Child-brides-young-5-married-secret-middle-aged-men.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2001029/Child-brides-young-5-married-secret-middle-aged-men.html</a>. Brian Stone, HRC Campaign paid writer and Huffington Post, a HRC Campaign paid publication <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53056#efmABtADz">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53056#efmABtADz</a> wrote an article about how America should look to become just like Dearborn, MI (44% population Arab-American, largest proportion of Arab-Americans in the US), and then said “think of how far ahead we’d be as a country if we were following Dearborn’s lead” <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-stone/what-if-america-looked-like-dearborn_b_9328288.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-stone/what-if-america-looked-like-dearborn_b_9328288.html</a> which is interesting since the Middle East as a whole doesn’t rank on the global ranking index for “best countries to live in” at all, (below North Korea which his the last ranked) <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking">http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking</a> no-one are ranked other than Qatar, U.A.E., and Israel which are low <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading">https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading</a> and the U.A.E. only has a decent economic ranking due to oil, the rest are in the bottom 1/4th globally <a href="http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp.php">http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp.php</a>
• Which leads to the point that when objectively looking at the treatment of Islam vs Judism or Christianity in the US, we see a suppression of Christian ideals (heterosexual-marriage only, anti-abortion; again, doesn’t matter your personal beliefs, just objectively comparing) and the praise of Muslim successes. Example: President-elect Trump to appoint Stephen Bannon; anti-semitic remarks. The next DNC will likely select Keith Ellison as chair, a man who while being the spokesman for the Nation of Islam in his 30’s constantly had anti-semitic remarks, and this is not in the media <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/17/democrats-must-scrutinize-keith-ellisons-anti-semitic-past-and-ties-to-radical-islam/">http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/17/democrats-must-scrutinize-keith-ellisons-anti-semitic-past-and-ties-to-radical-islam/</a>
• Go back to the 60’s with MK Ultra, and the 80’s when KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov talked about Soviet use of ideological submersion. Now plug in globalism; the movement to become 1 people, to have no borders. On a global scale, this effects major international corporations being able to more freely do trade, utilize areas of land, control smaller nations and larger amounts of people. Think of how in Europe, countries were told to set aside their own cultures to make way for refugees and their culture. Remember that the refugee crisis we know almost certainly know was not about ‘freeing Syria’ from Assad, but rather simply profiting from oil. Germany is on the verge of collapse <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/opinion/can-germany-be-honest-about-its-refugee-problems.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/opinion/can-germany-be-honest-about-its-refugee-problems.html</a> as is France <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/340954-france-migrants-crime-poll/">https://www.rt.com/news/340954-france-migrants-crime-poll/</a> and this article talks about how Muslim men, not because of who they are, but because of the culture they come from, are 23 times more likely than Swedish men in Sweden to commit rape. It also talks about how Japan did not open it’s doors to refugees stating Japan doesn’t want to commit “cultural suicide”<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/23/sweden-opened-its-doors-to-muslim-immigration-today-its-the-rape-capital-of-the-west-japan-didnt/">http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/23/sweden-opened-its-doors-to-muslim-immigration-today-its-the-rape-capital-of-the-west-japan-didnt/</a>. So, step 1) is to, through war and other events that break the averages persons’ A=B interactions through hysteria/chaos, develop a mass mindset that it is ok to move around/displace countries worth of people and that where ever they land we are helping them even though the chaos is fabricated, and that their culture needs to be recognized and further more, praised over the home country’s as this is a step in creating a global, singular culture. Step 2) rationalize and come to accept pedophilia (as that Salon article attempted to do) so that when moving around masses of people, it doesn’t have to be hidden that thousands of children are going missing since pedophilia will be a new orientation to respect. When 47% is dependent on a nations government <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/09/the-47-who-they-are-where-they-live-how-they-vote-and-why-they-matter/262506/">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/09/the-47-who-they-are-where-they-live-how-they-vote-and-why-they-matter/262506/</a> it only takes 5-10% to have a majority and which point most people will do what the government wants to do, since they rely on the government. Just this alone ties in with a globalist idea; would it not be better for less people to become more self-sufficient individuals? Going back to the ‘acceptance’ of pedophiles as sexual orientations, this seems like a thought planted to grow in a couple decades to come to fully accept pedophiles as a natural orientation.
• This mentality gets all the people involved in PizzaGate off the hook and forms a global society that caters to elitist needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that paedophile secret societes have been existing for centuries.
Imagine something like the Templars from Assassin&#39;s Creed: once they human societes formed they were not able to do their shit freely anymore, therefore they had to hide themselves and have enough power to keep doing it.</p>

<p>This is why there are so many paedophile priests in the church. 
The church has had political power for centuries and becoming a priest requires either to be literally insane or have hidden reasons to do it.</p>

<p>With the enlightment the church has started to lose its power, becoming almost powerless in the present day therefore the paedophiles have gone into politics and media and they seem to have been successfull in it.</p>

<p>This is why antiscientific and nonsense concepts like gender that harm children have been pushed through politics and the useful idiots of the movements of the 60s and 70s (and among them there were many paedophiles)</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s their final push: they are pushing for a society that accepts paedophilia with these concepts as trojan horses.</p>

<p>People are not buying it and they have pushed it harder in the last few years with the entire MSM going full feminist and LGBT groups used to pass crazy laws that have nothing to do with their rights or their health.</p>

Not only would I look far beyond those that get caught, I&#39;d be trying to figure out if anyone that is accused of being a pedophile actually is.  Look at what Assange was accused of...
