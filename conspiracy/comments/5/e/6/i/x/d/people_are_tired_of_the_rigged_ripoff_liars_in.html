       We win by staying focused on cleaning out the corruption,  the misrepresentation,  and exposing how the system has been rigged.   This is not about liberal,  left, right or conservative,  those categories are as dead as neocons and neoliberals are passe.    Its about getting a handle on the real issues of this Orwellian situation (the corporate elite feeding us shit and keeping us in the dark) and not getting distracted.    They don't want us to control the agenda,  they want to control it.    But guess what?   The agenda belongs to us,  not to them.    And the world just proved that the elites have lost it,  on both Brexit and Trump,  they are fucking clueless.    Let's take these lessons and stop getting screwed and screwing ourselves.

       Trump is another system of control. Dont slot the presidency into a system outside of this control.  That is an illusion.

       And what system of control do you suppose is there?    The democratic party,   republican party,  various corporations,  the IMF,  the federal reserve,   a large number of rich investors and CEOs,  landowners,  some old families,   Saudi leaders,  other world leaders,   there is a network of connected individuals that have varying degrees of influence.    These folks travel mostly by private jet and live lives that are insulated from normal people,  removed.  Effectively,  they have a huge level of control over military/mercenary/police power.   Effectively,  they determine what is on the corporate news and what is not.   Effectively,  they have a lot of say what happens within the government bureaucracies.   It seems that China,  Russia,  and some other countries are attempting to establish separate poles of influence from the main US/EU led crowd.

       What people are looking at is taking sides with Trump's group or Hillary's group.  That was my point.   Or left/right.   Liberal/conservative.   I say those old divides are useless/harmful to people's real interests at this point.   I say its their interests as an elite against our interests as the majority of normal people.   Its a war,  and the weapon now is largely information as they try to steal our roads,  our libraries,  our universities,  and our park lands,  every shred of property is being made private.   This used to be the common wealth of the people,  at least in theory.    I might be again.   There is a place for private property,  but the public wealth should not be allowed to be stolen,  and needs to be seized from the thieves.    The health of their economy depends on impoverishing the rest of us,  on turning our lives into a hell.

       Im still not quite getting your point. We know all of this exists. My point is that the remedy to these problems do not exist in supporting our current form of government. No candidate is going to be able to resolve these problems because the issue is a paradigm or systemic problem that is a byproduct of how our government is currently designed.

       We need self-government operating independently in all 50 states without central government intervention. That is really the only way to move forward without more of the same, IMHO.

       I just wanted to say I meant to say before I forgot about it that I do agree with the spirit of what you said, its a great point that we should not be supporting criminal groups and going along with the lesser evil which is a huge problem that keeps the crime going.
