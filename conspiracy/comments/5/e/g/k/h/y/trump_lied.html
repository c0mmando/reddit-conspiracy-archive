       Ok, even though i was really hopeful for this it seems that we need to accept that we were played by Trump. He backed up from prosecuting Hillary, it seems that we found out who he really is before getting to office. This is the end of MAGA for me. Back to reality again.

       Yeah, I got sucked into it too. The swamp just got a new ogre. He knows how to play people, he's been doing it for years. I'm a little ashamed to have been naive enough to believe in him near the end, but it's still better than a Hillary admin.

       I read about the missiles. I also read somewhere that Trump will wait til after he takes office to prosecute so Obama can't pardon her but I doubt it. Trump tricked everyone because he's psycho like the rest of them

       Playing people in business is seen by a lot of people as okay or a smart business move while playing people in politics creates an outcry. It's difficult to see it as the same scenario just set on a different stage.

       I think it's fair that anyone who aspires to and manages to achieve that level of high office is

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Usually a supporter of the current system as it enabled them to get this far.

         At least 'corrupt enough' to survive a world of cut throat, crony powered and favour driven politics (or business in this case).

       <li>
        <p>
         More attracted to power than helping the people.

       To expect anything different is, sadly, naive.

       Yea, it was a false hope. Its the usual again but they gave us drama. Backing out of us getting back our legal system shows that all of it for bs. So they get away with murder again and we get our closet and corrupt gov back. Back to reality. Cant believe i fell for it after all this years reasoning myself. Sorry i doubt you guys.

       But hey he is still promising to back out of the TPP so we got that goin for us. I'm actually beginning to think the TPP is manufactured simply to take it off the table and give the people a sense of "victory"

       I would imagine he knows (after some of the daily briefings he gets) that the FBI are still investigating her for at the very LEAST the Clinton Foundation.  He probably knows that she will be indicted and like any sane person, just wont waste his time.  I'm hoping this is the case.

       Guys, he's still playing 4D chess. Think about it. If he said he will prosecute H people would really be rioting in the streets. It would cause more unrest and the media would shit all over him for it. Also if he did push a Hillary prosecution Obama would most likely grant a pardon. He may still but if Trump says he won't prosecute then he won't. However Trump said nothing about his new DOJ team not doing it for him. He's laying low until inauguration. If Obama pardons H it's over. Trump didn't change his mind  he might be privy to information we don't know. We've trusted him his far don't abandon ship when seas get rocky or uncertain. Stand by our leader, stand by us all.

       That's what I am really hoping for. I know most of what he said was just political talking points to try to get enough support to win the presidency but there is just way too much information out there that points towards the current administration being treasonous beyond comprehension. 
If he doesn't convict her I wouldn't be surprised because people didn't vote McCain, Ryan and McConnell out so nothing will ever change until people realize they are the ones who have the power.

       That wasn't personal. I was all about Obama in 2008. It wasn't long before I saw that he wasn't the anti-war candidate many thought he would be. I quickly saw how for many,
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       wars were A-okay, because, hey, "at least Bush is gone."  It was a huge wake-up call. The irony of it all? I was adamant that Clinton could not become president.
