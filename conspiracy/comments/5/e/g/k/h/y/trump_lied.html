<li><p>Usually a supporter of the current system as it enabled them to get this far.</p></li>

<p>To expect anything different is, sadly, naive.</p>

<p>Edit: just to say I&#39;m not calling you guys out for believing it, I understand why he was so popular and why everyone wanted to believe in him for whatever personal reasons they had. </p>

<p>The world is fucked, it&#39;s getting scary and we want things to change but have lost the ability believe we can do it ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, he&#39;s still playing 4D chess. Think about it. If he said he will prosecute H people would really be rioting in the streets. It would cause more unrest and the media would shit all over him for it. Also if he did push a Hillary prosecution Obama would most likely grant a pardon. He may still but if Trump says he won&#39;t prosecute then he won&#39;t. However Trump said nothing about his new DOJ team not doing it for him. He&#39;s laying low until inauguration. If Obama pardons H it&#39;s over. Trump didn&#39;t change his mind  he might be privy to information we don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve trusted him his far don&#39;t abandon ship when seas get rocky or uncertain. Stand by our leader, stand by us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I am really hoping for. I know most of what he said was just political talking points to try to get enough support to win the presidency but there is just way too much information out there that points towards the current administration being treasonous beyond comprehension. 
If he doesn&#39;t convict her I wouldn&#39;t be surprised because people didn&#39;t vote McCain, Ryan and McConnell out so nothing will ever change until people realize they are the ones who have the power. </p>
