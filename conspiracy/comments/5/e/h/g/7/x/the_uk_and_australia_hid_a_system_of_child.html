       This is a true story for which the UK and Australia have officially apologized. If you don't think a government could ever try to hide a system of child trafficking, abuse, and exploitation, read up on the UK home children scandal. Watch the movie linked below.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to populate colonies with good British stock, the UK thought it a good idea to steal homeless children from the streets or illegitimate children and orphans from homes to send to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       These children were sometimes stolen from homes and told their living parents were dead. Meanwhile the children's parents were told their children had been adopted without their consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once in Australia or elsewhere, these children were exploited as free labor.

      </p>
      <p>
       This idea started as early as 1618. One program--the child migration scheme--started in 1869 and continued through
       <strong>
        1970
       </strong>
       . An estimated 150,000 children went through the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program wasn't exposed until 1987. The governments apologized in 2009.
