        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a true story for which the UK and Australia have officially apologized. If you don&#39;t think a government could ever try to hide a system of child trafficking, abuse, and exploitation, read up on the UK home children scandal. Watch the movie linked below.</p>

<p>In order to populate colonies with good British stock, the UK thought it a good idea to steal homeless children from the streets or illegitimate children and orphans from homes to send to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>

<p>These children were sometimes stolen from homes and told their living parents were dead. Meanwhile the children&#39;s parents were told their children had been adopted without their consent.</p>

<p>Once in Australia or elsewhere, these children were exploited as free labor. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/bindoon-boys-town-the-sad-truth-behind-britains-lost-children-1782544.html">Many were sexually abused</a>.</p>

<p>This idea started as early as 1618. One program--the child migration scheme--started in 1869 and continued through <strong>1970</strong>. An estimated 150,000 children went through the program.</p>

<p>The program wasn&#39;t exposed until 1987. The governments apologized in 2009.</p>

<p>Red pill your friends with the movie <strong>Oranges and Sunshine</strong>. It is currently streaming on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Sunshine-Emily-Watson/dp/B008ENNX18/">Amazon Prime</a>.</p>
