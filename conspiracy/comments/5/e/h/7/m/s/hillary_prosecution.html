<h1><strong>2012</strong> Hillary Clinton Supplied Weapons from Benghazi to Al-Qaeda in Syria</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if people here know what really is going on with Hillarie&#39;s investigation and i thought everyone knew about it but it seems a lot of people are still in the dark. So i will go ahead and refresh everyones memory with a short description.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure if you know what really is going on but the real issue are not the emails and having a private server with confidential documents <em>(which is also serious)</em>. The real issue is what the emails uncovered about Benghazi. Hillary and the Obama administration supplied weapons from Benghazi to Al-Qaeda in Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG’s, and 125 mm and 155mm <strong>howitzers missiles</strong>  <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pgs.-1-3-2-3-from-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version1.pdf">pdf</a>. Then those missiles were used against US soldiers. Upon investigating the situation the congress found the serial numbers of the missiles and they tracked them coming from a CIA banker in Qatar. Then Hillary and Obama tried to retrieve the evidence and the other missiles but the terrorists blackmailed them. So they paid the blackmail and send ambassador Steven to retrieve the missiles, then i am not sure what went down <em>(assume the terrorists were greedy)</em> but Stevens got killed.  </p>

<p>The rest you know... Hillary blamed a video and Obama used his power to cover up the rest. Congress knows what happened, and they fought hard to get the evidence <em>(or whatever Comey did not destroy so far)</em> but they came short when it came for the other gov branches to do their job and take them to court.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Hillary also got paid to help some businesses receive contracts and benefits in Libya. This was discovered in the emails by that reporter <em>(forgot name)</em> that exchanged a lot of emails with Hillary.  </p>

<p>The media knew about this stuff, which makes sense why they went all in on this election. There&#39;s a video that Gowdy Trey basically shit on the media and letting it assume that its their fault for having the job to reveal this to the people but failed to do so.
<a href="https://youtu.be/5i4tuuy1jsw">Trey Gowdy On Media</a></p>

<p>Also they paid the blackmail with taxpayer money <em>( i think its the first blackmail ever payed by the USA, the one that supposedly was paid on exchange for US citizens captured by the terrorists which i think we never got)</em> <strong>- this is my personal opinion.</strong>   <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/world/middleeast/iran-us-cash-payment-prisoners.html?_r=0">U.S. Concedes $400 Million Payment to Iran Was Delayed as Prisoner ‘Leverage’</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> i forgot to mention what was the piece that put everything together and let to this truth. It turns out that a stupid monkey terrorist did not know how to use the missile (i think he insert it backwards - don&#39;t remember) and he left the half blown pieces on the ground and thankfully the serial number was not destroyed.   </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#attachments">Clinton - “the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth&quot;</a><br/>
October 2013 WS speech in which Clinton acknowledged that “the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years.”  </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774">Clinton - Trying To Vet, Identify, Train And Arm Cadres Of Rebels</a><br/>
In that same speech, Clinton noted that she wanted to pursue “a more robust, covert action trying to vet, identify, train and arm cadres of rebels” in Syria, that would have fought both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and “the Al-Qaeda-related jihadist groups that have, unfortunately, been attracted to Syria.”  </p>

<p><a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/20140211-%20HASC%20O%26I%20Interim%20Report%20%28Actions%20-%20Benghazi%29.pdf">Benghazi - Security Support Team reduction</a><br/>
State Department officials in Libya apparently understood the dangers. As noted in the Interim Progress Report, on several occasions in 2012 Ambassador Stevens and others at the U.S. embassy stressed within the Department of State the inadequacy of security in Libya and outlined the need for additional personnel.39 In fact, however, in the weeks before the attack there was a decrease in the modest U.S. military presence there. For many months, there was a sixteen-person Special Forces unit, known as the Security Support Team or the Site Security Team (SST), at the embassy in Tripoli. This unit was involved with protecting the U.S. compound. In August 2012, however, DOD briefed that at the request of the Department of 40 State, this unit was reduced to four personnel and their focus changed to training Libyan forces. General Ham told the committee that this reduction and transition was done despite his offer to retain the larger number.  </p>

<p><a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/20140211-%20HASC%20O%26I%20Interim%20Report%20%28Actions%20-%20Benghazi%29.pdf">Benghazi - President was informed of the <strong>&quot;Terrorist Attack&quot;</strong></a><br/>
Defense Department officials believed nearly from the outset of violence in Benghazi that it was a terrorist attack rather than a protest gone awry, and the President subsequently permitted the military to respond with minimal direction.  </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12406">Clinton/Podesta - U.S. saw the rise of the genocidal Islamic State as an opportunity</a><br/>
Responding to the strategy outlined in the notes, Podesta said, “I think we are headed down this path in Iraq.” But “Syria elements are vexing,” he added.  </p>

<p>“Agree but there may be opportunities as the Iraqi piece improves,” Clinton wrote back.</p>

<p>The message also reveals that the U.S. saw the rise of the genocidal Islamic State as an opportunity. “With all of its tragic aspects, the advance of ISIL through Iraq gives the U.S. Government an opportunity to change the way it deals with the chaotic security situation in North Africa and the Middle East,” the document says, adding, “The most important factor in this matter is to make use of intelligence resources and Special Operations troops in an aggressive manner.”  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.aim.org/benghazi/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CCB-Interim-Report-4-22-2014.pdf">Report by the Citizens’ Commission On Benghazi</a>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The war in Libya was unnecessary, served no articulable U.S. national security objective, and led to preventable chaos region-wide.  </p></li>
<li><p>Muammar Qaddafi was an ally of the United States in the Global War on Terror.  </p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. facilitated the delivery of weapons and military support to al Qa’eda- linked rebels in Libya.  </p></li>
<li><p>The Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi (CCB) has discovered, that the ensuing civil war may well have been avoided, had the U.S. chosen to permit it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Qaddafi expressed interest in a truce, and possible abdication and exile out of Libya. He even pulled his forces back from several Libyan cities as a sign of good faith.  </p></li>
<li><p>No positive affirmation of consent from Washington, D.C. to pursue Qaddafi’s offer. The war continued and ultimately cost tens of thousands of lives. The U.S. failure to even consider Qaddafi’s request for talks, and its determination to enter and pursue this war in support of al-Qa’eda-linked rebels, presents the appearance of a policy intent upon empowering Islamic forces with no measurable benefit to U.S. national security.  </p></li>
<li><p>The White House campaign appears to have been well-coordinated with U.S. Muslim Brotherhood organizations as well as Islamic state members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who all joined in condemnation of the video, and, even more troubling, issued calls for restrictions on Americans’ free speech rights.  </p></li>
<li><p>On the day of the attacks in Benghazi, whether or not there was an official order to stand down, the result was the same. There were military assets, for example, at the U.S. base in Sigonella, in Sicily, Italy that could have been brought to bear, and perhaps could have saved the lives of the two men killed at the CIA Annex, the scene of the second attack that night. The failure to attempt to rescue these Americans amounts to a dereliction of duty.  </p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. was fully aware of and facilitating the delivery of weapons to the al-Qa’eda-dominated rebel militias throughout the 2011 rebellion. The jihadist agenda of AQIM, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), and other Islamic terror groups represented among the rebel forces was well known to U.S. officials responsible for Libya policy.  </p></li>
<li><p>The White House and senior Congressional members deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler who had been working closely with the West actively to suppress al-Qa’eda. The result in Libya, across much of North Africa, and beyond has been utter chaos, disruption of Libya’s oil industry, the spread of dangerous weapons (including surface-to-air missiles), and the empowerment of jihadist organizations like al-Qa’eda and the Muslim Brotherhood.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>After Qaddafi’s regime had been ousted, a delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) traveled to Libya to collect payment for the weapons the UAE had financed and Qatar had delivered to the Transitional National Council (TNC) during the war. The UAE delegation was seeking $1 billion it claimed was owed. During their visit to Tripoli, the UAE officials discovered that half of the $1 billion worth of weapons it had financed for the rebels had, in fact, been diverted by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the Muslim Brotherhood head of the Libyan TNC, and sold to Qaddafi.  </p>

<li><p>June 10-August 8, 2011—Time period where Secretary Clinton was heavily involved in Libya policy  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daniel Nasaw</strong> - The former secretary of state has maintained that the real-time operational details of diplomatic security were handled below her level. But information on the logistics around a 2011 visit to Benghazi were forwarded to Mrs. Clinton, according to emails released Friday.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Schwerin</strong> to <strong>Pedestal</strong> - The documents released by the New York Times also show that Clinton received numerous briefing memos about Libya from Blumenthal, a longtime friend of the Clintons who was not employed by the State Department.

<p><del>#UPDATE (This is an Old Killing - The new one is actually the one above but we mixed it with the helicopter story)</del></p>

<p><del><strong>2011</strong> US Weapons Shipments from Libya to Syria</del>  </p>

<p><del>The new killing is actually with <strong>howitzers missiles</strong>, no <strong>Stingers</strong>.</del>  </p>

<p>~~&gt;Big thanks to <strong><em>secretlyacutekitten</em></strong> that stepped in to correct my story. The OP seems more knowledgeable on the subject so i want to update the post so people can get of what it seems the accurate story. I won&#39;t touch the older version as that is what i remember and i don&#39;t want to go research again to see what detail is right or wrong. Overall the basic story is the same but with a different flow. Again, Thanks ~~<strong><em>secretlyacutekitten</em></strong>.  </p>

<p>I went back to clarify the story. I believe in this case it was Benghazi that revealed the private server. The US citizens killed from this weapon sale is not the one in the Apache story. But after digging to clarify this there are evidence that our gov did not only illegally sold weapons in 2 occasions, they&#39;ve been doing this for many years. I found many similar stories. So it goes like this. We send our soldiers and money to fight terrorists, and this terrorists buy their majority weapons from the US (many techniques used to supply them this weapons, directly and indirectly). In fact it seems that we dominate the market in supplying weapons to terrorist because we  issue punishments and restrictions to other countries that try to do this, arguing that they promote terrorism. It goes really deep. But i am not surprised at all. At the end we have massive consumption of weapons and trillions made by the war industry and the parties involved in the sales.</p>

<p><del>Not 100% accurate but close.</del>  </p>

<p><del>Missiles were stingers, came from State not CIA, CIA was against giving anti-Air to Al-Qaeda due to threat to commercial aviation. State did it anyway, used Marc Turi to funnel weapons via Qatar to Al-Qaeda for use in Libya.</del>  </p>

<p><del>Stingers were then used in Afghanistan against US helicopter, war head failed to detonate, US troops found serial number from missile, traced back to missiles sold by State to Qatar.</del>  </p>

<p><del>Stevens sent to buy Stingers back at a hugely inflated price to cover this up, doubled crossed by Al-Qaeda and killed.</del>  </p>

<p><del>Yes congress knows all about this, CIA made sure of it.</del> (??)  </p>

<p>IIRC, the Podesta emails also show that a large campaign donor was the head of the Libya&#39;s post-war asset allocation team (or something like that). Basically, the same institution that reaped the spoils of Gadaffi&#39;s overthrow also paid Clinton for her presidential campaign.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another thread I posted about Libya&#39;s presidential candidates (in this case, Dr. Bashir Musa) expecting to buy their way into the position via campaign contributions to Clinton. This is made all the more obvious by him hiring expensive DC lobbyists for the explicit purpose to assist with his own election campaign.  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/57vnwd/clinton_campaign_expects_libyan_presidential/">reddit!</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Worth noting that in the state of war, the leader is picked by a &quot;UN-backed presidential council&quot; which is really a fancy way of being picked by those amenable to Western interests. Just like it was for Haiti, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re re-routing all &quot;campaign contributions from Libya&quot; through the US company, Washington African Consulting Group. This is the agency responsible for overseeing the Libya Asset Recovery Committee.  </p>

<p>So, putting two and two together, she&#39;s siphoning off money from this fund and using a US company to do it.  </p>

<p>And of course, no mainstream media news articles covered either of these Libya-related emails. It was one of many discoveries that made me see the media is a propaganda mouthpiece for the establishment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not 100% accurate but close.</p>

<p>Missiles were stingers, came from State not CIA, CIA was against giving anti-Air to Al-Qaeda due to threat to commercial aviation. State did it anyway, used Marc Turi to funnel weapons via Qatar to Al-Qaeda for use in Libya.</p>

<p>Stingers were then used in Iraq against US helicopter, war head failed to detonate, US troops found serial number from missile, traced back to missiles sold by State to Qatar. </p>

<p>Stevens sent to buy Stingers back at a hugely inflated price to cover this up, doubled crossed by Al-Qaeda and killed. </p>

<p>Yes congress knows all about this, CIA made sure of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small correct from what I wrote, it&#39;s been years since I looked at this stuff, the US Helicopter was in Afghanistan and not Iraq. </p>

<p>Just remember the email server was discovered from the Benghazi investigation. I think you know this? Many knew about the real reason Ambassador Chris Stevens was Benghazi before the investigation, it was this investigation that caused the email server to come to light. </p>

<p>I would suggest people look into the Marc Turi case, Obama and Clinton had him pinned as their patsy, he threatened to blow the lid off the whole thing so they dropped the case. </p>

<p>There is so much more to Syria and Libya, it&#39;s truly disgusting, Clinton is such a nasty piece of work and her hubris is off the scale so she fucks everything up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are correct about the server. Now that you mentioned the stingers i think my memory kinda came back about the story. And you are also correct about Marc Turi threatening to blow everything up! Glad you came by the post, i would have felt bad not correcting the post :) But i also remember that when i was putting the pieces together to make sense out of this it was even before the whole congress war, this was being developed in 4chan where people were trying to put stuff together. Then came the email server and congress put us out of business :p</p>

<p>If you want to get ahead of the next Clinton scandal, look in to Eric Braverman and the Foundation, not much out there yet but Braverman is missing, some say he tried to get to Russia but I think more likely is he is cooperating with the FBI. </p>

<p>I hope Clinton is brought to justice, don&#39;t care which of her scandals it is, she&#39;s a criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with you. She is a murdered, war criminal, manipulator and a 1000 more things. I was surprised people didn&#39;t know this story, but then i remember that we have a bigger diversity now than just fellow conspiracy theorists, so i decided to put out a summary, and i&#39;m glad i did. Also, i followed this subject going through congress, i spent hours watching them fight. Gowdy gained my respect, he never gave up, he truly wants to bring justice to the victims and our country. At first the democrats were literally telling congressmen that the evidence and info on the case were confidential and they were refusing to give them up, and literally congress was telling them but this is our job, we can see anything we want, our job is to oversight you people. Lol, we are living in a country ruled by 10 year olds :) The Obama administration stepped to a whole new level, they were literally doing whatever the fuck they want, ignoring all other branches and our constitution. There&#39;s a nice video with Trey again when Obama was doing whatever he wanted and letting criminals get out of prison by telling his administration to ignore US laws, Trey was literally telling them that ones they start doing that the system will change forever and warned them than one day the president might not be a democrat. Well, he was right. Overall Obama was a discraise to our country and our laws. He changed us forever with his lawless actions.</p>

If people were smart they&#39;d also be putting more attention on Braverman because it has to do with issues highlighted by the leaks and gives them more credibility if this guy has really vanished. He was the CEO of the CF when all this was going on if he&#39;s missing it would seem pretty damn relevant wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<p>Question: What&#39;s your take on the Congressional investigation by Gowdy into Benghazi? He mentioned several times &quot;Why don&#39;t people start asking <em>why</em> Stevens was in Libya?&quot;. </p>

<p>Was he trying to hint to everyone that there was more to the story that he couldn&#39;t publicly reveal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Democrats and the other branches have been pushing back for a long time now. Only recently congress managed to get some of the crucial interviews of the investigation. They literally has to serve them in order to provide some of the evidence. Then it was shown that the FBI did not even interview the most important witnesses, and when congress got closer Comey destroyed 2 evidence laptops. Also, what makes it more complicated is that DOJ said that they accept the FBI decision and refused to reopen the case. As also the DOJ gave out of jail card to crucial witnesses which now refuse to testify by calling the 5th amendment. And you can watch when congress called witnesses and they literally answer no question, all they do is say &quot;i take the 5th not to incriminate myself&quot; over and over and over, its crazy to watch it. So it gets very complicated when no one works with them and the Obama administration is fully against them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress is involved in so much dirty dealing, the government is far more corrupt than people know. It makes me so sad actually, the gulf between what people think happens and how the things really happen is just so hard for people to grasp. </p>

<p>How much do you know about <a href="http://www.nswbc.org/Press%20Releases/PressRelease-March5-07.htm">this?</a> </p>

<p>Only came out because of whistle blowers, these are few and far between. If almost all of them are corrupt and the system is full of corruption it becomes the norm. </p>

<p>In many poorer countries so many of the cops take bribes, take Brazil for example, they do not see it as corruption, they see it as normal and how the system works. That&#39;s how our government is, no one wants to think that, it&#39;s quite upsetting but it is close to the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey!! I went back to clarify the story. I believe in this case it was Benghazi that revealed the private server. The US citizens killed from this weapon sale is not the one in the Apache story. But after digging to clarify this there are evidence that our gov did not only illegally sold weapons in 2 occasions, they&#39;ve been doing this for many years. I found many similar stories. So it goes like this. We send our soldiers and money to fight terrorists, and this terrorists buy their majority weapons from the US (many techniques used to supply them this weapons, directly and indirectly). In fact it seems that we dominate the market in supplying weapons to terrorist because we  issue punishments and restrictions to other countries that try to do this, arguing that they promote terrorism. It goes really deep. But i am not surprised at all. At the end we have massive consumption of weapons and trillions made by the war industry and the parties involved in the sales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there are lots of times where our government has supplied weapons, some public like Iran Contra others no so public. Yes they have been doing this for years and overthrowing countries for years.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how many years you know this has been going on? Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3_EXqJ8f-0">reenactment of a speech</a> by General Smedley Butler. A highly decorated marine that later in life came out against the war racket. It&#39;s less than 9 minutes long and worth really listening to. The speech was made in the 1930s. </p>

<p>Did you also know we were behind the coup attempt in Turkey? Erogan refused to be our troops on the ground in Syria. How much do you know about Syria and why we are there? </p>

<p>Ultimately no matter what the details are, you will discover the America is not the world&#39;s police as we claim, but the worlds mafia and uses extortion and violence as tools of the trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info. I dont have a long history in researching the behind the scenes government. I started following the signs and doing my own research for about 7-8 years now, so i&#39;m relative new  and also missing a lot of old info. I&#39;ve been researching only the new wars and events mostly. </p>

<p>Gadafi i know that one of the mail reasons was his agreement to start trading for oil with gold with Africa. Also i&#39;m convinced that we our action to take over governments and install puppets is mainly so we can control them and push elite agenda, as also to profit from the weapon sales and wars.</p>

<p>For syria and mostly muslim regions i believe is that we act for South Arabias interest and also again profiting from war. </p>

<p>I just have to admit that while i do have a lot of input from various sources and a lot of knowledge on some subjects i&#39;m still not organized and i haven&#39;t managed to put all the pieces together to get the true big picture. There are many misleading info and it makes it hard to filter only the true info, thus making it difficult for individuals like me to connect all the pieces. But as you said we live in a fake reality, what is going behind the doors is way bigger and different. I just wish we could at least have some true info sources to get some guidance, so far is individuals like me and you sharing info and thoughts, ultimately is comes down to how far your willing to get and how much time you want to spend for the truth.</p>

<p>This is the blackmail story i think was a coverup for the missiles. I am not 100% sure its this story but i know our gov payed a blackmail and we did not get the hostages. This article was the only one i could find on the web with a quick search. At one point that story was everywhere but now &quot;somehow&quot; you cant find an article about it. But also remember when Trump mentioned the story and said the gov is stupid, we give them money and they dont even give us the hostages? Feel free to go for it and prove if my conspiracy is true and they did pay the blackmail with tax money in plain sight. </p>

You thought that this vicious war was happening just because of the classified emails? Personally for me i didnt really got bothered for the C emails.

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate this being spelled out so coherently. Thank you.</p>

<p>IIRC, the Podesta emails also show that a large campaign donor was the head of the Libya&#39;s post-war asset allocation team (or something like that). Basically, the same institution that reaped the spoils of Gadaffi&#39;s overthrow also paid Clinton for her presidential campaign. It&#39;s buried in my post history but I can try digging it up if someone cares.</p>

<p>Not a surprise, but still awful. </p>

This is the agency responsible for overseeing the Libya Asset Recovery Committee.</p>

<p>So, putting two and two together, she&#39;s siphoning off money from this fund and using a US company to do it.</p>

<p>And of course, no mainstream media news articles covered either of these Libya-related emails. It was one of many discoveries that made me see the media is a propaganda mouthpiece for the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the 9/11 and Saudis involvement is also known by congress people. When the 9/11 happened do you remember the supposedly valid report the government did? Well, in that report 27 pages were classified, in those page is said to be the involvement of the Saudis in bringing down the towers. There are youtube videos of congress people who read those pages. Congressmen are allowed to go and privately read them but they can&#39;t say or take notes of what is inside. There&#39;s one congressman though that i watched his video that kinda lets to assume that is not what they told us and we dont know who our friends and enemies are. Saudies are considered our friends now. He then went on to say that we the Americans will be embarrassed when those pages get released. The reason we can&#39;t see them is because Bush made them confidential and then Obama came in and kept them confidential, he refused multiple requests by congress to make them public. As for Hillary getting paid by the Saudies that is a fact. Wikileaks released documents proving that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for joining in! Yes i am 100% sure on that, Stevens was sent to clean up and ultimately paid it with his life. Something that i was thinking (conspiracy) is that Stevens might actually have retrieved the weapons and then Hillary/Obama turned on him to silence him. I did not dig more into this as congress will &quot;hopefully&quot; expose everything. But the least we know is that they refused to send him backup and basically left him there to die. Again, congress know, they put a fight to expose this but the current administration silenced them. What will happen i don&#39;t know, but i know that they know.</p>

<p>I believe if one looks over all the evidence the connections are pretty clear. When I was reading the emails I didn&#39;t know what some of the sentences meant they made zero sense. Like having the pasta from xmas (it&#39;s March) or &quot;have pizza for an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>This is clearly explained by the DW anons who hunt and expose pedos. If you know how to safely go into the dark web do it yourself.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wanting something that doesn&#39;t exist...a way to prove to you 100% that pizzagate is real..and it seems like nothing less than a video of Hill licking a 5 year old is going to do it for you. strong circumstantial evidence without a body will get you put away for murder....yet even with ALL the circumstantial evidence you still want proof..jaysus fuckin h christ just the comments alone on the hole they were digging under CPizza is enough to make anyone...it wasn&#39;t fun banter like &quot;be careful or you&#39;ll find the bodies&quot; or &quot;who you gonna bury&quot;....no..those comments were flat out..&quot;can we put a popup in there? WFT? The photo of James covered in...a red substance crawling naked? on the floor of the place with red stuff dripping out his mouth and covering his face...I like to think I&#39;m a pretty wild and crazy person...but for the life of me I cannot come up with any reason except 100% creep...to take a photo like that. I&#39;m no stranger to the avant guard art scene...I regularly make fun of the contemporary arts when visiting such museums....and I&#39;ll tell you this for free...Robert Maplethorpe is angelic and pure compared to the art I&#39;ve seen the Podestas like. WHO thinks a reproduction of one of Jeffery Dahmer&#39;s dead victims sans heads is something worthy of art? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t any real evidence.  Its all unproven.  I&#39;ve looked through as much of this as I can and the only credible reports I can find are ones that confirm that the US didn’t disapprove or try to stop arms shipments from Russian or French suppliers from Qatar to rebels in Benghazi,  but the US government did not allow American weapons to be shipped.  Also the CIA, not the State Department was overseeing arming the Libyan Rebels. There are also credible reports that part of Ambo Stevens mission in Benghazi was to recover anti aircraft weapons. But claims that Clinton secretly sent Stevens to Benghazi to recover those weapons, or that those weapons were used to shoot down a US helicopter are all based on unconfirmed unnamed speculation,  usually found on infowars type websites.  So yeah,  as usual,  there is nothing here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be honest this is kinda old news for me. When i got into this it was months ago and in 4chan, not sure if that blog still exist, besides, when the email server scandal came out and congress took over i gave up on digging and i was just watching congress trying to bring it to light. I added some quick references because some other OPs were skeptical too, but i might have picked up a fake one too within all those links. I would suggest to start by watching the congress hearings, they start with the emails but then get deeper and things get more complicated. I believe very recently 3 congressmen released their reports, one of them is Trey and his report is the facts only, i am assuming it will be available in .gov website somewhere, please share it here if you find it.

<p>Edit: So wait a minute... Are you telling me that all this time you thought that congress was turning earth upside down because of the private server? You thought that this vicious war was happening just because of the classified emails? Personally for me i didnt really got bothered for the C emails. And one more time, i thought we all fought a huge war to elect Trump so he can bring them to justice and it seems that i was again living in my little bubble 😰😲🤔😜</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This stuff is fun and it&#39;s also kind of weird that not many people really know how government actually works.</p>

<p>If you want to get ahead of the next Clinton scandal, look in to Eric Braverman and the Foundation, not much out there yet but Braverman is missing, some say he tried to get to Russia but I think more likely is he is cooperating with the FBI. </p>

<p>I hope Clinton is brought to justice, don&#39;t care which of her scandals it is, she&#39;s a criminal. </p>
