       We all know the CIA popularized 'Conspiracy Theory' during the JFK era as a means to dismiss counterviews without rational thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       This word has been used up until a few weeks ago to cause immediate negative connotations and auto-rejection of alternative news sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, perhaps because of the vast amount of 'conspiracy theory' that has become fact, they are shifting the language to 'Fake News'.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are hijacking our words, before our own accusations of 'Fake News' - the MSM, could become household.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're scared, they're panicking, and they will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be able to stop this train.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too late for them. They are not as tech savvy as we. They do not have the same manpower as we. They can hire thousands for CTR, we can mobilize millions - we are global, we are a force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch for more internet censorship bills for 'fake news'.

       They use a different term because they know they will probably not be able to suppress the truth about pizzagate. If they used the term "conspiracy theory" people would immediately realize that everything that was labeled "conspiracy theory" was actually legitimate, just like pizzagate.
Just a theory.

       Pretty much the election. Clinton called everything against her conspiracy theories, but they mostly turned out to true so conspiracy turned around to they possibility of truth. Now it's fake news bc if the conspiracy people get together and publish it'll be sourced and they can't discredit so they'll get it banned.

       I would say it's more of a "how can we do anything" attitude with some head buried in the sand as well. Most Americans are so caught up in the daily survival routines that there's very little they can do to effect real change.

       You just need to convince people that they shouldn't waste all of their free time on video games, television, etc. If everybody devoted even 5 percent of their free time to reading and spreading truth, we would have a much more informed culture.

       I don't think people realize the degree to which they are being lied to.  They think there is a pro government slant, or a liberal bias.  I don't think most of them realize they are being led to slaughter after slaughter in order to feed the perverse appetites of the ruling class.  You phrase it that way and you just get a "come on"

       Also I think too many times in the past decade conspiracy theories have been proven real.   In conversation when somebody drops the conspiracy word you can literally list out all the conspiracies that became headline news.

       No one should be surprised that "Fake News" is a thing that corporate media is pushing now. Just accuse the opposition of doing what you're actually doing. That's always been in the playbook on every issue.

       You're right, and it's a pretty brilliant tactic. They're going to corner the phrase "fake news" before we managed to. Simply because their audience is more built in and they can propagate it faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't change much though. It's the same old negative connotations. We may have experienced a better light for a brief period, but we should expect the pendulum swing. After all, conspiracy theorists do waste a lot of time on things that don't pan out, making us easy targets for discrediting. It's just part of the territory.

       The actual fake news that ran rampant on social media during the election deserves its label. The problem is that MSM realized that gave people a reference point, and by lumping conspiracy theories under the umbrella term "fake news" is far more effective. Easy to say that independent researchers that nobody knows subconsciously by name aren't credible if nobody gives them a chance in the first place.

       No, you can have a conspiracy theory that's got evidence, theories, etc. The fake news sites usually just present fabrications. Like "this was in the wikileaks!" But it really wasn't.

       I don't think they are being used interchangeably. The fake news sites were real and were just generating massive revenues for people who learned how to game people with click bait titles to completely made up stories.

       Conspiracy theories are quite different.

       It's not so much it turned to fake news as it was being tied to everything Hillary was being accused of and it was gaining truth to it when the whole idea was to make it sound outlandish and false.

       When I hear "fake news"  I first think of the corporate sold out media,  as exposed by wikileaks,  Mark Crispin Miller, Sharyl Attkisson  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we haven't found the perfect alternative channel,   but there are better alternative channels than the corporate media channels.    People should inform themselves by issue anyway,  not by channel.

       I would say it's more of a "how can we do anything" attitude with some head buried in the sand as well. Most Americans are so caught up in the daily survival routines that there's very little they can do to effect real change.
