<p>This word has been used up until a few weeks ago to cause immediate negative connotations and auto-rejection of alternative news sources.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps because of the vast amount of &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; that has become fact, they are shifting the language to &#39;Fake News&#39;.</p>

<p>They are hijacking our words, before our own accusations of &#39;Fake News&#39; - the MSM, could become household.</p>

<p>They&#39;re scared, they&#39;re panicking, and they will <em>not</em> be able to stop this train.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too late for them. They are not as tech savvy as we. They do not have the same manpower as we. They can hire thousands for CTR, we can mobilize millions - we are global, we are a force.</p>

<p>Watch for more internet censorship bills for &#39;fake news&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much the election. Clinton called everything against her conspiracy theories, but they mostly turned out to true so conspiracy turned around to they possibility of truth. Now it&#39;s fake news bc if the conspiracy people get together and publish it&#39;ll be sourced and they can&#39;t discredit so they&#39;ll get it banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, and it&#39;s a pretty brilliant tactic. They&#39;re going to corner the phrase &quot;fake news&quot; before we managed to. Simply because their audience is more built in and they can propagate it faster.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t change much though. It&#39;s the same old negative connotations. We may have experienced a better light for a brief period, but we should expect the pendulum swing. After all, conspiracy theorists do waste a lot of time on things that don&#39;t pan out, making us easy targets for discrediting. It&#39;s just part of the territory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual fake news that ran rampant on social media during the election deserves its label. The problem is that MSM realized that gave people a reference point, and by lumping conspiracy theories under the umbrella term &quot;fake news&quot; is far more effective. Easy to say that independent researchers that nobody knows subconsciously by name aren&#39;t credible if nobody gives them a chance in the first place.</p>
