       I'm talking about the condition of being accused of multiple crimes.  A condition exclusive of "normalcy".  Alefantis is not a normal person.  You can research Frank Winstead if you want.

       Where's the evidence that supports the claim that they're guilty?
      </p>
      <p>
       If pizzagate is true, research should be done and hopefully justice will be brought down upon those responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as of this moment, there is not one shred of evidence that implicates anyone to a single incident other than a sketch. That's it, and even then we don't know if the sketch is valid and the whole story there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, people are witch hunting based off of conjecture. Is it convincing conjecture? Sure. But that does not mean its truth.

       This is true if someone makes that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same could be said for all of the "This guy is a pedophile!" and linking his businesses, phone numbers, etc. You make the claim, the burden of proof is on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is 0 proof at this moment of any of these guys having done anything illegal in terms of pedophilia. Only conjecture, no proof. If you're going to use the burden of proof claim, use it on both sides, not just the people not witch hunting and trying to provide some explanation as to why pizzagate was banned.

       So they weren't using clear pedophilic symbology in their logos or posting occult references through social media. You are a fool, who obviously would rather damn this information than consider it. Shame on you and shame on the people like you. Shame.

       Silly, out of context emails. OK, if they are not talking about pedophilia, then what does it mean? You are not debunking our interpretation of their out of context emails, etc if you are not offering a better one. Calling them silly is not it.

       I think you need to research the place yourself a bit more before you tell others to leave them alone. Once I saw the photo of the kid tied up, it became clear these are not good people. And no I don't think the pizza place is the 'center' of it happening.

       You are part of the problem. It's not just the oblivious world you live in, it's that you use your ignore as an excuse to ignore very intense and almost seemingly obvious evidence. I am still at the point of just serious suspicion; however, if you can not only deny, but then proceed to defend the heaps of speculation with no concerns- you are literally the willfully blind. I am confused as to why you are involved in this subtotal begin with. With that small mind, and blatant disregard, I assume you are a shill?

       I don't think it's far to ask that question. It leads to both being wrong. It would be better to word it as " is it better to let an innocent man be punished, or let a guilty man free?"  The difference here is that the quote implies that we don't know the person is guilty. It would be better to let them get away, than to punish someone who didn't do it.

       it would NOT be better to get away. If Alefantis wanted to prove his innocence he would have invited authorities to come and live stream his basement/backroom, or something to similar effect. Think about it. If you were accused of this stuff, the first thing you would do is emphatically prove that you are innocent, by any means necessary. INSTEAD he has altered his website, changed his restaurants logo, and flooded his social media with overwhelmingly positive reviews. He has demanded that authorities to take down OUR website, and threatened investigators for "stealing" he and his friends pictures. This is very suspicious behavior for an "innocent" man.

       He would only do that if he was being investigated by actual authorities. A business owner would be foolish to respond to every crazy person on the internet.

       There is zero evidence. You know it, I know it. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. If there was then people would be arrested and search warrants would be issued. This is how the world works. The whole thing is a made up fairy tale to help get rid of us and free speech. It worked very well, and people still don't understand they are tools of their own repression. Way to go.

       Unfortunately, that's not how the world works. Historically speaking, these types of rings have consistently been covered up by government and law enforcement agencies around the world. I'm surprised you're posting in r/consipiracy and yet have so much faith in "how the world works"

       A massive bust was just made in both Canada and Norway because there was actual evidence. If you had evidence things would happen. Anyone who looked into this knows you don't have evidence. Easy to say "oh they are covering this up" when you have nothing to cover up. Literally nothing at all. Artwork, instagram photos, food emails and a stand-up routine taken out of context. Great work guys! The PTB are quaking in their boots!

       Probably you're right, but I wouldn't involve my employees in this, simply out of fear they would say something to officials or leak it. Luckily the news got out anyways.

       But what I'm basically trying to say was, we should focus on the leaders

       Do you expect the owners/guests to clean up the mess and get rid of the bodies when necessary?

       But then maybe there's a nice cleaner service in DC for such spill overs on speed dial. Wouldn't surprise me either for that cesspool.
