<p>If pizzagate is true, research should be done and hopefully justice will be brought down upon those responsible. </p>

<p>But as of this moment, there is not one shred of evidence that implicates anyone to a single incident other than a sketch. That&#39;s it, and even then we don&#39;t know if the sketch is valid and the whole story there.</p>

<p>Right now, people are witch hunting based off of conjecture. Is it convincing conjecture? Sure. But that does not mean its truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s far to ask that question. It leads to both being wrong. It would be better to word it as &quot; is it better to let an innocent man be punished, or let a guilty man free?&quot;  The difference here is that the quote implies that we don&#39;t know the person is guilty. It would be better to let them get away, than to punish someone who didn&#39;t do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it would NOT be better to get away. If Alefantis wanted to prove his innocence he would have invited authorities to come and live stream his basement/backroom, or something to similar effect. Think about it. If you were accused of this stuff, the first thing you would do is emphatically prove that you are innocent, by any means necessary. INSTEAD he has altered his website, changed his restaurants logo, and flooded his social media with overwhelmingly positive reviews. He has demanded that authorities to take down OUR website, and threatened investigators for &quot;stealing&quot; he and his friends pictures. This is very suspicious behavior for an &quot;innocent&quot; man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A massive bust was just made in both Canada and Norway because there was actual evidence. If you had evidence things would happen. Anyone who looked into this knows you don&#39;t have evidence. Easy to say &quot;oh they are covering this up&quot; when you have nothing to cover up. Literally nothing at all. Artwork, instagram photos, food emails and a stand-up routine taken out of context. Great work guys! The PTB are quaking in their boots!</p>
