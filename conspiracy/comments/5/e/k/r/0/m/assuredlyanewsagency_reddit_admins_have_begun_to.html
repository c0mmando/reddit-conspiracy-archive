        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">231</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>AssuredlyANewsAgency can report breaking news this evening, as,  for the first time in the site&#39;s history, the owners of reddit.com have utilized their server side control of messages displayed on the website to alter user comments.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more shocking, the majority of the server-side manipulated comments seemed to be critical of reddit ceo Steve Huffman (who goes by the moniker &#39;spez&#39; on the popular news aggregate); evidence presented to staffers at this agency indicates that one of the original comments had stated, quite bluntly, <a href="http://archive.is/TErOc">&quot;Fuck /u/spez&quot;</a>. However, that comment by user <a href="/u/w0rdd">/u/w0rdd</a> now reads &quot;<a href="http://archive.is/73EOh">Fuck /u/ &quot;moderator of the donald&quot;</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>This unprecedented manipulation of user comments brings into question the legitimacy of every text submission and comment that exists on reddit, as the use of such server side editing to veil criticism of one of their own employees seems to stand in stark contrast to reddit&#39;s proclaimed designation (by Chairman of the Board, Alexis Ohanian no less) as the &quot;Last bastion of free speech on the internet&quot;. It also seems to stand contrary to the long held policy that reddit users are given exclusive authority over the content of their submissions to the platform.</p>

<p>As more and more of reddit&#39;s core ideological platforms begin to fall by the way side, and the functional integrity of the platform continues to be brought into question, many are wondering just how long reddit can survive this continued barrage of admin-instigated catastrophes. While the company has weathered more than its fair share of storms over the years, there is little room left for mistakes in the highly competitive arena of social news amalgamation. With previous reddit employees seemingly popping up out of the wood-work to open their own competitors (with imzy being but one example), reddit seemingly sits perched precariously beneath a broad sward held by only a thin thread.</p>

<p>This story has ramifications far beyond the initial use of this tactic by the admins to silent dissent, and staffers of AANA will follow updates closely.</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 7:26 PM EST]</strong>; It has been revealed that the edited comments were linked to by a <a href="http://archive.is/4J0Ae">Washington Post article</a> that came out <em>at the same precise moment that the comments were edited by the reddit admins on the server side</em>; this itself has terrifying implications, as <strong>it means the reddit admins manipulated user comments, contacted a press outlet, and intentionally lead that outlet to believe those manipulated comments were in fact genuine user contributions</strong></p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 7:27PM EST]</strong> A comment from reddit ceo <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KVneU4v.png">Hey Everyone,</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KVneU4v.png">Yep. I messed with the “fuck u/spez ” comments. It’s been a long week here trying to unwind the r/pizzagate stuff. As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly. As the CEO, I shouldn’t play such games, and it’s all fixed now. Our community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won’t do this again.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KVneU4v.png">Fuck u/spez .</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spez&#39;s statement does not resolve the standing matter of how the Washington Post was, somehow, given a link to the edited version of the comments. Staffers from AANA will attempt to follow up with Mr. Huffman regarding the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The admins of a forum actively manipulating the database to change the posts? There is no way that they can explain this away. When this news hit the front page there is going to be heads rolling.</p>

<p>Reddit is fucking dead. I joined a year ago when Bernie announced his candidacy and absolutely loved Reddit, thinking this is the tool people need to get organized and make a difference. </p>

<p>The last week has shown me that this platform is dead. The r/all has in the last couple of weeks turned into a congregation of shitposts consisting of gifs, memes and the occasional post from r/science, r/worldnews r/politics or r/the_donald.</p>

<p>The sad thing is Reddit is such an amazing platform with such a huge userbase that it will be hard to make another alternative that doesn&#39;t devolve into pure shitposts.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve not even mentioned the amount of shills and bots that has made it&#39;s way here in the last year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree whit u blockchain records and remembers everything.<br/>
Part of the problems is not being able to remove illegal shit,<br/>
Witch would then make that whole platform illegal.<br/>
Wen u add in a system that enables deleating things then that in itself is a security problem.<br/>
And defeats the purpose of the chain itself.<br/>
Th only way this could work is if u except shit like cp videos and so on on the protocol.<br/>
Even if we made it text only u could still upload videos in the form of text.<br/>
I myself am sure there is most likely already some jack-ass sharing illegal shit trough btc.<br/>
And if your running a wallet you are considered to be a host </p>
