        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kanye West was institutionalized at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, which was the site of many MKULTRA mind control experiments. Other notable patients were Michael Jackson, Lindsay Lohan, and Britney Spears.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kanye was forcibly hospitalised at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Monday after canceling his Saint Pablo tour.</p>

<p>A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was for his own health and safety, the sources said.</p>

<p><strong>The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a place many celebrities go when they need **“reprogramming”</strong> after having a public breakdown. It was also home to top mind control programmer, Louis Jolyon “Jolly” West, who carried out his MK Ultra work as late as 1989:**</p>

<p>Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in grants from the federal government, channeled through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a major funding conduit for CIA programs. Many millions more poured into the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute that West headed, including over $14 million in federal funds in one fiscal year before he stepped down.</p>

<p>According to reports, Kanye told an audience in California on Saturday that he believed Jay Z was some kind of henchman for the illuminati:</p>

<p><strong>“I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk, when I talk to y’all like this. Beyoncé, I was hurt, cause I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won [VMA] Video of the Year over me, over Hotline Bling.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Jay Z, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head. Talk to me like a man!”</strong></p>

<p>So here&#39;s where shit gets fucky-er </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early morning hours of March 1, 2012, publisher Andrew <strong>Breitbart</strong> collapsed in his <strong>Brentwood</strong> neighborhood, and was rushed to <strong>Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</strong>, where he later died.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Brentwood neighborhood, and was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is interestingly a 20 minute drive to Brentwood, California.</p>

<p>Whereas the John Muir Urgent Care Center is 2.2 miles away...</p>

<p>Guys I don&#39;t want to start something but we need to storm that place. </p>

<p>No, you don&#39;t need to storm a hospital. </p>

<p>You need to do proper research. Other people pointed out he lives near the hospital. </p>

<p>This kind of thing got pizzagate banned.</p>
