       Yes. This is exactly what happened. Trust your gut.

       r/The_Donald and r/Conspiracy have some of the BEST/AWAKE redditors around. Those of us who've been here through several scandals are fully aware doxxing is punishable and would never do it. If newbies had done it, our fully experienced admins would instantly &amp; immediately delete. There was no warning, and they have provided no proof of any offending post or TOS violation. Only accusations.

       Sounds more like they just arbitrarily said, "fuck this" and barely bothered with a pretext.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like the admins seem to actually have a set of rules that bind them. They just don't want to piss a lot of people off by looking too arbitrary, hence pretext, usually "doxxing".

       People who are muted (instead of banned) automatically get unmuted after three days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any evidence that those users were actually posting within three days of the initial mute?    AFAICT the mod just doesn't know what he's doing. (or is lying)

       Too many questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The screenshot lists only four accounts over four days.  If that's true, why didn't you mention this or show the screenshots until after the subreddit was gone?  What posts did they make after getting unmuted?  Why didn't you ban them from posting completely?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's ignoring the inconsistencies in
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       projected motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, why would they even bother?  They never bothered with citations for fatpeoplehate, they just gave their side of the story.  Even if it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       following the rules, the subreddit was specifically designed to investigate the personal lives of complete strangers, by what rule are they being held accountable that required it?

       everyone gets their undies in a bunch during election time because our sub ends up becoming the main place for poltical discourse, and I know there are a lot of people that like to come here for "typical" conspiracy stuff like ancient aliens and that crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election cycle was different though for a number of reasons, obviously. But we were diving into a huge conspiracy, and the amount of woke redditors on the_donald was growing exponential.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now, take a step back and check out our sub.
We are legitimately investigating (as a huge open source community) one of THE biggest conspiracy theories in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, Conspiracy of Silence, the Pedo/Occult/Satantic conspiracies are found near the bottom of the rabbit hole, and I think its extremely impressive to see this many people working towards this massive awakening.

I created

        /r/pizzagate2

       a few days before it closed as a means to back up the CSS and sidebar information in anticipation of reddit closing down the sub. I am not affiliated with
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate

       nor a moderator of any other sub. I didn't post on
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       . The day after it was closed, my private subreddit for which I was the sole subscriber was also closed down with the same message as
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>

       No, just, no. The reason
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       was banned was because you guys were going on a witch hunt, posting facebook links and all kinds of personal information that should not be distributed. And this is coming from someone who actually sees validity in pizzagate, honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read the post that is linked when you go to
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       , it clearly states that posting facebook links, private info etc. is not allowed. Pizzagate was simply a matter of policy, but what
       <a href="/u/spez">
        /u/spez

       did is still completely unacceptable, I think we can all agree.

       Yes, just yes. Obviously you don’t understand the way r/Conspiracy works. Idiot. If we had proof it would not be a conspiracy theory, it would be fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are side-stepping the fact that you have no proof either. You are just taking the word of u/Spez that there was doxxing happening on r/pizzagate. I frequented r/PizzaGate daily and NEVER saw doxxing happening. There was no witch-hunt going on, it was pure investigation. Heartfelt, genuine and by the books.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, Hypothesis Forming is a key part of investigation. Thus far we have all circumstantial evidence, and that's OK.

       Come up with a more plausible counter theory. That's how you eventually find the truth together.

       Doxxing definitely happened...I actually stumbled on a post in there that not only named an old friend of mine by name, but had his home phone/address and work information.  It remained up, despite reports and the doxxed individual contacting the mods, for at least a couple of days.
The individual in question has been receiving calls at home and work ever since.
       <br/>
       The doxxing was real...how the mods and admins handled it was questionable but it definitely happened, and continues to happen even with the sub gone.

       lol. You are missing the point. We're discussing false-flag. Therefore, even if there was doxxing going on -which up till now not a single person has provided a screenshot of the alleged doxxing - how do we know u/spez or any other reddit mod didn't PLANT that TOS violation?

       there were facebook links, idk what to tell you man. Let me put it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys were posting links to private social media, posting names and personal information ACCUSING PEOPLE TO BE PEDOPHILES!!!! Do you honestly not see what is wrong about that? People have a right to not be harassed by strangers on the internet and that is exactly what you guys were doing. Put yourself in anyone's shoes. How the fuck would you feel if thousands of people were accusing you of being a fucking pedo?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you guys are gonna hate hearing this, but leave the investigating to the people that are paid to do it. Don't trust them? Well, maybe you should become a fucking private investigator or something, but don't come crying when your little subreddit gets banned because you were accusing random strangers of being child molestors.

       Again, I was on r/PizzaGate on a daily basis. Never saw any one posting personal info. Mods would have deleted if anyone tried. You do not have a screenshot, nor has reddit provided any screenshot of this violation occurring. We know u/spez can and does edit posts. The suggestion this was false-flag is not far fetched.

       I think that's the wrong link, that one's just about people being unbanned.  It doesn't contain any evidence of altered posts.

       Sure, but considering how prevalent CTR is with Reddit doing nothing about it, it lends even more credence to the possibility.

       Is CTR prevalent on reddit?  I kept hearing that, and as "evidence" people pointed to anti-trump posts in the main subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the site is left-leaning to begin with, and Clinton suffered
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       during the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       If CTR is a driving force, why didn't they have a foothold until she won the primary?  Why don't they have a foothold in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       subreddit, you'd expect there to be more people pointing out Trump's business associates.
      </p>
      <p>
       this subreddit is way smaller and should be easier to manipulate than a huge subreddit like r/news.  We only see anti-clinton stuff here, and the regular non-political contributors are people who tend to spread stories on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CTR accusations don't hold up, IMO it was a false flag by the Russians to distract us from who was really manipulating the narrative.

       When did I say CTR had anything to do with Russia?

      <p>
       A pro-government narrative is affecting posts critical of Russia's actions, and completely controls T_D and conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major flood of pro-russian comments happens in every thread about russia in the major subreddits, but doesn't match the vote count of the large number of existing users, so they only stay at the top of the thread while it's relatively fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Articles critical of Russia are often downvoted before making it out of the queue in ways that don't affect other articles.

       It could be a good thing but it needs to be known. If people (investors in particular) understood the implications of this they would be outraged.  You're the CEO of a multinational social networking site and your feathers get so ruffled over being called names on the internet that you abuse your power like this? For real the fact that you didn't just delete the offending comments begs a lot of questions. Let's list these questions, I'll start - Do you understand why this is so outrageous

       Seriously. Regardless of how eloquent or shitty someones comment is, its typically taken as legitimately from that user.

       I think we all knew they had some fucked up powerful tools at their disposal. But being able to legitimately go in and modify a post at the character level is ridiculous.

      <p>
       It completely opens a flood gate worth of questions regarding their API and what they have allowed to go on behind the scenes.

       What else can they modify so easily? If it includes the vote count, the entire legitimacy of the website has gone away and we should all leave.

       This is why I've always been terrified that IP address info is used as evidence in a court of law. Like, if you'd upset someone at your ISP, and they changed the logs of IP address information for a terrorist/child molester to have your IP instead, isn't your life basically over?

       Shit rolls down hill. Never forget that. Reddit is not independently-owned, and so far its shareholders clearly have approved of the admins' actions. I'm sure they are in favor of shutting down pizzagate.

       It doesn't really matter what excuse was used.  What was essentially banned was speculation on existing data, ie. analysis and metaanalysis.  That's what they didn't like, as it started to lead to unambiguous individuals.   You can like this or not like this, or have opinion X on it.  It really doesn't matter.

       I'm a systems designer by trade.  I hear what you are saying re: design.  In my opinion what we need is this: a document per narrative;  that document is appended to only as it mutates;  that document is distributed; each mutation can be validated by blockchain or some other way of ensuring the data is what it is, and hasn't been modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeping narratives, and keeping those narratives distributed, is The Way to handle this situation.  The advantage of narratives is that they can become canonical/well-known/well-understood/well-remembered, and thus unwanted mutations to them at various stages of the narrative are harder to actualize in meatspace as people are familiar with the narrative.

       Yup. I've long thought about a crowd sourced, blockchain tech based, "narrative" formation. Linking to archived articles, allowing commenting etc.

       Same boat.  A common project for this would be great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freeballing some thoughts.  We could use git repos as the way to keep narratives.  Each repo being a narrative or set of narratives.  Git would be the versioning sauce.  Distribution of narrative(s) would be as simple as forking a repo.  Add a layer to provide an API making this more domain specific to a forum thread / document thread.  Have single page html app that wraps calls to the git repo in a domain-specific way.  Also good place to add more narrative-y meta documents with each commit.  If server side validation was required, could nodify the domain specific api to do the narrative-y meta sauce stuff.  Hmmm..

       We shouldn't use Git because the git server can be compromised. All storage should be on a distributed block chain. The way to run this would be to ensure that the proprietors maintain 51% of the validation pool. This would cost money. We would need to run ads, which is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The components would be:
* A heavily modified bitcoin node that stores messages from addresses. We'd have to figure out a karma/coin system to ensure people didn't completely spam the chain.
* A frontend website not unlike most bitcoin wallet sites to trawl the chain. Local caches could be used to increase performance. The frontend could look exactly like reddit/voat.

       I went to r/PizzaGate late at night two days ago. They were organizing a party to go to Comet Ping Pong and confront them as a crowd. That's a witch hunt, something that has been against site wide rules for a long time.

       OK  it was a popular witch hunt. The sub had new evidence.  Maybe someone from there will move back here and do an AMA. Maybe they were Assanged?

       Organized protests/meetups/confrontations have been been birthed on reddit for a long time.  Witness all the anti-Trump, or SJW, etc. stuff.  Nobody had any problems with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the acts of a few - they don't define the whole.  Acting like they do, and trying to perpetuate this kind of false narrative is smelly as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The excuses used to shut down all related discussion on this topic also smell of bullshit.  The data is out there.  The analysis will happen.  Stifling analysis because the conclusions could be unpleasant is the same thing as stifling free speech.  They're exactly the same thing.

       There were 2 incidents that gave reddit  as a corporation  a black eye back when alleged  members of this community went to Newtown CT. and to a day care center. where they were reportedly 'rude'.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear. This is inexcusable activity by the powerful to deceive the many. There is an absurdly visible plan to manipulate us to an extent that would not be tolerated by less indoctrinated  individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still sure they peacefully explain to themselves that they are just trying to protect the company.

      <p>
       Major leaders of every stripe have  reduced levels of empathy and compassion for others. They don't understand anyone with those  attributes. Neither do they ever consider trying, so they fuck up by being ham handed.

       Anything is possible. Depends on the amount of effort and what the motive for the effort  is. Watching it  develop in real time, it looked legit to me. They appeared to have a new smoking gun and were angry at the content of it.
      </p>

       I'm sure one of them will be willing to  give us a bit of an AMA soon. That is unless they've been Assanged.

       You edited this post yourself several times.  If
       <strong>
        I

       were editing a post multiple times and it ended up with a missing section, I'd assume that I cut the section out myself and re-add it back.

       Why, instead of re-adding the section, did you immediately move to accusations without collecting any proof?  Proof would have been easy, you could have had it indexed in any search engine or the wayback machine.

       What is the significance of this? Doesn't muting just stop people sending private messages to
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       ? So the admin changed it so that people who'd been blocked from messaging the mods could do so again, then banned the sub?

       This is possible, but to be perfectly honest I don't think pizzagate needed to be framed. When you're linking left right and centre to resources leading to these peoples' social media accounts and loudly proclaiming them to be pedos and child traffickers, and growing as fast as they were... I think reddit just didn't want another Boston bomber situation. I'm all for the citizen's investigation, but I'm not suprised reddit shut it down. Dangerous territory when you're amassing a mob of people some of whom are 100% convinced the "targets" of the investigation are satanist child torturers.

       I think it's quite plausible that, since he came out to state that he edited "those" comments, that he's simply admitting to these lower offenses to brush under the rug any other transgression he may have committed.

       The removal of Pizzagate was fishy from the get-go; I'd suspect foul play immediately given what has transpired today.

       Well just a day or two before it was shut down, one user claiming to have been a hacker dumped tons of links to cp all over the subreddit. If that wasn't an orchestrated attempt to shut down the sub I don't fucking know what it was. No one with even an ounce of smarts would consider putting links to cp on any public site much less the subreddit we were using to discuss a conspiracy theory about a government-level pedo ring...

       I think the whole "dox" argument is based on the fact that at one point there was a link on the r/pizzagate subreddit that linked to a site that hosted files from the incident.  On that page's second page, it has a dox link that has a host of private emails, and phone numbers.

       It's more a question of:  Please do not dox people if you're not 100% sure the people you're doxing are actually guilty, and not some innocent bystander who a.) bought pizza from them, b.) isn't even associated with it but has a similar name, or c.) is a poor High School kid who thought working at the local pizza place would be cool, and has no clue what the place is really up to.

       I'm a systems designer by trade.  I hear what you are saying re: design.  In my opinion what we need is this: a document per narrative;  that document is appended to only as it mutates;  that document is distributed; each mutation can be validated by blockchain or some other way of ensuring the data is what it is, and hasn't been modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeping narratives, and keeping those narratives distributed, is The Way to handle this situation.  The advantage of narratives is that they can become canonical/well-known/well-understood/well-remembered, and thus unwanted mutations to them at various stages of the narrative are harder to actualize in meatspace as people are familiar with the narrative.
