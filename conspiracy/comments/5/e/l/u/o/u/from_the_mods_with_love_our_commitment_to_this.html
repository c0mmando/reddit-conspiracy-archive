        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On behalf of the mod team I am writing this post to outline our commitment to you, as well as to shed some light on the nature of sub.</p>

<p>This sub is not supposed to be a curated space, a safe space, or any rigidly defined space.  Its not left-wing, right-wing or anything in between.  There is not litmus test we apply to users before we grant them entry, nor is there a test that guarantees we remove them.</p>

<p>We are fully aware that there are sources that you might find personally untrustworthy. We also realize that one man&#39;s most trusted source is another man&#39;s untrusted source.</p>

<p>It is because of this unavoidable difference in perspective between one person and any other person that we DO NOT try to define for you or anyone else, what is a trustworthy source.</p>

<p>We know that Alex Jones can be 100% correct at times, and 100% full of shit at a different time.  We know that CNN can be 100% correct at times, and 100% full of shit at a different time.</p>

<p>YOU have to look into these sources for yourself, You can not rely on the mods to apply a truth meter to everything posted here.  Honestly, You shouldn&#39;t trust a source every time just because it happened to be trustworthy the last time you checked.</p>

<p>Our commitment to YOU is that we will NOT attempt to be a gatekeeper.  We will NOT remove a post because of something we think.  You all, as a group, have the power to vote the best posts to the top and similarly to sink the turds.  If the mods were tasked with filtering what we think are bad posts, undoubtedly there would be some bias leak into that process and you would miss the opportunity to see those inappropriately removed items.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule 11</p>

<p>Misleading, fabricated or sensationalist headlines are subject to removal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule 11 has everything to do with the intent of the OP.  We do remove satire posts because the intent is to pass off a lie or sensationalize a story as a joke on the reader.  There are perhaps some other examples where someone might go out of their way to sensationalize their title &quot;OMG WE&#39;RE ALL GOING TO DIE TOMORROW&quot; that would also be removed.  Or a fabricated title &quot;Obama eats a pizza made out of dead babies&quot; that would be removed if the article isn&#39;t specifically about eating dead babies.</p>

<p>In these most extreme cases we may step in to remove outlandish post, only if its clear that the intent of the OP was to fool people or mock them.</p>

<p>the mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can not be expected to mitigate which sources are allowed here or not. The mods neither validate nor invalidate the truthfulness of any content posted within this subreddit.
The fact that we allow posts from sources that are almost universally considered to be &quot;untrustworthy&quot; is not a defect of the subreddit. It is in fact an important feature that allows for the unmitigated free exchange of ideas, for if we did not incorporate this important feature there would be a multitude of antagonist demanding that we remove a multitude of posts for this reason alone.</p>

<p>Please consider this while you browse through the items posted here. Anyone with any agenda can post fake news to elicit a predictable response from you, or the opposite, they could aim to keep you from responding at all. Don&#39;t take anything at face value without inquiring thoroughly for yourself into it&#39;s validity, and similarly don&#39;t automatically dismiss without giving it a fair shake. But most importantly of all, do not expect anyone to do this for you because even if they tried with the best of intentions they would eventually fail you and make the wrong decision.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Flytape</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s...actually not it.  Go toward <em>truth</em>.  Discern what truth is and be critically-thinking enough to understand when truth or validity is being conveyed <em>regardless</em> of what the source is.  If you &quot;don&#39;t believe ANYTHING these cunts say to you&quot; and you simply negate everything coming from a source wholesale, then you will likely pass by relevant information that you should have otherwise paid attention to.</p>

<p>Sift the wheat from the chaff.  Not everything will be &quot;all&quot; one thing or the other - all truth or all lies.  That&#39;s where being a critical thinker comes in.  You have to bob and weave; navigate the treacherous waters of the information war going on; know when to take in data as valid, and know when to discard information as irrelevant or incorrect.</p>

<p>Ha.  Perhaps that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t really understand what you were referring to initially.  I can&#39;t say I pay all that much attention to politics, what it all means, etc.  I still can&#39;t really say that I&#39;m even all that sure what &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; even means actually.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody builds a concept of reality using the information they take in. It&#39;s useful to be aware of how this process works and also that small or large parts of that grand concept might be wrong. You must be willing to reject/replace beliefs.
You can equip yourself with good &quot;software&quot; by learning and applying critical thinking. Also observe and learn how your mind works, it&#39;s not that incomprehensible as people make it out to be.
Anyway..: :P
Yeah what I would add: Don&#39;t hang up on/obsess over exact truth, it not achievable, especially for singled out events/&#39;facts&#39;. Get comfortable with not knowing things for sure and apply a gradual scale ranging on everything you know from: Almost certainly true, very likely, possibly, unlikely, probably not true, to: almost certainly not true. Once you take in more information your concept of reality becomes more and more sturdy, and things shift around on this scale. But certain things, especially &quot;general&quot; concepts about reality will consolidate on the outer edges of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I understand that.  However, I feel people should be mindful still of the logical implications of the things they say even if they’re only intended as jokes - especially on topics like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy theory label took form and gained meaning over a period of several years (or longer) in the context of efforts by the CIA, one of the world’s leading experts in psychological warfare, to deflect accusations that officials at the highest levels of the American government were complicit in Kennedy’s murder. … The CIA’s campaign to popularize the term “conspiracy theory” and make conspiracy belief a target of ridicule and hostility must be credited, unfortunately, with being one of the most successful propaganda initiatives of all time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Simply put, “conspiracy theory” is about forbidden thought and forbidden speech. It means stop thinking, stop questioning or risk being labeled a tin-foil-hat-wearing kook who probably thinks Elvis is still alive and extra-terrestrials secretly run the government. And most of the time it works. All someone has to do is say you are pushing a conspiracy theory and actual arguments become unnecessary. This stops discussion and even rational thought. It brings out extreme condescension in those who otherwise might be pleasant and reasonably intelligent. No actual evidence needs to be offered because a conspiracy theory is, by its very nature, assumed to be a lunatic idea that is not supported by facts.</strong></p>

<p>uh, this is something that anyone can experimentally test at any time by creating his own subreddit. In other words, you&#39;re the type of person who will allow himself to remain ignorant when there is no possible excuse, making ridiculous and damning allegations even while a very small amount of diligence can openly demonstrate your accusations to be false. Long story short, there is absolutely no reason anyone should take your concerns seriously even one single time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people don&#39;t understand how dangerous conspiracy actually is. People have been tortured, been exposed to psycholgical warfare and lost thier minds to address or research these topics. We are pure heretics and I won&#39;t be too surprised if one day I have to pay for my curiosity. </p>

<p>There is a reason this sub takes this approach and maybe one overlooked reason is tradition. I heard of conspiracies first when I was a kid in the 80s. There was no internet. The &#39;frustrations&#39; with the unreliably of the content were the same. Look back at any older videos like that mystery series Leonard Nimoy did (70s?) and you&#39;ll see a definite pattern of intentional unreliability - it&#39;s always left up to the reader/viewer to decide. Why do they do this? The answer is so that no-one dies. Adding disinfo is another technique. For every true article, post five that are pure bullshit. Savvy conspiracy readers know how to filter - this why we don&#39;t watch T.V. Think about that next time you see a link to rense or some other &#39;unreliable&#39; website. If they can discredit you, they might not kill you. That tin-foil hat could save your life.</p>

<p>On a slight tangent - this logic also works for alphabet agencies. Just because someone is tied to, infiltrated or works for the government doesn&#39;t make them disinfo or bad. Just because something is passed off as conspiratainment doesn&#39;t mean someone isn&#39;t trying to talk. Maybe they&#39;re flying below the radar. Wake up.</p>

<p>The election, trump and even the pizzagate newfags (special shout out to the &#39;reliable sources&#39; fags) have no idea what they are getting into. Instead of gaining some perspective, asking deep questions (why is the world like this?), they want to launch a crusade tomorrow, fight a short war and go back to &#39;normal&#39; life. There is not going to be normal anymore - understanding and embracing this will save your life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing against crusades - or supporting them, or factual, reliable information but we do have to think a bit more deeply about our world view. People who have just stumbled upon pizzagate are finding this out. The problem is pizzagate is bigger than pizzagate - we all know this, and look at how quickly that sub self destructed already.</p>

<p>Sometimes the content on this sub is so superficial it makes my eyes water but there is a big silent community of lurkers too and they do know what&#39;s up. So keep your tinfoil hats close by, remember Fox Maulder, and read and upvote something &#39;crazy&#39; once in a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah well as an ode to rule ten, I&#39;m going to guess that you&#39;re fetish is taking the piss out of the mods.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.  What&#39;s funny is that you don&#39;t realize your admission that your other account was banned here could easily be reported to the admins as a ToS violation for ban evasion... If I wanted to ban you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing man, I don&#39;t want to ban anyone, I don&#39;t want to report you to the admins and get your account waxed.  I just want you to conduct yourself here with a pinch of respect for the rules.  Rule 10 exists to keep people from constantly attacking each other or the mods or the sub in a general sense... So that we can actually talk about conspiracy theories instead of people&#39;s wounded egos.</p>

<p>You seem to be doing better after your initial ban because you now seem to get along better, well enough that I wouldn&#39;t ban you for taking the piss out of me nor would I bother to report your ban evasion.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Over three years ago <a href="/u/donbueno">/u/donbueno</a>, a moderator, came out of a long AFK period and removed everyone below him and began to troll alongside the authority-worshiping <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> queens. The only person above him on the mod-list was the founder of the sub <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a>, and he had been AFK for like 2 years at that time. A redditor, <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a>, who knew wax AFK contacted him and that led to him straightening it all out by removing donbueno and re-modding everyone he booted. solidwhetstone was also modded at that time for his role in helping everyone out. </p>

<p>this was because 9000sins was deleting comments and in general just acting like a shady mod in a conspiracy sub... Most of them were and I figured less moderation was better at that time. Sins sucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can chime in and let you guys know what happened. We were being hit with a deluge of 1 day old profiles trolling our sub day in and day out. We as a moderation team discussed the best way to defend against the attacks, and my suggestion was to create a rule for automod to require your account to be at least 3 days old in order to comment on the sub. It worked as intended until Donbueno decided we were all cunts and needed to be dealt with. Now I could understand a stern warning or maybe even opening up a discussion about the issue, but instead he used his master moderator powers to remove everyone below him on the mod list. He was number 2 and I was number 3. After I was reinstated as a mod I have slid way down the ranks. I only wanted to hold the higher position to ensure that the sub remained under control and that no one abused their mod powers. Ever since then I have been insanely busy with my boy who was just born 3 years ago and he has become my world. I love all of you and I am so sorry that my time is mostly taken up with my family and that I rarely have the energy to put into my moderation duties here at r/conspiracy. I just got a new phone and maybe I will start working again soon. Hopefully sometime soon I can come back to you. I have a lot of confidence in our current mod team. I check the mod logs every now and again to make sure everyone is keeping the sub clean and not abusing their mod powers. I start biting my nails every time new mods are added or when the mods start talking about major changes. I admit I can be a bit spontaneous at times but having a larger mod team means that I need to use a large amount of consideration for the other mods and the users before implementing any changes, cosmetic or functional. I have become more restrained in the last few years and also a lot more focused. Having children really changes you, and for the better. I have a new found empathy and love that I never even knew before he came into my world. Long story short, I love you guys and I will still be lurking around from time to time just to keep tabs on the current state of things. Hopefully no one higher on the mod list decides to go rogue and remove me or any other defenders of this sub. </p>

<p>Wish I could say the same. Only one or two of them (vocally) appear to understand the basic definitions of the words they use in rule 11. Troubling to say the least. Promoting witch-hunts in the side-bar without discussion beforehand doesn&#39;t bode well either.</p>

<p>That&#39;s happened twice in three years. Most larger subs are not nearly that stable.</p>

<p>The default mod&#39;s clique would want nothing more than to get several of our mods booted out of the way so they can get ahold of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and turn it into a memefest where the people who oppose <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are in a dominant position.</p>

<p>They have been trying to elbow their way in here for years.</p>

It seems &quot;they&quot; are now back doing that shit with &quot;pizzagate&quot; (and all &quot;bs&quot; around HRC during the élections). Allowing too much pizzagate bs (or &quot;similar&quot; like obvious neo nazi shit and those dark web horror stupid movies from youTube etc) is like allowing some worms to to nest into your body.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. We all need to consider at some point our own beliefs. The problem is that we cannot do this without the free exchange of ideas. Reddit is a great website for sharing ideas, but it is still a private company that has the right to remove or shut down anything it wants. The same goes for Youtube, twitter, facebook, even the shadier places. Therefore we must be willing at any moment to move our discussion elsewhere, and find new means of sharing ideas. I think that conspiracy theorists have often been demonized as crazy alien fanatics. But like any community, conspiracy theorists have evolved from a simple joke community to a multitude of citizens who don&#39;t want corruption and lies to govern there lives, and ultimately, the future of mankind. We must stay vigilant, and protect our rights to protect our rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was getting a lot of upvotes until it was deleted. Based on what you just said, it is little disingenuous to say this sub isn&#39;t curated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not accusing you guys of any malicious intent, I just think you guys are going about the wrong way of moderating the sub. We should focus a little more on outreach and getting our message out or at the least, allow us users to. </p>

<p>My title was&#39;t the best in the world but it would have taught many people about WT7 and show how many others there are that agree it was a controlled demolition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say &quot;do you believe in the fringe tin-foil hat conspiracy theory of bearded aerobats who throw their passports out of aircraft cabins seconds before bringing down 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes?&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;official narrative&quot; on 911 is an unbelievable conspiracy theory. People who believe it are nuts. The burden of proof is on them. Anyone who believes in the transubstantiation of steel or magical airplanes need to provide evidence. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how common knowledge is shifted, by reframing the discourse as if we hold the majority opinion (we do). That&#39;s how the institutional propaganda does it anyway.</p>

<p>the very fact the media was 100% anti-trump right around the world, not just in the usa (and still is) tells the kind of people who come here that he is/was a better choice, no matter what he does or does not achieve in office</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i suggested cnn be banned a few days ago, similar to facebook, it wouldn&#39;t be missed i&#39;m sure but it could open a can of worms</p>

<p>i personally will never give cnn or any of the other fake news sites a dime by opening one of their links</p>

<p>it is the one way we can fight back and make them wither and die: do not give them unique hits, do not give them ad revenue</p>
