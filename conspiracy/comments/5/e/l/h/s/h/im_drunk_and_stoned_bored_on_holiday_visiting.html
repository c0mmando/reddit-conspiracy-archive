        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You guys can look at my post history, I&#39;ve never posted about this before and I don&#39;t bullshit.  This is what happened 3 years ago, no exaggeration, no embellishment and no lies.</p>

<p>A little history. My wife and I were living with three other people (they were actually in a triad relationship). I was working full time at a Research Center as a Software Engineer at a college an hour away.  My life was mainly work.</p>

<p>I noticed one morning that my left calf was itching but never paid it any real attention.  I thought I had a mosquito bite and just scratched it when it itched but never really thought much about it.  After a shower a couple days later I really looked at it and thought &quot;Wow&quot;. Basically there were 3 raised little bumps in an exact triangle on the back of my lower calf. I thought it was cool how it made a triangle, showed my wife and she said &quot;that&#39;s awesome&quot;. It continued to itch daily, and never really healed two weeks later, three weeks later.  I figured by then I had gotten into ivy.  It didn&#39;t look like a triangle anymore and had more tiny little rash like bumps through and around it.  I put hydrocortisone cream on it and continued with my life.</p>

<p>About two months later I was sitting in my living room, playing Xbox with my roommates.  We&#39;re all smokers and we were high and talking about aliens and my roommate says, &quot;Man, me and &quot;Amanda&quot; woke up a couple months ago with this weird triangle thing on our leg&quot;.  I didn&#39;t quiet put two and two together and continued playing and then I heard, &quot;Yeah, man it took forever to go away&quot;.  That got my attention.</p>

<p>I put the controller down and said &quot;Man,  I have the same thing dude.&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe it, hell I couldn&#39;t believe it.  The exact same spots on all three of our legs had the same pattern, mine wasn&#39;t healed as much as theirs but there was absolutely no doubt they were the same and happened about if not the same night.  He says the night they got theirs the whole household slept really &quot;hard&quot; and didn&#39;t wake up till late the next day.  I really don&#39;t remember the exact night or the next day as I worked all the fucking time.  </p>

<p>Anyway, it finally healed after about a year.  The rash went away but it&#39;s still hard to the touch and was warmer than the surrounding area for the longest time.  I&#39;ve never had it looked at by a doctor, I quit my job not too long after finding it cause of the hours I was working and lost my insurance.  It is an odd thing though and I&#39;ll always remember that it&#39;s true and I have literally something in my leg.  It&#39;s weird man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an X-Files fan, this story got my attention and I did some digging... apparently &#39;Sovereign Silver&#39; (a silver-based first aid product) could draw out this object closer to the skin surface (if it&#39;s an implant). </p>

<p>Somewhere in this sub I read that aliens might be demons so the silver reference + supernatural kinda makes sense, but what do I know ;)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look around for more options, work is quiet today :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome man!  I&#39;m signing up for a free consultation.  Yeah man I worked for 4 years at the Research Center at Tech and said fuck it.  I&#39;ve been working from home, enough to make ends meet and all but I haven&#39;t had insurance since I quit.  Funds are low mainly cause of the holidays and I&#39;ve got a little girl that&#39;s wanting a Canon and a wife that&#39;s wanting new wedding bands.  Lol.  Strapped as hell dude.  But yeah, thank you so much.  I&#39;ll see what they tell me.  I&#39;d hope they don&#39;t charge much but I worry about Skype hypnosis working.  It&#39;d have to be difficult to get yourself relaxed etc.  I&#39;ll see what they charge though.  Thanks so much man!</p>
