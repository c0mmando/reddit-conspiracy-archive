        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to say &quot;Reddit is Dead&quot; after Aaron Swartz&#39;s death. Yet I still kept coming here. I frequented /conspiracy, but as some of you have already hinted, &quot;Can we get back to Aliens and Chemtrails?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not my point. Because the posts I read here on this subreddit are sometimes groundbreaking. Yeah there&#39;s a lot of hay. Yet, the needles I found opened new avenues in actual real motherfuckin&#39; life. </p>

<p>The new places I could gather information, since I have been interested in storytelling, are insane and more incredible than I could make up. Even ones I didn&#39;t picture myself ever touching (CIA database, FBI databse, Hundreds of individual Wikileaks emails, C-Span database etc.). </p>

<p>Now that r/pizzagate is gone, and I finally subscribed to this community, I realized now what I never was able to be truly apart of. The tracking down of information and real humble learning myself as an individual. I realized these are real people. With real shitty 9-5 jobs that spend good motherfucking time researching and backing up their claims with undeniable evidence.</p>

<p>Lurking only lets me slightly influence to people I know outside of Reddit. Now, even with a long and boring post, I feel I should give back my two cents. Sure this might be blocked, or skewed or taken down because of Rule #12. </p>

<p>Yet, even without posting or contributing, this subreddit has changed my life and changed the way I view information and the world. Shit it made me pay attention to events out of the USA without listening to mouthpieces run by the USA.</p>

<p>With the whole Hillary neo-mccarthyism I immedietely contacted a person I didn&#39;t even truly know on social media. Where the only reason I did that is because they were living in Russia and mostly distrusted what they heard on their end as well.</p>

<p>The fear of being lied to is real here. That fear only makes an individual search for truth. For anything, that process will keep you up at night. Because if places like this truly go down. We&#39;ve got one more place. The streets. Showing real people real information and organizing. Whether that be Huey Newton putting in a new Stop sign for his community. Placing provocative art to open people&#39;s eyes. Or God Damn, go up and ask somebody what they think for you and your personal interest only.</p>

<p>Anyway, does posting birth here always start with a rant like this?</p>

<p>Personally I haven&#39;t done much to help all of you. You reading this right now. The people who frequent this place. Though I want to say a formal and very real THANK YOU for what we have changed here. My Mind.</p>

<p>You might say this place hasn&#39;t done much. Looking back I was enamored with the fact all y&#39;all were forming theories against everybody, every candidate, every advisor. It was as if nothing felt to be untouched. (I hope to God we all question that fact in itself, that is subreddit is untouched and pristine and free)</p>

<p>Now look at the posts! The subtext is here LEAVE! LEAVE REDDIT! They might say Reddit is dead. It is censored. Check Ceddit.com, check Voat.co. What about the timeline of r/undelete and r/undeleteundelete ? Sure it is. In a way this post is for me. A staple in a place I&#39;ve come to know as the crazy ass people who aren&#39;t afraid to be called bat shit insane.</p>

<p>And every time One more person &#39;changes their mind&#39; it&#39;s a step towards a change in &#39;world consciousness&#39;. and it&#39;s showing e.g. trump getting elected ... the &#39;mind of the world&#39; and it&#39;s &quot;collective consciousness&quot;, <em>stopped</em> hillary, through people like yourself</p>

<p>from here  in Oz, thanks again mate</p>
