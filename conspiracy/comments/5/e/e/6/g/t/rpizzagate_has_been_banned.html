       So r/pizzagate got taken down the day after 1000's of accounts linked to CP were discovered on Twitter and then James Alefantis is in the Washington Times talking about it the same day? Something smells funny

       And Kanye getting locked up. The globalists are desperately lashing out. We have them on the run. This is how we know pizzagate is big. If it didn't scare them so much they wouldn't react so drastically.

       Indeed. After hearing the rant just now for the first time, and knowing that he got forced into a hospital or psyche ward shortly after, the two together are almost solid evidence of something quite sinister.

       We're virtually all followers of Lucifer, whether we know it or not. We just don't know his nature, his way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer is an ancient adept on the path of serving the self even at the expense of others. Domination and control for personal utility and gratification is the aim of his game. If we subscribe to that (anti)life path, we become very vulnerable to influence from him and his minions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society is a product of corruptions he brought to our world thousands of years ago. The money system, the Abrahamic religions, centralized government unaccountable to the people governed are all old tools that were invented and employed long before humanity on Earth was conceived. They were used to enslave other beings in this galaxy. It's all about domination and control for utility and personal gratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, our society compels us to be selfish, harming others, our environment and even ourselves, to find utility and gratification. He contaminated many wells of joy that satisfy our souls like sex, living in self-sufficiency efficiently in small units in harmony with our environment, enjoying nature without vexation from occupational stress compelling more intense gratifications, and generally connecting with each other in various forms of interaction rather than being superficially fixated on technology. Nature can be rough, but physics is not a slave seeker. It doesn't seek to squeeze you harder for greater utility and gratification. Although, your boss does, his boss does, the owners of the business do, and the controllers of this planet do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The traumas from the violence of our fall from connection to nature and other traumas create fear in our hearts. A mind in fear finds satisfaction much more difficult. Misery loves company as they say. Fear based minds enjoy others entering states of fear or suffering, for a deep long-winded, esoteric reason, another form of utility that Lucifer, his minions, and some earthlings selfishly enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very special energy of use to consciousness is transferred, which yields gratification and utility. The purpose of demonic or satanic rituals, or sacrifice rituals generally, is to create fear and suffering to give gratification and utility to the hidden spiritual infestors on, in and around our planet. This energy is generated by consciousness in emotional (energy in motion) states based on love; joy, gratitude, appreciation, relationships, witnessing beauty, and other positive emotional states. It is radiated outwardly during emotional states of fear; insecurity, anger, judgement, hatred, blame, jealousy, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of Lucifer and his band of mind slaves on us is to persuade us to adopt his way of life. It is a predictable machine-like way of life. Lucifer is a technology augmented being with vast computational, AI, surveillance and memory resources. When we adopt his way of life, it is as if we are sitting at a chess table with the world chess champion, betting our souls that we will best him. This computer augmented superbeing thinks many, many moves ahead. As long as you play his game, he can own you through the application of truth, deception, fear and reward, similar to how we train animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people choose to become self-serving even at the expense of others, they begin to merge with the hierarchical shadow of this being. Him and his minions give us temptations, or rather suggestions to live out of integrity with the whole and ourselves. This causes us to create fear and suffering for others and ourselves, for that spiritual energy, but also so that we become predictable and so that we persuade others to start being self-serving even at the expense of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, his shadow is like a contagious disease. The more one is affected by it, the more one agrees with the thinking that comes with it, and the more one can be manipulated by Lucifer and his mind slave minions. His minions are other races that failed to resist his persuasion. They essentially agree with him. In a paradigm of might makes right, this superbeing has an undeniable logical excuse to dominate and control your awareness, gaining consent, perceived by the self and third party observers. Why, if you think and act like Lucifer and his minions, you are out of self-control and obviously the environment and others are better served by your enslavement, sucker.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like the vampires of the Necroscope series, where vampires create other vampires for gratification and utility. Vampires in that story used the vampires they created as harvesters and accumulators of others' energy, so that the elder vampires can simply feed from a higher concentration of energy more effortlessly. This is what Lucifer does with spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As beings join his dawned mind slave minion army, they become the edge of what is effectively a giant energy sucking vortex. They pull this spiritual energy, akin to the value of existence for consciousness, into the vortex, then some of it is stolen by elder minions and then stolen by even elder minions, and ultimately Lucifer. So the minions get a cut and give much of it upward inside the hierarchy, the life sucking vortex.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people don't realize about this being is that he has played the role of God for humanity. When we reach out for God, much of the time we get Lucifer and his minions. Often, when we reach out for ET light forces, we get gifted imposters working for Lucifer. Know them by the emotional fruit they ultimately bear, love or fear. When much of what people consider light forces ask the One, Source or God what to do next, they get information from Lucifer. Lucifer means the bearer of light, which is essentially information rather than love. He has used just about every name for God and the devil and everything in between that people would trust, so that he can manipulate for control, utility and gratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to effectively resist this spiritual parasite is to follow an incompatible life path. It must be based upon respect for other beings. It may even be serving others even at the expense of the self. As beings embrace integrity with the whole, this superbeing is
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       able to predict and manipulate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is said that this being is allowed to exist as part of a special experience for consciousness, the experience of separation from oneness. We are all one being, including this superbeing that apparently attacks the whole. This being facilitates the illusion that we are separate beings, by removing God from the self and placing it outside, demanding worship and giving us fear. The idea that we are God is seen as blasphemy, by the Abrahamic religions Lucifer created and contaminated. Religions and other products of Lucifer are there to create division and submission to authority. God has no master, unless he chooses to simulate one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we truly believed in oneness, or even knew it, why would we seek to dominate and control others? Why would we harm others? Why wouldn't we unite to serve each other and ourselves better? We'd know that we experience each other's behavior. It wouldn't seem as appealing anymore to live outside of integrity. This superbeing does appear to be integral to this illusion of separation and it is said by many to work tirelessly to prevent the dissemination of belief, evidence and knowledge that promotes a perspective of oneness, not just in religion, but also science, finance and government.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we know we are one, the allowance of this being here may very well come to an end. It is apparently being compelled to obey rules, rules based on a version of free will. If we would take responsibility for ourselves and our society, uniting and healing our relationships, we will create unity and oneness will become more obvious. This being wants to maintain its access to our spiritual energy as long as possible and if possible add our race to its base of mind slave minions. Us willfully embracing technologies like genetic modification, and most importantly, mind augmentation with computers, will allow this master of fear, deception, dark knowledge and technology to slowly, but surely, persuade us that others are mere things to give us pleasure, and ultimately add us to his army of the damned, his energy sucking vortex.

       No he fucking didn't. I saw that thread and he posted nothing. He just talked about it. The whole sub was backed up into archives, find it and prove it. But you can't because you're wrong.

       Having intercourse with animals is illegal and is called beastiality. It's mostly illegal because dogs (and other critters) can't consent. Also because interspecies sex is a sin according to like every religion ever (probably where the law originated).  And also it's gross.

       Some dogs will hump anything anytime, how is it "abuse" to just let them do?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, breeding animals, especially horses, is often done by tying the mare's legs so she can't move away when they put the stallion on her... but since horses can't consent, they can't "not consent" either, so it's clearly not animal abuse, right?

       Reddit is the "front page of the internet". A great site?  Yeah a great site guaranteed to be under watch and cataloged that only allows things to stand as long as it is useful to them, whether via allowing people some semblance of control ( a false sense mind you) or via allowing people a place to willfully hand over data about themselves (photos, stories, descriptions, meta data etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is not a safe space. Reddit never has been and never will be. To pretend otherwise is to ignore everything we know a out government data collection and how they operate. Don't kid yourself, they allow you to post here, and at any time they can - and will - take that away. As they have proven time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a bunch of people in a sub about conspiracies some of you sure do seem like you haven't learned any lessons from the " conspiracies" that were proven factual.

       Idiot implies they don't know what they're doing. I prefer the term insidious because they clearly had an ulterior (business) motive for banning it.

       It's just a "timeout" area for members of a sub that gets shit-canned to go to and defuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time a sub gets banned everyone goes "fuck it that's it - I'm going to Voat, lets just start this shit there without the stupid reddit admins. Never coming back to reddit." That lasts for maybe 3 days, at which point it descends into a creepy, frantic little blogger repository for overthought 9/11 theories and creepy porn.

       Please do. Reddit is filled with globalist, satanic, pedophilic, reptilian, disinformationist, illuminati overlords. This is such a vile website. I can't wait to get off of it and I hope the rest of you follow me to voat and 8chan.

       I'm newer to Reddit... the whole Clinton foundation BS brought me here and it's where I found pizza gate.... it's hard to keep up with shit like this at the speed it gets shut down... which only feeds my hunger to dig deeper and find out more. I shall be following you all to Voat and look forward to discovering more. Is 8chan or 4chan still a good go to??

       Yeah it's not the best right now, but it is being bombarded with new users right now, to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, /v/pizzagate has close to 6k active users at the moment, and Voat as a whole only has 300 subverses. In a couple days I'm sure things will be ironed out, and at that point
       <a href="/r/PizzaGate">
        /r/PizzaGate
       </a>
       will have migrated to /v/PizzaGate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, some reddit users managed to achive the entire pizzagate subreddit, so everything down to lists of users who engaged with the subreddit are up and available. If you want to follow pizzagate, /v/pizzagate is really where you need to be.

       Trust in the media is at an all time low. Them pulling this shit is only going to "redpill" more people ultimately. It's disturbing that they protect pedophiles, but this desperation from them is probably a good thing. It means that people are waking up. We just need to keep doing what we're doing.

       4-8 more years of the liberty to brand opposition as "fake news" and we'd be looking at lite 1984.

       no, not hilarious, a set-up the pizzagaters fell for hook, line and sinker. Don't laugh too hard though, because we are next. These idiots got conned and it is going to impact anyone researching any alternate theories.

       I'll try to summarize since it seems all traces were removed. Anyone else feel free to add in where I left out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : Here's a
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129141807/http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.png">
        web archive link of the SLC post screencap
       </a>
       before comments were all deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It started out as a curious post to the Salt Lake City (Utah) subreddit with a picture of the place and a caption "I walk by this place everyday, never see any kids. Anyone know about it?" Most locals that knew chimed in with "yeah me either", or called it creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire comments discussion ended up deleted and the mods removed the post (due to "doxing" IIRC).
      </p>
      <p>
       It ended up being resurrected on here and people started digging deeper. Found a weird crappy website for a kids service (toys or daycare, can't remember) that was registered to someone who worked IT in the SLC city government. I believe he was tied to the daycare.
      </p>
      <p>
       People started calling the daycare, staking it out at night, and even delivering pizza to it. Several people reported it to the local police too (nothing was done). This kind of "harassment" and "doxxing" is what led to the admins pressuring the mods here to delete the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just say that while I don't necessarily agree with how everything went down, I'm pretty sure illegal shit was going down there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Day care fraud at a minimum, perhaps worse. The place has the AC unit running and lights on yet no kids were ever seen coming or going except one time (and they were alone, quickly ushered inside by an old woman). Artwork on the windows outside was unchanged for 7+ years (street view).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was shady as hell. It really makes me think with all this Pizzagate stuff.

       Eli5, how is this a conspiracy and Pizzagate is real, besides other redditors taking another redditor' so far out theory about a small female child that looked like the child kidnapped over 10 years ago. But it was linked to random, not verified, instagram subscriber.  And that unverified picture from an unverified instagram account.
      </p>
      <p>
       And explain it me why WikiLeaks has not discover this link....

       Mmmmm maybe wince it was fake. But please explain it to me like I am 5 with all the known facts.

It's more about Washington's connections to a few restaurants that have strange posters (think child exploiting content), instagram accounts with similarly creepy stuff, known pedo symbolism (referenced against a pedo symbols list released by the FBI) and much much more. It's a huge tangled mess of a web that people are working on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the inclination that there's something to it, because similar things have been discovered in the UK, and the US is a huge country with plenty of missing kids each year and it would be highly unlikely that there isn't something of this level happening somewhere within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helps. Most of all, go to

       And none of this debunks it. It raises some more questions.

       He guy who "owns it" operates it at a loss just so his mother has something to do? Okay, I'll bite. So why underneath the odd umbrella of "Chunga International LLC"?

      <p>
       I'm sure if I researched Chunga International further I'd have more questions.

       It doesn't add up given the timeline and shell companies used. I've done the research and Vice doesn't begin to scratch the surface of Jose and Eva's business history.

       Gotta say I haven't looked into the more recent "pizzagate" story but there was definitely something fucky going on back with the SLC daycare stuff.  I can say that, as a mod, the response to this new one isn't on the same level (at least so far).

       The ELI5 is that someone uncovered some weird evidence surrounding a daycare in Salt Lake City and started posting things about it, they uncovered ties to strange sums of money and people, pictures of kids coming and going, etc.  This was basically all over the course of one or two days and it ended up blowing up to the point that instead of 1000 active users, for example, we had closer to six or seven thousand.  Dozens of brand new accounts came out of the woodwork to tell us we were ruining lives and to stop, we were getting threats via PM, and then eventually the admins came in and essentially told us to shut it down.  The only other time I've seen something like it is back when someone made a couple of subreddits to study the Sandy Hook evidence and ended up getting both of them deleted, all his/her accounts banned, and dozens of other users banned as well.

       People litterally saying "people cant explain why its a good thing to be friends with russia."
      </p>
      <p>
       No dingy, its because they facepalm and walk away. Russia is number two in the world in terms of military power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being enemies with russia for the last 2 or 3 decades has caused :
      </p>
      <p>
       destabalization of power in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revel factions fighting for power
      </p>
      <p>
       A skyrocket in the price of oil
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro terrorist nations like saudi arabia rising to power
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis
      </p>
      <p>
       And the refugee crisis.

       Yes, and as of now, the site is down... dunno if it is because of the increase of traffic (i assume there is increase because of people changing sites) or if it's something else.

       I wonder how much the whole "fake news" push is related to concern about the leaks, past and future.. Maybe they're concerned there's some massive bombshell leak coming, or that people will put together the pieces from what we already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting when you see a phrase just injected into the public lexicon over the course of a week. "Fake news." Something we all need to wary of, of course.

       Well, looking at the Podesta emails paints a pretty clear picture how they do it. There was an
       <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-list-least-65-msm-reporters-meeting-andor-coordinating-offline-top-hillary-advisors/">
        email
       </a>
       with a full list of top reporters of MSM organizations attending an off the record dinner party to "frame the race." Probably had a nice slide show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next step is looking at the
       <a href="https://archive.is/BvC5H">
        democratic playbook
       </a>
       so you can see exactly what MSM has been told to preach to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else that happens in short spans is just people knowing each other and occasionally tipping each other off of possible scandals/questions/whatever through some quick emails and quickly doing damage control. I can only imagine what kind of panicked meetings are happening right now and who's going to end up being the scapegoat.

       Not really,  it's just top Reddit admins panicking. If the media depicts Reddit as "that one site" that "harrassed" an "innocent" "random" pizza place, advertisers might not want to advertise here.  Advertisers are irrational like that.

       Right. I know. What I'm saying is, this fake news story hijacked the search term "Madeline McCann" just as pizzagate was beginning to bust open and catch some ears. Interesting timing for an unrelated Madeline McCann story to suddenly pop up, no?

       I don't see why this is shocking to anyone here, let alone needing post after post. Reddit - the front page of the internet - is one of the most trafficked and cataloged sites on the web. Why did anyone think this would be allowed to stand here?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is truly as big as some think it is why is this surprising to anyone?  Censorship?  No one should be shocked by this, reddit is a corporation and you can bet they are beholden to special interest all their own. They allow some things as a form a complacency to allow people to feel as though they have a voice. But at any time, as they have shown time and time again, they will and can shut it down. No amount of creating subs will stop this. No amount of discussion will stop this. The only thing that can be done is a migration off site, to somewhere that they cannot control the narrative of. If you're unwilling to do that, then don't be surprised by these actions - as they are nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is allowed to stand because they allow it to stand. There is no other reasons. Same for any other sub. No one should be surprised by these actions. Reddit is not your friend. Its not a safe space. Its another in a long line of forms of control. It allows you to feel as though you have a voice. All while they catalog every word you say. For a bunch of people that believe in conspiracies you sure do make it easy for them to watch and catalog what you are doing and saying (I am to so not a judgement).  The sooner we recognize it for what it is the sooner we can formulate a real plan of how to combat it. Until that time we are all just continuing to feed the beast whether intentionally or not.

       Its not shocking because its probably another psyop to slide people slowly into less freedom just like flat earth ideology. And here you are falling right into the trap or part of the FUD camping. I have zero tolerance for shit and im smelling shit a mile away.

       No, karma police, gchq, prism, etc aren't psyops, they are proven factual information collecting programs and services. Which collect data from the net and correlate it into profiles etc. Hence why I've said that its not shocking, as they know everything being said here. And news flash, if anyone was onto something they would not let that shit blow up on reddit, where they can (and have) easily shut it down. Dont kid yourself it's otherwise. They allow information on here and they will take it away if they feel the need. Reddit IS NOT a safe space. Its as safe as those in power allow it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a corporation. Which is beholden to their own and special interest. I'm falling into it?  No. I'm not pretending like this is some  safe space that isn't heavily regulated, like some around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's called being cognisant of the truth not pretending this is something its not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said pizzagate was/wasn't a real thing. I'm saying don't be surprised that reddit will shut that shit down. Because of what reddit is, a fuckinf corporation. And what are corporations interested in outside of money?  The collection and control of information. Do try to not pretend like its otherwise or you have some kind of shit detector others don't. The fact that you would even reapond how you did shows the level of attention you've really been paying to what's going on in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can smell shit a mile away, yet you act like reddit is some kinda safe space?  Don't make me fucking laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying stop the conversation, I'm saying don't be shocked when those in power exercise such. That's not being blind or fud. That's acknowledging the truth of the situation. If you can't acknowledge the facts then yourp have already lost. As you can't change them when you refuse to acknowledge what they are.

       DO you are repeating the obvious. what is your point? this has all been said many times, we all know this. If you dont have something differnt to say that is moving this forward then you are from MHO spreading fear and doubt which already exists.

       Spreading fear and doubt in a sub about conspiracies?  Do you hear yourself?  This entire sub is based around fear and doubt. People fear they are being lied to. They are spreading doubt that what they have been told is the truth. Fear and doubt are the entire fucking point here, and that's not a bad thing. People should have doubt and they should be scared. What they shouldn't be is complacent and thinking the system works for them, because it does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying - and let me make this very fucking clear - that you cannot begin to change things or address the real reasons behind these things if you refuse to acknowledge the truth of the situation. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the truth here is simple, reddit allows these things to exist. They will, and have, shut it down at their discretion. Reddit is not a safe space. Reddit is not your friend. Being shocked when they go against the best interest of the public is idiotic. Of course they do, that's in their best interest. And guess what, for better or worse, their interest will always be higher on their list then yours or the publics. Don't kid yourself otherwise.

       is too high-profile or too chaotic to get the axe if too much supposed 'doxxing' goes on here.

       I'm betting the real reason that subreddit got banned is because one of reddit's unspoken rules is "don't cause us to get a letter from the FBI"

       It might be nothing but it's strange how the media has been reacting to it considering how truly bizarre the stuff that was on this dudes instagram was and the openly pedo stuff they were referencing in some truly creepy images.  Kids taped to a table and something THEY referred to as a #killroom that was the sort of empty sterile room with metal walls.  Weird stuff all things considered even if it turns out to be nothing.  The guy is also one of the top 50 most influential people in Washington.  Plus on the original sub before it was banned there were tons of accounts that had been made just to post in that subreddit saying how false it was.  Even more bizarre comments were just disappearing; not deleted or marked like that or even shadowbans, but just gone.  I've never seen that before on Reddit.

       &lt;---- Is the source material.  Most of it is from stuff taken from the dude who owned the pizza place instagram.  Even if it turns out to be nothing I don't think I'd let any children under my care eat there.

       There's a lot of suspicious evidence of pedophilia ring in Washington DC thanks to following breadcrumbs found in the Wikileaks releases of John Podesta's emails. The corporate media is actively covering up this investigation by calling independent media "fake news" while large social media corporations like Reddit and Twitter actively censor their users to keep this information from getting out and being investigated. In this case, the Reddit admins suddenly banned r/pizzagate, the subreddit where the investigation was largely centralized to.

       Pizzagate is the biggest scandal in the history of mankind. Needless to say, Reddit, which has a distinct liberal bias, is complicit in pedophilia. The entire core of the DNC is rotten, and openly encourages sexual abuse. Now that the Clinton media has picked up on this, they are spinning it to make it seem like it's just a far out there conspiracy, something only tinfoil hatters would believe. But I think that the New York Times are only trying to cover their own tracks: that once we were onto the Clintons, we will be onto them next (and it wouldn't surprise me one bit if other media outlets were complicit in this). I say that if this is all true, that all Democrats in the United States are pedophiles, then the U.S. should no longer be recognized as a sovereign nation. State recognition isn't an inherent right that the U.S. is entitled to. Some countries don't recognize Israel, some don't recognize Palestine, some don't recognize Kosovo. And here, my suggestion is for the rest of the non-west to do the same to the United States, even if it provokes a world war.

       Oh so Marc Dutroux in Belgium and Jimmy Saville in the UK don't count? This thing is worldwide and pizzagate is just one of the many times when evidence has slipped through the cracks over the years.

       I never meant to imply that it was a U.S. only thing.It's a problem with the entire west. Whereas I know all about Jimmy Saville, I'm not familiar with Marc Dutroux though.

       Yeah sorry if that came off as pedantic. Marc Dutroux is the craziest one as far as I'm concerned, and that's considering Jimmy Saville probably fucked dead bodies in the morgue of the Hospital he payed for. Just look up Regina Louf on youtube or the Dutroux X dossier on google and you'll hear about horrific shit so beyond most people's threshold it'll make you wish it was fake. e.g. Hunting naked children on the property of a European Chateau, forcing children to kill other children, repeated forced abortions, kids locked in cages or forced to drink the blood of infants, etc...

       The allegations that the "incriminating images" allegedly from Alefantis IG account were actually taken from the FB accounts of people who Liked Comet's FB page doesn't bother you?

       Yes. Please don't do this. We screenshot his entire Instagram, archived it and Alefantis even confirmed in the NYT by saying we "stole
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       content."
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis is able to file DCMA's to try and take down any sites holding photos like
       <a href="https://imgur.com/moIGyDA">
        these.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The part which checks out is that the social media commenters are also real people. Alefantis and I have three mutuals on FB and one on Instagram. These people are very, very real.

       Infamous Hacker Anonymous made a friken video announcement about pizza gate. They don't play around. Just because you don't want to open your eyes and research into what's been discovered that is undeniable creepy, I know what I saw, things I that I wish that wasn't true. pizza gate is real.

       I trust Anonymous as far as I can throw them. Who the fuck is Anonymous really? We dont even know so yeah, you could be getting fed false information. Whatever it is, it definitely seems to have captured peoples attention. it feels like a honey pot to me. I wouldn't doubt that its distracting people from something more important. Or it will be used as a false front to justify tyranny.

       I know I will be down voted for this, but there was nothing on pizzagate...It made me laugh and as well thousands of other of my followers on another social platform. There nothing in Hillary's email. This is probably why Julian Assange went into hiding like he has done numerous times, he has nothing.
