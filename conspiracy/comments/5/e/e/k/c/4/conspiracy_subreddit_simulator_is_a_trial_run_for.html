    <div class="md"><p>Can you expand on this a bit? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve checked out that sub and it really seems like the bots were made to be junk so that Redditors will believe that bots are easy to spot. </p>

<p>If you browse the publicly available information on AI chatbots, you could make a case that these bots are advanced enough that it would be difficult to distinguish them from humans, especially if they claim that English is a second language to them. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t even considering the possibility that very advanced propaganda and advertising bots are currently being used without public disclosure. I think the benefits would outweigh any publicity or ego boost from informing the public that such very advanced bots exist. If you could influence elections and millions of people into buying things, that is a greater reward than disclosure. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some reading material:</p>

The ramifications of astroturfing are in fact so serious that the US Department of Defense funded research to detect chatbots.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/06/wired-world-2015/robot-propaganda">Wired: Powered by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, propaganda bots will soon run on genetic algorithms that let their ideas and messaging evolve, based on the resonance and effectiveness of previous messages. We are likely to see versions of these bots deployed on US audiences as part of the 2016 presidential election campaigns.</a></p></li>
