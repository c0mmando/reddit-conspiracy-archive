    <div class="md"><p>Have a look at what I posted on <a href="/r/AskAnAdmin">/r/AskAnAdmin</a> about the Pizzagate ban.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAnAdmin/comments/5eefax/i_have_a_lifeanddeath_question_for_reddit_admins/">https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAnAdmin/comments/5eefax/i_have_a_lifeanddeath_question_for_reddit_admins/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s being quite massively upvoted, didn&#39;t expect that on that inactive sub at all, just wanted admins to see this.</p>

<p>My guess is this ban was decided by executives (under pressure from whereever), the admins were against it. Techies and system admins tend to overwhelmingly support Assange, Snowden, online freedom, Aaron Swartz&#39; values. It can&#39;t be anyway else if you&#39;ve grown up with the Internet, open source, the &quot;hacker culture&quot;.</p>

Think about it, if Rick Santorum had had the same power as this pizza guy, his family name would probably not have been shat over.</p>

<p>So the online censorship of pizzagate right now is only step one to stop the bleeding, next comes the measures to prevents new accidents like these. Brace yourselves!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We just need to boycott Reddit altogether. Voat looks like a great alternative to Reddit, and they don&#39;t have all of the heavy-handed censorship. I&#39;ve really enjoyed this subreddit, and will continue to participate for awhile, but I eventually plan to move over to Voat exclusively in the near future. </p>

<p>For those who are interested here&#39;s a link to their <a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/">conspiracy subverse</a> (like a subreddit), and here&#39;s their <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">pizzagate subverse</a>. The site is organized just like Reddit, so it&#39;s easy to adapt.</p>

<p>They&#39;re experiencing heavy traffic with the influx of new people, and the site is having some trouble, but be patient. I invite everyone to join me over there and create a viable alternative to this site.</p>

<p>&quot;REDDIT ADMINS BANNING PEDO INVESTIGATION SUBS WITHOUT EXPLANATION, TWITTER PEDO ACCOUNTS STILL AT LARGE&quot; might be a good start.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks to the Streisand Effect finally hitting hard in T_D, found out something else.  They&#39;re not taking action on the &quot;pedofriends&quot; sub which I will definitely not be looking at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, after modding this sub I am more inclined to try and give them the benefit of the doubt. This shit is <em>hard</em>, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m getting paid for all this work or anything. People report comments and posts for the most ridiculous reasons, which makes going through the mod queue really, really tedious. The sort of people who frequent these kinds of subs tend to be more independent and paranoid as well (full disclosure, I fit this description too, so no judgment), which makes it really difficult to build consensus. Quite frankly, if I&#39;d known how difficult this would be I&#39;m like 50/50 on whether I&#39;d have even created the sub at all a month ago. I care about this subject though, so I&#39;m just trying to do my best. I am inclined to believe that the wikileaks mods are in a similar boat.</p>

<p>In my opinion, what really hurt them was heavy-handed moderation when things started blowing up for them, which hurt their standing/trust in the community. That&#39;s a difficult thing to rebuild. I hope that the openness and transparency here has bought us some capital in those areas.</p>

<p>You have to get 100 ccp or karma to downvote and post without restrictions. This is easy to do when you make a post in introductions. </p>

<p>Lots of people you may not like their views I am one of them. </p>

<p>Pizzagate has become a featured subverse now so safe to say they ain&#39;t gonna be banned as that is done by the site owner. Atko. </p>

<p>The site is wonky right now as they have a bug in the code. The site is off and on thruout the day. It only lasts for a minute. Mark sure you save your text in a self post as it might get eaten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i might be a little reddit stupid since i&#39;ve never been on a sub that got shut down but is there a way to retrieve your own posts after they disappear from your page?</p>

<p>i&#39;m glad there are other places to go but damn it, we fought through CTR this long and i just kind of want to make reddit hear this shit in every corner of the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, we shouldn&#39;t abandon Reddit immediately. I will keep posting here for awhile, but I will try to be more active over at Voat to help build the community. As for retrieving comments, I&#39;m guessing your only hope really is to find them on archived pages. Luckily we had a small warning before the subreddit was banned, and many people furiously started to archive. They will try to migrate all of those posts over to Voat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voat is subject to the exact same potential for censorship as Reddit is.  I&#39;d rather explore alternatives now instead of building up something huge again, only to have it fall to the same old mechanisms of censorship.</p>

<p>IMO it&#39;s a far better idea to support something where censorship is much more difficult to execute.  Pere-to-peer, maybe?  Something that relies on a kind of blockchain technology?  </p>

<p>Reddit is over 10 years old.  Surely SOMEONE can come up with something better.  If that option were out there, people would flock there in great numbers very quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that everyone in real power is involved. </p>

<p>Committing acts of child rape is probably an initiation ritual to gain access to the highest ranks of power. The candidate is filmed (consensually) while he&#39;s raping/torturing innocent children, and this film is then used as leverage to make him loyal to the agenda of the upper echelons of power. </p>

<p>If he some day decides to go against the agenda, the film (or still pictures) is leaked. That&#39;s why most members of the elite stay so loyal to their comrades. Most of them probably aren&#39;t even pedophiles in a sexual sense, but their lust for power is so great that they&#39;re willing to do literally anything -- including raping kids -- to be initiated into the highest ranks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it likely depends on how high up in the power structure we&#39;re talking about. Most senators and congressmen? Probably not. I would expect it&#39;s more the backroom players that rarely make newspapers, let alone headlines, but wield considerably more influence than your average no-name congressman. </p>

<p>But the other issues with your question is you might be looking at it backwards. If you take the general population, or even the population of people who aspire to high political power, the percentage willing to commit acts of pedophilia to get there is probably pretty low, under 1% even. But if you assume that to reach a certain level in government you must be willing to commit such acts, then it&#39;s entirely believable that those who are in positions of power are the ones who were willing to commit those acts. </p>

<p>Note that this is not in itself an argument that this is the case, but that it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be inconsistent with the results we see. Also consider that it might not start with acts of pedophilia. It could start with seeing who would commit a misdemeanor or minor felony on camera to get a lesser position. Maybe that&#39;s 10% of people. Then a slightly more serious felony, maybe 10% of those. You progressively weed people out until the only ones left are those so hungry for power that they&#39;d do the most despicable acts to get it. </p>

<p>Imagine democrats waging war on their own, not saying his name in media avoid you like the plague. Im a believer that the elite would spend 100million in a hick county just to make sure no wild sheep end up in the pen. </p>

<p>I believe democrats use a tactic of &#39;engineered incompetence&quot;, making sure no progressives end up anywhere.</p>

<p>Im fearful, i think bernie was great, but im also someone who believes bernie was blackmailed into submission</p>

<p>Anyone like Ning? i have a friend with a paid for site that&#39;s been mostly neglected for some time because the admins got busy &quot;real&quot; lives. They would be willing to host a bunch of stuff on there. It&#39;s a Christian site but anyone wanting to destroy evil would be welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty tough to get it down in a nutshell. There&#39;s loads of information but basically some Podesta emails were found with an odd code using the word &quot;pizza&quot; along with some other foods in nonsensical phrases. It was code that pedophiles use to communicate about their nasty dealings.</p>

<p>Connections lead to connections and now we have a pedo ring that reaches around the world involving Clinton et al. People have been searching up leads and evidence and investing this on the now banned r/pizzagate... one more place to get shut down actually since a couple of alt news sites also were crashed over this.</p>
