       I left Digg when it was time to and was a refugee.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then viewed this place as home.

      <p>
       It hasn't felt like a home for years, and its only getting worse.

       Eh, the alternatives are pretty damn bad currently. Most of them are complete copycats of Reddit with one or two having a big potential.

      <p>
       I don't see the Reddit Empire being shutdown anytime soon. Unless there are criminal things involved and they are forced to shutdown. The community alone can't do jack shit.

       I was thinking the exact same thing. This is how you become Digg. Go check out that site. Look what a piece of biased bullshit it is, its sickening.

       Man, where the fuck do we go. If we were to all flock to 4chan.org, it would only be a matter of time before they come for it too. Shit, the internet is becoming smaller and smaller.

       Probably waiting for voat to scale up their server power, they're getting swamped by this like last time there was an exodus. If you want voat to become your new home maybe slip them some money for server time.

       Not everyone follows pizzagate. Many don't care. Pizza gate subreddit has been around for 5 minutes.  I'm sure majority of reddit hasn't heard of it. Reddit will be fine for now

       Reddit might get sued over that particular bit of fake news. If I was the owner I'd line up people and places to sue. Like Bill Burr and Reddit. You're not allowed to destroy the lives of ordinary people for no reason.

       You can't destroy anyone lives period. Not just ordinary people. Besides ,pizza boy was and is involved in politics in a few positions. Another thing is that sure he can sue but doesn't guarantee victory. There's plenty of evidence against him. Even if there's some falsity in some claim there's no intentional malice from reddit.  There's more to it than to claim something is false then sue because of it.

       Well, if there's plenty of evidence you're safe. But the NYT says they're not. Maybe they're lying. But if they're not, you're screwed. You accuse someone innocent of running a pedophile ring just because they knew the brother of the head of the DNC, someone you don't know and know nothing about, just fake news, and get ready to give them all of your money. If it was me I'd be talking to lawyers. I'd end up owning Reddit.

       Reddit Isn't  accusing anyone of anything.  You're also assuming the information isn't real and that he's innocent. And no you're not going to get all their money and own reddit. That's just not how it works. It's not like T.V.

       well i know you're a leftist, but from what I understand about the Digg situation:
      </p>
      <p>
       there was a ron paul group there that was getting a lot of momentum.  that's not exactly the same time of "alt right" that you're seeing on reddit (which seems more like the coopted glenn beck teaparty directed at angry young white guys), though there is some crossover.
      </p>
      <p>
       then an agit-prop group (which I think is an israeli PR team) started a campaign against the ron paul folks.  There was vote gaming on both sides. Eventually it destroyed the site and they moved over here, where the PR team settled in the anti-conspiracy sub and the two sides continued to battle it out in subs like r/politics and r/news and r/worldnews.  My personal theory is that it's the same guys running the GMO propaganda, who went on to manage a lot of the Hillary PR.  It's well known that at least one of the actors from the anti-ron paul/ anti-conspiracy group created the Trump sub and managed a good deal of that side on reddit.

       I think this misses that there were TWO groups (and considering who was running the trump sub, one should question how much of the one was being steered by the other).
      </p>
      <p>
       The digg patriots were pushing libertarian/ paleoconservative, pro- ron paul stories to the front page.  But they didn't appear until 2 years AFTER the anti-conspiracy "bury brigade" which was pushing typical hasbarah (neocon and authoritarian leftist).
