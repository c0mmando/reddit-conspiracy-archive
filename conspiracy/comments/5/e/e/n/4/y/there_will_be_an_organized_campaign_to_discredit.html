       The removal of r/Pizzagate should be a sign to you that the operation is already underway. It won't be long before you will be afraid to mention any of it, for fear of looking like an idiot. It will work much the same as it did for the anti-vaxers. There will be all sorts of pressures put on you to stop talking about pizzagate and pedophiles. Editorials, comments, memes you name it, they will come at it with every tool available. The same CTR machinery is still in place and continues to work. Didn't it seem odd to you, that if any of this pizzagate stuff were true, that these people would be so bold as to use symbols in plain sight to communicate with fellow pedos? It's because they know they have the ultimate control over what we think and talk about. So they weren't worried. By 2017 you will be afraid to mention anything about any of this except to mock it and ridicule those that still try to talk about it. It's already begun. MSM will start mentioning it and what knuckleheads we are for believing in it. Soon your friends and people all around you will be parroting the MSM and the other efforts on social media. I wish you all could prove me wrong. But you won't. You will be assimilated.

       They can't silence this story. The global pedo ring has already started to crumble. There have been nearly 400 arrests made and 386 children rescued. This is a recent story and Australia, UK, and Canada have all been reporting on it. The USA obviously wants to keep the lid on it right now but the bust is taking place as we speak all over the world. It's only a matter of time before this all becomes common knowledge, globally.

       I agree, there have been many arrests in the US as well. This story broke shortly after the Podesta emails were released.

       I saw a story of a pedo bust in Canada. Apparently they investigate these guys for years and then when a scandal like this breaks, a bunch of them suddenly get arrested.

       It is ruining the credibility of our leaders and making everyone, everywhere wonder how much longer they will be in power. That is big news globally. In fact, I was just wondering yesterday if NATO was another front organization filled with these pedophiles. And if it was, what effect the news of it would have on everyone.

       How soon do you think it will be before people are checking on that angle . . . like now?

       You are likely right about the spin campaign about to unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't mean anyone has to comply with it.  Each of us as individuals has authority within ourselves to decide what actions we will take in response to any attempted smear campaign.  In fact, when one's thoughts, feelings, and ACTIONS are unified (whether for good or bad) that is a POWERFUL force.

       I will say this.  If you buy into the idea that nothing about the situation can ever be changed, tptb HAVE won because they have corrupted step 1 in the process - your thoughts.

       Ok, I wont.  I just wonder why people havent taken the law into their own hands you know?  This is some horrible stuff, the kind of stuff that infuriates people and makes them do violent things.  Im impressed no one has gone vigilante yet.  I mean, people have killed other people over far less heinous things.

       I agree, but inciting violence or committing acts of violence are the kinds of things that can escalate a situation to more dramatic levels. It's a known tactic in riots for "plants" to start doing that at peaceful protests.

       I have a (kinda) joke theory that this is all the first step in normalizing the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a month everyone will "know" about the theory and discredit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 20 years everyone will have "known" about these things taking place "forever" and it will be an open secret that politicians are pedos and possibly even cannibals.

       What other culture practices child sacrifice?
      </p>

       I don't know of any other one and I have been studying culture and religion for a long time.

       Most well known pagan religions were sacrificial in nature: Egyptian, Roman, Phoenician, Aztec, on and on. all of which did not discriminate age. there was no room for disabled or sick children in those days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even the Catholic/Christian based churches still have people "eating the body and drinking the blood of christ"
because Jesus sacrificed himself for us, and was resurrected. A story that originated in Pagan sacrifice rituals.

       Except very few people truly care about what the MSM now thinks, from everything I keep seeing.  The situation is nowhere near as dire as you might think.

       Pizzagate could have been a model opportunity to show what social media can do responsibly.  Instead, it's the same old Cointelpro tactics to let the criminals take the fall for arch-criminals,

       Don't be surprised if you find yourself getting referenced as the claasic example of infiltration among us.  Responsible people among the rest of us must distance ourselves from your incitement tactics.  You know, responsible people who believe in trial before murder, and all that "Rule of Law" cuckoldry.

       "Pizzagate" with its low standards for evidence &amp; high fever pitch of scattershot accusation against anyone who raises questions is doing a great job of discrediting decades of anti-pedophile work.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you believe in Pizzagate, then why do you NOT believe in COINTELPRO?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think elite pedos would not try to infiltrate
       <a href="/r/Pizzagate">
        /r/Pizzagate
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't
       <a href="/r/Pizzagate">
        /r/Pizzagate
       </a>
       be guarded against COINTELPRO?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand how COINTELPRO works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand that COINTELPRO does not work by denying the claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand that COINTELPRO does not work by "CTR" style attacking the claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       COINTELPRO infiltrates and destroys from within by embracing claims &amp; making them unreasonable to outside listeners; by raising the volume to shrieking lunacy; by using violence &amp; attempted intimidation instead of logic to persuade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling people "CTR" is just one example of a classic COINTELPRO dividing tactic on an issue that isn't only about Hillary.  Turning elite pedophilia into an anti-Hillary topic alienates half the audience.  Isn't elite pedophilia more important to cautiously dismantle than making the topic into an anti-Hillary entertainment?

       Pizzagate came from a good honest place... but hit a wall and collapsed in on itself... turned into an anti-Comet echo chamber... with a few too many urls leading to kiddy porn being posted. Pizzagate died because they couldn't follow the rules... or at least have management capable of doing so for them. They will do better on a site that will allow unfettered Doxxing... getting kicked offa reddit hurts... but it is all growing pains... in the end it will give them more power.

       The sub was a doxxing madhouse... Doxxing is something mandatory when conducting those kinds of investigations. They have an awesome idea... but just picked a bad site to conduct it at since reddit as whole does not allow doxxing.
