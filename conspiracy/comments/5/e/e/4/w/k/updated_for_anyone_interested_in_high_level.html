<p>Some answers asked and answered for TL:DR lurkers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:<strong>What do you know about Assange&#39;s whereabouts?
Was he captured or killed? etc.</strong></p>

<p>A:<em>Wikileaks is in a holding pattern because there are extensive negotiations going on with respect to who and how many people will be prosecuted by Trump. Assange has always been a creature of the CIA and policy has shifted as a result of the election, so they have to cool it until the dust settles and decisions are made about where to push the public attention next.</em></p>

<p>Q:<strong>Is Assange dead or alive?
How big is pizzagate and is everyone involved?</strong></p>

<p>A:<em>Assange is alive.</em></p>

<p><em>Pedophile rings are very extensive. In excess of 80% of people at the level of Congress, important think tanks, executive positions, leadership of major corporations are on video engaging in pedophilia, gay sex, orgies, etc. Blackmail of this nature is by far the strongest glue holding the old order together.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to develop a HLI reading list as well as pressure him to comment more on history. It&#39;s the best way to get insight into his motives as well as enhancing our own knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>What I have so far: The Socratic Dialogues by Plato, the Bible (specifically New Testament, especially apocrypha like the Gospel of Mary), Julian Jaynes&#39;s work on consciousness, and Henry Kissinger&#39;s work on diplomacy.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable sample of books—what I would call &quot;imaginative&quot; yet &quot;grounded&quot;. </p>

<p>I suggest we pressure HLI more on books/subjects that deal with:</p>

<p>1) nature of agency; </p>

<p>2) development of agency (historically and personally); </p>

<p>3) the state of the world and how it became that way (the role of the Romanovs, Kerensky, and Lenin in the Russian Revolution; the fall of the Roman Empire, the fall of Constantinople, the Black Plague, the Reformation and 30 Years War, the American Revolution and the early American republic (you remember my questions on James Madison from earlier... maybe we should ask why Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence if he was a conscientious traitor), the role of Napoleon, the role of Simon Bolivar, the role of Maximillan the Hapsburg emperor of Mexico, the German Empire pre-WWI in opposition to the British Empire, the development of Buddhism with Siddhartha Gautama (a member of three?) and the spread of Buddhism under Ashoka the Great (converted ruler like incoming 2024 candidate?) the role of Nero, Caracalla, and Diocletian in the fall of the Roman Empire, the Conquest of New Spain (was Hernan Cortès&#39;s success an example of agency and its development?), the publication of the Wealth of Nations, major scientific revolutions (need more info regarding the Newton v. Leibniz struggle), George H.W. Bush&#39;s rise to power, etc.);</p>

<p>4) worthwhile knowledge to be gleaned from humanities (landmark books... also anything that could be good pre-reading to a new set of federalist papers... start throwing out game changers at him like <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, <em>The Republic</em>, <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, <em>Metamorphosis</em>, <em>Ulysses</em>, <em>Faust</em>, anything by Nietzsche, <em>Being and Time</em>, etc.), social sciences (where can we go in economics and psychology to develop a better understanding of agency? certainly not Wilhelm Reich, but then who?), and physical sciences (what is worthwhile to know for the average person seeking agency?); </p>

<p>5) general self-development (refining mathematical ability, nutrition, career choices, artistic expression, cultivating vision, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You most certainly are not. I&#39;ve been lurking this thread and directing others to it for a while. Halfway through <em>Origins of Consciousness</em> and have started reading around some of the other rabbit holes his answers take you down. With Assanges interview yesterday, as well as Erdogans power consolidation in Turkey, it seems his predictions are fairly accurate. The big one is next years major crash and further down the line, their candidate insert in 2024 election cycle.
Until he next appears, I think then best we can do is help the thread get further traction, learn from the sources he&#39;s suggested, discuss &amp;amp; exchange amongst ourselves and generally maintain a level of engagement around all of this. </p>

<p>You will find gems like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: You&#39;re a Marxist. You only wish to strengthen America in order to accelerate and solidify opposition to her. I can see right through this shit.</p>

<p>A: No, we are most definitely not Marxists. Marx and his ideology are products of British intelligence, one of the most evil modern influences.</p>

<p>Q: What did you guys think when the regime you oppose introduced communism? </p>

<p>A: Synthetic ideology to co-opt American style nationalism. Marx and Engels went to work on this sort of thing almost immediately after the American revolution and that is much more than a historical accident. </p>

<p>Q:Was Hitler a good goy or did he actually declare war on the elite? </p>

<p>A: Hitler was very much controlled. </p>

<p>Q:What was Hitler&#39;s intended purpose? A big baddie to justify further globalization and consolidation of power in the form of the EU etc.?</p>

<p>A: Much of continental Europe was headed in the direction of the American revolution in the 19th century. The wars there are largely efforts at disrupting this and controlling the spread of productive nationalism, especially in regards to independent financial stability.</p>

<p>A: History books and /pol/ are both wildly inaccurate on Hitler.</p>

<p>A: Hitler was put into power by the British. If you go review his speeches, the rhetoric actually started out as anti-masonic more so than anti-jewish, then was subtly shifted over time. That by itself tells you that what you&#39;re seeing is someone who was put into place to co-opt organic movements. The sorts of things that Hitler was put into place to achieve were: (1) discrediting nationalism, (2) discrediting armed opposition to organized conspiracies, (3) destroying nation states, (4) centralizing financial control </p>

<p>Q: What was the deeper purpose of the overthrow of Russian monarchy I.e communist revolution? Who was behind it.</p>

<p>A: Russia had a long history of supporting our American enterprise. Same reason Germany was demolished repeatedly. These actions represent direct assaults against our own efforts by the old order.</p>

<p>This is what really sucks. He tells us to be specific but... specific on what? One should be able to recommend books on different subjects without going too specific right? Reminds me of my professors</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. Also interesting would be asking about the Frankfurt School. I&#39;m of the opinion that, while many leftists today are badshit insane, Theodor Adorno was surprisingly sober. I read <em>Minimalia Moralia</em>, it it seems to warn about the altering of society via mass commoditization as inevitable. It seems that he dislikes capitalism for promoting degeneracy. </p>

<p>While Theodor Adorno is only one guy, it would be interesting to ask questions about the intellectual backstory to modern times. Are any selections worth reading? Was the Frankfurt School full of useful idiots? Insidious conspirators? Well-meaning leftists? Unrelated to the old order and relatively unimportant third party agents that are unfairly maligned? </p>

<p>No problem dude. Try to keep an open mind when reading the threads. If you really think on the answers, they begin to make sense. </p>

<p>You should have dropped a question. I was able to ask quite a few questions on some stuff that came to mind at that moment(see the 11/22 post). HLIanon said he will be back sometime in this week. He usually starts his Question Session around night/midnight. Try to jot down some questions you have in mind so that when you do drop in, you can instantly ask away. </p>

<p>Some of his claims are difficult to verify but the others can looked into and verified. You&#39;ll have look into what he says rather than instantly go &quot;LARP!&quot;. His posts have been insightful in giving hope in what a person could do compared to what r/Conspiracy has talked about in some threads. </p>

<p>I&#39;m unsure about FBIanon. You&#39;ll have to search for the third AMA on archive4plebs. For some reason there is multiple versions.

    <div class="md"><p>I have read High Level Insider&#39;s answers and Jaynes&#39; book. A couple of thoughts:</p>

<p>1) I&#39;d love to see much more background information about the activities of &quot;Three&quot; throughout the ages, some evidence about the continuity of the &quot;good priests&quot;. If there is no credible evidence based on historical records presented, then I have troubles to accept the claims about their identity and intentions. Because basically anyone could pop up now, hijack some historical personalities or some enlightenment activities and claim: they were &quot;our&quot; members and &quot;our&quot; actions (see below). Some concise and referenced TL,DR needed because the amount of records and books is probably too vast, really, who has time to sift through all that considering that much has been edited or misinterpreted. I remain sceptical until I see more evidence.</p>

<p>I am referring to these HLI&#39;s claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve been around a few thousand years and pop up as agitators towards greater freedom, awareness, progress. We monkey wrench the system when it is needed.</p>

<p>We are the joker in the night, the wildcard that carries the light.</p>

<p>We feel guided by a hidden hand, divinely inspired at times.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t ever &quot;control&quot; either Christianity or Islam. We have throughout history injected big ideas like this ...to nudge mankind in the right direction</p>

<p>We created Islam to inject a warrior mentality into Christiandom against the influence of Paul/Roman branch that was taking root.</p>

<p>We created the Illuminati.</p>

<p>It is only in the modern era that we could conceive of programmatic seizure of power with the ability to leverage scientific ability to overcome our inferior numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) I like the following, if it represents their true aims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The big picture is, very roughly, that consciousness was loss in catastrophic events in the past. Evidence of civilization remained, consciousness was regained, people realized that it existed before and was lost. Mystery schools form to try to protect against that happening again but are eventually corrupted by ideas like the need for masters and slaves, therefore justifying an effort to keep most people unenlightened, unconscious, downtrodden. <strong>We&#39;re a splinter group opposed to that and seek the highest elevation of each individual.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) In my opinion, this is the most amazing and significant statement / explanation I have found in HLI&#39;s answers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Combine the idea of coherence in consciousness with a very popular figure. Their identity is literally passed down through the generations. As someone with agency, it&#39;s possible to adopt an identity that exists in the collective memory. You can carry this sort of thing into thinking of a second coming of the Christian messenger as being a quite literal thing without invoking ideas like God inseminating a random woman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) Concerning the future plans I&#39;d love to hear (Darkomantis, please add these questions to your list)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If all knowledge should be free, what is the Three&#39;s opinion on patent laws?</p></li>
<li><p>HLI said: &quot;We are inclined towards socialization of novel input resources while leaving most of the existing way things work untouched, including existing ownership claims.&quot;  Does it mean that the &quot;bad&quot; elites owning vast assets (land, infrastructure etc.) at present will be able / allowed to keep them in future so nothing much will change, there will still be some &quot;royal families&quot; with more power?</p></li>
<li><p>Matthew 24:7-8: &quot;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.&quot; What does he mean by &quot;birth&quot; when speaking of earthquakes?</p></li>
<li><p>HLI said: &quot;Our interpretation of Christianity does not resemble anything you will find in the churches.&quot; Does the Pope know that he is a &quot;false prophet&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Who or what are the watchers?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting reading for sure, though in Jaynes&#39; book you won&#39;t find the complex picture of &quot; the phenomena of coherence in consciousness&quot;  and the danger of &quot;cyclical loss&quot; that HLI has been trying to present. It is an intro only. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could you explain what is being talked about here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multilayer meaning. Here an analogy (not a parallel, mind you). HLI probably does not keep honeybees, if he did, he might use a beehive colony as an example if he cared to expand on the idea. If the bee Queen is lost (too old, dies, is killed) the worker bees quickly find a way to nurture a new one since they know how vital it is for their own existence.

<p>An interesting reading for sure, though in Jaynes&#39; book you won&#39;t find the complex picture of &quot; the phenomena of coherence in consciousness&quot; and the danger of &quot;cyclical loss&quot; that HLI has been trying to present. It is an intro only.</p>

<p>Hmmm.. Are you thinking of getting the JJ collection to see more of the work or is that enough for you? Also, are you trying to construct the &quot;phenomena of coherence in consciousness&quot; or no? Seems like you&#39;re trying to find something.. possibly something else.</p>

<p>Multilayer meaning. Here an analogy (not a parallel, mind you). HLI probably does not keep honeybees, if he did, he might use a beehive colony as an example if he cared to expand on the idea. If the bee Queen is lost (too old, dies, is killed) the worker bees quickly find a way to nurture a new one since they know how vital it is for their own existence. The new Queen kind of emerges from their collective beehive memory.</p>

<p>If anything, I would look more into the &quot;phenomena of coherence in consciousness&quot; and what it would mean when it happens, what &quot;life of its own&quot; it takes.
Think a bit what coherence means, e.g... coherent light =&gt; laser.</p>

<p>You are referring to a comment that I deleted a short time after I posted it. I erroneously thought that these are the missing threads, but no, we&#39;ve seen them already. No sense in pursuing this &quot;nuked issue&quot; anymore. </p>

<p>Much more interesting will be to watch how HLI goes on with the Question Sessions (if at all). He is kind of special, I&#39;d love to chat with him, but participating in such a discussion is not feasible for me unless I am notified in advance. Thanks again for collecting the questions!</p>

<p>Funny indeed. High Level Insider had mentioned bicameral mind and used Michelangelo&#39;s painting &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot; image months before the TV series Westworld premiered in October 2016.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/14264-bicameral-mind-westworld-julian-jaynes-origin-of-consciousness-hbo">https://www.inverse.com/article/14264-bicameral-mind-westworld-julian-jaynes-origin-of-consciousness-hbo</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fans just got a peak through that haze in Episode 3, “The Stray,” when Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), the show’s modern Prometheus, name-checked Julian Jaynes’s theory of the “Bicameral Mind.” For an instant, the show was laid bare. 
In introducing the concept, Westworld’s writers make it clear that the show’s artificially intelligent robots aren’t breaking out of pre-programmed bondage because of a glitch or a virus — as was the case in the original film. They’re breaking out because of their exposure to increasingly complex language. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talk about hidden details. It’s no wonder that Anthony Hopkin’s Dr. Ford points to Michelangelo’s painting “The Creation of Adam” and tells the robo prairie girl about the hidden brain in the art which took someone 500 years to discover in the painting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Episode 10 of Westworld closes out the season with a bloody robot rebellion. Dolores, one of the amusement park’s android hosts, kills the park’s remaining founder, Robert Ford. But in the buildup before she puts a gun to his head, Ford subjects Dolores to an incongruous art history lesson. He explains that Michelangelo’s painting, the Creation of Adam, contains a hidden symbol: the shape of a brain outlined by God’s billowing shroud. Ford’s message seems to be that consciousness is the true gift that a creator can give its creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The theory of the bicameral mind is name-checked in the third episode of Westworld, and a character immediately suggests that it’s been debunked. Has it? It’s really never been debunked, just ignored. That’s how I would put it. It’s definitely not mainstream, and it’s definitely not considered something that is widely accepted in academia. What are the key differences between a bicameral mind and a modern human brain? When we’re talking about the bicameral mind, we’re talking about this period after language develops, but before we learn consciousness. In lieu of an introspective mind-space, we’re hearing a commanding voice when we have decisions to make. As language gets more complex through metaphor, we develop the ability to have introspection and little by little, the hallucinations are suppressed</em></p>

<p>Not sure. I don&#39;t know who he is. </p>

<p>Conspiracy members were analyzing Obama&#39;s birth certificate a long time ago when it first came out. A lot of people didn&#39;t notice that Trump was helping with the Psyop in talking about the Birth certificate (to garner attention) a few days before the Osama Bin Laden raid and ended up quieting everyone down about the certificate. You can&#39;t say Obama is Osama if all over the news we hear Osama is killed right? Perfect psyops in my opinion. </p>

<p>A lot of people share your thoughts too. I think one of the more important things to get out of it is that there is more out there than what we previously thought. We need to improve our lives to the point where we can comfortably and reliably do independent research to not only look at the geopolitical/political agenda and events happening but also what we can be able to achieve grounded in reality. </p>

<p>Possibly. I&#39;m not sure who operates the disinfo campaign network but the CIA is probably one of the bigger groups heading it. </p>

<p>Yup! Especially the part that the OSS was the prequel of the CIA and they were both trained by the MI6 which is the intelligence group of the British. Really puts things into perspective. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t recall him being wrong about who would get elected as he didn&#39;t say [X] would be elected. He had mentioned multiple times that Trump had way more support of the people than Hillary even though the Elite wanted Hillary Clinton as the president among things that he said.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there is a lot of people that are hoping Trump has a good heart, but from what we&#39;ve seen so far, it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case from the picks he has. Though High Level Insider did say that we can be able to pressure him to do the things we need. We&#39;ll see what happens in the future. The prediction HLIanon said was that there will be a crash either in the summer of 2017 or when Trump&#39;s policies come out. </p>

<p>Oh okay, I don&#39;t know if you saw it but I added a new one which is the 11/26 thread. Came into the thread too late so I couldn&#39;t get a lot of questions in. I was trying to tie in two other people who said they were interested but it&#39;s like they either didn&#39;t get a notification or they ignored it.</p>

<p>What part is disinfo? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a step back for a moment. The default opinion of the majority of r/C believes Assange/Wikileaks is sacrosanct. Think about the possibility of TPTB creating a limited-hangout. They already enslaved the masses have they not?</p>

<p>Witness protection in some Asian country? That makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>If we find out it&#39;s true and he is CIA (no evidence so far)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Julian Assange is the one who has done work with the intelligence community before and called 9/11 a false conspiracy in an interview in 2010. If you&#39;ve looked into 9/11 then that should raise an immediate red flag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a huge red flag for me also.  But I always considered that wikileaks was just trying to distance itself from this narrative since they didn&#39;t have anything bulletproof to support it ... and also 911truth has a tendency to shut people down.  I know this firsthand.</p>

<p>I have few friends now irl because I refuse to accept the 911 story and I&#39;m not afraid to say anything about it to anyone.  This has gotten me in trouble with friends and family.  That said, I&#39;ve recently looked into this whole thing and I&#39;ve come out of it as proud that I&#39;ve lost friends.  I am not always right about stuff, sometimes very wrong, but about 911 I&quot;m not wrong.  Neither are any of us here.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t really my friend if they weren&#39;t wlling to borrow my brain for a minute and listen to me in earnest, but instead relied on the opinions of scumbag narcissists they dont&#39; know personally, who&#39;ve lied to them so deeply for 15 yrs... and committed treason trying to steal the election.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised when 911 truth happens if some of these &#39;old friend&#39; jumped off a bridge.</p>

<p>So when it finally does happen and they msm has no choice but to announce 911 was an inside job, I&#39;ll be in a tugboad with nets to catch people as they fall towards the sea.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have a care packages for the surviors...containing, one large lolipop, a copy of &quot;other shit we were right about.PDF&quot;, a compilation written by <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>; a puppy; a blanket; an illegal copy of &quot;They live&quot; and square foot gardening brocure</p>

<p>What you get from it depends on you. You might be skeptical, but I implore you to read the posts with an open mind, and you might find truths you didn&#39;t know about or were on the fence about.

<p>They have plans and goals. Supposedly, the group has a lot mathematicians (so they can crunch a lot of numbers and calculate what things are possible or not) and there is plans set-up to help restore and build the U.S among other things.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Hillary is dead post 9/11/2016. She had serious health issues but I don&#39;t think it was enough to warrant death anytime recently. Did she use a double? Probably. I haven&#39;t looked into that. </p>

<p>Do you mean the 9/11 Question Session? Or the entirety of the threads? If you mean the entirety of the threads, then I think the anon is legit and what he says makes sense. I felt a lot of hope reading through them and I also felt that there is a lot more to achieve/gain in the real world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of focusing on &#39;doom porn&#39; and all the bad things: 9/11, pedophilia, false flags, etc, we need to be promoting the solutions to our problems.  A Orbital space ring elevator is feasible today with about one year&#39;s military spending and would pay for itself in 2-3 years from the vast amounts of solar energy we would be able to harness outside the atmosphere. This will make us no longer dependent on oil and will allow a gigantic increase in GDP. We can pay off the national debt, decrease income taxes to 0, and everyone can have a better lifestyle. That&#39;s why he cares about the space elevator. It&#39;s a positive promise for the future, not scary doom porn about evil elites. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to finally hear someone who understands the way of speaking and the manner of which the anon speaks on various topics. Almost everyone I showed it to on reddit has instantly shouted out &quot;LARP!&quot;. If we did find someone who knew a lot of topics we were having trouble knowing or didn&#39;t even know about, then we would think whatever he was saying is both non-fiction and fiction. </p>

<p>And what did I make of him? I think he is legit. I feel that what he says makes a lot of sense and I have talked to a professor on the space elevator claim and my professor said that we have the ability to create one from talking with colleagues from a time ago. Also, he didn&#39;t bullshit on 9/11 which most anons do(even FBIanon bullshitted by saying Mossad did it) and claimed Bush and CIA ties to the British which I remember some members of r/C talking about this a long time ago. I didn&#39;t save it unfortunately. </p>

<p>It might take a lot more time before High Level Insider gains traction. Nobody on Reddit knows about HLIanon... Which I found odd since he started around the same time as FBIanon yet only FBIanon was paraded around both Reddit and /pol/. Strange right? I can post the HLIanon threads more often as more of his Questions Sessions pop up, but a lot of people will think of him as a LARPer. Also, I&#39;m in the same boat as you, as I thought I was getting carried away but I feel something about this anon.</p>

<p>I felt like I had a lot more hope after going through his posts than the general consensus of the r/C sub. I&#39;m not saying r/C is bad but... a lot of people are under the impression that we can&#39;t do shit and the only thing we can do is just read/research things and then continue on miserably with knowledge of things. With what HLIanon, I think there is a lot we are missing out on and that there is more to achieve than we believe. </p>

<p>Wholeheartedly agree. There&#39;s been a lot of traction since this originally posted but no new threads.

<p>Same here. I mean the idea that there could be such a group isn&#39;t impossible. It&#39;ll be interesting if 8 years from, the HLIanon actually turned out to be completely honest in saying that his group is inserting a candidate into the Presidential cycle. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re to take the possibility that the royal family never truly lost their power, then it&#39;s quite possible the Queen and other family members were &quot;evil&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read about half of these now. I&#39;m still working on it, but I&#39;ve got kids so...yea. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty impressed at the possibility, but I think a reasonable possibility exists that he is just very smart (and perhaps bored) or has hidden motives.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>smart and bored : If you recall bad self eater, that guy put considerable effort into what he did and fooled MANY, this could be just another example (perhaps with or without an agenda). Also, I&#39;ve read many of the things he has wrote about...the queen being in control and Barack Obama (his name translated, blah blah) to name a few. These theories are very easy to find online. Also, some answers he gives are only yes/no or vague which could leave room to wiggle and when something doesn&#39;t happen (like pence vs Pentagon) it can be easily explained away.</p></li>
<li><p>hidden motives: what struck me as odd, despite pushing a more positive outlook...in just half the threads I have read he has mentioned agency and (specifically mentioned three times total that I have seen) how one could easily bring down the government by taking out the power grid with snipers at a low cost. It could simply be an example he is giving and not implanting ideas, however for someone posting against the regime and not in favor of revolution without a good alternative (which obviously does not exist right now unless he knows something) that is a pretty risky thing to suggest repeatedly in my opinion. He hasn&#39;t given very many (if any) other specific examples of agency or alternatives because we have to ask...so why the exception? Perhaps I missed other examples.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While it may seem I&#39;m against this guy, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m going to read through the rest and see what I can find.</p>

<p>I think time will be the greatest indicator of whether he is a LARPer or not. We should think of ways to both debunk and prove what he says. Below are a few ways off the top of my head...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if he is as high level as he says, and he did say people know what he says and indicated Trump gave the birther press conference in response to one of the threads...we should watch for other indicators of the press or politicians reacting to what he says. </p></li>
<li><p>see if things he says transpire</p></li>
<li><p>fact check or investigate his claims to the best of our ability</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, he sends a good message of thinking outside our little windows and he is right that nothing we do matters without a better alternative regardless if our theories are true or not. If pizzagate is as encompassing as many assess, we do need an alternative, a full draining of the swamp. Also, how do we know it ends there? What more do we not know that has been covered for so long? Much of what he says makes since if you think about it.</p>

<p>My questions for you: </p>

<p>The most recent thread I read was the one before 9/11 (edit: 8/31 I think or 9/1), and he claimed false flag cyberterrorism would occur soon, like a hack in a dam and that thought crimes would begin to be persecuted. He also mentioned something big at the end of September. Have we seen anything that correlates to this? I can&#39;t think of anything off the top of my head. </p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, I&#39;m all over the place. One thing I did think was odd, if he was going for a wow factor (LARPing) is he discounts CERN, aliens, and other things I&#39;ve seen on here. Perhaps it&#39;s because he is right (and perhaps it&#39;s only human for us to think the worst when we are faced with a mystery) or because those rabbit holes he doesn&#39;t want us to follow. Regardless, if he was just bullshitting, saying these things don&#39;t exist or there is no conspiracy there doesn&#39;t gain him attention if that is what he is seeking.</p>

<p>smart and bored : If you recall bad self eater, that guy put considerable effort into what he did and fooled MANY, this could be just another example (perhaps with or without an agenda). Also, I&#39;ve read many of the things he has wrote about...the queen being in control and Barack Obama (his name translated, blah blah) to name a few. These theories are very easy to find online. Also, some answers he gives are only yes/no or vague which could leave room to wiggle and when something doesn&#39;t happen (like pence vs Pentagon) it can be easily explained away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would suck so hard if that was the case... I fucking hate people who trick people because they&#39;re bored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hidden motives: what struck me as odd, despite pushing a more positive outlook...in just half the threads I have read he has mentioned agency and (specifically mentioned three times total that I have seen) how one could easily bring down the government by taking out the power grid with snipers at a low cost. It could simply be an example he is giving and not implanting ideas, however for someone posting against the regime and not in favor of revolution without a good alternative (which obviously does not exist right now unless he knows something) that is a pretty risky thing to suggest repeatedly in my opinion. He hasn&#39;t given very many (if any) other specific examples of agency or alternatives because we have to ask...so why the exception? Perhaps I missed other examples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You make a good point. When people did ask to provide more examples, he pointed back to the sniper example. Said that it&#39;s about &quot;proving your own merit&quot; to make your own leverage on your own from that example, more specifically talking about weapon leverage instead of data leverage. Not sure if this is a bad thing or a good thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it may seem I&#39;m against this guy, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m going to read through the rest and see what I can find.</p>

<p>I think time will be the greatest indicator of whether he is a LARPer or not. We should think of ways to both debunk and prove what he says. Below are a few ways off the top of my head...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re providing good points. I&#39;ll have to see whether or not the Anon is true in time by his future claims (i.e. Assange appearing again sometime after or around Trump&#39;s first day in office, Financial crash being in the summer time of 2017 or when Trump makes his policies, etc)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, he sends a good message of thinking outside our little windows and he is right that nothing we do matters without a better alternative regardless if our theories are true or not. If pizzagate is as encompassing as many assess, we do need an alternative, a full draining of the swamp. Also, how do we know it ends there? What more do we not know that has been covered for so long? Much of what he says makes since if you think about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As others have said in the threads, HLIanon doesn&#39;t seem particularly focused on helping root out corruption. He says it depends on what the goals are, like with the Clinton Foundation research(which ended up dying down). HLIanon saying that we need an alternative is a true statement. People are motivated by what is possible and what they&#39;re being cheated out of. I can&#39;t agree enough but yet we don&#39;t have those types of discussions at all in r/Conspiracy (or at least since I&#39;ve been there starting around June/July).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most recent thread I read was the one before 9/11 (edit: 8/31 I think or 9/1), and he claimed false flag cyberterrorism would occur soon, like a hack in a dam and that thought crimes would begin to be persecuted. He also mentioned something big at the end of September. Have we seen anything that correlates to this? I can&#39;t think of anything off the top of my head. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Soon&quot;. We could possibly say that the Financial Crash is soon. I doubt they would pull a cyberterrorism event right now as Obama is almost exiting the office and Soros and other shadowy figures are doing post-presidential operations to work up another psyops/false flag(s). As for something big happening at the end of September.. hmmm... I&#39;m not too sure. u/elnegroik and u/RunningDarkly ; <strong>Was there anything big that happened around the end of September?</strong> Only thing to note was the Birther conference from Trump but that was around the middle of the month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I&#39;m all over the place. One thing I did think was odd, if he was going for a wow factor (LARPing) is he discounts CERN, aliens, and other things I&#39;ve seen on here. Perhaps it&#39;s because he is right (and perhaps it&#39;s only human for us to think the worst when we are faced with a mystery) or because those rabbit holes he doesn&#39;t want us to follow. Regardless, if he was just bullshitting, saying these things don&#39;t exist or there is no conspiracy there doesn&#39;t gain him attention if that is what he is seeking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm... The ET topic is an inflated one. Rockefellers have been supporting the ET truth movement, so I&#39;m not keen on &quot;whistleblowers/witnesses&quot; who talk about Aliens/UFOs. Also, the ET narratives that circle around make absolutely no sense in terms of what an actual intelligent being, who is capable of traveling galaxies or solar systems away/high tech communication devices or weapons, would do if they&#39;re contact with earth.</p>

<p>Hmm, rethinking, your right not enough for a whole sub and really no need for a new thread.

<p>(Piggybacking from above comment w/ my thoughts on HLI): I don&#39;t think that its that he is against rooting out corruption or finds it unimportant, more that there is a bigger picture than what most that research things like pizzagate, ect think about, like consequences. I got about as close as you can get to watching Syria unfold during the Arab spring for the first six months of it. I doubt a lot of what I saw now, because who the fuck knows what was real, however when the opposition needed to unify and agree they couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t.

<p>I mentioned bad self eater because HLI said it was in response to one of their outreach programs, he referred back to the 8/31 &amp; 9/1 threads for proof, but I didn&#39;t see anything.

<p>Latest I was reading is he said he predicted the turkey coup ahead of time. However, I didn&#39;t see where any of his comments before that were anymore insightful then guessing.

From my research I would agree with HLI on that one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try and easily compile his comments to people&#39;s questions, has anyone done that? I thought I read that someone was.</p>

<p>Questions I would have for HLI off the top of my head: </p>

<p>1) What are your thoughts/advice on public, private, and home schooling? Also, any advice on parenting to raise children in this age?</p>

<p>2) You say Obama is one of the two beasts in Revelation meant to fulfill prophecy, yet also claim your organization is going to help turn America around and we are going to have this brighter future of space elevators and no aging, ect. How does this fit? Surely it&#39;s a contradiction? Or if Revelation is real, can its events be stopped or postponed? Please explain.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll think of more later :) thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: Looking into we are three...I found something I didn&#39;t realized was a thing. Have you ever heard of a three percenter? Look up we are 3%...

<p>He did say his family helped fund the American Revolution...</p>

<p>Edit 2: latest odd nugget: (in 3rd 7/13): The best thing you can do for your child is move far away from civilisation. You see all around us there are microwaves that infiltrate our minds and bodies. This is why this generation inundated with technology has become what it is. 
If you cannot move I suggest a layer of tin foil around your house.</p>

<p>But in order to have discussions talking about alternatives and potential solutions, the use of stickies is required...

<p>I think it was said that the way Syria went down, it dragged on more than what it was supposed to and that even though on the surface it seems like TPTB didn&#39;t finish their main goals, it doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t accomplish their secret goals. </p>

<p>Hmmm.. If we did find something potentially damaging, there is a chance for it to spill uncontrollably. We would have to operate as a deeper group in order to achieve anything. We can&#39;t know for sure if HLIanon is 100% legit but we can make out that we need to evolve in a more deeper and secret group in order to gain strength and momentum. </p>

<p>Not sure what Bad self eater is. Could you explain?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m guessing his predictions are more as just information trails. For example, him talking about who would win the election. He didn&#39;t say &quot;I predict Trump will win&quot; but instead listed points like: Trump having huge support/Clinton having abysmal support after the Democratic election, Trump not setting up as much poll watchers as he should, etc. What do you make of this? </p>

<p>General feeling? I could say that there could be things that we&#39;re being mislead to believe and/or us being stuck in &quot;mainstream&quot; views even though we feel we&#39;re uncovering things behind the curtain. Wikileaks is one thing that r/Conspiracy heavily feels is sacrosanct and that there is no possibility of it and Assange being part of the CIA/TPTB&#39;s machine. After going through the HLI threads, I feel that Wikileaks is <strong>NOT</strong> a true organization in terms of actually helping society in any way. Did their leaks help though? Yes, you could say that. I need to participate in another Question Session to ask why Wikileaks intentionally leaked the pizza emails. I don&#39;t think they were just a coincidence.</p>

<p>That may take quite a long time unless you have a program or specific way to be able to compile the posts. Copy and pasting isn&#39;t very time-considerate unless you know what you&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>Alright, have it inside my word doc. If you want to give a few more, just let me know. I&#39;m going to make sure to submit all the questions everyone else gave me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m unsure. I think it has to do with only 3%(?) of the colonists having helped in the revolution. I think their group was way smaller than that though. </p>

<p>I have been wondering about this as well. He said this (9/1):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is demonstrably false. I told you about the Turkey coup ahead of time, told you who did it and why, and that it was leading to a big push into Syria by Turkey for starters - all of which has proven true. You can get much more info from me if you ask the right questions. </p>

<p>7/10: &quot;Anon, do you honestly believe these people are serious?
Think about what a joke it is to say let&#39;s stop having the CIA traffic drugs - if that is as far as you go. You&#39;ve just put a serious kink in the monetary order without any ideas about how to compensate for that.
<strong>We let your politicians</strong> run drugs and have orgies with children because they have a functioning methodology of governance and you don&#39;t. &quot;</p>

<p>another 7/10:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The watchers are interested in order, not chaos. <em>We don&#39;t seek chaos to create order, we create order out of chaos.</em>
For the most part we are compensating for your flaws, not scheming against you. You are dangerous to yourself.

<p>Question: FBIanon mentioned that Israel would potentially nuke the US.if all the clinton-related info would be released to the public. Looking at the latest news it seems Turkey-Russia have been warming up a lot, maybe indicating that Turkey is about to jump ship. However Israel as well now tried to reconcile with Turkey and bibi has already visited Russia more than 3 times in the near past. On top of that Turkey today said they want to improve their relationship with Syria as well. What is going on? Is Israel actually selling out ISIS+US and joining team red? Putin announced he would send a warship to wipe out ISIS and Obama has been taking some steps as well so the future does not seem very bright.</p>

<p>Answer: There is great disruption in the force, so to speak. People anticipate a lot of change in the near future and hedging bets. It&#39;s a dangerous but opportune time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For Syria, I don&#39;t think they completed their goals, but may have changed them in response to their failure. I agree with HLI that they are reactionary vs forward leaning. Those around me at the time assessed if the protests hit Aleppo the regime would fall and many didnt think it would take longer than 6 months. That narrative was pushed until it was obvious the cockroach would live on. Obviously, that didn&#39;t occur and extreme factions took advantage of the situation. It is my opinion that the US probably did create ISIS, perhaps because it is better to have an enemy you are controlling than one that you are not. But, to talk more intelligently on that I&#39;d have to look more into it all.</p>

<p>Bad self eater was an anti abortion campaign that circulated this sub in late August and ended Sept 14th. Bills with occult symbols were mysteriously found and traced to a website with a countdown clock. Many speculated why, and it turned out to be an anti abortion video basically claiming abortion was the real evil/child sacrifice and we were all still asleep even though we felt awake. You can find the bad self eater sub on Reddit and the video online probably (NSFW). If it&#39;s connected, I assess it&#39;s a loose connection.</p>

<p>For the turkey coup, I found something interesting. Another anon asked on part 2 of 7/13 (timestamp 16:14) why yesterday&#39;s threads were deleted. I wonder if that is what we are missing?</p>

<p>Also, looking into the end of September there are a few things that could be what he was referring to. It may make the anti-KSA narrative look plausible (except the 28 pages were released first, so I am not sure). </p>

<p>More questions for him: (Yes strange I know, I&#39;m more interested in his response then the answers)</p>

<p>Have you heard of M81 (bode&#39;s galaxy)? I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s really tiny. Does this mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Is there a crypt at Hylton castle?</p>

<p>What do you mean? Brzezinski was involved in helping train the muslims and &quot;rebels&quot;. You haven&#39;t noticed that for the past two decades, we&#39;ve been helping &quot;rebels&quot; and training them too? Don&#39;t you find it strange that Al Queada &quot;died&quot; with Obama &quot;killing&quot; Osama Bin Laden and somehow an even more radical group (ISIS) emerges afterward that results in more intervention into the ME? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Maybe. Some threads do get suddenly deleted. Archive4pleb would and probably did pick it up. The only thing to look for most likely is if HLI had posted in /cfg/ threads before 7/10. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t exactly mention Obama is Osama until the 9/11 thread. The first of responses, he said that the raid was fake and that Osama wasn&#39;t killed there.

    <div class="md"><p>no, I think he is being serious, the &quot;obama&quot; name thing is messy, ..James Corbett has stuff on that, the Barry Soetero version.. the point HLI makes a few times is there are several things that are out there (like the Hilary logo) that are both smug/secrets for the &quot;elite&quot;. This does jive as within the elite circle it probably gave lots of confidence as in &quot; see we can do this and they don&#39;t even realize it&quot;, which would give them confidence/strength , but well as in such things is a double edged sword (as we become aware, we all the more pissed off).

<p>Yeah, this has been a shitstorm since the beginning of the church, and I suspect some of these schisms have been infiltration.

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is probably incorrect about certain things, I absolutely believe in life after death and find NDE&#39;s to be strong proof of that. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too troublesome or discouraging because we already knew so much of religion and the Bible have been used to manipulate people, so it&#39;s not surprising if there was a concerted effort to do that early on. Personally I&#39;m not feeling like I miss anything if the Bible isn&#39;t all it&#39;s purported to be because what I know is true about Jesus (yes still partially based on the Bible) is that he showed us the Way to true life, and His Holy Spirit is in me. All the details of that, I don&#39;t know for certain (face it, I wasn&#39;t literally there) but I enjoy the mystery and strongly believe humans are capable of much more than we know. (Greater things will we do) It gets me excited to think outside the box in that way, which is I believe what Jesus wanted us to do anyway. 
I can&#39;t say I&#39;m in any way questioning Jesus, The Father, the Holy Spirit as One, but I don&#39;t know for certain what that really means. Some take the trinity and make it a rite. That&#39;s not necessary I don&#39;t think. Jesus didn&#39;t act like it anyway.</p>

<p>I think he is speaking esoterically about Christianity, or possibly is wrong. He seems to hold the views of Jewish Christian sects, such as the Nazarenes and Ebionites.</p>

<p>But I can refute the claims that the Bible has been modified by mystery school adherents. We literally have the letters where early church leaders discuss their attempts at infiltration (false gospels, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Magi also referred to as the (Three) Wise Men or (Three) Kings, were, in the Gospel of Matthew and Christian tradition, a group of distinguished foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth, bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s referring directly to the Trinity, although he did say we are to see multiple interpretations from a single symbol. I think it&#39;s a compelling idea that Three refers to the three wise men and a Babylonian mystery school established by Daniel during Israel&#39;s exile.

<p>Sorry to digress here, but while this does not address HLI directly, it is consistent with things he says check this out from James Corbett of CorbettReport, you can jump to the 40 min point regarding the &quot;Kakistocracy&quot;, all of this is consistent from the best/serious sources I have found</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points that you have picked out, don&#39;t think this is LARP-ing (a game).</p>

<p>I would like to point out something very practical he said;</p>

<p>&quot;HLI: Security clearing rules were lifted for a few days after 9/11. There was only one major bank that had problems, and it is well known to have been the primary arm of laundering CIA cash.</p>

<p>You can look up all their employees and initiate surveillance grids on them to get to the heart of the organization.&quot;</p>

<p>later someone finally asked him which bank (he said it was Bank of New York) </p>

<p>I did my own search &quot;Security clearing rules were lifted for a few days after 9/11&quot; 
and got a great article that is from Zerohedge, and authored by Paul Craig Roberts (both pretty good sources), and yup it&#39;s there (it is about 1 yr old), but as HLI does in every answer so far it is consistent, and gets more accurate/detailed version of well so far everything I can check
Here is the article</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-11/paul-craig-roberts-911-fourteen-years-later">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-11/paul-craig-roberts-911-fourteen-years-later</a></p>

<p>both videos excellent (the second is the Most detailed I have seen on 911)</p>

<p>just my 2 cents </p>

<p>It seems to me that the idea comes from 2001 speech by someone within the federal reserve. This explains the clearing. A way to react(by the federal reserve) towards uncertainty in the market. HLI is NOT providing any info that is not already out there. To be honest I cannot completely comprehend the various intricatsies of the economy pertaining to the issue. However the speech does go infinetly more in depth. Perhaps a bona fied economist or stockbroker could shed some insight.</p>

<p>The answers he made are based off from what questions people asked of him. There were some good questions posted, but there were some questions that were repeated by quite a bit.

<p>Even if the anon is a LARPer, the misinformation (from your point of view) has offered different view points different from the course of r/Conspiracy. I don&#39;t know if you know this but r/Conspiracy is more focused on just finding evil and exposing than trying to find what caused the state of affairs and the <strong>alternatives</strong> we should seek.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record I keep an open mind to all conspiracy theories. I thoroughly enjoy this very community. I do not see HLI statements as misinformation, nor do I see it as fact. A good portion of what he talks about im certain can be attributed to truth. In regards to Asian conspiracies-I expect that any NWO or OWO groups or splinter elements should contain within its structure members and agendas from all nations of the world. I have read many theories and have discovered very little about China&#39;s interaction, other than vague ideas. I would expect that there is a question that begs to be answered in regards to Chinas specific connection and activities in the worlds secret conspiracy&#39;s. As to your last statement about the nature of the conspiracy reddit community,  - all aspects of evil and events that transpire in its actions should be disected including what caused the state of affairs. This is the very nature of truly being able to expose conspiracy&#39;s. Understanding such allows us to pinpoint the perpetrators, there agendas, both in past present and future. For the very conspiracy&#39;s that this community is reporting, is unlaid upon our world in a way to decieve and thwart the very people that report on it. Every source of information weather msm or alternative are within the influence of NWO or OWO. All the pieces of the puzzle(both fake and real) brings with it the possibility of uni lateral, bi lateral, or multi lateral, conspiracies and agendas. Truth with lies, lies about truth, engineered truth backed by lies. Lies told to achieve truth. Lies about Lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts? I find all his answers on politics and hidden control very believable. I find his thoughts on science and suppression believable. I just bought the book he keeps suggesting and hope it will make some sense of the bicameral mind. I even believe the stuff about the kingdom of heaven being within and consciousness being a direct link to Gods voice. However I&#39;m a devout evangelical Christian and I am carful to wade into waters that dismantle many doctrinal tenets of my faith. On those things I&#39;m more carefully treading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, with differences. I&#39;m a natural cynic, with a keen lifelong interest in history and literature, and found myself overly impressed with the depth &amp;amp; range of his knowledge. Everything checks out and the claims he makes that go against historically agreed facts, tend to be plausible , e.g real age of Pyramids, ancient civilisations, Obama being  CIA etc. I read through every single session, noting the timestamps, and his answers are pretty much instantaneous. Answers to not only questions that demanded facts, but the easy manner he explains complex concepts leads to me believe he&#39;s considerably more intelligent than he appears. What struck me most was the way he speaks: no ego, no grandiose, just here&#39;s the facts- trust them not me. My upbringing and the way I was introduced to religion are the main reasons I turned away from Christianity as soon as I was old enough. I never stopped believing in spirituality however, just never had it presented to me in a way that I could adopt. That&#39;s changed significantly since listening to HLI and going back to the bible with fresh eyes. 
So, yes I guess... I&#39;m fairly sold. There&#39;s a whole host of future events his predicted and as news of him spreads, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find ourselves discussing it in more depth with new people. Either way, I think this is the real thing.</p>

<p>I have noticed this, perhaps you mean another comment?</p>

<p>Q: Can you give me a proper explanation of The Shroud of Turin? </p>

<p>A: It is real. Jesus was nursed back to health after being removed from the cross. </p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Q:Question about Jesus: is the resurrection just a metaphor in the same sense as the cave? </p>

<p>A: Yes. Jesus didn&#39;t die on the literal wooden cross. He was taken down alive, nursed to health by Mary, and left the region.
Dying on the cross is a metaphor. He stood at the intersection of the elite and the masses, the crossroad and remained there. </p>

<p>A red flag for me is HLI&#39;s reduction of the Crucifixion to a metaphor for socio-economic transcendence. Maybe I&#39;m the one being a reductionist, but the reason the temple curtains were rent in two was because the the cross reconciled Man to God, not plebs to elites.</p>

<p>The temple curtains that only The High Priest was allowed to pass through, to get to The Holy of Holies? </p>

<p>IMO very symbolic (not only elites could access the Holy of Holies from that moment on) and if that was a historic fact (temple curtains torn in two), I would like to know how Jesus did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I was unclear. Real or not, the torn curtains are only meaningful as metaphors within the context of ancient Jewish traditions. The cool thing about the Biblical narrative is how much self-referential messaging occurs within it, so much so that when John says Christ is the Word made flesh, he&#39;s using a metaphor inside a metaphor inside a metaphor inside a metaphor...</p>

<p>My point isn&#39;t that the curtain detail was REAL, it&#39;s that I bristle at HLI seemingly reducing Christ crucifixion to a statement on the &quot;elites.&quot; Although...as I type this...it occurs to me that by &quot;elites&quot; he was referring to the High Priests who subjugated the masses under weight of a hierarchical lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/HillarysPizzaParty I appreciate your comment. I have had the past three weeks to consider my own heart/mind in all of this. I&#39;ve finished the book on the Bicameral Mind and it also shook me to my core. Here is where I&#39;m at today relative to my faith, etc.</p>

<p>I agree with thesis that consciousness is fundamentally based on the mind&#39;s implementation of metaphorical language. It is a learned behavior rather than an evolutionary one, not unlike a software upgrade relative to hardware. The book ends with several descriptions of how modern man still contends with the vestiges of his Bicameral mind, seeking authorization if not a messianic hope in sophisticated belief structures: materialist world view; religion; Reason itself.....</p>

<p>Our Bible depicts a rational creator and I think it is a reasonable starting point to believe in that versus the alternative. Another starting point is that our minds cannot escape metaphorical language as a foundation for conscious thought, and so it is acceptable to employ metaphorical language even while attempting to &quot;see through it&quot; (...like that). </p>

<p>When John 1 says that the Word was with God and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, what we&#39;re reading is that the 2nd person of the Trinity existed in equality with the Father at the beginning, and through him all reality was made and is sustained. Similarly, our minds and the world exist in a way unknowable to us, but through the second person of ourselves, the subjective &quot;me,&quot; our will is made known to ourselves (real) by articulation, consciousness, words, metaphorical language employ. I was disturbed to approach the idea that my Trinitarian conception of reality - and all the associated Christian dogma - was nothing more than an elaborate metaphor for my own consciousness. But I return to the presumption that we have a rational creator, and that he seeks for us to know Him. I then surmise that man exists in self-similarity with God - created in his image - and that functioning in similitude with the Trinity doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s &quot;all in our head.&quot; Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>As for HLI&#39;s claims about Christ not literally dying on the cross and choosing Mary as his top disciple before traveling East, I am suspending disbelief until I can understand more. I have a set of questions I want to ask to that end:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you pray? What do you pray for?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the name THREE relate to the the Trinity? To the three magi? How so?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have a favorite bible verse or parable? What are they?</p></li>
<li><p>Was THREE involved in supporting Martin Luther&#39;s work and the Protestant Reformation?</p></li>
<li><p>You previously made negative reference to the Pauline/Roman branch of Christendom taking root. How have those trends influenced Christian thought for the negative?</p></li>
<li><p>Where Leonardo Da Vinci or Michelangelo Buonarroti affiliated with THREE?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the coherence of consciousness more like a realization of what&#39;s &quot;there&quot; as opposed to an attainment of esoteric ability? Is the acquisition of agency similar? I understand your avoidance of explicit direction since I imagine the successful attainment of both is dependent on unique individual ideation as opposed to didactic instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>Was the Battle of Jericho an example of psychological warfare which induced cognitive dissonance in the bicameral minds of the Jerichoans, leading to their defeat?</p></li>
<li><p>God in the Bible institutes that we employ metaphorical language when conceiving of and communing with Him. What metaphors do you employ?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the House of Burke have a legacy of membership in THREE?</p></li>
<li><p>Suggest a focal idea (meme) that we might use to engage in conscious coherence with you/THREE. If you&#39;d prefer I make the suggestion: &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Do you or your colleagues at THREE regularly lurk or post on /pol/?</p></li>
<li><p>I have been deeply affected by reading your previous posts as well as THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS by Jaynes. The first prayer I could utter thereafter was &quot;Woe is me! for I am undone.&quot; My prior understanding of every mediating metaphor, including &quot;my SELF,&quot; has been annihilated. Yet, after some weeks, I have never felt closer to God. He is at once alien and imminent. Please read the following treatise and answer my question at the end.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I once conceived of a pseudo-scientific metaphysical conceit-cum-cosmology:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Expansion of space is caused by the location of our galaxy on the 2D surface of a toroidal universe stretching as it approaches equator. Experience of spatial realty is 3D holographic projection thereof.</p>

<p>Dark matter is an object’s wave-function of constituent potentials bending space as they collapse into being. They exist in a 5th-D of infinite potential &amp; radiate gravity as a product of their collapse into the novelty of the 4th-D.</p>

<p>The 2nd person of the Trinity is called the Word &amp; animates all things under authority of the Most High who is infinite in power. Their communion is so strong as to manifest as the 3rd person: Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The Word resides at center of the horn torus, begotten when poles of the spherical proto-universe converged into that point. This caused a quantum fluctuation &amp; the Big Bang. The Father exists beyond the event horizon of the toroidal universe, infinite in space. He pours his infinite power/potential through the singularity to achieve the particularity of his will: REALITY. Time, the protraction of this relationship, is administered by the Holy Spirit. Trinity fills the 6th-D.</p>

<p>The flow of infinity into particularity is further seen by the universe itself existing as an object/point in infinite space. This 7th-D abstraction corresponds with the Zero-D theoretic - a point in infinite space. This collapse of higher into lower dimensions is the flow of time, Ouroboros, &amp; the accumulation of reality recorded by its conscious observers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of its scientific accuracy, the impulse to consolidate all subjective experience into a single metaphorical framework is the very same creative impulse ascribed to the Godhead in my &quot;Cosmology,&quot; exposing the whole as a sublime metaphor for consciousness itself. Is my Theology rendered mere Psychology, or does man yet exist in self-similitude with his Maker, that in revealing &quot;I am,&quot; he may rejoin &quot;I AM&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure your specifically asking for my own perspective but it seems you&#39;re interested in anyone&#39;s, so I just want to add that I have been questioning reality, our existence, certain &quot;biblical&quot; ideas I can&#39;t either find in the Bible or aren&#39;t actually stated by Jesus. I find some of Paul&#39;s teachings to be more of an addendum to Jesus rather that expounding on His words. The Trinity isn&#39;t clearly in theBible, I often have wondered over the past couple years whether the Bible was more of an inspired text vs. THE one and only pure inspired text. 
On the consciousness note for the past several years my charismatic Christian experience has fully embraced ideas that mesh perfectly with becoming more conscious of God&#39;s divine presence in my every day life. I&#39;ve lost passion for the &quot;church&quot; because of injuries I&#39;ve sustained by those within who lie and control people. HLI ideas have given me fresh motivation and inspiration that I&#39;ve lacked for some time. 
Take a breath, God is in it. 
I want to know more about what HLI suggests would blow our minds.  I work typically on evenings he shows up, wish I had caught it last night. I wish he could (or someone from Three) be my mentor. </p>

<p>Yeah, I saw that too. He says in a later Question Session that Trump had to choose Pence due to overwhelming support for him by democrats and democrat-like independents since Hillary had a bad support base coming out of the Democratic election.

<p>It seems highly likely. They look very similar. Also, Obama&#39;s parents are part of the CIA and so, Obama was possibly raised up into the CIA and is a creature of them. User elnegroik had posted a <a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/exopolitics/2012/01/hidden-story-behind-jesse-ventura-piers-morgans-cnn-clash-over-obama-cia-ties.html">link on the Obama CIA ties</a>.</p>

<p>Any hint of when he will be back?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure when he will be back. I&#39;m guessing that he is to appear again around Christmas week similar to how he did Thanksgiving week. However, I hope he appears soon. I stored up a lot of questions.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, I can be able to store them and submit them in a Question Session if you&#39;re not able to. This could be your chance to ask challenging questions that has puzzling you or to challenge the validity of the anon. So far, me and the two other users I&#39;ve mentioned have PM&#39;d each other questions or posted onto this thread. If you want me to start a new thread, then I could. </p>

<p>As far as starting a separate thread/sub to fully dig into what he is saying, it could be done but there isn&#39;t significant enough attention to the threads to warrant that yet. It would take a lot of work. Let me get u/elnegroik opinion.</p>

<p>My initial response from others was that he is a LARPer. It was only with the recent Question Sessions(11/21-22 &amp; 11/26) that some attention has been gained. It will take some time to fully prove whether or not the anon is fully legit or not. Once the next QS arrives and I&#39;m able to dump a lot of the questions, we can make some guesses from there. I&#39;m under the impression he is legit though. If we find later on that the anon is legit as more complex questions get asked with detailed answers, then yes, it will deserve a lot more thought and inspection into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that they&#39;re isn&#39;t sufficient attention to warrant the creation of a new sub. Despite HLI gaining more traction in recent weeks, still doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s enough to take it to critical mass- where we&#39;ll see the most growth is when any number of the predictions he&#39;s made come to fruition.</p>

<p>I read through u/MrsMadHatter04 response, and was struck by the similarity of the  things we all took away: the need to convince people by not only exposing evil, but explaining why it&#39;s done, as well as articulating a better vision: aka Hope. HOPE.
If you read back to my first reply u/darkomantis you&#39;ll see I said something similar. In this sub we and others like us, pore through the  raw data and attempt to expose the fallacy in the news &amp; media, so we can figure out what&#39;s really going on in the world. At some point we&#39;ll try and tell others so that they can wake up too, right?</p>

<p>Like HLI says and as well know,when presented with the truth, people either shirk away or they attack you as a nut. Especially a truth that turns a lot of their existing &#39;truths&#39; into lies.But if you explain why it&#39;s done - peadophilie rings provide elites protection in the form of blackmail M.A.D etc- they&#39;re more likely to understand what you&#39;re saying and not feel as threatened-  granted, you&#39;re now you&#39;re in a better place ...  but it still isn&#39;t enough.
I joined reddit a year back specifically to take part in discussions on r/conspiracy after a friend sent me a link from here. Im a cynical mid 20s now but spent my optimistic-teens watching Zeitgeist, Fahrenheit9/11, 9/11-JFK everything&#39;s a rich mans trick and other consciousness expanders of a similar ilk.  I felt I&#39;d woken up! Really got the world now! I mean how couldn&#39;t other people see these things?? It was obvious right? So I started crusading. &quot;Do you know how money is created?&quot; &quot;Do you know why oil is traded in dollars??&quot; &quot;How about the Middle East - why do you think we invaded Iraq? Or Syria??!&quot;
After a while I just stopped. People didn&#39;t want to know. Even when they did the research and came back, they were like - &quot;ok. So what?&quot; 
And I feel like that&#39;s where this sub is. We collectively recognise the illusions perpetuated by TPTB and all have tried at some point to inform someone who doesn&#39;t what&#39;s actually going on. But unless we develop a way to link that to a vision of what is possible, I fear we&#39;ll never succeed. HLI&#39;s questions sessions are the kind of thing I guess I was looking for all this time - hope. A vision articulated. At first it was enough to be awake- to realise things weren&#39;t as they seemed with the world and from that point on seeing everything differently. But then it became burdensome, labouring under the weight of uncomfortable truths that you can&#39;t really share because people don&#39;t believe you or don&#39;t really care ... most of the time because they don&#39;t see how it concerns them. But what if you could show explain to them how it concerns them: &quot;Did you know we have the technology to create space elevators harness solar energy at a magnitude far greater than what we currently do? Enough to raise global GDP to $1M per capita?&quot; &quot;We can cure cancer- were you aware?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to trying to unravel Pizzagate, and the like, that you add another prong to your arsenal; seek to demonstrate opportunity and let the gap between our potential and the state of affairs serve as a proof of conspiracy to those who are not aware. You can show people there is something deeply wrong by giving them hope - which we all need to cope with the darkness that is real.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember what HLI says about &quot;the emperor with clothes off effect&quot; -  I think he&#39;s saying for a mass awakening to occur ,its not enough for people to know it&#39;s all bullshit- they have to know that everyone else knows. If this sub should have any kind of purpose, it&#39;s to move past being a protest group to TPTB, and develop our collective awareness to show people how massively the fuckeries we endure, detracts from our potential.</p>

<p>That and the next question session coming up. I want to dump all my questions to see what the response is since I have not only my questions, but a variety of questions from other people as well. When the next QS comes, I feel there&#39;ll be a lot more attention. It&#39;s just wondering when the anon will pop up (I&#39;m predicting around Christmas week at the latest).</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the more important thing to take out of the threads even if it was the case the anon was a LARPer. We have to construct a vision. We have to bring ourselves further from just being a news compile group.</p>

<p>There will be a mass awakening to occur in the coming years. A lot of people are smelling that something is up and if Trump delivers like how Barack Obama did, people are going to get restless since it will be 16 years of &quot;Hope &amp; change&quot; that ended up being fake. </p>

The reason I mentioned David Icke is because there are some striking parallels between his speeches and that what the HLI has said.  Also, I wanted to share this definition of Agency, because the HLI uses the word constantly:</p>

<p>Human agency is the capacity for human beings to make choices, and have the condition, or state of acting or of exerting power. It is normally contrasted to natural forces, which are causes involving only unthinking deterministic processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of free will, the philosophical doctrine that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. How humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.</p>

<p>Theory behind this is because he stated that Elon musk was (I cant remember the exact words) was more along the lines of a fraud.</p>

<p>What caught my attention was Elon Musks newest proposal of the &quot;Boring&quot; Company.  HLI, stated that he is known for taking already known technologies and ideas and using them to make money when the government has already been doing it and supplies it resources to his company (Example: Space - X and NASA) for free</p>

<p>One of the theories with the Hollowed Earth is that there are already tunnels underneath the earth created by something/someone else that can be used to travel to remote locations quickly.  If you recall, Elon Musk opensourced Hyperloop which probably is currently being used in these tunnels</p>

<p>Just a theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I possibly made a mistake with the hollowed earth theory.  HLI stated that he worked at Area 51.  But he said theres no existance of aliens.  </p>

<p>I did some further research and saw that the US could have possibly been boring tunnels under North America and that could be what Area 51 is.  What got me thinking and connecting dots is all of Elon Musks companies and even his open sourced Hyperloop were all at one point US Govt Projects which HLI states as a comparison to NASA and Space-X.  </p>

<p>If Area 51 is an undeground city , tunnel network possibly with Hyperloops to other cities, why would Elon Musk just magically announce he was going to create a &quot;Boring&quot; company</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys have done terrific work documenting this here. Thank you.</p>

<p>It seems much of what HLI has to say is spot on while adhering to the &quot;eyes to see, ears to hear...&quot; ideology of sharing info. The spiritual aspect of what he&#39;s shared can be very difficult depending on how tightly someone is attached to an existing religious belief; of course, absolute disbelief would present the same difficulties.</p>

<p>Honeycomb earth theory is a possibility, too, as it allows many things being questioned to make sense when it&#39;s factored in to the equation. </p>

<p>Thanks, again, for taking this on and sharing your thoughts in the process.</p>

I notice too when referring back to himself sometimes he says &quot;we will keep reaching out...&quot; and of course the whole &quot;we are three&quot; thing...maybe there are three of these guys? Either way the info is highly interesting. </p>

<p>Also, I thought he was wrong about Trump but it seems like not exactly wrong. I thought once he said that TPTB would not let Trump win. But then qualifying that with it can only be Clinton if enough people know that most others know that it&#39;s legit. So I suppose no one could have expected the people to choose Trump so strongly. Wish we had legit vote numbers to look at..</p>

I haven&#39;t read all threads, but yes I do see not really a different voice, but short answers, then sometimes a bit more expansive. 
who/whatever HLI is, they write pretty well (consistent and quite efficient) especially for what is &quot;on the fly&quot; quick Q/A responses. We&#39;ll see and these days disinfo or not, it&#39;s at least more useful than MSM, CNN etc.  lol ;)  </p>

<p>Q: Was Shakespeare related to the activities of Three?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One illusion that will disappear in short order is the idea that free speech exists as a matter of law.</p>

<p>As it stands today, the majority of the population is what you might called purple pilled. They believe in systemic conspiracy but also nonsensical myths like remnants of a free press (&quot;alternative media&quot;).</p>

<p>Such notions are immediately debunked by entertaining ideas like being a space elevator. We have and have had the technological capacity to do this for decades and therefore the ability to drive 20%+ annual GDP growth, yet you see no talk of this in any of the vast swaths of &quot;real/alternative&quot; media. One can only conclude that they are truth purveyors but rather mere misdirection.</p>

<p>The existence of forums like this encourages people to believe in nonsense ideas like free speech still exists under the law.&quot;</p>

<p>U/darkomantis what did you make of that?</p>

<p>Also thanks for asking my question- didn&#39;t expect too detailed a reply tbh as such information could be used by nefarious actors - but worth a try.

<p>I guess he is saying that people will wake up to realize that the Free Speech and they think exists will be turn out to be false. Alternative media, which is kind of the last lines for people still believing in media (but not MSM), are misdirections in that they don&#39;t provide discussions to talk about our technological capacity which is essential in moving on from our current system. They only continue with themes that aren&#39;t beneficial to us besides the occasional &quot;Truth(s) here!&quot;. </p>

<p>I found this puzzling too... I did definitely have way more questions than the previous time I came in but it makes no sense to not answer them. Perhaps the anon is buying time to look into the questions to answer them... If this is the case...</p>

<p>If he ignores it a second time, then it could finally be a nail in that he is a dedicated LARPer. If that&#39;s the case, then that will be unfortunate and demoralizing. I still learned a few things from these threads even though it could be fiction. </p>

<p>I still think it would be much more efficient use of time of all the parties involved if all the questions are addressed, at some point. It would be so easy to filter the omitted questions and address them in quickly in a follow up thread. </p>

<p>Hmmm... the context of that answer was in terms of the endgoal for the OWO. In the 8/8 session, HLI commented: &quot;It&#39;s only a [<strong>recent development</strong>] that depopulation has been seriously considered as we move more towards automated production and less need for worker bees. They are many years away from being able to rely on these sorts of things though. You are still needed for now.&quot; He does mention that some of TPTB are interested in A.I. and/or automated processes to replace the population with. I don&#39;t know if this is the 180 you&#39;re talking about or in relation to something else. If u/elnegroik can comment on this.</p>

<p>You&#39;re concern is one shared with everyone else. People have mentioned in the threads and I have noticed from some time ago that the questions asked are repeats from earlier threads.

    <div class="md"><p>I can see a difference between what he stated in the last thread and in August:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s only a recent development that depopulation has been seriously considered as we move more towards automated production and less need for worker bees. They are many years away from being able to rely on these sorts of things though. You are still needed for now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I would not conclude 180 but rather that there might have been some further development since summer...</p>

<p>When questioned more about the genocidal plans HLI used an approach I can appreciate - he answered that he did not wish to answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: How are they actively depopulating? Feminism, MGTOW, welfare, refugees. What about GMO crops?
I know Bill Gates is into that. </p>

<p>A: I don&#39;t want to get too far into the details here for a number of reasons; they don&#39;t need any new ideas, clearer thinking about their plans, or better notions of how aware we are of their thinking, our countermeasures, etc. </p>

<p>Well... it might be a reaction to this, just a few days ago... &quot;Bill Gates says the world is not prepared to cope with a deadly flu epidemic... Billionaire is crossing his fingers one doesn&#39;t come around in the next 10 years&quot;</p>

<p>Bill should watch out. HLI said: &quot;This is the sort of thing we are prepared to kill to stop though..&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I got that, thanks for clarifying. Since I&#39;m in Ireland that 7-12pm it&#39;s like midnight-4am as I&#39;m about 5hrs ahead. Currently 00:20 here as I type.

If I had money I&#39;d buy you a beer for going to all this trouble. Still making my way through the thread. I may take you up on the offer though as I have a habit of ignoring time and because of that lots of things pass me by, but we&#39;ll see.

    <div class="md"><p>P.S. I am curious about Bogdanoffs since a weird connection of the name, HLI, meme magic and Tavistock appeared in this comment:

<blockquote>
<p>Guys this is not a joke, I need your complete attention. This is 100% not a LARP, I swear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been working for the past 6 months as an intern at the Tavistock institute in London as a lab assistant for a large project involving blockchains and network economics. I mostly just check equations from the higher-ups and run simulations. Nothing big. I&#39;m not granted knowledge on the actual project...for the most part.</p>

<p>Only my curiosity got the better of me today. I decided to look into the aims of the project using my bosses&#39; password. I wish I never fucking looked.</p>

<p>I know this is going to sound stupid and you&#39;re going to dismiss me or whatever, but I don&#39;t care: they believe meme magic is real. They&#39;re building a decentralised network in combination with botnets to create a mesh similar to 4chan in order to influence reality. There were DIRECT references to 4chan in those papers. I didn&#39;t have time to read anything but I checked the funding schedule and you won&#39;t believe who the main donors are.</p>

<p>It was the Bogdanoff brothers. I checked the address and everything. I thought this was just a shitty fucking meme but it&#39;s real, they&#39;re actually pulling the strings here.</p>

<p>HLI mentioned something about memes being real, it appears that at least Tavistock is aware of this.</p>

<p>The memetic energy must have leaked onto other platforms. That&#39;s why the Bogdanoff brothers started appearing as a jokey meme thing. The project itself must already be up and running, and the Bogfanoffs might be using it for their own self-interested gains, probably trying to get back on TV or some stupid shit.</p>

<p>Fuck. I don&#39;t have time to leave the country, I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s too late for me. I&#39;m going innawoods til this blows over.</p>

<p>Keep digging into the Bogdanoffs, this is not a meme, this is not a joke.</p>

<p>So they plan to create a copy of 4chan to have more influence? It could be something... If they needed a better way to stop others from spreading the occasional truth thread, prevent insiders, and v&amp; more people... this could be key. That would depend on if they can&#39;t already do this on 4chan.</p>

<p>Unsure what to make of the Bogdanoffs... (though they look terrible)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking something very similar after reading <a href="http://wlym.com/archive/campaigner/7806.pdf">this </a> -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through three millennia of recorded history to date, centered around the Mediterranean, the civilized world has been run by two, bitterly opposed elites, the one associated with the faction of Socrates and Plato, the other with the faction of Aristotle. During these thousands of years, until the developments of approximately 1784-1818 in Europe, both factions inner elites maintained in some fashion an unbroken continuity of organization and knowledge through all of the political catastrophes which afflicted each of them in various times and locales.
It was the elite associated with the Platonic (or, Neo-platonic faction which organized the American Revolution and established the United States as a democratic constitutional republic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still making my way through it alongside reading <em>Origins of Consciousness</em> and <em>Atlantis - The Antideluvean World</em>.. (strongly advise you begin both - the PDFs are available online)</p>

<p>But from what I&#39;ve seen the similarities in HLI and Larouche are considerable. Even if you ignore the fact they both discuss the same alternative version of history, they also reference each other:</p>

<p>Despite not mentioning <em>Three</em> by name, Larouche is clearly referring to the group in the quoted passage. Likewise, HLI, only endorses 3 or 4 reading materials for truth seekers by name- one of which is <em>Executive Intelligence Report</em> </p>

<p>So yes, u/TheDarkestTimeline, I think there is some relationship there, but I&#39;m still not sure of its nature.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t seen that particular passage from LaRouche, I think we&#39;ve made a pretty important connection here.</p>

<p>I have already gotten through 50 pages of Jaynes book and despite studying Chemistry and Philosophy I feel like I&#39;m back at the top of the rabbit hole. I&#39;ll hop into the Atlantis book shortly. </p>

<p>I rather think so too. The hyperlink is the PDF version of the book the passage came from-
<em>The Secrets known only to the elites</em> written by a Mr Lyndon H Larouche, 1978.</p>

<p>Now here we are, fast forward 39years and we see High Level Insider saying the exact same things. Coincidence? Nah, most definitely not. But what&#39;s the connection? Either suggestion you&#39;ve made rings as plausible, but the truth could easily be something hitherto discussed ...  </p>

<p>I have already gotten through 50 pages of Jaynes book and despite studying Chemistry and Philosophy I feel like I&#39;m back at the top of the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>For sure, <em>Origins</em>is tough sledding. I find myself stopping every other minute to perform some ancillary research that leads me deeper down another avenue of investigation i.e <em>Atlantis &amp; The Antideluvian World</em>
It&#39;s a frustrating but wholly satisfying line of enquiries I&#39;m pursuing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/elnegroik, I just read <em>The Secrets Known Only to the Inner Elites</em> following your recommendation. One profound takeaways I found was from page 15 where he described OUR SPECIAL COMPETENCE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through the combined effects of our work in advanced aspects of the physical sciences and a decade’s coordinated application of political-intelligence methods to crucial issues of history, we have in due course discovered ourselves to be much less a novel institution than we might otherwise have assumed to be the case. We have discovered that into the 1790s, the leading forces of the United States and the leading humanist forces of Europe were linked by common participation in international Neoplatonic networks, networks reaching back, essentially unbroken in continuity, over approximately three thousand years. Through such and related efforts, we have been able to revive, in suitably modern terms, the essential parts of the “Secret knowledge” of that Neoplatonic elite.</p>

<p>Others among today’s humanist elite already command important sections of that knowledge. In specific aspects of the matter, their knowledge is more richly developed than our own. Our distinction among these forces is that we have a grip on this knowledge in its universality. Our task is to give that universal overview to all sections of the elite, and to obtain from them, in turn, the richer knowledge of particulars at their command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is astonishing to me because it reveals that Larouche&#39;s work and network isn&#39;t being offered as the apogee of enlightenment, but as a subcomponent part of a larger global Neoplatonic/humanist body of knowledge reaching back 3000 years. </p>

<p>If reading through Larouche&#39;s work or biography gives you pause, as if this man is intended to be seen as the central humanist figure in modern history and that HLI might merely be a committed disciple of Larouche, you are freed from absolute skepticism when you see Larouche&#39;s achievements in their proper place within the larger network, and you hear him admit the same. </p>

<p>It is also astounding to think that each of us individually might contribute to other aspects and categories of this Neoplatonic body of knowledge. What novels need be written? What songs need be sung? What recipes need be concocted? What politics and political figures need be nurtured? What pedagogies need be pursued? What dreams, be they dreams or something deeper, must come?</p>

<p>This resonates. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to read the insights and learnings of notable persons and feel awed into insignificance. &quot;How could I ever replicate such a feat?! Best to not event try ...&quot; </p>

<p>However, the irony is the more I immerse myself in the rabbit hole spawned by HLI&#39;s sessions, the more I feel affinity, not distance, to these individuals. We are all pilgrims on the journey to truth, some are just further along than others. It gives me heightened means to persist, knowing groups like <em>Three</em> are operational  and concerned with our passage- we who have longer to traverse, as we strive towards understanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>North American Water and Power Alliance I think - a Massive public works project to divert water from Alaska through Canada and the united states with hydroelectric dams along the way, including nuclear power plants to pump water UP the rockies to collect the gravitational energy as it comes back down. Anyway HLI said something about this and while I was reading the wiki on it I read that this dude Lyndon LaRouche was a huge supporter and I just fell down that rabbit hole. Dude has run in every presidential election in the last 30 years. He is associated with groups all over the world that sorta share his message, but honestly his message seems really similar to HLI&#39;s. Think of how much better the future can be, not how fucked up the past has been. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I do think this group and everything Thiel is involved in are looking very interesting, his Imitatio website is identical to the website for The Berkeley Institute, and I also found this: <a href="https://www.seasteading.org">https://www.seasteading.org</a> which has people listed who are connected to Thiel. Also lists &quot;The Eight Great Moral Imperatives&quot; as, 
1. Enrich the poor
2. Cure the sick
3. Feed the hungry
4. Clean the atmosphere 
5. The Velella Mariculture Research Project
6. Live in balance with the nature
7. Power the world
8. Stop fighting</p>

<p>It might not be the precise objective of HLI but they&#39;re clearly on the same side. Which is humanity&#39;s side imho. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve been up for 2 days but here are a couple things I can remember he said about himself</p>

<p>He&#39;s made enough money to never have to work again, but he&#39;s actively involved in writing, investing, poker, and I think political advisor or something, a few other things that are escaping me atm.. </p>

<p>Peter Andreas Thiel (/ˈtiːl/; born October 11, 1967) is a German-American entrepreneur, hedge fund manager, venture capitalist, philanthropist, political activist, and author. Referred to as the &quot;Don of the PayPal Mafia&quot;, Thiel was ranked No. 4 on the Forbes Midas List of 2014, with a net worth of $2.2 billion, and No. 246 on the Forbes 400 in 2016, with a net worth of $2.7 billion.[4][5][6]</p>

<p>HLI - His kind are found at a young age via &quot;spelling bees, etc&quot; and they&#39;re all highly advanced in mathematics.</p>

<p>Theil - &quot;In his youth, Thiel was a fanatical chess player. He began playing at the age of 6, and by age 12 was ranked seventh in the U.S. in the under-13 category.</p>

<p>&quot;In school, Thiel excelled in mathematics, and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending middle school in San Mateo.[16] At the San Mateo High School, he read
 Ayn Rand, admired the optimism and anti-communism of then-President Ronald Reagan, and was valedictorian of his graduating class in 1985.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Born in Frankfurt, Thiel moved with his family to the United States as an infant. He spent a portion of his upbringing in Africa before returning to the U.S., where he attended San Mateo High School.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Peter Andreas Thiel was born in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany on October 11, 1967 to Susanne and Klaus Thiel.The family migrated to the United States when Peter was aged one and lived in Cleveland, where Klaus worked as a chemical engineer.&quot; 
&quot;Before settling in Foster City, California in 1977, the Thiels had lived in South and South West Africa&quot;</p>

<p>HLI said he grew up on well water and not as exposed to fluoride during important early developmental stages.. and for speaking or using very American English, he used the word &quot;petrol&quot;; which I guess could be explained by European parents and growing up in S Africa.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more they have in common, check Thiel&#39;s wiki.. and I&#39;ll add more tomorrow when more clear headed.
I&#39;ll also try to read that link before falling asleep </p>

I&#39;m not totally certain that God would not have us do this, but I do think back to the Tower of Babel and wonder, if the story is as told, would God stop us? Would being capable of pulling the minds and resources together for such a thing that literally would open the universe to us be going too far?<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t we go for it, we have already learned that there is no limit when we put our minds to it? </p>

<p>Freeing every human to create and explore their potential without the need to work is I believe what God wants for us, if we can do a project like this with consciousness of His divine Presence, wow, a new heaven and earth will truly be realized for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My quick reflection on the latest batch of HLI threads (1/11):</p>

<p>Something must be wrong with the discussion format or the way the &quot;discussion&quot; is led because HLI has had HOURS to speak to people, in total, and after engaging in a &quot;dialog&quot; with him using this board I definitely cannot say that he is the person able to save the world.
In other words, there is some kind of *intensity&quot; in his answers but very vague, perhaps intentionally, some answers are avoided altogether. He is withholding something, in my opinion. Why, and what?</p>

<p>Referring to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>anon: What&#39;s it like having agency? What do you do with it and how does it affect your day-to-day life?</p>

<p>HLI: The ability to speak freely is not something most people have encountered in person and it really shocks them to bump into it. I&#39;ve repeatedly struck up conversations with strangers and had them tell me I am going to save the world within five minutes. That&#39;s an overblown analysis on their part, but it speaks to the intensity with which an encounter with freedom resonates with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate on your thinking? Are you doubting the validity of HLI&#39;s identity (i.e.: suspecting trolling/larping) or do you rather suspect unrevealed motives behind his appearance/revelations?</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s the answers that are lacking. I have a feeling we&#39;re not asking the right questions yet. The first couple of threads were most revealing because a wide range of questions were asked and answered without pretension, but the more recent threads have been largely repeat questions or questions related to earlier questions that are easily answered by context.</p>

<p>A few things have been standing out for me, that I wish HLI would delve into more deeply, but we&#39;ll have to come up with cogent enough questions is my suspicion. </p>

<p>For instance, HLI has let on that the Mandela Effect is a real effect, but that its cause is not Cern or some other governmental experiment, but has to do with the concept of coherent consciousness, the 100th monkey phenomenon, or meme magic, however you want to refer to the mechanism, it&#39;s all the same idea. So I would extrapolate that one of his main arguments is that cognitive intention shared amongst a wide enough group of people can tangibly shape and reshape reality. I&#39;m not sure what question to draw from this, but it seems to me that this is one field we should explore more deeply.</p>

<p>Another clear and repeated statement by HLI is that aliens have not shaped life on this planet, has never visited our planet and is not in control of this planet in any other sense either. He has emphasized this several times but has never offered any argument for his stance beyond that. So I&#39;m curious how he can be so sure. The most interesting part about this was when he exclaimed that stories about ghosts, aliens, demons, whathaveyou have more to do with things we don&#39;t yet understand about the power of our own minds, rather than real, tangible phenomena. Again, I&#39;m not sure what conclusions to draw from this or what questions to ask that would clarify his stance on this issue.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can brainstorm on a couple of solid, new and interesting questions to have asked next time around. Any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My jury is still out as to his validity (lots of words and promises, where are the fruits?) and yes, I suspect there might be some hidden motives. The question is of what kind.</p>

<p>He might have had a surprising experience when personally <em>discussing</em> with strangers within 5 minutes, but the board does not provide this kind of experience to an individual user. Questions are flying, he is picking some and answering partially, fully, vaguely or not at all, your chance to post an additional question that would be answered is minimal.</p>

<p>In this 3-part series he made an effort to answer questions from the first thread (very good!) but it did not last long, sadly. Again many questions were ignored. Why does he not answer them quickly later on when he finds some more time?</p>

<p>I am not dismissing him yet, I will surely continue to watch him because it is fun and he shares interesting stuff, but I do not think I am going to ask the questions I really wish to be addressed. Based on what I have seen so far he would ignore them, I&#39;m hinting here again to a possibility that it is a data mining operation, someone collecting your deepest questions. Cui bono?</p>

<p>But, I may be wrong, people should form their own conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HLI:</p>

<p>I feel as though every conscious thought within me has been subordinated beneath neither a higher nor a deeper consciousness, but an adjacent, imminent, all-consuming fire of awareness that transcends both consciousness and knowing. In fact, I&#39;ll go so far as to say all knowledge, and all knowing, and every definable unit thereof, all of it as the aggregate and interconnected mind of man in which we collectively take part, it, down to it&#39;s deepest inner human wound which bleeds, doth seek, doth hunt, doth rest to be merely an articulate reflection of that transcendence and its glory. And I can see now how the regime has sought to suppress it for centuries. </p>

<p>Do you affirm it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here an idea for those wishing to ask HLI some questions in case he appears in future.</p>

<p>I can imagine collecting questions, posting and re-posting them so that they would get answered was quite demanding for Darkomantis.</p>

<p>Instead of collecting questions, <strong>I propose we might notify each other via personal message if anyone notices HLI is active.</strong> It would require ANYONE spotting a new session sending a PM to a couple of people, for instance: &quot;A new HLI Question Session + url link&quot;).</p>

<p>Whoever is interested in this service can reply to this comment so that the handles are collected. Reddit notification options have to be set accordingly so that you get an email.</p>

<p>HLI uses no tripcode (unique user identification) so there is chance of impersonators. His real threads have been easy to distinguish so far, though.</p>

<p>A new thread is best spotted here:

    <div class="md"><p>Something that could purely be coincidence, but Trump&#39;s speech today included this wording:</p>

<p>“We are ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow,” </p>

<p>To me, it sounded interesting considering HLI&#39;s discourse on these subjects and talk of &quot;three&quot; being willing to guide Trump in the future if he will take the help. If I remember correctly, the group (if it is to be believed) has or has tried to make contact and their intentions know to Trump. </p>

<p>Yes, they did make contact with Trump from what High Level Insider said... Though they said they haven&#39;t really heard anything from Trump as far as want to make actual changes and not just following the plans of TPTB. </p>

<p>When we build the space elevator we will get rid of free floating satellites. Orbital rings can be built at any altitude and any inclination, so we&#39;d just hook payloads to the ring structures wherever we want them and let them hang in place rather than orbit. </p>

<p>After the first orbital ring elevator (around $450B), successive rings cost only about $1-2B a piece.</p>

<p>It takes about 10 sequential rings to reach geosynchronous altitude if you are using kevlar as your elevator material between rings, so we&#39;d want at least 10 rings.</p>

<p>If you to be able to move anywhere on Earth quickly, we might eventually want something like 100 east-west rings and 100 north-south rings.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to travel from Los Angeles to Sydney, then you just go up an elevator in LA, traverse the ring system in space, and back down an elevator in Sydney. All of this is essentially free because you recover your climbing energy in LA on the descent in Sydney and similarly recover your acceleration around the Earth in the deceleration phase.</p>

<p>At a comfy 1g of acceleration, the ride up an elevator to 300km orbital ring height takes around 5 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some new stuff from &quot;Anonymous&quot; Space Elevator:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/space%20elevator/">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/space%20elevator/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original design for a space elevator came from Tesla and we call it the orbital ring space elevator concept now. Arthur C Clarke was also working off the Tesla template and described an orbital ring style elevator.</p>

<p>This is completely different than what you normally conceive when you think space elevator. People are familiar with the idea of a counterweight in space attached by a ~40,000 km cable. Something that works like spinning in circles with a yoyo. Unfortunately you need nonexistent materials for this design: carbon nanotubes or something similar.</p>

<p>However, we can get around this by changing the design. The orbital ring elevator only has to be about 300 km high - just high enough to get out of any significant atmospheric drag.</p>

<p>Imagine a ring of material circling around Earth at ~300km altitude. Now what we can do is put an elevator on either side of the Earth like pic related. Each elevator uses superconducting magnets to deflect the ring of material downward somewhat. That produces an equal and opposite reaction, or lifting force, which can hold an elevator up.</p>

<p>It works on the same principle as you getting pushed back a little bit by firing a gun. In this case, the top of the elevator is essentially continuously firing material &quot;down&quot; in order to push itself up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth thinking about that this original design, put forth by Tesla and popularized by Clarke, is hardly even present in the public psyche. Take that as an indiction of how extensive and pervasive the brainwashing in the media is - mainstream, &quot;alternative,&quot; or otherwise. </p>

<p>Not personally but a friend who I introduced to HLI, <em>Origins of Consciousness</em> etc quite his job last week Wednesday. Literally told his boss it&#39;s all bullshit and walked out. He&#39;s a commodities trader and used to make fairly good money, his girlfriend (who I schooled with) is distraught and doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten in to him.. she&#39;s nowhere near as open minded so he hasn&#39;t told her... I certainly didn&#39;t. I feel bad for him but also happy.. it&#39;s given me a little bit more <em>oomph</em> to continue trying to spread the word, despite the ridicule and disbelief I&#39;ve encountered trying the same with others.
The 100thmonkey is being created, critical mass is inevitable.</p>

<p>*i haven&#39;t read through this thread in a while, it&#39;s good to see some familiar faces and some new ones.. keep going guys, you all fucking rock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: ... if the United States had $5 trillion worth of electricity pouring out of the sky, wouldn&#39;t that pretty much crash the value of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Ultimately, we would like to drive the price of everything down to zero. That is to say, we&#39;d like to live in a post-scarcity society where you can have what you want.</p>

<p>Collapsing the price of input commodities is among the greatest achievements that mankind can strive towards. It means you in turn collapse the prices of food, housing, health care, cars, whatever. This is where we want to go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do you have any idea how difficult it would be to sign up the whole world to receive all of their energy costs from the United States? We wouldn&#39;t even have time to enjoy any benefit, because of World War III. Petroleum is one fourth of Russia&#39;s GDP. Their export earnings from oil and gas are 14% of their GDP. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be as casual as you are about eliminating that industry and buying all of their energy from us at an arbitrary price we set. Not to mention other countries who rely much more on energy resources. This is exactly the kind of stuff that starts wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: The US already does this in effect - it is called the petrodollar regime. We force the world to trade energy supplies in dollars, propping up the value of the dollar, which we in turn use to effectively skim a cut off of every transaction for free.</p>

<p>The present circumstances of world geopolitics in other words is that the US is committing highway robbery by force.</p>

<p>The only real geopolitical shift we are talking about is one of mutually improved circumstances, i.e., energy is cheaper and more abundant for us all. The usury class and the degenerate politicians who depend upon economic hardship to suppress and distract the masses would be in serious trouble, but no one else really. </p>

<p>A: Whether it is or not, you&#39;d not be able to tell based on me telling you so. One of the first principles of anonymous boards is that you should judge by the merits of what is said, not the identity of the sayer. With that in mind, you might as well go ahead and ask what you wanted to ask and see what kind of response you get. </p>

I think this means the Meme he&#39;s advancing has achieved a certain &quot;critical mass&quot; within the coherence of consciousness that he&#39;s now deploying it in this way (good for us!)

    <div class="md"><p>u/ToddWhiskey, it seems you were right from the start my man. I&#39;ve just read the latest Space Elevator submissions and I&#39;m in no doubt that the anon and HLI are one and the same. Why has the anon changed their name though? The Space Elevator tag has been operational for some years now, so unless S.E was HLI all along, HLI has adopted this moniker. Now that I say that, I&#39;m reminded of something HLI said about the incarnation of Jesus -</p>

<p>(This is from memory not verbatim so it&#39;s most likely riddled with errors but the gist is there)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>take a popular figure from history and you can incarnate that consciousness time and time again without anything  as ridiculous as a virgin birth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that ring any bells?</p>

<p>Reading through the 4chan theesss when Space Elevator has posted its apparent the anon (Space Elevator) is much loved by /pol
This is quite the achievement considering how cynical the average /pol poster is. Perhaps HLI or another from <em>Three</em> learned of the anon and adopted the tag as a means to foster greater connection to /pol - leading to an acceleration of the 100thmonkey?</p>

<p>I dunno how true any of that is, I&#39;m just grasping here. I can say this however: all of this has changed me. For the better, I think. I find it difficult to relate to friends I&#39;ve known for a decade ... but it&#39;s like I don&#39;t really mind. I&#39;m happier than I&#39;ve ever been, but spend more time alone than I used to. I haven&#39;t been shopping in months, whereas I used to hit the west end (Londoner here) every weekend to buy pointless shit. The path I&#39;m on feels right, I&#39;m nowhere near started I know, but I&#39;m further along than I was before, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Q: Did you start meme-seeding the Space Elevator after evaluating the collective response to your Q/A last year as HLI?</p>

<p>If so I suspect &quot;HLI&quot; was a meme just as well as #SpaceElevator</p>

<p>This would give us an example of how to start our our meme-ing projects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: You could call either a &quot;meme&quot; to the extent that they are compelling ideas, but they are not crafted as such.</p>

<p>The state of the world is such that people who offer you solutions are generally put down by the regime. The fact that you are being offered solutions - something you&#39;ve never seen before - should tell you that what we&#39;re doing is more than a meme. There is indeed a real revolution afoot, we cannot and won&#39;t be stopped.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s HLI/Space Elevator - wording is too specific to previous threads - no deviation at all from the original.
More likely someone from /pol looking to push the message further .. still very interesting, especially with the increased activity of <em>Space Elevator</em> this year ..</p>

<p>Except that the concentration of intellect and ambition into one society by skimming off the top of the whole world has resulted in a society with the technological capacity to end scarcity.
The presenter in the OP is objectively wrong. Probably not out of malice to deceive, but ignorance of science. </p>

<p>Indoor farming is not just viable but preferable when you have cheap electricity. You prevent nutrient and water run off and eliminate the need for pesticides. We already have laser/camera systems built and tested that can detect insects and burn them up. Indoor farming drastically increases crop yield because you have no dependency on intermittent rain, can deliver ideal sunlight throughout the whole crop cycle, and grow year round. Finally, the ability to build mutli-story buildings means that even without all of the above benefits, we can increase yields 10x on a per acre basis. In terms of food resources, it is immediately obvious that the planet can support tens of billions more people using only off the shelf technology.</p>

<p>Cheap electricity also solves any emission problems. We can scrub the atmosphere of as much methane or CO2 as we so desire given abundant electricity, which is easy to get by building an orbital ring space elevator.</p>

<p>Electrical distribution is easy. Orbital rings can support 20 or more elevators per ring. It would cost less than $1T to have an elevator deployed to every major city in the world. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s work out how much an orbital ring space elevator would cost together.</p>

<p>The basic idea is this:</p>

<p>You have steel rope with an aluminum bed on it, on which superconducting magnets can react against and hold up a steel jacketed kevlar tether about 300 km in length.</p>

<p>You can find material estimates here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf">http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I invite you to dispute any figure you find questionable, at which point I will convincingly refute you as the fool that you are. After a few iterations of this, you will concede that the costs of an orbital ring is less than $500B and that you are wrong. Let&#39;s go.</p>

<p>You&#39;re at an extreme disadvantage here because while you might know engineers, I know engineering. Don&#39;t feel too bad when you are repeatedly refuted in other words. </p>

<p>The beginning, yes, but this doesn&#39;t sound like the HLI whose ran the majority of the threads.
Scientific understanding is on par but the tone &amp; attitude in the latter part is very uncharacteristic. HLI tends to let the data do the talking, without any ego intervening. This reminds me more of the first anon who started the sessions, they were more abrasive and &quot;pol&quot; like than the entity we know so well or his latest incarnation - Space Elevator </p>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong as the more I copy the SE<sup>2</sup> answers from his 4chan posts, the more I see a different side. This is a younger person to be sure and isn&#39;t afraid to say faggot or other names along with outright calling you a fool. The answers are given along with other tidbits about the economy and stuff but HLI seemed to be more of a &quot;seen it all&quot; type of guy.

<p>Possibly more people but their engagement in the threads varies a lot.

<p>This very much. Lazylice, a user who wanted to test the anon, tried to see if HLI would answer the questions he had and it was a wash. He ignored the questions in the first question session since his absence and then only answered a partial amount of questions in the following sessions. Why? HLI said that if you ask, you will get answers, but it makes no sense to purposely skip around the questions. If it&#39;s just one person, why become picky with questions if you the point of the sessions is to answer all questions? If it&#39;s more than one person, why leave questions in the absence and choose &quot;easy&quot; questions that is in reality the same questions from before? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m at a crossroads on this. What exactly is happening that it would require a 2024 election period? HLI said that <em>Three</em> has multiple plans to get into the white house if need be. Are they waiting for Trump to get out? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree. It could have been done way better. This makes me question whether or not the SE<sup>2</sup> anon is a younger member or so. It&#39;s not bad but if SE<sup>2</sup> is part of Three or in connection with HLI, they should have been able to design a more established video. I mean, they have inserted varying art pieces and works throughout time to affect the masses, right? The video should be a &quot;masterpiece&quot; if you have so many smart people/connections to people. </p>

<p>The awareness is low indeed and it doesn&#39;t help with the fact that HLI isn&#39;t keeping to the rules he sets and SE<sup>2</sup> isn&#39;t making a more attractive platform. Though I could be expecting too much. People are slightly picking up on the Space Elevator concept, but it&#39;s interesting to see the parallel of HLI/SE vs FBIanon who was an overnight success. I&#39;m not sure if the FBIanon was even right in anything as Trump doesn&#39;t appear to &quot;help&quot; the people in any shape or form.</p>

<p>Here is one idea: assuming that SE is connected to Three, I feel that the SE copypasta is an assignment given to a younger group member in order to learn how to meme which might be why it&#39;s a bit amateurish(though it doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t get the point across). The video does remind me of some of the things made by people at technology expos I visited. </p>

<p>As for being the top-tier technological group... I don&#39;t really know. It has only been two months, so let&#39;s see what future copypasta will yield (/pol is picking up on the space elevator meme though slowly compared to more refined and manufactured memes generated by agents).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would you define capitalism as private property only?</p>

<p>The proper definition of capitalism is a market with a vector of price signals that inform us how capital should be allocated in order to increase the abundance of things which people desire. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: what is a public property? Pretty sure it implies property of the state if there is a state. If the goods are all property of the state, it&#39;s socialism, thus not capitalism </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Roads are a good example, but not the only one.</p>

<p>I contend that an absence of state investment implies a lack of capitalism rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Because the state is larger than any other entity, it can engage in larger capital ventures than any other entity. That means it can operate in a non-competitive domain and therefore generate higher returns on capital than private operations.</p>

<p>People believe in capitalism because it produces more stuff at the end of the day. Because you know that your production is sub-optimal by banning state investment, you reject the central tenets of capitalism by rejecting state enterprise.</p>

<p>The construction of the Erie canal in the opening years of the US government is a great example. The construction of roads, rails, hydroelectric dams, rural electrification and then internet access followed suit. Today, we have the capacity to build things like space elevators with returns on capital far in excess of anything a private entity can achieve.</p>

<p>If you believe, as I do, that we desire the multiplication of capital to the greatest extent possible, then you must be in favor of state investment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: True, but can we impose private organisms to give money to the state to build a space elevator that they don&#39;t give a flying shit about? Do we have other means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s take the example of a road. It would cost 100 000$ to build. We can ask people to invest in it, then place a tax to use that road, until 130 000$ was paid, that will go in the pockets of the investors. The maintenance can be assured by the mean of private taxes too. Thus, public installations can be build, if they attract investors. Based Hoppe explained in details how a AnCap society would work, i suggest you look into it, i forgot most of it desu </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: We need to enforce what the gov. is
Make a constitution that dictate a entreprise-like comportement. The problem with that is that they can seek gains over the well being of the population, so NatCap enforce nationalist values with that </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: I&#39;m not sure what you mean by seeks gains over the population here.</p>

<p>If the power to tax is curtailed (either by amendment or the public realizing that taxation is an indicator of incompetency), then they are immediately less able to get over on people.</p>

<p>Sure, you can imagine some cronyism and what not. Society needs robust and determined watchdogs, extensive public disclosure of government operations, and so on.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe that the perception of endemic corruption is a bit misguided. The government, as an incompetent entity, is forced into degenerate modes of self-sustaining. There is the appearance of rampant fraud and waste in government spending today, but in reality most of it is just funneling of monies into black budgets to support publicly unacceptable programs like cocaine or heroin trafficking.</p>

<p>You can unwind the motivation of the government to engage in these things, and therefore unwind the majority of what is mislabeled waste and fraud today, by restoring competency. </p>

<p>A: A space elevator can be built for about $500B and will generate hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of wealth.</p>

<p>If the state is managed competently, it will have plenty of capital thereafter and not only never need to raise money from the population for infrastructure, but no longer have any reason to even tax people.</p>

<p>Taxation is basically a measure of past incompetency of the government. When it digs itself into a hole, it has to start looting.</p>

<p>The correct way to reduce the burden of the government is to make it a productive enterprise rather than a drain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What kind of Utopia is this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Utopia is some sort of perfection.</p>

<p>We&#39;re only asking for competency comparable to what has been expressed in the past. Building the Erie canal then, or the space elevator now.</p>

<p>You can force this sort of behavior with simple amendments undoing the income tax. In the past, the government had to put up or shut up because it was less able to loot domestically. For the most part, it put up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What&#39;s the response so far? POTUS excited? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: POTUS is being put into a position where he has no choice but to go big or go home. Hard to say which way it will go right now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Are you threatening him? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: He is already bogged down. They have no idea what to do about Obamacare. He isn&#39;t going to be able to deliver on anything unless he breaks out of the old incompetency. Space elevator allows him to sit GOP/Dems down and say you get 0% taxes across the board and free health care. Every one of you votes yes or I fuck you up in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>Right now he is helpless against a staged financial crisis or some such. Deep state will continually demand that POTUS bends the knee. He can do that, or he can rise above. No real middle ground here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: If the gov., that is a enterprise, can make profits by shilling the globalist, without constitution they will have all rights to do so; we can&#39;t count on the goodwill of the gov. to avoid this kind of scenario, thus a constitution and some form of protectionism is needed, the questions is to what extend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, how do you plane to enforce competency? What if the shit already hit the fan so to speak? </p>

<p>A: The main thing you need for competency is free speech, I think. People will always have good ideas. It&#39;s just a matter of whether they make it into the public domain.</p>

<p>You need robust protections against endemic sociopathy like freemasonic gangstalking or whatever, right? That&#39;s the kind of thing that killed free speech in the west.</p>

<p>There are technological solutions to this that we can imagine. If everyone had a device similar to a phone that uploaded media to a public commons but had no ID (you can get temporary single transaction identifiers), open source the servers and distribution and allow public inspection, etc., you can make something like Wikileaks but better because of universal accessibility and not being a CIA front, right? There are ways to go about protecting free speech into the future at any rate, and I think that will prohibit incompetency.</p>

<p>People are not decadent or spoiled or whatever. Where we ended up isn&#39;t a &quot;natural&quot; course of wealth societies. People get killed for talking sense by the state. Big difference. </p>

<p>I think this is instructive. We should feel free (and be encouraged) to share our ideas publicly, at least among this community, and not just re: Space Elevators. What interesting ideas have been spawned in your mind since all this HLI/SE2 stuff emerged?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those of you who know history, you know Bannon is a fraud. For those of you who don&#39;t, here is where you are ignorant:</p>

<p>Throughout history we&#39;ve had many world reserve currencies. Before the US dollar it was the British pound, the French, Netherlands, etc., preceded these systems. All of these systems last 90 years or so, the amount of time the US has had dominance.</p>

<p>Each system marshaled the real resources of the domestic population to enforce acceptance of fiat throughout the developed economic world. The banking cabal, with the power of the printing press and first access to fresh fiat, buys up hard assets. Then, they use income from fraudulent acquired hard assets to buy up all the gold and silver towards the end of each cycle.</p>

<p>Because usurious debt systems are intrinsically unstable, and the banking cabal knows this, they begin to introduce the idea that only &quot;hard&quot; currency has &quot;real&quot; value when they are preparing to abandon fiat, but of course after having cornered the market on gold/silver.</p>

<p>Then, when people are persuaded we must return to &quot;hard&quot; money, there is no actual transfer of power. The banking cabal is the only one left with any substantial amount of the &quot;hard&quot; money that it got for free by printing fiat.</p>

<p>So, not only does the banking cabal get richer, it gets to jettison the failing fiat and pick a new country to be the next foot soldier in its war against mankind.</p>

<p><strong>The isolationism of Bannon, the ideas that Bannon promotes like the US debt and unfunded liabilities being too large to ever overcome, are his signaling to the usurious banking cabal that he is on their side.</strong>He agrees that the fate of the US must be catastrophic depression to clear out &quot;mathematically impossible&quot; debt obligations in his view.</p>

<p>True Americanism is radically different than anything that Bannon is doing. </p>

<p>I am reading the LaRouche PDF. There are a few good videos on YouTube from LaRouche&#39;s organization outlining the Aristotle vs Plato arguement (in lecture from). The content is more digestible as LaRouche himself tends to be a very tangential speaker/writer:</p>

<p>My sense is that the truth lies in some highly subjective personal place of conscious thought. Remember Christ said in Rev 3:20, <em>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it helps to know what exactly does he mean by &quot;knocking at the door&quot;. In the context, the question is on the awakening of oneself after reading through the Origin of Consciousness book. From HLI&#39;s answer and my thoughts, it&#39;s that we should know ourselves to understand that the &quot;knocking at the door&quot; isn&#39;t part of who we are. &quot;Knocking at the door&quot; could mean something like desires/shallow attempts at something. We don&#39;t need to make &quot;knock at something&quot;. If we understand ourselves, we will awaken to what we want without an obstacle before us...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johndclare.net/Russ12_Jokes.htm">One Hundred Russian Jokes</a></p>

<p><strong>In a society where you could be sent to Siberia for speaking out openly, few Russians criticised the government.   They expressed their views in the forms of jokes – which they called anekdoty (anecdotes = little stories).   The KGB knew about these anecdotes, and you could be arrested for telling them.   The jokes give us unprecedented, secret insight into the attitudes of Russians towards their lives.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The first 50 jokes are so-called ‘Armenian Radio’ anecdotes, the Russian equivalent of our ‘Question:…; Answer:…’ jokes.   They are based on the popular perception of Armenians as ‘clever but subversive’.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that they&#39;re isn&#39;t sufficient attention to warrant the creation of a new sub. Despite HLI gaining more traction in recent weeks, still doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s enough to take it to critical mass- where we&#39;ll see the most growth is when any number of the predictions he&#39;s made come to fruition.</p>

<p>I read through u/MrsMadHatter04 response, and was struck by the similarity of the  things we all took away: the need to convince people by not only exposing evil, but explaining why it&#39;s done, as well as articulating a better vision: aka Hope. HOPE.
If you read back to my first reply u/darkomantis you&#39;ll see I said something similar. In this sub we and others like us, pore through the  raw data and attempt to expose the fallacy in the news &amp; media, so we can figure out what&#39;s really going on in the world. At some point we&#39;ll try and tell others so that they can wake up too, right?</p>

<p>Like HLI says and as well know,when presented with the truth, people either shirk away or they attack you as a nut. Especially a truth that turns a lot of their existing &#39;truths&#39; into lies.But if you explain why it&#39;s done - peadophilie rings provide elites protection in the form of blackmail M.A.D etc- they&#39;re more likely to understand what you&#39;re saying and not feel as threatened-  granted, you&#39;re now you&#39;re in a better place ...  but it still isn&#39;t enough.
I joined reddit a year back specifically to take part in discussions on r/conspiracy after a friend sent me a link from here. Im a cynical mid 20s now but spent my optimistic-teens watching Zeitgeist, Fahrenheit9/11, 9/11-JFK everything&#39;s a rich mans trick and other consciousness expanders of a similar ilk.  I felt I&#39;d woken up! Really got the world now! I mean how couldn&#39;t other people see these things?? It was obvious right? So I started crusading. &quot;Do you know how money is created?&quot; &quot;Do you know why oil is traded in dollars??&quot; &quot;How about the Middle East - why do you think we invaded Iraq? Or Syria??!&quot;
After a while I just stopped. People didn&#39;t want to know. Even when they did the research and came back, they were like - &quot;ok. So what?&quot; 
And I feel like that&#39;s where this sub is. We collectively recognise the illusions perpetuated by TPTB and all have tried at some point to inform someone who doesn&#39;t what&#39;s actually going on. But unless we develop a way to link that to a vision of what is possible, I fear we&#39;ll never succeed. HLI&#39;s questions sessions are the kind of thing I guess I was looking for all this time - hope. A vision articulated. At first it was enough to be awake- to realise things weren&#39;t as they seemed with the world and from that point on seeing everything differently. But then it became burdensome, labouring under the weight of uncomfortable truths that you can&#39;t really share because people don&#39;t believe you or don&#39;t really care ... most of the time because they don&#39;t see how it concerns them. But what if you could show explain to them how it concerns them: &quot;Did you know we have the technology to create space elevators harness solar energy at a magnitude far greater than what we currently do? Enough to raise global GDP to $1M per capita?&quot; &quot;We can cure cancer- were you aware?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to trying to unravel Pizzagate, and the like, that you add another prong to your arsenal; seek to demonstrate opportunity and let the gap between our potential and the state of affairs serve as a proof of conspiracy to those who are not aware. You can show people there is something deeply wrong by giving them hope - which we all need to cope with the darkness that is real.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember what HLI says about &quot;the emperor with clothes off effect&quot; -  I think he&#39;s saying for a mass awakening to occur ,its not enough for people to know it&#39;s all bullshit- they have to know that everyone else knows. If this sub should have any kind of purpose, it&#39;s to move past being a protest group to TPTB, and develop our collective awareness to show people how massively the fuckeries we endure, detracts from our potential.</p>

Because basically anyone could pop up now, hijack some historical personalities or some enlightenment activities and claim: they were &quot;our&quot; members and &quot;our&quot; actions (see below). Some concise and referenced TL,DR needed because the amount of records and books is probably too vast, really, who has time to sift through all that considering that much has been edited or misinterpreted.

    <div class="md"><p>For the record I keep an open mind to all conspiracy theories. I thoroughly enjoy this very community. I do not see HLI statements as misinformation, nor do I see it as fact. A good portion of what he talks about im certain can be attributed to truth. In regards to Asian conspiracies-I expect that any NWO or OWO groups or splinter elements should contain within its structure members and agendas from all nations of the world. I have read many theories and have discovered very little about China&#39;s interaction, other than vague ideas. I would expect that there is a question that begs to be answered in regards to Chinas specific connection and activities in the worlds secret conspiracy&#39;s. As to your last statement about the nature of the conspiracy reddit community,  - all aspects of evil and events that transpire in its actions should be disected including what caused the state of affairs. This is the very nature of truly being able to expose conspiracy&#39;s. Understanding such allows us to pinpoint the perpetrators, there agendas, both in past present and future. For the very conspiracy&#39;s that this community is reporting, is unlaid upon our world in a way to decieve and thwart the very people that report on it. Every source of information weather msm or alternative are within the influence of NWO or OWO. All the pieces of the puzzle(both fake and real) brings with it the possibility of uni lateral, bi lateral, or multi lateral, conspiracies and agendas. Truth with lies, lies about truth, engineered truth backed by lies. Lies told to achieve truth. Lies about Lies. </p>

<p>Is anyone grappling with the upsurge of doubt/chaos/anger that he mentioned accompanies the  awakening to the reality of the regime&#39;s clear disdain for us?</p>

<p>Not personally but a friend who I introduced to HLI, <em>Origins of Consciousness</em> etc quite his job last week Wednesday. Literally told his boss it&#39;s all bullshit and walked out. He&#39;s a commodities trader and used to make fairly good money, his girlfriend (who I schooled with) is distraught and doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten in to him.. she&#39;s nowhere near as open minded so he hasn&#39;t told her... I certainly didn&#39;t. I feel bad for him but also happy.. it&#39;s given me a little bit more <em>oomph</em> to continue trying to spread the word, despite the ridicule and disbelief I&#39;ve encountered trying the same with others.
The 100thmonkey is being created, critical mass is inevitable.</p>

<p>*i haven&#39;t read through this thread in a while, it&#39;s good to see some familiar faces and some new ones.. keep going guys, you all fucking rock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find that very odd... Yes, you could regard the posts as &quot;spam&quot; but this seems more deliberate. 4Chan mods more than likely are suppressing since it&#39;s picking up wind. You&#39;re doing a good job tracking the anon. Just be careful </p>

<p>Q: Also, how do you plane to enforce competency? What if the shit already hit the fan so to speak?
A: The main thing you need for competency is free speech, I think. <strong>People will always have good ideas. It&#39;s just a matter of whether they make it into the public domain.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is instructive. We should feel free (and be encouraged) to share our ideas publicly, at least among this community, and not just re: Space Elevators. What interesting ideas have been spawned in your mind since all this HLI/SE2 stuff emerged?</p>
