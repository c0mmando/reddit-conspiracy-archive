       ...but that's not what I think.  I mean, I would tell my friends in a "You won't believe what I saw" kind of a way but I certainly wouldn't feel compelled to go to the media so I can be ridiculed.  Unless I had ABSOLUTE UNDENIABLE PROOF, then I would feel obligated to share.  But on just a sighting?  nah

       He is the only UFO celebrity that I like.  He is passionate enough about it that I think he would be able to help come up with the best way to move forward.  And if he couldn't help, I'm sure he could at least point me in the right direction.   Plus I love the Ghostbusters.

       I gotta say nobody. I tell people if they ask. I've had two encounters. One was very brief when I was young. It was just a formation of stars that took off across the sky. The other lasted for hours. Two craft bobbing around passing a beam of light between them. I watched them for hours with my girlfriend at the time. Ten miles due east of Fargo North Dakota, around October, 2001, 12:00 am through 3:00 am. We called him Marvin. The encounter lasted for hours. Probably a weather balloon filled with swamp gas. What do you tell people?

       I meant it as a rhetorical, but none-the-less. There is nothing to say. These days you can have a video and a used alien condom and nobody will believe you. Our entire media is so gaslit that nothing matters anymore. You can toe the line or fuck off. It sucks, in this internet age of connectivity we have been divided more so now than ever.

       No one.  Extraterrestrials really aren't that big a deal, as far as I am concerned.  Do you freak out if you see a crow on someone's lawn?

       It would also depend on which group of them it was, though.  The
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       positive ones are more difficult to deal with than some of the negative ones in a way, because the energy is very confrontational.  That energy wants to drag everything to the surface, bring it all together, and make you totally coherent; and most of us are less ready for that now than we were on the day we were born.

       If they were mildly but not uncomfortably positively polarised, they were capable of making themselves appear largely (although not necessarily entirely) indistinguishable from baseline humanity, and they just wanted to come down one evening to smoke a few cones and have a chat, then I would have no objections.  I might sound superficial regarding their appearance, but I just want something ordinary.  Blonde angels are likely to freak me out just as much as reptiles or giant bugs.

       Humans keep secrets from themselves, and each other.  We all do.  We repress how much we'd rather be doing something else, other than working in a call center day in and day out.  We communicate with people on Facebook and our mobile phones who we'd often rather disown and tell to fuck off, but we keep putting up with them because we think that's the "nice" thing to do.  We see a couple of men kissing in the street, and initially experience a wave of nausea, before repressing it because we know that that isn't a "progressive," or politically correct attitude.  In other words, we keep ourselves tied down and locked up in a million different ways, bury how we are really feeling, and then use antidepressants to try and paper over the cracks; and most of all, while doing this, we tell ourselves that we are free.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are in the presence of truly positive or benevolent extraterrestrials, (or even some humans if their energy is positive enough) it becomes extremely uncomfortable, because if you let your guard down even slightly, then all of the little suppressions and acts of self-dishonesty and things that you don't want to think about come rushing to the surface.  Their energy encourages openness and transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love corresponds with coherence, integration, and integrity.  Real love doesn't have secrets.  Beings which exist in a constant, highly benevolent state, are therefore unbelievably threatening to individuals who are not coherent or authentic; and in the current time, that means most people in the Western world, including me.  The worst part of the day for me psychologically is usually the first hour after I wake up, because it takes about that long for the mask to fall back into place, where I can tell myself that I am happy with the way I am living, even though I know I'm not.

       I've seen several, and, on one occasion, I had reason to believe there was at least one present which I couldn't see; it didn't occur to me that they needed reporting, and frankly, now that I think about it, there isn't any agency I can think of that I trust to deal with alien visitors in a humane and civilized fashion.
