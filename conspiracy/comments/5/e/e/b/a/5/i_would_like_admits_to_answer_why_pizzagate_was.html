       Didn't that turn out to be just a standard day care center? They used cardboard in the windows when the kids were napping or something like that. Like the company had to change it's name and number because they kept getting screwed with which made reddit feel like a jerk for about 20 minutes. Or am I thinking of another incident involving a day care center? I feel like there were a few of them for some reason.

       Yeah that's just serious bullshit anyways because they don't do a damn thing against all the SJW/feminist/SRS etc... type subs which frequently post information about people, their alleged crimes without any court ruling, false information/fake statistics, brigade other subs, and do weird shit like banning people specifically only because of the subs they've participated with in the past. They clearly made biased decisions that have an agenda or allow them to push a specific narrative all with the goal of preventing information the news/media doesn't like. They don't want to lose control over being able to manipulate the population into making the decisions they want them to make and the fact that Hillary didn't win they realized they were losing that control. They try to claim they are trying to make the site more advertiser friendly but even though we know that's bullshit it would mean they are perfectly happy to destroy the point of the site just so they can make even more money. What the fuck happened to integrity?
      </p>
      <p>
       The news/media uses bullshit fake issues as a way to keep us fighting each other. They want to stop us from ever discussing any of the actual problems the world is facing because literally every single one of those problems were created by the stupid rich assholes who don't even consider themselves apart of humanity. Having us fix things would basically remove their iron grip on the world that they've either blackmailed or setup so they are a monopoly which prevents competition coming up to develop/produce/construct/etc... the things they have been failing to do. Keeping us separated into different groups, thinking were all different, and preventing us from working together to make the world better. It really just seems like the rich's only purpose in this world is to increase suffering and death as much as possible. They really shouldn't exist anymore.

       This directive came from the investors. The kitchen is too hot. It was already infested by shills and liars dismissing the leads and all too coincidental coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's legacy will be complicity to Satanic Ritual Abuse and Child Trafficking, and against freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will backfire on the investors - including Jared Leto and Snoop Dogg. I hope they are proud of shutting down a public investigation into Satanic Ritual Abuse, Child Trafficking, Corruption and Collusion. Good job guys.

       Remember the absolute best way to make anyone investigating your organization is to do made up "satanic" rituals. Reason being is that the moment any person hears "satanic ritual" they instantly think of movies, TV, Comics etc... and so they fall back on preconceived notions of that it's just completely fake/false and the person reporting on it is just trying to trick people or are pushing some new movie w/e. Basically it's a great and easy way to make any investigators lose all respectability by the public and or be considered a crazy person looking for satan. If you want it to be impossible to investigate things that's exactly how you do it. Plus it helps to weed out a lot of less willing people to participate in their random shit.

       They're also summarily banning ANY and ALL r/pizzagate spin-off subgroups, which makes two things clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) This initiative is motivated by external government related pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The very act of banning r/pizzagate is tacit, concerted protection of a paedophile network.

       Reddit took away our freedoms when they were originally bought out by one of the big 6 news/media companies. Shit's just going to continue to get worse until people wake up and force the government to reintroduce anti-monopoly/limits to media concentration.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all went down hill fast in the 90's with bill clinton and his telecommunications act of 1996. When that passed it basically gave the major companies a free pass to destroy all smaller competition as well as collude together to control news/information to the masses(however manipulations of elections had been going on significantly longer). It allowed these major companies to become massive conglomerates who own just about all news/media/entertainment in the nation as well as most parts of the world. Good old clinton shafted us as he was getting a blowjob and it makes you wonder how much worse things would have gotten if the other clinton had won.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all until we start to target these major/monopoly corporations things will continue to get worse but I have absolutely no idea how to even get the ball rolling on that. There would have to be a group dedicated to it that could investigate these companies, the people controlling them, the politicians they control, their moves in the government system, and especially who their enemies would be. Other than that though I have no idea what to do and it makes me sad that I can't figure out how to fix things. I'd probably also have to be rich to fund it all but I mean why deal with that problem when I don't even know what kinda actions would be a starting point.

       Some of the mods claimed it was a bullshit excuse because they were deleting any questionable posts as soon as they appeared. It looks like this is censorship/damage control plain and simple, and it's no coincidence that it occurred right after the New York Times and other outlets mentioned the subreddit.

       It's interesting that the "fake news" idea has already been absorbed by the mainstream public.  My 70+ mom told me today that all the pedophilia emails were determined to be fake.  If I am reading anything from an online source, it's fake.  She said "That's all from that online fake news.  You can't believe most of what's online anymore."  Wow.  She's Republican. It worked.

       And if Reddit for a moment announced as much, and said, "we have to crowdfund our legal fees or it's getting taken down," guarantee you enough money would be raised in 5 minutes. The community would
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       the opportunity for Alefantis to begin defending this in court. The subpoenas alone would be glorious.

       I don't condone death threats, but it's obvious they're running damage control any way they can. People were and still are finding documentary evidence that should've led to a serious investigation. Instead, they are being protected. Makes me want to vomit.
