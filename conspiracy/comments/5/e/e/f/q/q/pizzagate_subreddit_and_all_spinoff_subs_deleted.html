<p>Voat is also down a lot in the last hour, probably from all the traffic it&#39;s getting from people leaving reddit. </p>

<p>The fact they not only deleted the whole sub, but all the spin-off subs as well, is really amazing. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee87e/all_pizzagate_spin_off_subreddits_also_getting/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee87e/all_pizzagate_spin_off_subreddits_also_getting/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here for more than six years myself, and I&#39;m not remotely surprised.  I&#39;ve known Reddit was a neo-Stalinist hugbox for pretty much the entire time.  Safe spaces aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: this is a throw-away account, I will not be using it further nor answering any questions</p>

<p>Edit2: impossible to get such a piece passed my editor, so I&#39;m leaving it here for people to distribute (send it to journos if you have the emails, it will silently resonate)</p>

<p>We are told the work on <a href="/r/Pizzagate">/r/Pizzagate</a> (and other message boards) is illegitimate because people are rushing to conclusions, or because they are being paranoid, or partisan (despite so many of different political complexions provably working together). The subtitle here of course is that the State is solely legitimate to suspect and investigate crimes.</p>

<p>But what if the State itself is, in a systemic way, responsible for said crimes? It wouldn&#39;t be a first; after all, democide (death by government, a word surprisingly absent from conversations) was the first cause of non-natural deaths in the 20th century. Whether one is from the right, left, or center, one cannot deny government is the number one abuser, enslaver and serial-killer in History. We may honestly disagree on the ways to eradicate the phenomenon, or we may regret that fact, but we cannot deny it.</p>

<p>So, if the State itself is committing crimes, it is the people&#39;s sovereign and sacred duty to expose it. Those who understand this truth best tend to become journalists. At least, that&#39;s what drove me to the profession.</p>

<p>Now specifically on this work. First, there is context; institutional child abuse is already a common-knowledge phenomenon. From the Presidio affair to Jimmy Saville and the BBC, or from the Vatican&#39;s historic involvement in covering-up pedophilia to US legislators&#39; documented trips on the &quot;Lolita Express&quot;, from the questions still surrounding Dutroux to the Hampstead doubts, the scourge has been featured in the news, movies, documentaries, art work. There have also been many policymakers, prosecutors, investigators and victims denouncing the very phenomenon; see for example British MP John Mann passionate speech before Parliament on the subject last year, or the extensive report by former undercover Interpol agent (Bannon). Indeed it is a secret de Polichinelle. So the only possible disagreement can be on the scale and systemicity of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>To honestly decide whether that&#39;s what we are seeing in the Podesta emails, please have a look at this one example. Look at the invitation at the end of the thread. Ms Luzzatto is inviting people (among which are John and Mary Podesta) to a farm in Lovettsville. This is what she says:</p>

<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so youâ€™ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>

<p>Impossible, you say? They couldn&#39;t possibly be speaking about abusing the children! After all, what step-grandmother would offer three innocent children up for group abuse?</p>

<p>This is how invitee Drew Littman answers the invitation:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware, Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina&#39;s 3rd congressional district; in DC he&#39;s regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.</p>

<p>Agreed, if that example was the only one, one could dismiss it as baroque misinterpretation. But there&#39;s more, much more. Let&#39;s not even get into the handkerchiefs and codewords - even though &quot;cheese pizza&quot; is a known euphemism for &quot;child porn&quot; (and there are abundant examples in the Podesta emails where that term is used in very strange and out-of-context manners).</p>

<p>How about the fact that John and Tony Podesta are old friends of Jeffery Epstein, Dennis Hastert and Clement Freud, three convicted child molesters? Who has so many child rapists as friends? Who stays friends with child rapists after they&#39;re exposed and convicted?</p>

<p>How about the Katy Grannan photos plastered around the Podestas&#39; mansion, depicting naked teenagers?</p>

<p>How about Tony Podesta writing he&#39;s &quot;very good and a little wired&quot; from being seated next to &quot;the kids&quot; on an airplane?</p>

<p>How about the underground vault on the Podestas&#39; property which admittedly allows them to watch &quot;very complicated video pieces&quot;?</p>

<p>If you are feeling ill-at-ease, that reaction is honorable. And the worse thing is you haven&#39;t yet seen much. But for more, you&#39;ll have to look for it. Indeed one might be breaking statutory laws by linking to some of the clues Internet sleuths have found in the past three weeks.</p>

<p>For example, did you know James Alefantis, listed 49th &quot;most influential&quot; person in DC by GQ, chef and White House regular, boyfriend of David Brock, owner of Comet Ping Pong, had an Instagram account filled with references to and depictions of child abuse and torture? Indeed it&#39;s not just the frescoes in his restaurant or the &quot;artists&quot; he hosts there; it&#39;s not even the fact his menu and the logos of three other iconic businesses next door feature FBI-recognized pedophilia symbols. No, this is about his own posts, pictures, comments and friends on social media. Again, you&#39;ll have to look it up for yourself. It is hardly ambiguous. Indeed it is Alefantis who puts the pizza in #Pizzagate.</p>

<p>If that surprises you, did you know Arun Rao was caught &quot;liking&quot; several of Alefantis&#39; creepiest toddler Instagram posts? Again, that could be dismissed - only there&#39;s all this context, and the fact Mr Rao is a Assistant US attorney, and charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re still not distinguishing the pattern, did you know that Laura Silsby (Gayler), the woman caught trying to smuggle thirty-three children out of Haiti (a country where the Clinton Foundation isn&#39;t without controversy), whose release from jail became a personal matter for Ms Clinton, thereafter became an associate of MyStateUSA, which changed its name to AlertSense, and which is the one providing the technology to issue Amber Alerts?</p>

<p>Enough already. If anything I have proven the legitimacy of the following question:</p>

<p>Is there a systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC, as we already suspect there is one in Hollywood?</p>

<p>In terms of national systemicity, the statistics are eloquent. The International Centre for Missing Children (ICMEC) estimates that 8 million children are reported missing each year around the world. Of that number, according to U.S. Department of Justice research, an estimated 800,000 children will go missing in the United States alone â€” a rate of over 2&#39;000 missing children each day â€” with 466,949 of those cases entered into the FBIâ€™s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database in 2014. With a current child population (aged 0 â€“ 17) of around 74 million in the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice figures equate to around 1 child in every 92 going missing in the United States each year.</p>

<p>This looks like a systemic problem indeed. Childhood disappearances outnumber cancer deaths in the United States by one third.</p>

<p>Therefore, given the sheer amount of leaked emails, and the suspected phenomenon&#39;s scale and repartition, it is likely the data dumps (Podesta and other Wikileaks, Guccifer 1/2, DNCLeaks, etc.) provide some clue to the problem. Therefore, they should be investigated thoroughly under than particular lens, and suspicions need to be corroborated with other (and previously) known facts.</p>

<p>So, my fellow journalists, why aren&#39;t you all looking into this? Is it easy for you to dismiss it as confirmation bias?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to answer the question for you. At least hop on the bandwagon: this is coming out with or without your help. But remember some moments are defining, in one&#39;s career, for one&#39;s conscience.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll conclude with two excerpts of the Munich Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists (kind of our own Hippocratic Oath).</p>

<p>The responsibility of journalists vis-a-vis the public has precedence over any other responsibility, in particular towards their employers and the public power.</p>

<p>[A journalist&#39;s duties include] respecting the truth no matter what consequences it may bring about to him, ... defending the freedom of information, of commentaries and of criticism, [and] not suppressing essential information.</p>

<p>... and one question:</p>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t matter, what does?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is the proof that multiple pieces of Katy Grannan&#39;s art depicting nude minors were on display at Manor Podesta?</p>

<p>Outright declaring so many people pedophiles without solid evidence is really fucked up. Thats a life-ruiner, there must be incontrovertible proof before you move forward with accusations.</p>

<p>Especially worrisome is that false claims keep being repeated (the artist depiction sketches, for one!).</p>

<p>Like with that Nickelodeon dude, people are stating as fact things that are only supposition and circumstantial. People gather the mobs on that flimsy evidence, then once the mob is assembled brain function shuts down and it&#39;s time for lynch&#39;em&#39;all mode.</p>

<p>Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents&#39; suburban homes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t state which pieces. The piece being shown in the misleading infographic was shown for maximum smear, not because there is any proof it is one of the pieces they own. (Nor would that in itself be sufficient evidence to hang your hat on, as it has been shown theyre into edgy provactive modern art crap.)</p>

<p>That kind of lazy, misleading crap works against pizza hunting peeps. Stick to facts, dont create misleading amd downright false propaganda. It makes the entire thing look like dumbshit kids with no self control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well when someone can make a credible post without a ton of errors or assumptions in every other statement, I&#39;d be more willing to believe something is going on. Some of you see an e-mail saying &quot;pizza for dinner 8pm?&quot;  and freak the hell out thinking it&#39;s some kind of code for banging little kiddies. I still see ZERO evidence of something actually happening and some of you guys make it even more harder to believe when they just throw up a bunch of loosely connected events in MS Paint and say it&#39;s &quot;100% proof this is true!!!!&quot;  and then it gets debunked in the first 30 seconds of it being up. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m far from a Hillary &quot;supporter&quot;, I hate Donald and everything he represents. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s interesting you seemingly stopped posting for a month and had never posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before even though your account is a year old. So what exactly is your point? Sounds like you&#39;re the shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh seems like you have not looked into the thing at all, you think people got suspecious because of one email saying pizza for dinner? No, there were a lot more emails that were using general food terms like pizza, hot dogs and sausage that made NO sense in any context that they were written in and could only make sense if they were code for something, that is what got people suspicous, and that is what got people to investigate further... I mean who says &#39;&#39;want a pizza for an hour&#39;&#39;, or the handkerchief one were he says it has a pizza related map on it(WTF does that mean?) or the email were they say dominos on pizza...And it turned out that investigators found that pizza is a code term that is used within the pedophile and child trafficking circles. </p>

<p>Then you have Podestas and Clintons connection to Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong, with Alefantis creepy instagram account with pictures that made the whole thing even more fucking suspecious because some of the pictures he had uploaded were disturbing and was pointing to pedophilia. There is so much more to pizzagate then that but that is some of the summary.  </p>

<p>So don&#39;t come here with your bullshit disinformation that people got freaked because of one email saying &#39;&#39; pizza for dinner&#39;&#39;, there is truth to pizzagate otherwise it would have not exploded like it did and it would not have experienced the harsh censorship it has gotten so far if it was all just bullshit. Also pedophile rings within the higher ups of society is not a new thing, a few have been exposed like for example in the UK and Belgium. Do not think that the U.S is an exception, ever heard of the Franklin scandal? </p>

<p>I am a lurker, i hardly post on Reddit, i only do it when i feel like it. So no i&#39;m not a shill, a shill would be more dismissive like you are being right now. </p>

<p>The thing that really saddens me at times, is that they don&#39;t realise that it isn&#39;t actually the psychopaths who are a problem; it&#39;s <strong><em>them.</em></strong></p>

<p>When politicians talk about wanting to put cameras everywhere in order to &quot;protect the children,&quot; (which is the fascist appeal of last resort, and is especially hypocritical considering the likes of PizzaGate) we could prevent said politicians from being listened to, if it wasn&#39;t for people like the above.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never liked it when someone&#39;s only justification for increased government presence is &quot;But what about the children?!?!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a blatant appeal to emotion designed to draw a line that no decent human wants to cross (You&#39;re either on our side, or you&#39;re against the safety of the children) It&#39;s akin to your ex-wife using your kids as a carrot on a stick to exploit you to get what she wants. It&#39;s the oldest political tool in the book and nobody thinks to question it.</p>

<p>The sad truth is, that Paedophiles and neer-do-wells have existed for as long as we have been a civilized species. The only thing that&#39;s changed is the availability of information surrounding them. The ignorant masses are given unlimited access to things like registry lists and offender locations (which I am not questioning as a bad thing, but more to my point) which convinces them that they are not safe anywhere. As soon as legislation pops up that&#39;s questionable, just toss in there mentions that it&#39;s &quot;for the childrens protection&quot; and suddenly everyone is on board.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I suspect you tossed those buzzwords out there without knowing what they actually mean.</p>

<p>Libel is an intentionally fallacious statement made in writing with the intent to damage the reputation of someone. Taking perceived evidence and investigating is not libel. Nobody involved with any actual investigative efforts has come out and stated as a matter of fact that any crime has been committed. They may believe this to be true, based on their interpretation of the evidence. However, belief is not libel. Again, nobody has made any kind of public statement. It&#39;s all been within the realm of hypothesis.</p>

<p>Slander is the same thing as libel, except with spoken word and statements. Again, nobody is committing slander.</p>

<p>Nobody is trying to damage anyone&#39;s reputation. They are simply following a trail of evidence wherever it takes them. If their evidence is wrong, then it&#39;s wrong. Following leads, clues, and investigating does not equal &quot;Libel and Slander&quot;. Is a spouse who hires a PI to investigate her husband comitting libel and slander?</p>

<p>Speaking without consequence is the exact idea behind free speech. Because this mentality of &quot;You can say what you want but you better be prepared to suffer the consequences&quot; is not free speech. Punishing someone for their words is suppression, which means your &quot;free speech&quot; comes with stipulations. Free speech is free speech. It&#39;s either all or nothing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what people are doing when they continue to blame the wrong guy over (Andrew Kline) and over and over again as well as the Podesta Brother&#39;s to drag Hillary into some muck. Again, continuing to say something to damage their reputation, like this, is libelous, because it has been proven by people on the same fucking subreddit to be untrue. If you don&#39;t think this shit is intentional, there&#39;s no point in arguing. You are right, however, about the slander. But that&#39;s because this a text based media and not verbal. I&#39;m sure some crackpot reporter will make these claims verbally here soon enough. </p>

<p>As far as free speech goes, you have the right to say whatever the fuck you want and we have the right to make you look like a complete fucking idiot for saying the dumb shit that is being repeated over and over after it already has been disproven. Free speech has ALWAYS come with stipulations, whether you like it or not. There&#39;s always been limitations and to suggest otherwise is either you being a pedant or you just being a liar. You&#39;re free to call me a nigger, I&#39;m going to bash your fucking skull in. </p>

<p>If words, either spoken or typed, rile you to physical action, then maybe the internet is not the place for you. If you are unable to control your psychopathic urges, then it only makes sense that you feel this way about free speech.</p>

<p>[Edit:] The whole blaming the wrong guy was likely unintentional. Cops, however, do this kind of thing all the time. Often to the effect of destroying their suspects life irreparably. That&#39;s not a free speech issue per say, however, it&#39;s an unintended consequence of investigation. Based on what I have read, Hillary is only really complacent in this issue. Her ties to the Haitian orphanage and that woman who got caught trying to smuggle 33 children out of the country are known and established, however, I personally don&#39;t believe that she&#39;s as directly involved as people want her to be. Correlation doesn&#39;t (always) equal causation.</p>

<p>John Podesta, however, is directly involved. How much so remains to be seen. A lot of the people following the investigation just want to touch something historic before it blows up so they can say they were involved or they watched it unfold. These are likely the people you&#39;re finding an issue with. The ones making threats and threatening statements as well as posting statements that use flimsy evidence in order to implicate someone. This, however, does not reflect the whole of the effort. There are people who are actually trying to sort this shit out. They are NOT the ones making the statements you have an issue with. So to say that the ENTIRE effort is libelous based on the actions of a minority of the followers is a stretch.</p>

<p>The intent of the investigation was NEVER about damaging the character of those involved. It&#39;s always been about trying to get to the truth behind everything. While I personally am not sure whether or not all of the information is founded, I have to admit that, as a skeptic, there are a great deal of coincidences and mysteries surrounding this. Too many to ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the only one who understands how the open marketplace of ideas functions. It would appear, however, that the masses have lost touch with this.</p>

<p>The idea behind free speech is that, when everyone is encouraged to bring their ideas and beliefs to the table, these ideas will be scrutinized by others (this is where I believe you derive your belief that there are consequences) Scrutiny is not a consequence to speech. It&#39;s not even really a negative thing. The ability to take feedback and input from others to improve your ideas is a boon.</p>

<p>Ideas that are bad ideas, however, are also welcome to be presented. Your ideas and beliefs should be able to endure scrutiny and ridicule. If you are unable to defend your ideas in an open marketplace, then your ideas are not worth much, if anything. Things like racism and bigotry fall within this category.</p>

<p>The government and &quot;hundreds of millions of people in this country&quot; take an issue to actual free speech because they are preoccupied with feelings. </p>

<p>&quot;You can say what you want, but you cannot hurt someone&#39;s feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>This is absolute horseshit. This whole culture of coddling people&#39;s feelings because everyone gets a medal and deserves to feel included is shit. This is what&#39;s eroded free speech to it&#39;s current state. I&#39;m not saying that anyone should allow someone to be hateful towards them. However, there are more effective ways to deal with hatred than violence.</p>

<p>Hatred is a byproduct of stupidity. Someone who is unable to understand something else on a fundamental level is going to show an abnormally high amount of malice towards it. This is well documented in human civilization. If you&#39;re smart enough to understand something, then you&#39;re smart enough to see it&#39;s flaws and can dismantle it without the need of throwing fists.</p>

<p>Unintelligent people don&#39;t like free speech because actual free speech protects ideas they do not agree with, and cannot combat without violence.</p>

<p>So we have a government who is willing to cater to the malleable masses about how their feelings are valid, and we have masses who feel that their feelings are valid because everyone should be included. Naturally, some people are going to have better ideas than others. That&#39;s just how ideas work. That&#39;s a fact, and facts do not care about your feelings.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t always have great ideas and I am willing to accept that. However I don&#39;t allow my feelings to be more important than my personal growth, and I continue to present ideas.</p>

<p>Failure is not a bad thing. Failure is part of development. However we, as a society, now believe that if we present a bad idea and it gets rejected, that failure is wrong and is a personal blemish. That&#39;s not the case at all. Demanding that your ideas be recognized, whether good or bad, dilutes the marketplace of ideas. It also encourages censorship and suppression.</p>

<p>Special snowflake syndrome has changed how we interact with each other. Over the years, it&#39;s also changed what free speech is. There should be no consequences for speech. There are, however, consequences for actions. So regardless of whatever someone says to you, if you pound their face in, you&#39;re going to be the one going to jail for assault (or worse depending on the injuries inflicted). Those are just facts, and facts don&#39;t care about your feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one adds weight to your point, however, it&#39;s missing a post (was removed) that would add context to why this user was banned.</p>

<p>I am not saying that your point is unfounded, however. This is the first I have heard of users being banned for expressing an opposing view. I have seen this more often on politics and worldnews (which were owned by CTR shills so, by proxy, this was more common in Hillary environments)</p>

<p>I sent the mods a mod mail, inquiring about criticism on the_donald. I guess we will see what happens. If they reply favorably, then I will pursue this further by making criticisms in the sub to test the waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>based off my experience and others with the mods, you will get a response along the lines of either &quot;we&#39;re a pro-trump subreddit and never claimed to be a bastion of free speech&quot; or &quot;CUCK CUCK CUCK CUCK GOD EMPEROR 4D CHESS&quot;, but i do appreciate your open-mindedness to them striking down any kind of criticism against trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>making false allegations is definitely prohibited. not sure where you got the idea that this country is also 100% free speech, you&#39;re thinking everything is black and white when there&#39;s obvious grey areas. And since when does free speech apply to a non-Government entity like Reddit? Besides, if there is an actual an conspiracy, why isn&#39;t <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shut down too???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incredibly racist allegations to boot. I mean it&#39;s obvious that the main reason the Podesta brothers are being attacked is because they&#39;re &quot;swarthy&quot; Mediterranean-looking types, this is also the reason for why they are being compared to ONE swarthy looking-guy on a Portuguese wanted poster, I mean if you think factually you will have to admit there is nothing else linking them to the rendering in the poster except a generic swarthy, ethnic-Mediterranean &quot;resemblance.&quot;</p>
