       All the evidence that I know about is circumstantial. I think the Pizza Gate conspiracy is being used by TPTB to create honey-pots, distract from the actual conspiracies, and to push the fake-news censorship laws.

       This could be a disinformation campaign like what the KGB did in the ColdWar (examples below).

        Andrew described the following active measures by the KGB against the United States:[36]
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Promotion of false John F. Kennedy assassination theories, using writer Mark Lane.[37][not specific enough to verify] Lane denied this allegation and called it "an outright lie".[38]
        </li>
        <li>
         Forged letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to E. Howard Hunt, attempting to incriminate Hunt in the Kennedy assassination.[39]
        </li>
        <li>
         Discrediting the CIA using the ex-CIA case officer and defector Philip Agee.[40][clarification needed]
        </li>
        <li>
         Spreading unconfirmed rumors that the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a homosexual.[41]
        </li>
        <li>
         Attempts to discredit Martin Luther King, Jr. by placing publications portraying him as an "Uncle Tom" who was secretly receiving government subsidies.[42]
        </li>
        <li>
         Stirring up racial tensions in the United States by mailing bogus letters from the Ku Klux Klan, by placing an explosive package in "the Negro section of New York" (operation PANDORA),[43] and by spreading conspiracy theories that Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination had been planned by the US government.[43]
        </li>
        <li>
         Fabrication of the story that the AIDS virus was manufactured by US scientists at the US Army research station at Fort Detrick. The story was spread by Russian-born biologist Jakob Segal.[44]

       How can we trust Google DKIM? If Wikileaks is compromised by  TPTB, Google is part of that group. Is having something verified by Google DKIM impressive when you potentially have access to Google's private keys? Not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there could be something there, but it could also be a fake disinformation campaign.

       Pizzagate could be fake I suppose but my counter to that is: why would anyone that has Hillary Clinton's best interests in mind lead
       <em>
        the internet
       </em>
       to believe that she's an international child sex trafficker? Why would anyone with the U.S. government's best interest in mind lead the internet down that path?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was going to assume that it's fake, I'd only do so for one reason; to throw people off the trail of the Vatican. I can see the D.C. pizza joints as misinfo to lead people off the trail of where this all
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       leads to, which is quite obviously all the way up to the Vatican and the pope himself. I can see them sacrificing the CF, Hillary, and the Podestas only for that purpose.

       I should also explain the reason I talked about the KGB disinformation campaign. The KGB were terrified that they would be blamed for the assassination of JFK, because Oswald tried to move to the USSR and join the KGB. One of the reasons KGB spread false conspiracies, was to help hide this fact from the American public, so they would not be blamed. Pizzagate could be something similar. A fake conspiracy used to muddy the waters, so people can't find the truth or connect the right dots together. An act of misdirection.

       Furthermore, Hillary's interests are not the same interests of the US government. It is important to not confuse the two. Hillary wants money and power. She is/was a pawn of oligarchs like Soros. I think the US Gov has different interests.

       The intelligence community may not want Hillary to be president. The NSA probably know what was on her server. They would know if there is dirt on her that would allow other countries to blackmail her. Also one of the most over looked facts about Benghazi is that it wasn't a state department site that was raided. It was a shared site with the CIA. They might might be pissed too if their people were killed and their plans got ruined because of Hillary.

       because it is not believable without a preponderance of evidence. The world certainly does not believe or even know about this, it is a fringe of the fringe who do. We have no proof of anything at all, not even evidence of anything. It is totally safe for whoever is implicated.

       I'd also like to add that the focus on Pizzagate/Assangeisdead has really marginalized a lot of the damning Wikileaks revelations like the "oil opportunities" created by Isis's location. And that our allies are funding ISIS.

       The latest lead is on a restaurant called We The Pizza. Somebody just leaked 10 CP pics to
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">

       and claimed they hacked them from

        www.wethepizza.com
       </a>
       , people downloaded them and lo and behold it was legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within an hour We The Pizza shut their website down. Several hours later the website comes back online. However some of us noticed that the website has changed. It used to have a login page which can be seen on the wayback machine:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127172305/http://wethepizza.com/login">

       But there are mountains of real pedo in government investigation material that is somehow, magically, never followed up on by the media or courts..like Corbett says:"no one gives a damn".and the Dennis hasterts of the workd get away with a slap on the wrist when they ought to do the world as favor and eat a buffet of bullets

       PizzaGate could be true. Ultimately it doesn't matter what I think. However, it could disinformation, used to create honey-pots or something else. The  conspiracy came from the Chans and Reddit when CTR infested theses places. And we don't know if the Wikileaks is compromised. So everyone should be cynical and make sure they don't get sucked into a honey-pot. That is all.

       Not sure of the time line. When he called into the conference at Buenos Aires he said the emails were being automatically released by a algorithm. And they continued to release the emails after people thought Wikileaks was compromised, but according to Assange they were being released automatically. People believed that the call to Beunos Aires was fake, I don't agree with that theory.

       No. What I said was conspiracy theories about JFK's assassination were created to muddy the waters so that people would over look that Oswell tried to join the KGB. Pizzagate could be a conspiracy theory used to distract from something else.

       That is exactly what I've thought all along. It might have something to do with performance enhancement drugs too. Steven Kotler's book "Stealing Fire" is being published in February and supposedly will blow the lid off a conspiracy of elites using some kind of wonder drug. Or maybe it's just weed and cocaine. But I've been thinking drugs all along.

       It just makes way, way, way more sense.  I think most people have taken drugs in their time.  We know it was rampant in the 80s amongst successful folks.

       Some of the language I've seen, "we've only got once slice to go around", implies a gram of something rather than a child.

       Think about it... reddit's perceived "paranoia" is leveraged to frame the email dialogue into a manic white knight campaign against a satanic cannibal pedo conspiracy, thereby killing two birds with one stone: the alt-right (this is how they see us) and "fake news". End state is we look like fucktards, we feel like fucktards, and MSM regains recent losses. Just a theory. I mean I do still feel like there is something to pizzagate, but this last run WTP and even the Besta/CPP stinks like an operation. A successful one at that.

       I think Pizzagate is fake too. Lots of the proof is just linking together the web/network of bigshot dems. But proof of their social circles doesn't prove the pedophilia/child molestation. Lots of confirmation bias. And like I always said with Pizzagate, it's either the craziest conspiracy in the world, or it's fake.

       There is some stuff that seems suspect, but  it could be like you said confirmation bias. For example the logo on one pizza business had coded meaning and it was promptly changed after people posted about it here.
