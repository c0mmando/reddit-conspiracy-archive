<p>This could be a disinformation campaign like what the KGB did in the ColdWar (examples below). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disinformation campaign against the United States</p>

<p>Andrew described the following active measures by the KGB against the United States:[36]</p>

<ul>
<li>Promotion of false John F. Kennedy assassination theories, using writer Mark Lane.[37][not specific enough to verify] Lane denied this allegation and called it &quot;an outright lie&quot;.[38]</li>
<li>Forged letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to E. Howard Hunt, attempting to incriminate Hunt in the Kennedy assassination.[39]</li>
<li>Discrediting the CIA using the ex-CIA case officer and defector Philip Agee.[40][clarification needed]</li>
<li>Spreading unconfirmed rumors that the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a homosexual.[41]</li>
<li>Attempts to discredit Martin Luther King, Jr. by placing publications portraying him as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; who was secretly receiving government subsidies.[42]</li>
<li>Stirring up racial tensions in the United States by mailing bogus letters from the Ku Klux Klan, by placing an explosive package in &quot;the Negro section of New York&quot; (operation PANDORA),[43] and by spreading conspiracy theories that Martin Luther King, Jr.&#39;s assassination had been planned by the US government.[43]</li>
<li>Fabrication of the story that the AIDS virus was manufactured by US scientists at the US Army research station at Fort Detrick. The story was spread by Russian-born biologist Jakob Segal.[44]

<p>How can we trust Google DKIM? If Wikileaks is compromised by  TPTB, Google is part of that group. Is having something verified by Google DKIM impressive when you potentially have access to Google&#39;s private keys? Not really. </p>

<p>I think there could be something there, but it could also be a fake disinformation campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate could be fake I suppose but my counter to that is: why would anyone that has Hillary Clinton&#39;s best interests in mind lead <em>the internet</em> to believe that she&#39;s an international child sex trafficker? Why would anyone with the U.S. government&#39;s best interest in mind lead the internet down that path?</p>

<p>If I was going to assume that it&#39;s fake, I&#39;d only do so for one reason; to throw people off the trail of the Vatican. I can see the D.C. pizza joints as misinfo to lead people off the trail of where this all <em>really</em> leads to, which is quite obviously all the way up to the Vatican and the pope himself. I can see them sacrificing the CF, Hillary, and the Podestas only for that purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should also explain the reason I talked about the KGB disinformation campaign. The KGB were terrified that they would be blamed for the assassination of JFK, because Oswald tried to move to the USSR and join the KGB. One of the reasons KGB spread false conspiracies, was to help hide this fact from the American public, so they would not be blamed. Pizzagate could be something similar. A fake conspiracy used to muddy the waters, so people can&#39;t find the truth or connect the right dots together. An act of misdirection. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Hillary&#39;s interests are not the same interests of the US government. It is important to not confuse the two. Hillary wants money and power. She is/was a pawn of oligarchs like Soros. I think the US Gov has different interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intelligence community may not want Hillary to be president. The NSA probably know what was on her server. They would know if there is dirt on her that would allow other countries to blackmail her. Also one of the most over looked facts about Benghazi is that it wasn&#39;t a state department site that was raided. It was a shared site with the CIA. They might might be pissed too if their people were killed and their plans got ruined because of Hillary.</p>

<p>Peter Thiel was for Trump and one of his companies was started with money from the CIA. </p>

<p>Paul Bonacci said the elite pedo-ring is global, and based at Fort Offutt AFB in Nebraska.  99% of people here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> don&#39;t know who Paul Bonacci is.  100% of people on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> don&#39;t know &amp; don&#39;t give a fuck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I got to witness <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before it got artificially changed.  Most of the old recognizable usernames are gone.  Most of the new names never gave a fuck about conspiracies previously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just makes way, way, way more sense.  I think most people have taken drugs in their time.  We know it was rampant in the 80s amongst successful folks.</p>

<p>Some of the language I&#39;ve seen, &quot;we&#39;ve only got once slice to go around&quot;, implies a gram of something rather than a child.</p>

<p>I think this is an instance of people trying to make something fit, rather than looking at the evidence and making a conclusion at the end.</p>

<p>Think about it... reddit&#39;s perceived &quot;paranoia&quot; is leveraged to frame the email dialogue into a manic white knight campaign against a satanic cannibal pedo conspiracy, thereby killing two birds with one stone: the alt-right (this is how they see us) and &quot;fake news&quot;. End state is we look like fucktards, we feel like fucktards, and MSM regains recent losses. Just a theory. I mean I do still feel like there is something to pizzagate, but this last run WTP and even the Besta/CPP stinks like an operation. A successful one at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk, i think pizzagate is somehow connected to Assange&#39;s insurance files....my guess is that is what he was going to release -- but reddit detectives are trying to piece it together.</p>

<p>i think WL is owned by CIA or whoever has Assange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Pizzagate is fake too. Lots of the proof is just linking together the web/network of bigshot dems. But proof of their social circles doesn&#39;t prove the pedophilia/child molestation. Lots of confirmation bias. And like I always said with Pizzagate, it&#39;s either the craziest conspiracy in the world, or it&#39;s fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it&#39;s bad for a brand to be associated with pedos or anything else that will ruin it&#39;s reputation. Even if there&#39;s nothing to it, changing the logo was a pretty solid business decision.</p>
