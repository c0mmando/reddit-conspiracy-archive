       Imo whether or not the Russians did anything is still speculative.

       I think it's a tactic to distract people from the content of the emails by focusing their attention on the alleged circumstances surrounding the emails.

       It's all speculation due to his death &amp; timing thereof.  It is my opinion it wasn't the Russians as well based on what Assange stated, no hard evidence being presented, and the lying DNC saying it was the Russians to me means it's must be a lie.

       Perhaps. Or he does not know. Or (what I would say is most likely), he himself is a conservative Christian and does not want to have his political identity associated with Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Putin could have outlawed Evangelism (I never heard that though so I would want a source) but that doesn't change anything. In Russia the conservative Christian movement is Orthodox, not Protestant-based. So as far as an Orthodox Christian would be concerned an Evangelical would be heretical, like a Catholic or a Mormon.

       There are many voters who identify as Democrats who are more disgusted and outraged and disappointed than you.  But HC and her DNC machine made it impossible to clean house and vote Sanders as candidate for the general.  Let's hope that the leaked emails send her and her associates to prison.  But I won't hold my breath.  I think our country escaped the literal and proverbial bullet - she would have had us at war by the second year she took office.

       It's interesting that you say that because I saw an interview with Bernie Sanders and he says because of the electoral college our candidates for presidency only focus on the swing states or the states with lots of electoral votes and pretty much ignore the other less important states with only a few electoral votes. He thinks the candidates for president should focus on all states and all citizens.

       Well to some, the exposing and demonization of one party for practices that are common in both parties, appears to be partisan and not real progress towards fixing anything.  This would fit with Russia's goals in just wanting America to be self-absorbed so that it can increase its influence abroad.

       Some would also say the corrupt practices are far more common on the part of the Democrats, especially when you consider that they have little MSM oversight.  Imagine if the media scrutiny were more equal.

       Corruption should be exposed wherever it exists if we want things to get better within this country.  Fix the internal rot, then focus externally.

       agreed.  Both sides have their narratives that accuse the main supporters of the opposition of being corrupt.  What I see is more sensationalist accounts from both sides.  Which again further's the goals of those who would like to see infighting.  I think in general America would actually be fairly moderate.  It's this media narrative from both extremes that implies and incites conflict.

       There's a blog post I read recently called the Toxoplasma of Rage that I honestly think explains this whole phenomenon extremely well. The main point seems to be that this whole polarizing, infighting thing isn't something anyone is trying to push, but that it's a natural consequence of our national conversation's shift towards social media.

       Thanks for that reference.  I read the blog post and it's very insightful.  The problem with this sort of insight is it can be used destructively.  I'd have to say that someone has clearly been studying  and is using online forums and social media to achieve goals using this dynamic.

       He goes into it more in the Moloch post, but I honestly agree with him when he says there's no one at the rudder of it.  The rise of Trump through the media is a great example; he rose in prominence because of the natural capitalistic effects of being entertaining on a network that profits off of making news entertaining.  The media "turned" on him when he became a viable candidate, not because the media cabal decided it was time, but because the reward of making money off of him got outweighed by the risk of actually getting him into office.  It's all psychohistory.  There's a quote from the Moloch post that I've been turning into my mantra for the past few months: "Almost nobody is evil, almost everything is broken.  We're never fighting flesh and blood, it's power and principalities all the way down."

       The Republican Party didn't put forth shit, the GOP establishment fought tooth and nail to prevent Trump from getting the nomination, they just failed. Honestly, the only real imbalance there was the difference in fields...I believe had there been a dozen democrats squabbling over the nomination then Sanders would have taken it, and if it had been essentially down to Trump and Cruz or Trump and Rubio from the outset then Trump would have lost.

       Both parties were faced with the same, unexpected situation: an "outsider" candidate whose popularity did not fade out during the primaries but who gained momentum and outshone the candidate that was expected to win.  In the case of the GOP, there was resistance.  The DNC got what they deserved in this election by stealing the primary from Sanders.  He did energize politics - throughout the country, his rallies had numbers that Clinton's people couldn't even dream of photoshopping.  Everyone knew she rigged the primary with voting software.  And the DNC was complicit.  So fuck them.  Clinton was so dirty - and now we're learning that she is evil too - that it's better to have someone else serve as President.  But Trump's remarks when introducing Jeffrey Epstein indicate he knew about the sex trafficking and made a joke of it.  That should be troubling to everyone.

       Doesn't mean it's okay for either. Same goes for corruption in Russia, Iceland and hell, even in Norway. It's alive and well because fuckheads are looking at who is doing it and not the act and lack of oversight of it.

       Clever.  State what you are trying to do by saying you have poisoned half of the populace and they must be destroyed in order for you to be free.  Putin is Ex-KGB too.  The way to accomplish: "creating an uninitiated state of war within the United States and it will spread and will not require foreign agents to continue because it's own citizens will begin fighting against each other."  Would be to promote more and more extreme rhetoric for both the right and the left, which is what we see.  This would cause the infighting that they desire.  Recently we have seen more right wing rhetoric coming from Russia, which would be indicative of this strategy.  They could be trying to promote whichever side they feel would cause the most infighting.

       Yes,  there is a shit load of static out there.    Most of the bandwidth is garbage.    We have been turned into junkies for sensationalism,   for hyper-reality,  for enhanced special effects.   The plain truth doesn't look sexy enough,  it doesn't hold the attention.

       "Fake News" and news hoaxes have been going on for quite a while.

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvBQDHqdCck">
          In 1992, NBC fabricated a news story entitled "Waiting to Explode," claiming that a line of trucks produced by General Motors can explode on impact. They ensured that a fire would occur by using a planted incendiary device to cause the fire, used the wrong gas cap, and overfilled the tank. Video also includes recent example of MSNBC caught cropping video to make black guy with a gun appear white, then fabricates a whole narrative about white people possibly shooting the president.

          CNN edits out Milwaukee victim’s sister calling for violence in ‘the suburbs’ making it seem that she advocated for the opposite of what she actually called for.

       Proof? There's certainly evidence that there's something fucky going on with Assange, yet proof? I think we'd rightfully decry the MSM for reporting something like this as true with as little hard evidence as what I've seen for Assange being murdered.

       The man has a lot of ego,  and his only real wealth is his image,  his brand.    He has always fought,  sued,  those who have tried to tarnish his image.   This is about him, not us.    We might as well be his hotel or casino customers.   We are going to get fleeced.   He hopes we will enjoy getting fleeced.   Some of us will.

       Projection is a full time job for people who live in ideological extremes. Democrats
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it's their fault that Hillary lost, but rather than face that reality, they must project their own wrongdoings onto others to protect their psyche. They hear "fake news paid for by Hillary gave you the false impression that she would win" and some brief mental gymnastics later it comes fresh out of the oven as "fake news paid for by the KGB stole Hillary's win from her". Anything to avoid feeling like you were wrong.

       The dnc has this tactic where they accuse the other side of doing what the dnc is already doing. The trick to it is that idiots (the majority of the population) will believe whoever says it first. It gives them the perception that the dnc is not also guilty.

       Well if you consider the fact that fake news stories have been happening long before "it's happening" today, then you you might see how much crazier it is to know that we all are just eating each other's shit over and over again.

       Everybody here
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       the election was fixed, and shared articles proving that thousands of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they were certain, because the polls, which were within 1% of the result for the last three elections, predicted a Clinton win.  Obviously the polls were faked and simply justifying the rigged election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk to me about bots.  All those articles had a top voted comment telling people how somebody was sharing these facts to everybody they knew of facebook, and encouraging us all to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, Trump won.  The aggregate polls were
       <em>
        apparently
       </em>
       off by 4% for the first time this century.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the election wasn't rigged for Clinton (that news was fake), and the organic grassroots army of people telling us to share stuff on facebook was a natural occurrence of concerned citizens who had no major impact on the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could find an entire catalog of accusations in this subreddit that follow the same pattern, and yet the FBI (who proved itself Clinton's enemy on the eve of the election) hasn't even bothered investigating.

       Projection is commonly used by liars. When they're provided with arguments that demonstrate their falsehood they don't debunk them because they can't, so they use rhetoric and misdirect.

       Yup basically those in charge of things thought their mind control was more effective than it was and now they want to prevent that from happening ever again. So the best way for them to do that is to get to label whom is real news and whom is "fake news" which is so incredibly ironic considering how much bullshit the news/media of the "real news" group reports on and never ever has any sort of repercussion from it. It's just sick how bad things are getting. If I was an outside person looking into the situation I'd have to swear there was some kind of super villain group that has taken over the country. Where the hell is the rebellion at? We need a rebellion so badly because we came so damn close to having one of the worst human beings ever created as a leader of the nation but even though that crisis was averted we still got shafted thanks to having to choose trump over her with him not exactly being the best person either. He's at least way better then her.

       This is the way I define "fake news":  1)  people outright lying to reporters, and reporters not calling them on it.  eg, "He never said that."  2)  People pretending to report the news, but not reporting actual facts  eg
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/">
        http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/
       </a>
       3)  News focusing on ephemera instead of things that are actually important.  eg, pussy grabbing instead of global warming denial.
      </p>

       I am of the opinion that Hillary lost the election primarily because the Clintons are so scummy that not even loyal Democrats want to vote for them, and ALSO fake news.  The only real news I saw all election cycle was the guy who slogged through the Trump charity crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people forget that the sound bite was only invented 40 years ago.  I am waiting for the backlash return to authenticity at any moment.

       It feels like the status quo hasn't changed at all. Brexit is stalling and Trump's hands will likely be tied. By the time the next Game of Thrones season swings around the masses will be far more concerned with that than anything to do with purer, more transparent politics.

       This should not surprise anyone. These people are fully compromised in the sense that they cannot stop what they are doing because it would be the end of them. So they continue to raise the bar of ridiculous. They know it is ridiculous, but have to play it out because otherwise they will go to prison for their corruption in office. It is desperation.

       The problem with this line of thinking is assuming "the government" is one giant entity. In fact, it is a category referring to many smaller groups of people, all with different education levels, competence, experience, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people accuse "the government" of orchestrating a conspiracy, they are typically referring to the CIA, NSA, FBI, etc. These agencies are full of some of the smartest, connected, most educated and experienced people out there. And don't forget that some people in bureaucracies drag their feet and stall progress as a way of protest. I'm not accusing the Obamacare programmers of anything, but it's a general possibility when you see stories about "the government" being extremely incompetent.

       I did downvote you for being too lazy to do your own fact-checking. Also, that tin foil hat moniker that you use to excuse your laziness via a blanket statement about those on this sub is also why you get downvoted. This stupid idea that only established news sources in the fold of the spinsters that ruined the US are to be relied upon as reputable sources for information is why we have these problems. Take everything with a grain of salt and then look into it.

       The CIA has been promoting lies through the media for decades,  for generations.    The government is the biggest liar,  and the corporate media has just been the face of it,  called "news".

       Yes,  there is a shit load of static out there.    Most of the bandwidth is garbage.    We have been turned into junkies for sensationalism,   for hyper-reality,  for enhanced special effects.   The plain truth doesn't look sexy enough,  it doesn't hold the attention.

       Yeah,  no one likes to admit they have been had.   They were still hoping things could be fixed using the means provided by the rigged system.    People will have to suffer more before they can open their eyes.

       Proof? There's certainly evidence that there's something fucky going on with Assange, yet proof? I think we'd rightfully decry the MSM for reporting something like this as true with as little hard evidence as what I've seen for Assange being murdered.
