    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. Or he does not know. Or (what I would say is most likely), he himself is a conservative Christian and does not want to have his political identity associated with Putin.</p>

<p>Of course Putin could have outlawed Evangelism (I never heard that though so I would want a source) but that doesn&#39;t change anything. In Russia the conservative Christian movement is Orthodox, not Protestant-based. So as far as an Orthodox Christian would be concerned an Evangelical would be heretical, like a Catholic or a Mormon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you say that because I saw an interview with Bernie Sanders and he says because of the electoral college our candidates for presidency only focus on the swing states or the states with lots of electoral votes and pretty much ignore the other less important states with only a few electoral votes. He thinks the candidates for president should focus on all states and all citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed.  Both sides have their narratives that accuse the main supporters of the opposition of being corrupt.  What I see is more sensationalist accounts from both sides.

    <div class="md"><p>He goes into it more in the Moloch post, but I honestly agree with him when he says there&#39;s no one at the rudder of it.  The rise of Trump through the media is a great example; he rose in prominence because of the natural capitalistic effects of being entertaining on a network that profits off of making news entertaining.  The media &quot;turned&quot; on him when he became a viable candidate, not because the media cabal decided it was time, but because the reward of making money off of him got outweighed by the risk of actually getting him into office.  It&#39;s all psychohistory.  There&#39;s a quote from the Moloch post that I&#39;ve been turning into my mantra for the past few months: &quot;Almost nobody is evil, almost everything is broken.  We&#39;re never fighting flesh and blood, it&#39;s power and principalities all the way down.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parties were faced with the same, unexpected situation: an &quot;outsider&quot; candidate whose popularity did not fade out during the primaries but who gained momentum and outshone the candidate that was expected to win.  In the case of the GOP, there was resistance.  The DNC got what they deserved in this election by stealing the primary from Sanders.  He did energize politics - throughout the country, his rallies had numbers that Clinton&#39;s people couldn&#39;t even dream of photoshopping.  Everyone knew she rigged the primary with voting software.  And the DNC was complicit.  So fuck them.  Clinton was so dirty - and now we&#39;re learning that she is evil too - that it&#39;s better to have someone else serve as President.  But Trump&#39;s remarks when introducing Jeffrey Epstein indicate he knew about the sex trafficking and made a joke of it.  That should be troubling to everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clever.  State what you are trying to do by saying you have poisoned half of the populace and they must be destroyed in order for you to be free.  Putin is Ex-KGB too.  The way to accomplish: &quot;creating an uninitiated state of war within the United States and it will spread and will not require foreign agents to continue because it&#39;s own citizens will begin fighting against each other.&quot;  Would be to promote more and more extreme rhetoric for both the right and the left, which is what we see.  This would cause the infighting that they desire.  Recently we have seen more right wing rhetoric coming from Russia, which would be indicative of this strategy.  They could be trying to promote whichever side they feel would cause the most infighting.</p>

They ensured that a fire would occur by using a planted incendiary device to cause the fire, used the wrong gas cap, and overfilled the tank. Video also includes recent example of MSNBC caught cropping video to make black guy with a gun appear white, then fabricates a whole narrative about white people possibly shooting the president.

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody here <em>knew</em> the election was fixed, and shared articles proving that thousands of times.</p>

<p>And they were certain, because the polls, which were within 1% of the result for the last three elections, predicted a Clinton win.  Obviously the polls were faked and simply justifying the rigged election.</p>

<p>Talk to me about bots.  All those articles had a top voted comment telling people how somebody was sharing these facts to everybody they knew of facebook, and encouraging us all to do the same.</p>

<p>And yet, Trump won.  The aggregate polls were <em>apparently</em> off by 4% for the first time this century.</p>

<p>So the election wasn&#39;t rigged for Clinton (that news was fake), and the organic grassroots army of people telling us to share stuff on facebook was a natural occurrence of concerned citizens who had no major impact on the election.</p>

<p>You could find an entire catalog of accusations in this subreddit that follow the same pattern, and yet the FBI (who proved itself Clinton&#39;s enemy on the eve of the election) hasn&#39;t even bothered investigating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup basically those in charge of things thought their mind control was more effective than it was and now they want to prevent that from happening ever again. So the best way for them to do that is to get to label whom is real news and whom is &quot;fake news&quot; which is so incredibly ironic considering how much bullshit the news/media of the &quot;real news&quot; group reports on and never ever has any sort of repercussion from it. It&#39;s just sick how bad things are getting. If I was an outside person looking into the situation I&#39;d have to swear there was some kind of super villain group that has taken over the country. Where the hell is the rebellion at? We need a rebellion so badly because we came so damn close to having one of the worst human beings ever created as a leader of the nation but even though that crisis was averted we still got shafted thanks to having to choose trump over her with him not exactly being the best person either. He&#39;s at least way better then her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the way I define &quot;fake news&quot;:  1)  people outright lying to reporters, and reporters not calling them on it.  eg, &quot;He never said that.&quot;  2)  People pretending to report the news, but not reporting actual facts  eg <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/</a>  3)  News focusing on ephemera instead of things that are actually important.  eg, pussy grabbing instead of global warming denial.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that Hillary lost the election primarily because the Clintons are so scummy that not even loyal Democrats want to vote for them, and ALSO fake news.  The only real news I saw all election cycle was the guy who slogged through the Trump charity crap.</p>

<p>I think people forget that the sound bite was only invented 40 years ago.  I am waiting for the backlash return to authenticity at any moment.</p>

<p>&quot;We all saw what happened with the election just a couple of weeks ago and we will knew the polls were bullshit. Clinton couldn&#39;t fill a high school with supporters and trump couldn&#39;t accommodate all the supporters with a stadium and yet they say clinton won the popular election?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this line of thinking is assuming &quot;the government&quot; is one giant entity. In fact, it is a category referring to many smaller groups of people, all with different education levels, competence, experience, and so on. </p>

<p>When people accuse &quot;the government&quot; of orchestrating a conspiracy, they are typically referring to the CIA, NSA, FBI, etc. These agencies are full of some of the smartest, connected, most educated and experienced people out there. And don&#39;t forget that some people in bureaucracies drag their feet and stall progress as a way of protest. I&#39;m not accusing the Obamacare programmers of anything, but it&#39;s a general possibility when you see stories about &quot;the government&quot; being extremely incompetent. </p>
