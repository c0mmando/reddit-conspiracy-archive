    <div class="md"><p>I think it became an issue when people started going to the place without looking for actual pizza.</p>

<p>Reddit had to get rid of the creepy child daycare posts because people were doing the same thing.</p>

<p>One thing people so easily forget even though there was a huge shitstorm over it, is that reddit is trying to appeal to businesses for adspace more and more and less so trying to cater to the individuals. They want to make reddit a safe space. Does no one forget that <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> and its affiliates got banned for, iirc, just being dicks. It got labeled a hate-reddit and that&#39;s not conducive to creating a safe space. I don&#39;t agree with it, just trying to give some background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the wording of the TOS identify that practice as a violation you have to comply or go to other place to post that information, so you have to be more cautious or ask to somebody to help you to react your post and in that way state your discovers without infringe the TOS</p>

Sorry, but if you search inside the subreddit you will find and one recommendation use &quot;sort by new&quot; instead of &quot;best&quot; to evade the brigading of downvote &quot;unfavorable&quot; comments by the different bots and s**lls that lurks one here lately </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply untrue.  The moderators were actively working to stop any TOS violations, and had actually just brought on new mods to help.  They were maybe a bit overwhelmed by gaining 2000+ subscribers per day for the last couple weeks, but they were still removing content that broke the rules in a timely fashion.   I browsed just about every thread on pizzagate over the last few weeks, and it was certainly no worse than conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Voat has the entire subreddit archives if you&#39;d like to find some examples?</p>
