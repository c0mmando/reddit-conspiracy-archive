        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay so being the great &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; I am, and have been since I was 10 (I&#39;m 19 now and well rounded on issues like 9/11, Moon Landing, and have been a frequent follower of this sub reddit), I decided to venture into &quot;Flat earth&quot; &quot;Theory&quot;... which has A LOT of great mathematics and actual reasoning behind it (even nearly all major religions before the 1600&#39;s believed this, including depicted in the Bible and Koran). Now, While watching ODD TV&#39;s video on Flat earth in 5 minutes, he made a very interesting point. Earth has something called the l Low Orbit Zone (link here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit</a>). </p>

<p>Now even reading the wiki on this, you&#39;ll see that EVERY space mission, including the space station, have been conducted in the Low Earth Orbit zone (99miles up to about 2000 miles above earth), EXCEPT for the 6 manned lunar missions...</p>

<p>Even President Obama has come out (and you can find the videos yourself) and made a public statement how monumental it will be when NASA finishes its new aircraft that will able to bring human outside of the low orbit zone &quot;For the first time&quot;....</p>

<p>Putting NASA&#39;s poorly photoshopped images, being a part of the US military, and all the other faked information about the moon landing, isn&#39;t this ONE fact VERY telling.</p>

<p>Please help me do some digging, I have done a lot myself but I do not want to post any links to videos until I can vet them all and make sure that the format I give for these links follow this sub-reddit&#39;s policies. Hope you guys/gals/unicorns can help me find more information. I am currently working on making a Change.org petition to open an investigation on all 6 lunar moon landings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about the map that they use as <a href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:7h149v85z">proof</a>, Australia is almost double the size as the United States. The entire idea of human progress is to built upon the works of those who came before us. How can anyone seriously question the works of Copernicus in 1473 or Eratosthenes in 240 BC, that the world is round? How about the fucking fact that we can travel across the world in an airplane? Or that there are satellite images of the round fucking Earth, in all its glory?  No, all of that is bullshit and parlor tricks, when the same satellites are watching your every move and entering the data into a government database. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t have both. The world can&#39;t be flat if the government is using the satellites orbiting the Earth to watch your every waking move. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that anyone who truly believes that the world is flat is an idiot. As an exercise in discourse and logic, it is completely without merit or validity and it is extremely detrimental to the progress of knowledge. </p>

<p>If you believe that the Earth is flat, despite all of the opposing evidence and won&#39;t accept any evidence that conflicts with your opinion, then you are completely arrogant in your own ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you say so, but I&#39;ll remind you that empirical evidence is something that can be recreated over and over again to support a theory.   I stand by my point. No proof the world is flat. No proof the world is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually believe that the world is flat, then you are willing to ignore any evidence to the contrary. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_Astronaut_Requirements.html">How about you apply to NASA as an astronaut, so you can fly into space and see for yourself</a>.  Of course then you would be a part of the global conspiracy to deny that the Earth is flat, otherwise known as reality. </p>

<p><a href="http://ifers.123.st/t79-why-they-lie-to-us-about-the-flat-earth">Or, you could believe this lunatic (the moon is also round), who says that HBO and other major corporations have created this global conspiracy to get you to buy more stuff.</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>All the stars in our night sky are in the same area of our galaxy and are traveling around the center of our galaxy at roughly the same speed and path as we are.</p>

<p>As for the movement of the earth around the sun, the distances to these stars are just so so much bigger that you will not be able to measure a different along our short path around the sun.</p>

<p>To put that in numbers, the radius of the earth&#39;s orbit around the sun is 93,000,000 miles, so the distance between two opposite points on the circle is twice that.</p>

<p>Sigma Octantis is 8.51 million times further away than that. If you plug that into a trigonometric function, you find out the change in angle is 0.00000011 degrees over the course of half a orbit</p>

<p>One of the posters was talking about the cult of science and its seemingly infallibility, which is completely false.  The very core of scientific inquiry and critical thinking relies on accumulating evidence to support or disprove theories.  If anything, there is more incentive to disprove theories that are inaccurate.  The basis of the scientific method is that nothing is sure until it is proven.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t spend a lot of time addressing questions, I just link people to the subreddit I help run which contains the information or to other ways that they can do the research the themselves.  All of this information you can prove to yourself to be true with some basic equipment or basic reasoning, you just need to want to find out for yourself because the lie is so big you shouldn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s word for it.

    <div class="md"><p>You guys gotta watch for <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> contributors - they usually try to lead people astray.</p>

<p>From your own article you clueless goon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering the motion of the earth in its orbit only, this displacement should be {\displaystyle 2D{\tfrac {v<sup>{2}}{V<sup>{2}}}=2D\times</sup></sup> 10<sup>{-8}}</sup> {\displaystyle 2D{\tfrac {v<sup>{2}}{V<sup>{2}}}=2D\times</sup></sup> 10<sup>{-8}}.</sup> The distance D was about eleven meters, or 2×107 wave-lengths of yellow light; hence the displacement to be expected was 0•4 fringe. The actual displacement was certainly less than the twentieth part of this, and probably less than the fortieth part. But since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity, the relative velocity of the earth and the ether is probably less than one sixth the earth&#39;s orbital velocity, and certainly less than one-fourth.</p>

<p>In what precedes, only the orbital motion of the earth is considered. If this is combined with the motion of the solar system, concerning which but little is known with certainty, the result would have to be modified; and it is just possible that the resultant velocity at the time of the observations was small though the chances are much against it. The experiment will therefore be repeated at intervals of three months, and thus all uncertainty will be avoided.</p>

<p>It appears, from all that precedes, reasonably certain that if there be any relative motion between the earth and the luminiferous ether, it must be small; quite small enough entirely to refute Fresnel&#39;s explanation of aberration. Stokes has given a theory of aberration which assumes the ether at the earth&#39;s surface to be at rest with regard to the latter, and only requires in addition that the relative velocity have a potential; but Lorentz shows that these conditions are incompatible. Lorentz then proposes a modification which combines some ideas of Stokes and Fresnel, and assumes the existence of a potential, together with Fresnel&#39;s coefficient. If now it were legitimate to conclude from the present work that the ether is at rest with regard to the earth&#39;s surface, according to Lorentz there could not be a velocity potential, and his own theory also fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The interferometers showed that the displacement caused by his experiment could in no way account for the rotation of the earth.  Thanks for the link and for proving once again that <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> are the most clueless population on reddit  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, you didn&#39;t demonstrate anything you just quoted a passage that is entirely irrelevant. Nothing at all in what you quoted says anything about the earth being flat. In fact, it talks about the <em>rotation</em> of the earth which in astrophysics refers to spherical bodies.</p>

<p>I also like it how you completely avoid the question of providing your own evidence. Since whatever third party evidence I cite you will just rationalize please just conduct your own experiments. There is a rich history in astronomy of talented amateurs making ground breaking discoveries on their own with minimal equipment. Please cite some experiments you have done and provide the data for confirmation of your results. If you are unable to cite independent experiments then you are just full of shit.</p>

<p>Or better yet you can just admit that when even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thinks your nuts you got some serious issues. There is simply no way you are unaware of the delusional nature of your beliefs. The astounding thing is that you actually think anyone believes you when you play dumb about your beliefs being delusional. No one believes you.

    <div class="md"><p>The earth is flat and motionless and that <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> are a witch hunting brigade of cowards and mental toddlers who literally spend their time trying to make fun of strangers over the internet - often times making light of actual of actual conspiracies and widely misinforming people :)</p>

<p>Are you here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to try and say differently?</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably a thread up there literally about this comment string with a bunch of &quot;thought police&quot; circle jerking while still not understanding Airy&#39;s Failure or any of the experiments I mention.  This is absolutely normal behavior for them.  They&#39;ll still try and make fun of me tomorrow for the same things, doesn&#39;t matter how wrong or ignorant they are, the idea is just to spread the cancerous attitude of scoffing and naysaying.</p>

<p>Is my position pretty clear? :)</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand your position - this information isn&#39;t basic research, there are about a dozen links.  </p>

<p>Moreover, the information only attempts to &quot;debunk&quot; the shadow theory of an eclipse without proposing an actual alternate theory.  So please, tell me - what is an eclipse in conjunction with the luminary theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - spend more than 5 minutes and stop pretending like you&#39;re a child and do actual research - where you sit and read and look things up actual hours at a time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what it takes to understand things like this topic that are this big and this old.  If you&#39;re not willing to do the work yourself then how do you expect to understand it?  I am personally 100% not willing to sit here and hold every person&#39;s hand through all of the research - it&#39;s not a job I&#39;d want.  But I&#39;m happy to post links to forums where you can get the basics of the perspective and find many jump off points for your own research - so you can verify and work things out however you wish.  If you don&#39;t want to do all this work - that&#39;s fine, no one is forcing you :)  I just did it myself because I wanted to understand how people could disagree so wildly about the shape of our world.</p>

<p>Nice job trying to move the goal posts. I challenged you on Michelson-Morley, and as soon as you realize I actually understand physics you suddenly abandon Michelson-Morley and devolve into ad-hominem. Let&#39;s assume for the sake of argument that I am everything you say I am, cowardly, witch-hunting, etc. That says nothing whatsoever about whether or not my position is factually correct. Cowards can be just as factual as heroes.</p>

Your reasoning is basically: &quot;it&#39;s a fact. a fact. i say its a fact so <strong>its a fact</strong> your a stupid dumb dumb head because i&#39;m a fact sayer and flat earth is a fact&quot;</p>

<p>If it&#39;s an empirical fact just provide us with an explicit experiment by independent experts which has been published and replicated. If it really is a fact it should be easy to do that.</p>

<p>You are clearly very new to this topic.  If you want to try and debunk the flat earth, be my guest - that&#39;s how I became a flat earther.  The problem is that you seem be much more focused here on complaining, playing the victim, and attacking me.</p>

<p>Please provide an example of an independently conducted and independently verified experiment designed to decide whether the earth is flat or spherical which has found that the earth is flat. This is what emirical means. You have refused to do anything but interpret the works of others. That is not empirical evidence. Science does not proceed by argument and interpretation. Science proceeds by explicit experimentation. If you can&#39;t provide an example of an explicit experiment finding for a flat earth that has been verified by independent experts then you do not have empirical evidence, you just have rationalizations. </p>

<p>Luckily for both us the earth is empirically flat whether or not I give you any links or experiments.  Whether or not you think I can prove it or not - the evidence is out there and I&#39;m just pointing that out to people and I think it&#39;s pretty funny that you and others feel so much of a need to attack me personally rather than put any effort into actual investigations.  Pretty telling if you ask me.</p>

<p>None of the &quot;mountains of evidence&quot; is actually evidence because literally none of it was explicitly designed to decide between flat vs spherical earth. Airy&#39;s experiments, for example, were designed to measure drag through the aether and did not address the shape of the earth at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t claim that the earth is empirically flat unless you have experimental evidence to support the claim. That is what &quot;empirical&quot; means. If you are so convinced that it is an empirical fact please provide an example of an experiment specifically designed to decide between flat vs. spherical earth which has found for flat earth, and whose results have been replicated by independent investigators. Until you do this you have no empirical fact whatsoever, you just have a baseless claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you have no idea how science works. It is not possible for an experiment to &quot;prove&quot; anything other than what it was specifically designed to prove. If it was not designed to &quot;prove&quot; A than you cannot say it &quot;proves&quot; A because you cannot say whether or not all the variables have been accounted for, whether or not the results are a fluke, etc. This is middle school level scienctific methodology. Literally, it is jr. high level science. Every notable physicist has written on this subject. Feynman, Popper, Einstein, all have written about the fact that only explicit experiments count.</p>

<p>But for the sake f argument let&#39;s assume every astronomer ever is wrong and you are right. You still haven&#39;t explained how any of what you cite &quot;proves&quot; flat earth. Let alone provide any references to independent experts that have come to the same conclusion. Please provide a peer reviewed study in which independent experts conclude that the studies you cite prove flat earth. </p>

<p>No, you simply claimed that. I was the one who explained what the experiments you cited actually mean. I repeatedly addressed the science directly. Not once in this thread have you explained how the science you cite supports your case despite repeated requests to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have attacking me in looking into this stuff yourself this conversation would be going very differently</p>

<p>I am not attacking you, I am asking you to provide independent evidence to support your claims. I am even doing so politely, I have repeatedly said &quot;please&quot; in my requests for evidence and continue to be polite despite your numerous personal insults against me. It is telling that you consider polite requests for evidence to be &quot;attacks&quot;. Furthermore, as I have pointed out numerous times, I do understand the science, I have a degree in physics, and I have explained the science multiple times. I have asked you numerous times to explain the science yourself but you refuse to do so. If you think I don&#39;t understand the science please explain what the science means, as I and others have asked you to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is an empirical truth.</p>

<p>Then provide us with independent empirical evidence to support that claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know they can&#39;t do that. So....that&#39;s why we doubt they can go even to the Van Allen belts. Everything you think you know is a lie...the entire Heliocentric model, the Big bang theory and Evolution was all brought to you by Jesuits child molesting Catholic priests. They have always controlled your reality. What you call Secular &quot;Science&quot; is actually  luciferian imaginary bullshit by deceivers of the Church. When they couldn&#39;t control the reformation movement to educate the masses from the Church control. The Church cleverly became the center of all knowledge distribution. They erased all the past knowledge that would contradict their lies, and infiltrated all nations around the World to get rid of any truth that might have remained. The Head of Beast was always the Church of Rome. We are all blinded and brainwashed in their artificial and deceptive World. It &#39;s no wonder that some prominent  Historians often became conspiracy theorists alleging that Church fabricated artifacts of history including entire books and buildings. In the 90s a German historian even argued the Phantom time paradox...that the Church might have doctored facts, and time periods from the past. The Secular Science we were taught NEVER existed. We were learning stupid religious lies all along.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a teenager, he has the same world view he had when he was ten, he thinks he&#39;s &quot;well rounded&quot; because he believes both the moon landing and 9/11 conspiracies, he praises flat earth for having a lot of math supporting it, and he thinks that support from religious groups five hundred plus ago that&#39;s been dropped by the wayside is a good trait for a scientific theory to have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, you didn&#39;t demonstrate anything you just quoted a passage that is entirely irrelevant. Nothing at all in what you quoted says anything about the earth being flat. In fact, it talks about the <em>rotation</em> of the earth which in astrophysics refers to spherical bodies.</p>

<p>I also like it how you completely avoid the question of providing your own evidence. Since whatever third party evidence I cite you will just rationalize please just conduct your own experiments. There is a rich history in astronomy of talented amateurs making ground breaking discoveries on their own with minimal equipment. Please cite some experiments you have done and provide the data for confirmation of your results. If you are unable to cite independent experiments then you are just full of shit.</p>

<p>Or better yet you can just admit that when even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thinks your nuts you got some serious issues. There is simply no way you are unaware of the delusional nature of your beliefs. The astounding thing is that you actually think anyone believes you when you play dumb about your beliefs being delusional. No one believes you. You know that flat earth is delusional and everyone knows that you know that.</p>
