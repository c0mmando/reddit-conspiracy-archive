       The reddit admins have shut down
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       , a sub with nearly 25,000* subscribers, as well as certain other subs* which were set up to address suspected child abuse references in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails">
        Podesta emails
       </a>
       which were published by
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">
        WikiLeaks
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       now directs you to the following message:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This subreddit was banned due to a violation of our content policy. Specifically, the proliferation of personal and confidential information. We don’t want witchhunts on our site.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the first time a sub has been closed down for contravening reddit rules relating to doxxing, brigading, harassment and witch-hunting. Amidst the cries of censorship, keep in mind that the admins are simply applying existing sitewide rules, and it's more than likely that reddit (and its majority owner
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">
        Avance Publications*
       </a>
       ) have been pressured from external sources, with threats of litigation, removal of advertising revenue, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where does that leave
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Pizzagate" is a new aspect of an established conspiracy which has long been discussed, and will continue to be discussed, in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The key issue is that we, as a group, must ensure we don't break the rules set out by the admins, or this subreddit could be next.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have always been vigilant about preventing doxxing, brigading and harassment coming from this sub, and to their credit, the admins have respected our independence and rarely interfere in the way we moderate
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is many things, but it is not, and cannot under the terms of reddit, be a direct action group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can discuss, theorize and rant about whatever we like, but there must be absolutely NO brigading and NO contacting or harassing individuals within or outside reddit, even if you suspect them of criminal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who engages in these activities poses an existential threat to this sub, so if you see any examples of this please notify the mods immediately, and we will remove the comments and report the offenders to the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       *EDITS: Factual corrections.

       After  Pssagate content migrates to r/conspiracy, then r/conspiracy gets pulled down.

       Skip conspiracy and go directly to pol... posting in here with all the bigfoot and UFO stories only serves to make your pizzagate stuff look less reliable. Thats why early on CTR upvoted the hell out of pizza posts here... cause it helped lump that story in with every nutcase and crackpot theory in existence. Instant discreditation.

       As someone who posts the "less evidence based topic" (because let's face it, what outlets are left for posting "evidence?" The NYT?), we should absolutely feel free to explore the more fringe topics. In this climate we never know when such things will become fact.

       Those are what comes to people's minds when they see a post make it to the front page under from the sub "conspiracy"... they figure pizzagate must be about as credible as the least credible theories they have heard. The front page redditors don't come to these boards and dig. They just see what makes it to the front... which probably isn't much anymore since brigading has subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to maintain plausible deniability and follow the rules of reddit to not suffer the same fate as pizzagate.

       The funny thing is that Podesta himself is a huge promoter of UFO stories,
       <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/16/john-podesta-emails-encourage-ufo-buffs-seeking-de/">
        being the most prominent UFO disclosure advocate in the world.

       I'm just trying to keep ex-pizzagaters from trying to bring down
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in a fit of jealousy and rage... I see a few comments with a lot of upvotes concerning turning conspiracy into a martyr for the pizzagate cause. I don't want them to even try.

       I have a lot of faith in our mods... I've only lurked here for like a year so I haven't seen an influx of new users like this. I'm just concerned when a few make it obvious they want to martyr this sub... and worry about how butthurt they will get when they realize the posting guidelines are very strictly followed here.

       I think it was a separate FBIAnon that said browsing 4chan is like getting the morning paper delivered at 3 am instead of 9am.

      <p>
       The problem is the degree of disinfo and wading through the "isms" (legit sexism, racism, etc... and this comes from someone with a thick skin and recognizes how those labels are more often than not used to stifle meaningful discourse). Those three days to trickle here, then, acts as decent filter.

       4chan i believe operates on the constant belief they are all compromised and none of them can be trusted.

       Maybe this new reddit you're talking about can have a bunch of rats scurrying when you flip the pizza over to upvote.

       let's be serious for a second - they went and harassed a small business owner making allegations that could be hugely damaging and are based on pure supposition -- absolutely everything comes down to 'seems suspicious' and '1+1=Illuminati' logic. Harassing Alefantis isn't the only thing they've done they're actively tracking people, trying to work out who children are and etc, etc, etc...

       of course reddit wanted to be distance itself from it, and 8chan which is known for two things, being full of pedos and being full of fbi.  i mean honestly just read it's encyclopedia dramatica page, and they don't even get into half the old drama... A well targeted news story could make readdit look really bad and that's basically all reddit admins have ever cared about - protecting reddit.

       Also, there is 0 evidence that implicates anyone to a single event. There is circumstantial evidence, sure, and more research should be done. But as of this moment, there is 0 evidence that anyone hurt a child.

       There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       evidence that at least two of John and tony podesta's close friends are convicted pedophiles and continue to maintain contact with them. Also the woman caught attempting to illegally smuggle children from Haiti was convicted and is known to have close ties to Hillary. Wish I had links or even names, but oh well take it for what it's worth.

       he really wasn't though, he posted a funny picture of some kids playing around which were totally innocuous and some people desperate to prove their hatred of authority justified decided this means he's the devil. Honestly don't you find it a little bit absurd that this whole thing was cooked up in the minds of a website famous for Pedobear, idolising the characters from various childrens tv shows (mlp, the one with the funny wig, etc), and popularising henti fetishism in the west... i mean 4chon literally started because we were kicked off SA for shitposting henti in the forums!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's not all bad, many times they've been on the right side of things such as the habbo raids and etc but also it's an excitable muddle of confused and over-excited lunatics... many people who enjoy nothing more than causing chaos and suffering for their own amusement - i mean 'the internet hate machine' isn't a title you get lightly...
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean let's not get too deep into it but the whole 'secret code' they're pretending to have discovered being used by the Clinton's was invented on he chan sites to get around filters moot put in place to deal with the pedos - that's where 8chan came from pretty much, people pissed off at being banned for breaking the almost zero rules wanted somewhere with actually zero rules which is why 8chan is famous for having actual pedo boards but then closed most of them and everyone split off into 8ch which split off into.... 8chan is like 4chans voat, literally the worst of the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       what i'm trying to say is the people complaining at someone for having a 'shocking' picture of a baby holding a big stack of money like it's some form of gangster come from a site that's so vile even i can't bare to go there and i grew up on the chans! i had goatse.jpg as my laptop wallpaper ffs and that place make me feel queezy. they see darkness everywhere because they're looking for darkness, post those pictures on mumsnet with a similar joke he made and everyone will laugh like it's the cutest thing in the world, because it is, because that's what normal people do they play carefree games and get upto hijinks without once even thinking about digging a subterranean torture room to murder children and feast on their corpses in twisted satanic rituals, why? BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DERANGED BASEMENT DWELLING NECKBEAR SOCIOPATHS.

        Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.

       but it does have a lot to do with the conspiracy because they invented it, every time i look at a thread about it there are people using absurd 4/8chan posts as evidence - did you see the recent one with the spooky wifi signals? none of it makes any sense, has any proof, yet somehow it's counted as evidence in the minds of the people who are trying to push this.
      </p>
      <p>
       the simple fact is i can't debate the evidence for this because there is no evidence, just a shifting sea in inference and supposition.

       If I saw photos of John Podesta actually eating Cheese Pizza, it would mentally match up with the number of times it is mentioned.

       All these coincidences, dots that span decades that might be connecting; they might not be evidence, I agree.

       Tell me, have you ever ran in the kink social circles in your community? I have, as, ah.. a facilitator. People don't have art in their home like Tony Podesta unless they have a dark side to their kinks.

       I think what is strange is his connection to Brock &amp; in many ways how Brock &amp; Podesta's private life is very drawn to an art scene that is dark. 
My sister is an artist in the provocateur scene that meshes art &amp; fashion, &amp; gay club scene with lots of elite money / overseas money from very sketchy people. 
Lets be truthful in this conversation. There's a lot of creepy sex and drugs that occurs within those circles when they merge.
       <br/>
       I know this because my sister hates my dad and discussed it in detail at the last Thanksgiving dinner my grandma will live to see. 
Is there pedophilia? 
Probably.  If you look at kids in the foster system in major cities that go to group homes instead of permanent ones , some will find refuge in this scene.  My sister is 24. She's had roommates that weren't old enough to get a driver's license. They were runaways looking to model - but most of their work comes from escorting with foreigners visiting NYC. 
Does everyone do it? NO. 
Does everyone realize it's an Elephant in the Room at Fashion Week? YES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without question we turn our back on these kids ( liberals and democrats).  And maybe it's because it's complex.  Kids are having sex in our society at a much younger age.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think human trafficking doesn't exist in America talk to a person who works in social work.  Or a cop in a bad part of a major city. Hell the right inner city high school counselor could share a story or two with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that , like drugs that minorities aren't selling, it's a foggy world that we don't really want to look into.  But it happens. And it happens around money &amp; power. 
This isn't new. It's always been this way. 
The only thing that has really changed is that a certain part of society is afraid of what happens when the Pandora Box is opened and the troubled child who played victim isn't that innocent.

       you i presume are american thus also a paedophile? how can you deny it just look at the evidence from boys town!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there is a serious problem in America with paedophilia, rape, violence and all sorts of things however the existence of these real issues isn't enough to hang a person just for being American, or for liking art...
      </p>
      <p>
       art is often shocking, look at Egon Schiele or Balthus even Hieronymus Bosch - just liking art doesn't make you a pedo, you criticise these people for liking high art with a significant message because it doesn't fit some oddly Victorian moral set but you have no problem with
       <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.24694638.0052/flat,800x800,070,f.u1.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       for example and the fact all these allegations come from the same website that
       <a href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/140/462/cake-pedobear.jpg">
        invented this
       </a>
       doesn't seem to bother you? I mean if Podesa was sharing stuff like
       <a href="http://img15.deviantart.net/f9dd/i/2011/173/a/6/pedobear_montage_2_by_zelda1fiction1child-d3jnknb.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       then sure you'd have to think maybe he's a bit odd, but no that's perfectly acceptable to anon... it's 'just a joke' but somehow things that are just innocent jokes without even a tacit let alone overt theme of pederasty make podesta the worst person in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they're part of some pedo conspiracy, they may well be, however vague assumptions based on your dislike of successful people just isn't proof. Not everyone that likes are is a pedo, not everyone that decides to work as part of the government to try and make the country better is a sinister monster hellbent on destroying the world (that's mostly just the republicans, mostly)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really believe these things then change the system, don't waste your time in a pointless witch-hunt with no evidence especially not one directed at a random pizza shop - i mean honestly, doesn't this feel like massive distraction from the important things that are actually happening in the world?

       Your 1st sentence makes zero sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read my other posts, I have issues with Pizzagate in general. People are taking a lot of swings and batting below .300. 
Wikileaks (in many ways) was always solid at dropping files in batches to let the story develop slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe - as an American - my problem is that child trafficking exists. As a minority I'm aware of this because many come from Asia (my people), Eastern Russia,  &amp; Latin America.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media doesn't cover it. And when they do they cover it as if it's a problem of the lower class that never leave that bubble.  It's alluded that they find work as sex workers in poor neighborhoods in big cities making money off of poor blue collar workers &amp; gang members.  But this isn't true at all.  Like high end drugs , you don't go through hell and consequences unless a payday is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am liberal because the ethics and morals relate to the world I want to live in. But I feel like there's child gloves for many of the people who hire child prostitutes. Or complete denial. Or fear that certain people being exposed as pedophiles would ruin social justice campaigns that they live &amp; die by the sword on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people in both Politics &amp; Hollywood cover it up because they know that their careers could be ruined if the story ever blew up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that PizzaGate is unorganized.  But I do believe that why they are going after certain groups of people is an elephant in the room scenario - the same way that the Catholic Church &amp; Penn State University covered up something that would ruin their reputation, legacy, &amp; power.

       but ALL of this is 'i heard some terrible things happen in general therefore this exact thing is true...' that doesn't make sense, you can't just say that because there are same bad people that everyone or a specific person is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an interesting note on what you talk about from one of the most prominent campaigneres against human trafficking,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Elementary students across America are taught that slavery ended in the 19th Century. But, sadly, nearly 150 years later, the fight to end this global scourge is far from over. Today it takes a different form and we call it by a different name -- “human trafficking” -- but it is still an affront to basic human dignity in the United States and around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimates vary widely, but it is likely that somewhere between 12 million and 27 million human beings are suffering in bondage around the world. Men, women and children are trapped in prostitution or labor in fields and factories under brutal bosses who threaten them with violence or jail if they try to escape. Earlier this year, six ”recruiters” were indicted in Hawaii in the largest human trafficking case ever charged in U.S. history. They coerced 400 Thai workers into farm labor by confiscating their passports and threatening to have them deported.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have seen firsthand the suffering that human trafficking causes. Not only does it result in injury and abuse—it also takes away its victims’ power to control their own destinies. In Thailand I have met teenage girls who had been prostituted as young children and were dying of AIDS. In Eastern Europe I have met mothers who lost sons and daughters to trafficking and had nowhere to turn for help. This is a violation of our fundamental belief that all people everywhere deserve to live free, work with dignity, and pursue their dreams.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I know it's hard to even imagine but this is still a major problem in the world, a friend of mine who grew up in Thailand was married to a Thai businessman when she was 14, he was in his fifties! He brought her over here (the uk) when she was 17, had barely had any education and wasn't allowed any friends or contact with anyone until she got pregnant and the social services talk to her and basically just said 'no don't be silly, you don't have to go back there if you don't want to...' That was twenty years ago now and she's a campaigner against no-love marriages and human trafficking which she could so easily have been a part of instead.  It terrible but the reality of the world is complex, to go back to what i pasted before it presents some important things that people should be doing,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Citizens can help too, by advocating for laws that ban all forms of exploitation and give victims the support they need to recover. They can also volunteer at a local shelter and encourage companies to root out forced labor throughout their supply chains by visiting
        <a href="http://www.chainstorereaction.com">
         www.chainstorereaction.com
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       but to really have a serious effect this is going to have to be political,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We need to redouble our efforts to fight modern slavery. I hope that the countries that have not yet acceded to the U.N. Trafficking Protocol will do so. Many other countries can still do more to strengthen their anti-trafficking laws. And all governments can devote more resources to finding victims and punishing human traffickers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       however one of the chief campaigners against sex trafficking and the author that open letter isn't going to be the next President, partly no doubt because of smears concocted by the right-wing especially people like Jerome Corsi that manufacture easy to believe pap to be pushed out through the blogs and side-channels so they can pick it up on their bigger blogs and say they're 'just reporting what people are saying' then their media outlets 'just report that people are saying it...' and they know exactly what they're doing because they hire the best psychology graduates and train them through secret NSA projects where they do all sorts of psychological experiments to work out the best ways of manipulating society to their own ends...
      </p>
      <p>
       You're fighting against people that are working towards global co-operation in the fight against corruption and sleaze, people that are introducing and fighting for legislation to end human trafficking on national and international levels - people that are genuinely fighting these things and who have genuinely made a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       didn't it cross your mind that maybe this whole nonsense has been cooked up by the vast criminal conspiracy of greed that rules the world and thrives of suffering exactly because they want to defeat the people who were making their life difficult... I mean haven't you gotten it yet, the Republicans always talk about smaller government because they want to get rid of oversight, they want to get rid of all the protections that stop them being able to do whatever they like - effective government is what stops rich people being able to built child brothels and pay off the local police (as happens in countries without effective governments or the political will to challenge thees things)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to fight corruption then fight corruption, this is a complex process which involves increasing the checks and balances and opening the government so it's more transparent and accountable - simply running wherever Corsi points and attacking blindly really isn't helpful, you're just becoming a puppet of the establishment and protecting those who are the real culprits.

       What we both know is that CTR is involved in this (Brock - who is associated in a homosexual polygamist relationship with the owner of Comet Pizza - note they may be no longer together although reports are conflicting). And when CTR's candidate is under fire PR judo takes place in the form of shills.  Now the general of CTR is under fire - which could lead to the reveal of what he paid 850k to have silenced.  So do you think that we won't see shills in or around this movement?
      </p>
      <p>
       Chart both of these if you wish : 
What's the worst case scenario in this situation if PizzaGate continues its movement?
       <br/>
       What's the worst case scenario if it is stopped into silence?
      </p>
      <p>
       If PizzaGate continues and fails to find anything substantial, there's blood on the internets hands. But lets be truthful, we live in an ecosystem where this will always occur. In fact it often happens in a conscious manner from the MSM.   People will incorrectly doxxx a school shooter, people will demonize a professional athlete who didn't rape someone, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If PizzaGate is true , then CTR has to work harder than normal to irradiate the situation. They give scumbags second chances - because our society gives people those if they're required to.  See Anthony Weiner who was at the DNC partying with Bill &amp; Hill seconds before they both went on stage.  When it came out that he was a pedophile (again) - their job was to separate Weiner from the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people give up ( which both of us are wasting time to believe that that will happen ) then Children who come out will be seen as 'typical craizes' like the children in Boys Town.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim to ask for an effective government. But just because a government is big doesn't mean that it is in any way ethical. 
Have you tried doing business in China?  Its near impossible to do it the legal way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're smart &amp; liberal ask yourself this when watching the media + government speak. When are they deontological? When are they consequentialist?   My father left his country when he realized that the country used its power to pendulum back and forth between both. It helped him realize the people were not playing the same game that the people in power were playing. Even social &amp; cultural laws were meant to make impacts that would benefit the most powerful economically.

       Yes frequently and no it's not at all, they're a brilliant efficient nation full of wonderful people who are proud of their governments achievements in lifting so many people from poverty and providing such good educations and opportunities to people... sure there are problems in china, everywhere has problems but they're an amazingly successful nation which has done amazing things for it's people, i mean honestly have you seen the water management projects! it's magnificent, awe inspiring! and the numbers are amazing, the amount of people lifted from poverty and educated to a modern level is simply staggering, i mean compare it to Europe or America and it's impressive, compare it to the rest of Asia it's frankly dizzying.
      </p>

      <p>
       yes, that is how it works - powerful people make laws to benefit themselves,  i mean i'm from England we have a queen for fuck sake, it couldn't be more obivious how the system works - this is the old system which we're trying to change by developing new system which enable the people to stand together and resist the power of the wealthy - however the rich don't like this, they fight against it - that's basically what the republican party is or the british tory party, they exist to try and return us to the feudal yoke which is why they're so vehemently opposed to anything that makes the working people more able to defend themselves, like good government, strong laws, etc, etc, etc....
      </p>
      <p>
       yes there is corruption all through politics, nothing is ever easy and often both sides are brought and paid for but does that mean we should just give up and attack everyone that's trying to put through decent legislation simply because some crazy on the internet pointed a bony finger and yelled pedo?!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to protect against shills demand good, strong proof of everything and give good strong proof of everything - it really is that easy

       except that's the exact inverse of what i'm saying, i'm saying don't be taken a fool of by the corporate criminals - educate yourself (with genuine facts and real knowledge), organise (around useful goals and positive principles) and don't just push absurd conspiracy theories that help help the rich destroy the things designed to protect you simply because it sound fun and makes you feel good to be some form of hero in your own imagination.

       The pic of the toddler taped to the table was pretty shocking. And then the pic of the guy holding a toddler that Alefantis's commented "chicken lovers" on which is a pedo code word, no chicken in the photo, but it did look to be taken in the back room of the restaurant

       but this is what i'm saying, i've seen all of that stuff and there's nothing in the least bit shocking on any of it, it's a pizza place in the day it's all family orientated with kids eating pizza and playing around then in the evening they have some kinda emo punky bands, alcohol, probably some people outside weed smoking and sexual jokes because they're adults and sometimes adults make sexual jokes.

       this isn't some petty game where there's a handful of satan worshippers messing up the world, it's hugely complex situation involving deeply entrenched power structures that wield huge amounts of power yet they're also week, they need people to believe in them and to follow them - that's why they have to do secret tricks to try and discredit wikileaks it's because they're weak, they're scared and they know the world is changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       we can win but we're not going to make a better world by running around after absurd things talking nonsense about everyone that likes pizza is a pedo. we need to be working on making systems that hold governments to account, that hold the systems we use to account and to make sure that we the people have more power than the government. we need software tools and community tools, we need to work together and build a positive new world in which corruption isn't possible and if someone tries to manipulate the will of the people then everyone knows about it instantly.

       that just makes no sense though,. why would they advertise they're pedos using the secret codes that are known to the fbi, i mean they have access to this information,,remember this is the most power people in the world you're saying are responsible for this and they're advertising publicly their pedo clubs? why? in case Bellesconni is walking through DC and fancies a child murder orgy?!

       Oh good, I'm not crazy. I just started trying to understand PizzaGate today and it's "this person posted a picture of pizza! And they have a picture of a child which they say they think is cute?! Definite paedophile!" I'm just not seeing any connections or proof of any of it. Coded emails? Sure, but I'm not really seeing how it

       it's really odd, they've been getting really excited about maps of underground tunnels that link pizza restaurants, secret back rooms and sinister underground torture rooms -- then some people actually went and started 'protesting' he was really polite to them, invited them in and showed them all around including the toilets they'd said were sinister and all the kitchens and backrooms and everything - nothing even slightly sinister or unexpected for a pizza shop...
      </p>
      <p>
       but now no one is mentioning that video and i still see people talking about underground back rooms kitted out like wet rooms and other insanity - they're not looking for truth they're trying to prove something they've decided is true.

       Have you looked at his IG pics that are archived from before he went private?  Not to mention he painted over the pedo art that was all along the walls.  The only reason people think that he's a pedophile is because of his own accounts.  Who has a bunch of pics of kids in weird settings, who then is pictured digging tunnels and has a very large freezer room which he commented saying "#killroom" and then responded to a commenter with "#murder", while another commenter said "just spray it down when you're done".  One of those commenters makes child size coffins.  So yeah, people are definitely over-reaching here.  Not.  Some people choose to keep their eyes wide shut.

       yes i've seen all the evidence, debated the evidence with fanatics and always every bit of evidence has been accepted to be obviously false when we actually look at it, i mean honestly are you saying that everyone who likes art is a pedo or that you've never seen art before? these are big name artists here, this isn't like some 4chan nerd with a hdd full of henti it's the sort of thing that gets reviewed in magazines and wins prizes - posting art on your socialmedia feed doesn't make you evil.

       you're collecting a load of spurious nonsense and playing a game holding up one piece as a vital clue and then as soon as that's called into serious question you point to the massive mountain of shit and say 'but all that!' and people say 'pick the best bit of evidence then...' and you come back with some nonsense about underground tunnels and that's proven to be nonsense so you say 'but look at the mountain of bullshit, it's so big something has to be true...' and so people say 'well get the best bit of evidence then...' and we go through the whole thing forever because you never actually remove stuff that's discredited you sneak it back into the pile again when no ones looking...

       it looks like they're putting in a drain or some form of pipe, it's a small hole - you think they're molesting kids in a two foot deep, 3 foot wide hole? that doesn't even begin to make sense!

       If you care so much about the evidence you should search it yourself.  Obviously you have your mind made up about the subject and your mind is closed to it now.  I get it, but I do not have time to send you all the evidence, it has taken people many hours of research to connect these dots.  I haven't dedicated my life to this subject to pass out the perfect links for sceptics such as yourself, I randomly found the links to send to you.  I also don't have an imgur account and didn't feel I need to package the links perfectly for you, I did it on the fly.  The links are out there for people with an open mind on this subject to look through.  It's only your responsibility to search the facts, stop getting hostile with others because you're lost on this matter.

       ah back to this chapter of your playbook, the 'you would believe if only you'd seen all the evidence i can't tell you about...'
      </p>
      <p>
       I have searched for evidence myself, this is why you'll notice you've not shown me anything i haven't seen before - like remember when you claimed they were digging a tunnel and i said 'not a picture of people doing routine maintenance on a small business.' but it turned out that yes you were talking about that picture of a small, completely normal hole... etc, etc.. I think you need to stop and actually consider the evidence, think about each piece and if it actually proves or suggests anything or if it's just an over stretched fantasy... there is no evidence, that's why when i ask for a piece of evidence the best you can do it pictures from art gallerias or of routine building maintenance - there is no evidence because this whole thing has been imagined, probably by a group of people employed to spread disinformation...

       that doesn't change the fact that two pictures of small holes that appear to be for building maintenance is not evidence of anything except building maintenance, certainly not an international conspiracy of pedos involved in the kidnapping of maddy... i mean really, this is absolutely baseless madness.

       i have a very open mind, what you actually mean is you only want people who agree with you to talk about it because then it'll seem like you're right?  that is not a good way to do anything... certainly not look for a concealed truth in.  If you really believe in pizzagate then your most important task should be collecting the best evidence, putting it into a well sourced document and using that to convince people of the veracity of your claims --do you really think just wailing 'but i'm sure it's true, you have to believe me or it's not fairrrrr!!!!' is going to get you anywhere?!

Provide facts, provide good arguments, provide sensible inferences and people such as myself might listen to you, but run around screaming about the 'evidence' without being able to point to a single thing is just stupid.

       This case hasn't been properly investigated by officials, therefore the irrefutable proof you are requesting does not exist at this point in time.  The only investigation the government has done is to direct the MSM to label it "fake news" thus allowing the media to play judge and jury of media court, in order to disarm the public conscious and reassure the people that all "pissagate" info is for crazies by crazies.  Meanwhile they completely omit the several past cases where it has been proven true, covered up and spun into a nice PC media package ready for mainstream consumption.  The MSM is biased, they have proved that time and time again.  They have covered for pedophiles before and they are willing to do it again.  Shit, they HIRE pedophiles, most of the movie producers/directors are pedophiles that are still allowed to work with kids.
       <br/>
       We want an official investigation that's why we have brought this to attention, not so that crazies will go shoot the place up- which btw seems like another plot to make this scandal look fake and radical.  So the proof you're so desperately looking for, unfortunately isn't available, just a long trail of breadcrumbs.
       <br/>
       You are wasting your time here trying to convince people they are crazy to look into this, your time could be spent better else where.

       absolute, this is why some right-wing think tank invented and pushed it - it was a handy pre-election gambit to sway all those undecided conspiracy theorists then after the election when it doesn't matter they can turn on it along with everyone else and say 'see, fake news is bad we should remove it all, every last bit of it....'  this means that all the genuine stuff get's lost too.

       by jumping on board any old rubbish without demanding proof you're creating the excuse they need to shut down the more discerning people who seek the truth.

       this too is their game, they want sensible people to stay away so they can manipulate you without anyone pointing it out  - i know this and so will not stop saying the truth when i see it no matter how much you beg or threaten -- speaking the truth is important and i won't stop, not for you or for anyone.

       Same here buddy.

      <p>
       If it were an alt-right theory than the alt-right would back it, they don't nor do any MSM outlets.  There IS a very large under ground pedophile network, whether or not Comet Ping Pong is a part of it is only speculation right now.  It could be a decoy, but then why isn't the MSM covering it?  Why did Comet Ping Pong paint over the pedo art on the walls, if it was as innocent as he claims?  Why does he joke about kill rooms?  Why are babies and money referenced in multiple pics?  Why does he use sexual references of pics with kids in them?  There are so many questions, and the answers involve more than just taking a peak around his restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedi network has been exposed many times, as the links provided above in my previous posts show, it's just a question of how big it is and who all is involved.  Many of these documented pedophiles have not been criminalized and are allowed to maintain their positions with no repercussion to their place of employment, society, or social status.  Which also means they're still allowed to work with children.   So if you can show me some real proof that this guy is as innocent as you believe, I would love to see it.

       O I fully believe it's a strategy to just target people until they slip up like this.  It's impossible to defeat it if you think about it.  You have to be perfect and can't slip up once while they can just bait you like crazy.
      </p>

       Also, no one mentions he's a developer so he probably modified source code to make the changes he wanted.  I doubt every admin can make a macro that changes words out in posts for others, if so then wow.

       Shadowedit peoples posts without them knowing and purposely writing comments that violate T&amp;C. Then admins use those fake comments to justify shutting down a sub? That is the definition. A false event or person with the intent of taking action.

       The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not trying to be deceptive, they are flat out telling you what they did. Because you cannot stop them. They control the flow of information here, not the other way around. Don't kid yourself otherwise.

       He only admitted it when caught. Pizza gate mods have confirmed that users and comments were changed to violate the terms and justified the ban. Reddit faked as if they were users in order to violate the terms and shut the sub down. I don't know how much clearer that gets

       mods repeatedly neglected to address doxing in their sub, so the sub got banned. That's consistent with established Reddit policy. The only thing that the NYT article did was hold Reddit's feet to the fire and force them to finally pull the trigger on the rule that they
       <em>

       Speaking as a former mod of the aforementioned sub, there will be no proof provided because its absolutely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       We absolutely did have a lot of PII getting posted but we were always diligent to remove it. Unfortunately, there were also a few people that were given mod authority that behaved inappropriately and could lead some to believe the entire team was complicit. These same mods were removed quickly once we noticed what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the allegation that we refused to remove PII is a flat out lie by
       <a href="/u/OgreMagoo">
        /u/OgreMagoo
       </a>
       that he has no basis for. We did have some strong disagreements with the reddit admins we were in contact with, in regards to what actually violates the anti-doxxing rule. We as a team felt the rule was both too ambiguous and heavy handedly applied. However, we also were very respectful and fully willing to adhere to their given instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for clarity sake, they felt that the doxxing rule was being violated, not only when private information was publicly released, say from someones private facebook information, but also centrally collecting public information that is not originally associated. If the collective information had been in a central source from a news organization, it would have been fine, but since we were acting as journalists in this regard, it was disallowed.

       First of all, the mods always urged people to avoid any contact with any of the mentioned people. There were a few times people decided to go to some of the mentioned locations but I never saw anything to suggest they were truly a disturbance in these situations. Others decided to post inappropriate remarks on the facebook and instagram pages of some of these people. Absolutely not cool and we most assuredly removed those threads and banned a lot of people for performing these sort of actions.

       The sub had been opened for just over 2 weeks. We had a lot of plans we were in the process of fleshing out with tools to help people collaborate and organize. We grew at several thousand organic subscribers a day, sometimes 4,000+/d, far more than any other non-default sub, probably ever (with exception to exoduses). We just didn't have enough time to get things organized before people started shitposting like crazy.

       Do you understand how moderation works? People post things WITHOUT any checks. Then other people report it for breaking rules, THEN moderation kicks in and checks it...deleting it if rules are broken.  If a million people want to post personal info then a Mod team of 1/2 a dozen are going to struggle to keep up.

       The admin's word is good enough for me so long as there isn't any proof that they're lying. If the
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate

       mods release modmails showing that they were responding appropriately to the admins' requests and had made a good faith effort to crack down on doxxing, then I'll change my mind. Or something to that effect, something demonstrating that they were actually treated unfairly. I'd be upset with the admins about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I trust the admins unless there's proof to the contrary. Burden of proof is on the mods to show that they got shafted.

       I'll note that I do generally sympathize with these sorts of efforts, and that I would prefer that the admins provide more in-depth explanations for why they ban certain subreddits, especially those of

       We would release them but I don't think they were backed up unfortunately before we were locked out. We absolutely appropriately responded to any allegation of any PII being posted and expressed an earnest attempt to keep it from being elevated into the public view before being removed.

       They absolutely acted in a heavyhanded fashion.

       If the executives mentioned above want to close us down, then they'll find an excuse to do it. They'll plant some phony rabble-rousing users if they have to, doing the online equivalent of what happens to numerous legitimate in-person protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideas and discourse are considered a dangerous threat to these people. We--all of us here--threaten to upend their status as keepers of knowledge which has, for centuries, been the source of power.

       Exactly. Also, it is being leaked that admins were purposely posting PII to try and bring down pizzagate. Apparently the mods were banning user and deleting PII, but admins went above them and unbanned said users, and brought information back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether that is true or not I can't say with certainty, but given the recent spezgate, and the leaked slack chat, it seems VERY plausible.

       No it was immediately removed.   A few people apparently clicked on the link without realizing what it was.   I highly doubt any of them "downloaded" it.

       There's tons of people who downloaded it and confirmed the child porn in the thread you should go and look the whole sub is archived. I visited the thread when it was 16 hours old and the link was still up. The moderator stickied a comment about how the post was a honeypot to implicate other users of the sub because of the child porn and the illegitimacy of their "hack." Trust me man it was not immediately removed. There was child porn on the top post of the sub for a good amount of time.

       It was banned because it was getting a lot of attention

       it was rule breaking. It most certainly was banned for doxxing though, you can't really deny that.

       Subs that don't stir up the dust and attract attention might slip under the radar, but seriously doxxing will get you banned, regardless of the subject. That's just a fact.

       The right to free speech does not extend to a website. You are a guest in the house that reddit made. If you consistently don't follow the rules you get kicked out. It is pretty cut and dried. If the sub closed any other point you'd still be crying censorship... it had nothing to do with NYT. The sub was warned many many times.

       The personal information also included the pictures of minors they used in the infographics... They should have had black bars over the faces just like every other media outlet does. The mods didn't clean up enough of it... and certainly not fast enough... people kept reposting the same things again and again. Yes they were censored... just like I would be censored if I called you names or posted all in caps... because that is against the rules. Pizzagate was doomed from the beginning... you guys would link it's closure to any development that happened around in the same timeframe.

       What about the multiple other subs that were made in relation to pizzagate that got shut down within hours of being made did they breach any Reddit policies? If the intelligence agencies do not want to do their job and ignore something that has substantial evidence to suggest that there is something sinister going on it is our sovereign right as a community to investigate it ourselves.

       It was heading that way since day one... the mods repeatedly tried to get the user base to fall in line and couldn't. Everyone say it coming... thats why voat was up and running days ahead of time. They all knew they were on a sinking ship. It's a good movement... just on the wrong site to conduct an investigation that requires nonstop doxxing and posting of CP.

I don't know about IRC or Usenet and what their rules might be, but it seems as though you just don't want it on Reddit. Anywhere, but here. Right?

       You can spread info anywhere... you just can't do solid research here. Look into IRC and Usenet... or even just co-opt some abandoned message board system somewhere. Conducting a private investigation in one of the world's most public forums is counter productive. You are  having your hands tied from the beginning. You deserve more freedom than reddit can provide.

       Look for an opening anywhere and sneak in... Hell... something as simple as

       I knew it was doomed from the start. Not to mention your points, but the fact that
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       , including damage control CTR-like shills, could join and subscribe. On top of that the mods even suggested that people make a throw away account to investigate on pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then you have no basis for who is a shill and who's just trying to protect themselves. Lol. Stupid, if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan is where it started and 4chan is where it should have stayed. No sub reddit is going to do the job of law enforcement and that's where pizzagate is and has been for the last month: awaiting a proper legal investigation. I kinda wish the admins would have banned it from jump street because at least then the perps wouldn't have so much time to peruse the freely available "evidence" against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was like less than a week after the sub went up that Besta changed their logo. Hell, if that's not a clear cut sign that the perps are covering their tracks, idk what is.

       Yeah... we sent 2 places running... I'm sure they knocked off all illegal activities... and that is a good thing. But to focus on them for 3 weeks after that is overkill. I posted a very well documented case of child trafficking via a pizza front along with evidence of military involvement... it was deleted because it "was not what pizzagate is about". Then I knew they were just locked onto Comet and won't back down until they see every employee hanging from a tree... They want to see instant justice... and can't move on until they've seen it. I hope the new board  promotes more than just Comet bashing... I'll get involved again if I know my research will be accepted and extrapolated on.... until then

       No...I don't hate them.  I'm very much behind the movement... But hosting that kind of investigation on reddit is akin to hosting a cigar aficionado meeting in the cancer ward.

       A great idea... just not in the right place. I don't hate pizzagate... I admire their spirit to put an end to something terrible... I just don't want them coming over to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       The users here have a different mindset than the users at pizzagate... we are past the point of blind outrage at the human situation... and know we must work together within the system to end it... Spamming memes isn't part of our MO. Rational discussion is.

       You know, I first joined reddit because I thought it was progressive and anticensorship and would be a place to find things that normally are suppressed by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now reddit is doing the suppressing and you are all just shrugging and saying, "what'd you expect"?

       There are rules in place... you can't engage in a bunch of horseplay by the swimming pool and not expect to get kicked out when people complain. If reddit was a bastion of unfettered free speech then it would be filled with the exact kind of stuff that was all over twitter. They are as lenient as they can be without subjecting themselves to legal action which would endanger all the subs.

       I am all for speculating... It's just that if you don't follow the rules your work will go down the drain. There are plenty of places to brainstorm that aren't reddit. Refine the info then come here once it is fit for consumption based on the rules here. Reddit is one forum out of millions... I made speculative posts linking 9/11 to pizzagate to Scientology... and none of it was censored or removed.. because I stayed within the rules of the sub. You can wildly speculate all you want... it is healthy and productive... but there is a difference between peeking thru a window and kicking in a door.

       In an age where all rules and laws have a grey area and are disproportionately enforced in order to conform to an ageneda, it allows for censorship to flourish. Sure, they may allow you to post your connections you made to 9/11, and shit, you might get stickied talking about some cray trans-dimensional reptilian aliens. They allow it because they just think nobody is ever gonna believe you. I believe xizzxgate was censored for becoming too accessible, so much to the point where it was really waking a lot of people up, and it scared "them", so they then took steps to ensure its labeled as "fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, there are plenty of other forums online that are more open to free speech, and I will happily go there and support them. But that won't stop me from coming here to attempt in lifting the wool that's been pulled back over the eyes of the people of reddit who don't see the change from an open forum to just another piece of the MSM propaganda machine.

       The pizza stuff can definitely be an eyeopener if used correctly... if you can get people on board with that they are just a stone throw away from listening to Ted Gunderson... then when you see he is perfectly describing the pizza stuff... and about 75% of the other "conspiracies" you are ready to have a lot more wool pulled away.

       They've only temporarily stopped illegal activities. Everything is nice and clean, ready for investigations. Alefantis has been prepared and this is why the MSM is now reporting. Once they manage to deflect the heat, rest assured they'll restart things. RIP to anyone they had caged up a month ago because those kids are surely jelly in a tin now.

       Hell, it's quite possible that Trump has had to publicly back off because of this. Not that he was involved, but there's no win for him if he calls for an investigation and it turns up blanks. That would actually destroy him. Thankfully he's got more tact in one eyelash than the entirety of the pizzagate board.

       What your saying is we should crowd source and buy reddit. So some elite dickhead cant sway opinion?  Its real easy to tell which story from any online news source is lying or truth telling by whether or not it has a comment section. People get pretty mad and convincing when they are lied to. TPTB can attempt to censor this content and any other telling of truth but their efforts will be in vain. They have lost the information war, they are in a death spiral lashing out now, it will be their attempts to gain more control that will destroy them.

       Hey... I'm not saying it is perfect... but it is something. If anyone wants something better they are free to go to a better site. I can just control myself enough to not get kicked off of reddit.

       I think you're naive to think otherwise. It absolutely did break rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do also believe that it goes much deeper than that, with consideration to the "fake news" nonsense and the NYT article. Breaking site rules is only one justification for them to shut it down; though I'm sure there are others.

       Some users broke the rules, but it wasn't many, and the mods were actively working to ban those users.  They had actually just taken on more mods for that exact purpose.  I browsed all the threads there over the last few weeks, and I didn't see any PII or CP that wasn't removed in a reasonable time frame. Voat has an archive of the subreddit if you would like to show me some examples.

       I'm not a lawyer, but the pictures were pilfered from facebook, instagram and twitter accounts that have been since set to private. Maybe they are no longer public since they are set to private.

       You claimed posting the pictures was incorrect use of private information, while that is incorrect, as I pointed out. Its not like these people posting, used some hidden backdoor access, AFAIK. Any person's privacy issue was due to their own negligence.

       Did I mention, anything about the people's comments or posts? You are attempting to bait people it appears. I saw you mention earlier, about freedom of speech doesn't extend to the internet. That I consider a problem.

       I said I don't know the law, I was just speculating... and freedom of speech doesn't extend to the internet. Reddit is a privately owned public space... just like if you went on an obscenity laden rant at a restaurant they could kick you out. They don't even need to explain themselves... you are on private property and will be ejected for violating the rules they have set forth.
      </p>

       I'm behind the pizzagate movement... I'm just smart enough to know that reddit isn't the place for it to make significant progress... Just like the yodeling association doesn't hold their practice in the public library.

       Some users broke the rules. If they're to be believed, the mods were very active in shutting down PIE when it arose. The users were banned by the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are talking about site rules... What happened to sub quarantines? What happened to warning strikes? The behavior of the Admins is highly variant from what the subreddit shutdown process is expected to look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that almost every sub could be shut down if held to the same standard that r/pg was. This is similar to the fact that any police officer could pull over any vehicle if they follow them for long enough, based on how complicated and subjective traffic laws are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it's a privately owned website. They can do what they want. But, they can't hold onto any semblance of credibility when they crack down on people trying to stop organized child sex slavery, who have flown too close to the sun.

       Yes, technically it did. But if you look at the bigger picture and the history of Reddit and how these things have been handled in the past, it is blatantly obvious that the admins jumped on the first chance they got to shut it all down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was a sub for knitting and they broke that rule, the whole thing would not have been shut down plus shutting down any other new sub that had to do with knitting, knitting shopper tips, and anything to do with sewing overall. We have been through this enough times as a community to see the pattern and as the people running the site get smarter on how to corral the sheep, they look for legitimate reasons that most people would not think to question or look beneath the surface of, and then hold a virtual pillow over the faces of anyone who disagrees till they stop breathing.

       Actually no one broke any rules. People used info and names obtained from the emails the posts were regarding, and investigated from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in essence- any time someone questions something, or attempts to use evidence to implicate someone in something- it is "illegal." So if you question anything the media reports, or attempt to do your own investigating on anything, the "slippery slope" says that they can and will eventually be able to silence you for thinking or expressing anything that differs from what the media wants you to think.

       We, as redditors, don't have the right to be sharing the personal information of people regardless of its availability online. It's why we can't post Facebook accounts or anything else that divulges someone's personal information. People were harassing the establishments named on and offline.

       I made the jump to voat to keep up with pizzagate, but I'm still aware of reddit's basic rules. Some people weren't and damaged the movement's credibility.

       No, but reddit's sitewide rules don't allow the posting of personal information like phone numbers or addresses. Remember, this guy was only suspected of our claims -- without irrefutable proof, it's a witch hunt and harassment.

       A user got banned for publishing a list of Facebook accounts (of comet ping pong employees). Apparently that was a gross violation. This is public information, but you cannot discuss it. Every one can see it, but no one must talk about it.

       People were posting personal phone numbers and addresses from time to time, despite mod warning and interference. And yes cp was posted at least twice. Once on purpose as 'proof' and once (afaik) by accident as a consequence of linking to the twittergate fiasco.

       The whole "We the Pizza" ordeal had OP post CP as proof of his story. Other people saw it and confirmed. It was an all day thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then twittergate happened and some people started linking to the relevant twitter accounts. Other people had to warn users not to dig through the accounts because they contained CP.

       I was a mod in pizzagate. Yes, there was child porn posted twice. Twice both very quickly removed. But I'm not showing you proof of that, because fuck that. We did keep on top of removing anything that broke the rules to avoid doxxing and witch hunts, and as we got to about 15,000ish subs the shills and trolls came fast as well so we added (well, mainly pizzathrowaway777 and ned_harrison added) a few more mods to stick around /new to keep in to of it. But oh well, they shut it down anyway.
       <br/>
       That doesn't mean the end of it though. I'm glad to see the exposure here. It's just the start.

       The police send employees dressed as protestors into the crowd to break a few windows and throw a few rocks at their coworkers so that rubber bullets, mace, and tear gas can be "legally" deployed. I don't doubt for one fucking second the same tactic was used here.

       That's the problem is the sub did identify the pizza shop owner and he found that his business was getting brigaded on Yelp, people whose pictures were on the pizza place's website were getting their own FB and instagram pages brigaded, threats were coming at these people, and the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYT article certainly brought a lot of attention to these things which put Reddit in the unenviable position of either letting a sub that originated this brigading, even to the point where people were going to the establishment to "investigate", continue or to shut the sub down.

       late to the thread, but theres some drama about the mod on v/pizagate, no one knows who he is and is very strict about removing threads that aren't directly related. much of the community support him though.

       Yeah.  I read a little bit about that incidentally yesterday.  Seems possibly sketchy for sure and something that definitely needs to be looked into more, but I wouldn't go as far as to already say Voat's "compromised" as
       <a href="/u/noname318">

       Under the imgur it reads yellow brick road.
and tra cd
My answer: tra cd is simple. dc art - DC ART TRANSFORMER KEY
so the key is transformer art dc. That is an art gallery/ incubator in DC that alefantis and podesta formed or sit on the board of. Can't tell which it is. If you check 4 ch@n, they're already following this lead. 
Yellow Brick Road can tie into people who say wIZARD OF oZ relates to mindcontr0l stuff.
Its all so wild.

       it did when what most of what is called the security council of the UN now (mostly Russia) Revengedx1000, like they should have, the disrespect of their non-interference pact with Germany in the summer o 41, behind enemy lines, the almost infinite Russian landscape had workers invent war products such as guns of better quality, same as the tanks, and they can only thank the UK for the air cover early on. The war could have ended before may 1945 in Europe but Hitler was a prissy little fag who said if I go down we all go down.

       Man, I wonder why they would have thought that pizzagate2 would have anything at all to do with pizzagate. You were innocently just standing there ready and waiting to be an immediate backup if they banned a sub. Why would they be so mean and shut you down without giving you the chance to replicate the exact things that got the first sub banned? What jerks!

       Great post thanks, though you're missing one huge detail - they didn't just ban
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       , but all subs that were related to it. Even subs with no 'witch-hunting' going on. New subs were even made then shut down to test this.

       This
       <strong>
        proves it wasn't an issue of rule-breaking, but that Reddit admins are actively protecting child abusers

       First, you
       <em>
        just

       got done saying that these subs are doing no harm, and then you turn around and say that the admins are "protecting" those people? You're contradicting yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: "Child abusers". This is the exact reason these people need to be protected. These are only theories, nothing is concrete. Acting like these people have been tried and convicted and are guilty because they used to have a pedophile logo on their pizza is insane. You might as well say
       <strong>

       Devil's advocate here. Getting this sub shut down over #Pizzagate could actually be a huge fucking win for all of us. Think about, this is a large sub with a lot of users and even journalists pulling/pushing stories here, if we went down fighting it could send an awesome message and put the nail in the coffin for Reddit, who's time has come and gone. Let them shut us down for nothing, it will would be the worst thing they ever did for their "business model".

       This is the holy grail of conspiracies. It seems our time has come, the doorbell is ringing, what shall we do? I'm not saying we need to doxx or harass anyone to achieve this, but some direct action is needed. Get the information out there, keep it out there. Plaster those infographics all over social media. Warm up the meme machines. Put the tag in your comments. This is way bigger than a makeshift subreddit or community on the internets being able to stay together. We can disband and assimilate again for important causes. It
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be this way, because then we are untouchable. Reddit is not the only place we can go, it is one of many. There are evil people in this world, and they are scared shitless of #Pizzagate.

       Yes this is exactly what i was thinking. R/conspiracy has over 400k subscribers, we hold a lot more power than i think most of us realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is an organized effort to continue the research of r/pizzagate HERE on r/conspiracy and dare the admins to remove us. Not by witchunting or doxxing, but by the unabashed well sourced research that got ALL pizzagate related subs banned. Spez got caught today, if they attacked us next they wouldn't be able to handle to backlash. We have the power to leverage them.

       No, don't jump to conclusions about your evidence when there is clearly not enough to substantiate the outlandish claims made by "pizzagate". I would take a step back and really access what evidence they have and ask yourself whether they are making wild leaps in logic and whether they have a case.

       while i do agree with this completely, i looked at a lot of the circumstantial evidence and i have to admit its really fucking bizarre. the dudes instagram has both pictures of kids and then references to sex everywhere. it gave off a sincerely creepy vibe, but i do agree i think its been stretched VERY far.

       Exactly, it's ridiculous.  That people involved were getting death threats based on conjecture.  And now they think it's a huge conspiracy because it got shut down.  I for one feel the sub will improve once all the easily swayed people leave.  Most are the same suckers that supported Trump.  Not exactly a brain trust.

       So, I was a mod of
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       until about 4 days ago (got removed due to concern trolling which sparked the unfounded perception that there was somehow an issue with regards my role in providing moderator oversight on
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       ); it is important to understand the background dynamics going on with
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       , as that is what ultimately lead to its closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the first week of moderating the sub, we received 2 warnings from different admins regarding PI on the subreddit. This lead to a post that I made, wherein I made it clear that, for the subreddit to survive, the mods were going to have to work diligently to remove PI of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sticky was well received for the most part, users seemed to understand that, if they wanted to discuss that kind of info, they had to go offsite, and the mod team left up my announcement for 4 or 5 days. However, I was removed from the mod team while the sticky was still up and was unable to follow through with a lot of what would have been required by the reddit admins for the sub to continue functioning (they would have wanted to see some kind of automod reports to the modmail for facebook/instagram links, and they explicitly told us that were we to remove anything that could even potentially be PI for "non-public figures", run it by them, and then reapprove if it was okay on their end.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My removal from the mod team is relevant only because the people who were moderating the sub were all new to reddit, had little understanding of core site functionality (not to mention the very high degree of nuance required when dealing with the admins during site-wide TOS issues), and were still learning the ropes even after I left the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was in that context that a perfect storm of mechanisms came together to engulf the sub in a conflagration; as an inexperienced mod team, with no understanding of how reddit admins apply their tos during maor "shit storms", simply let their guard down and received their inevitable third strike. With no presence of any automod rules to help deal with the large influx of doxxing following the NYT piece (You can read former reddit ceo Yishan Lee's comment on how press effects reddit operations
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/58zaho/the_accuracy_of_voat_regarding_reddit_srs_admins/d95aoft/?context=5">
        here
       </a>
       , wherein yishan makesit quite clear that during "press events", the influx of new users tends to overwhelm a community), the mods of
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       were only one slip up away from being banned. Whether that slip up came in the form of a malicious actor intentionally trying to subvert the flow of information by having the sub banned, or simply a new user unfamilair with the rules of reddit as a whole, is, for the most part irrelevant as the sub was literally on its death kneel and there was nothing anyone could have done to save her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voat.co/v/pizzagate is a valuable resource for continuing the important work of the investigation, and I think it is absolutely terrifying that,
       <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/563846/twitter-child-sex-porn-ring-pizzagate-gamer-leaks-thousands-of-social-media-accounts">
        one day after 20,000 pedo twitter accounts were shut down as a result of this investigation
       </a>
       , the sub got banned; but I think it's clear the situation is far more complex than some would make it out to be.

       Sorry buddy, Reddit as a platform for unaffiliated journalism is dead. Join me and the other former mods over at Voat, at least until it gets nuked. We all independently felt this was a likely outcome and moved to initiate backup channels of communication. This is phase 2.5.

       We had 20-25k, just need to start saturating broader subs and people will catch on. Hell, my Mom signed up to reddit for p-gate.

       I am not sure saturating is a good idea. It would draw too much attention too quickly.

      <p>
       Better to grow slowly and surely, in like minded subs first. We need a solid user base that can reliably vote relevant content, and keep us stable and protected against brigading and the likes.

       What struck me as ironic is the essence of pizza gate is a witch hunt. From the occult standpoint this investigation is partly about hunting witches, in a sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I get what they meant. 
And here is a different view. The energy of that site was getting very intense. In the barely four weeks since the investigation started I think with all of the frustration and confusion of it, things were moving too fast. Some were getting paranoid, sometimes there wasn't enough caution emphasised etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is a good opportunity to not blame the admins, but I think it was the energy of the group itself that needed a break and collectively chose this way to step back, if even only for a few hours, to reflect and regroup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read somewhere else the mods of that site were even swamped with issues people were having. I commend them for their efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza gate and where it leads needs to be grounded. You can't just have all this stress, anxiety, confusion, fears and consequences coming in from every angle at once. Sometimes it takes a little time to absorb it cause we can only handle so much at a time in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least from an individual standpoint. This will only make us stronger and more prepared in the days and months to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take a break for an hour, a day. Rest your soul, give it time to heal from some of the things you become aware of. It's always good to do that so you don't overwhelm yourself. When each of us are overwhelmed to a point we then become a collective that is overwhelmed, and we will shut it down on ourselves again. So let's stay grounded.

       The witch hunt, as you appropriately call it, originated in 4chan, a site known for being a pool and reservoir of very very dark energy. I would trust absolutely nothing that originates from there.

       It was growing exponentially. I think that is very relevant. You have to add in the fact that our government is run by the pedophiles. They saw it taking off and they recognized it as a threat so they had it shut down.

      <p>
       It is really obvious that is what happened. Everyone who was watching could see it.

       We only care about bringing pedophiles to justice. "r/conspiracy" as a community is useless if it is not able to take a stand or take action.

       There's no point in new content about the grassy knoll, Roswell, etc. ACTIONABLE and CURRENT information is the only thing that makes a community like this worth a damn. And this community can exist on voat just fine if we have to.

       Waking up to this is a difficult experience - it's fascinating, but also deeply disquieting. Furthermore, as you have found out, it is extremely frustrating (because most of the people around us don't get it, and even worse, don't care!). But this isn't a modern phenomenon (viz the ancient greek legend of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra">
        Cassandra
       </a>
       ).

       don't buy a gun while you are going through a state of freaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       super freaky stuff has been going on for A LONG time.
      </p>
      <p>
       when you start to realize any part of it -- is really happening -- you go through this crucible of shock/disorientation/paranoia - all sorts of bad feeling. it happens to everybody as far as I can tell. BUT it will pass. maybe in weeks, maybe months/ maybe less. but you will regain your equilibrium and you will start to be able to process that there is so much weird shit happenning that all your life you never realized. It really is ok. they are not coming to take you away. I promise. just go through this feeling. recognize it;s a kind of shock/withdrawl from your previous world view, and take it as easy as you can. and no weapons. not until you feel well again.
      </p>
      <p>
       you might not ever be able to fully share this with your friends. if you can - -you are lucky, but don't push them too hard or judge them too hard if they just can't relate or hear you on this -- going through these stages of realization is deeply scary and painful and some people (I think) they just know they can't. so they don't. or if they do -- they need to do it for themselves -- and not feel pushed into it etc, so you might fee llonely that you can't talk about this stuff -- but other people are out there, you may meet them - it's hardly impossible.

       Thank you for your great comment it really is beneficial for a person to look at it that way!
But will also strikes me is this fact. The fact that this unfolding is going hand-in-hand with the race to the White House! I fear if this will not be addressed, we could lose our sovereignty forever! Governments around the world are pushing his fees rhetoric of controlling the Internet!
I hope we all see the gravity of the situation and start realizing that we need to be woken right now. And it's not a matter of love hate relationship and it is a matter that runs way deeper than that!

       I don't wnt to suggest that what your saying isn't true, when in fact I do agree with you that it is true, free speech is super important, incredibly important.
      </p>
      <p>
       however -- I am getting the feeling you are just starting to wake up to some of what is going on. and more waking up will help you get more perspective on the greater picture -- of what has been going on for at least a few hundred years, (very hard to know how long really). But I' also not sure precisely which issue you are referring to being woken up to? is it the issue of repressing free speech on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the country's sovereignty, ugh. I've got some dreary news for you that you may or may not be ready to hear rt now -- but our country has never been what the history books tell us it is, our sovereignty is a lot like santa clause, we believe in it, that's all. Who really controls us -- I don't know. there are plenty of theories on that. but our government at the top is playacting on all sides. and always has been, I promise you. we are not loosing anything we have, you are just realizing we don't have it. That's not to say we can't fight and get it. I think we can... but just to say -- there are a lot more layers here to figure out  A LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are right to  be fired up about what is happening rt now -- but with an understanding of all that is happening - yo might even prioritize what you are fired up about with broader scope.
      </p>
      <p>
       also about pizza gate specifically , I can not tell if it is real or a planted pile of evidence meant to freak out people just like you and me,  I looked at a lot of the evidence - and if it's all authentic well then it looks super like the accusations are completely factual. However, the CIA does PLANT stories like this - for the purpose of putting people off the track of what is really going on -- and completely filling their imaginations with awful things. so even if the story is a plant -- that's still horrible. I really can't tell what it is either way, but -- it's good to know that the CIA loves to plant fake stories to mess with people who are researching off the path MSM provides for the public. Unfortunately I can't yet think of a way to be sure about this one either way. but the fact that reddit banned it -- actually makes me wonder if it's fake -- like a planned tennis match to catch us up in and further fuel our obsession with needing to know, it's not above them to do that.

       You don't have to agree... There are so many better pictures that would get the point across... without making this place look like it is run by a bunch of 13 year olds. It's a fucking stupid picture and never have I seen one so dumb here.

       It sends the wrong message... when we have the same picture on our wall that a bunch of pedopervs also loved to have on their wall.

       You already know the context of the pic though. Anyone just rolling through might see that pic and immediately think less of this sub since they don't know the deal. I agree with u/ninjakick666 that its not a great sidebar pic.

       Why are you not able to comprehend that the pic came from one of the actual emails. It's culturally significant because the pedo subculture that circulated it and thinks it's funny is being protected by the elite. It's politically significant because Podesta was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager and is associated with the pedo subculture. Got it?

       ... we discuss topics that have caused others to lose their lives for speaking out about. An image like that undermines the seriousness of sexual assault... turns it into a funny little joke... when it is anything but. I can understand it has some shock value, but in general makes the movement look immature and idiotic.

       It's pretty degrading, especially considering the likelihood that some pizzagate users are trying fervently to find details that can bring missing family members home. One in ninety two children in the US go missing every year. The sub had 14,000 members.

       Key takeaway:  if you are going to doxx or brigade be sure to do it on a sub that justifies the establishment, on an account created via tails+TOR, so it makes it very difficult for them to stop without breaking all of reddit.  Tee hee

       All this shit started happening after Monica Petersen's death.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what brought down the hammer on this sub and the Italian sub, as well as mainstream media attacking the Pizza all of a sudden and the big push on the Fake News narrative. Monica Petersen is the key to all this. Hillary Clinton also gave that press conference without make-up last Wednesday hours after the Monica story broke. It's all fucking connected.
It was all fun and games until am American girl investigating the Clintons in Haiti hit the jackpot and paid with her life. When that was exposed - OPERATION PIZZA CLEANSE was initiated on all fronts - Reddit, Twitter, FB, NYTIMES, you name it.

       So, continue the discussion but instead of disclosing personal information, take a page outta the pizzagate playbook and rename things such that they aren't literal examples of personal information.  Problem solved.  Pizza vs Pizza.  The same plausible deniability that defends the suspected pedos can defend the suspected pedo finders.

       Personal information like "I am a reporter." I think that is a little bit too restrictive. That is not really personal so much as it is stepping on media toes. They will always make up an excuse.

       It was shut down...because they tried to expose a deep conspiracy that should never be discussed in the public. Reddit is public. But we just discuss about what has been exposed.

       I've already read that, and have been following PizzaGate from the very beginning. I'm not someone who just glanced at the "evidence" and then dismissed it immediately. I have taken it very seriously from the start because of the people involved, and have gone over all of the "evidence" multiple times. I just have a very different take on it than most of the people here seem to. I haven't seen a single thing yet that has convinced me it's real. I've seen some tasteless jokes, bad performance art, and emails being taken out of context.

       It's fine if you feel differently about it all...there's no way
       <em>
        either
       </em>
       of us can know the truth. NONE of us can know for certain if they're innocent or guilty of anything, it's all just speculation at this point. Which is why I hate seeing
       <em>
        potentially
       </em>
       innocent people being harassed in real life.

       These people are wusses, they wouldn´t dare go after real criminals, for example, drug traffickers. because they know those people really are drug traffickers and not just innocent pizzeria owners or what have you. E.g. imagine if they decided to go after El Chapo´s sons with just 10% of the zealousness they´ve shown going after obviously inoffensive people, who stand out for essentially one thing, being tenuously connected to the Democratic party. Also, you´ll notice that implicit in this witch hunt is the subtext that the Democratic party, the party of gay rights, liberals, urban types, artistic types, is, has to be the party of pedophilia!

       The implication is, don't organize any witch hunts out in public. Reddit can't have it's face placed on the results. That's the plainest truth and an ordinary business position to hold.

       Rule of thumb is to just ignore them and downvote them or provide simple short responses in conjunction with downvotes. The key is mass downvoting of trolls, it immediately discredits whatever they say to anyone browsing the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       ex: It is very clear to me that you have a bias on this topic and your input does not contribute to the discussion in a constructive manner. Good day.

       I'd rather just believe I'm losing it a little, that's a much more realistic explanation...I mean, it's one thing that admins let users who send PMed death threats to

       users keep threatening

       Y'all wonder why you're running around attacking pizza restaurants instead of connecting the dots between Epstein, Trump, and Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       The stupid emanating from this pizza thing is discrediting and gives cover to actual corruption. And it's bad energy for your psyche, will be even worse when you find out you've been had. (But maybe it'll teach a few people critical thinking? One can hope?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, it's an op, but not the way you think, they've found a way to weaponize stupid -- try to be a little skeptical and a little inquisitive and try not to let them use you for their own aims next time. This one's even more dangerous because people have been encouraged to threaten people and businesses and download nefarious files - do you guys ever wonder about the identity of those who try to gin up this kind of thing - to get you to engage in criminal behavior in pursuit of "good" that they define based on outlandish non-evidence?

       Credulously believing every stupid thing you hear on 4chan is not a "search for truth." Sending death threats and inciting others to engage in terroristic acts is a crime - it has nothing to do with finding truth, it has to do with mob mentalities...and honeypots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is out there - but that stuff exists to keep you from it AND it discredits actual findings and citizens and activists exposing real corruption.

       I haven't sent death threats or incited anyone to engage in terroristic acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the evidence, and while obviously there is no smoking gun, there is definitely enough evidence for a serious investigation to be opened.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that's the problem. The government has ZERO credibility and will do nothing and we all know the government will do nothing, so all we can do is try to expose these heinous crimes to the public and let the public seek it's own form of Justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call it mob mentalities...  Well, when the very government that is supposed to maintain the rule of law refuses to do it, then you naturally end up with vigilante justice.

       A few points: Credibility overrides truth. Sometimes they overlap but most of the time they do not. People will beleive MSM over anything realated to pizzagte.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way is to focus on one aspect of this that is plausible. The Madeine Khan case. Most people would think the same thing: gee those sketches do look an awful lot like Podesta and His brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of having a pissing contest with "pizzagate". Focus on the Madeline Khan case.

       It's Madeleine McCann but otherwise you may be correct. That may be the straw. Plus, they're both public figures so my understanding is that's not doxing. Correct me if I'm wrong?

       I don't participate in this sub much because I'm not usually as well researched as most of the posters here. But even I don't believe that Reddit shut down
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       due to violating the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the whole 'witch-hunt' thing is designed to be a catchall to stop legitimate discussion. While I completely understand having a 'let's not be a direct action site' policy, I think that, for a site that supposedly promotes free speech, Reddit often seems to try to derail or suppress that very thing. IF someone is possibly engaging if child abuse, why is it a witch-hunt to investigate it? As long as people keep their investigations unbiased, why is it harmful? It's just a group of people trying to get to the truth. If that truth happens to involve specific people, then that's naturally going to focus the investigation on those people. That's kind of like the police saying "well, the husband was at home when his wife was murdered and he was covered in her blood and was holding the knife while standing over the body but we need to investigate a bunch of other completely unrelated people or else it's a witch-hunt".
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe is happening is that Reddit, and many sites like it, are slowly stifling free speech and giving it no place to live. It's forcing people who are interested in finding the truth off of large sites where they are safer and onto smaller, more vulnerable sites where it's easier to suppress them. I'm not saying this is Reddit's
       <em>
        desire
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        policy
       </em>
       but it is a
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       of what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       That concerns me.  It makes hiding things much easier for the powerful and influential. It makes shutting down your enemies much easier and more effective. It dilutes the concentration of people involved in any movement because they now have to go to 20 sites to engage instead of one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, that scares me.

       I'm not disagreeing with you, but irrespective of the
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       reasons, the admins were gifted a "legitimate pretext" to close that sub down, and they used it. That is why
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       has to extra vigilant not to give the admins any valid cause to try the same thing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no problem naming actual criminals, but there are issues with naming what are merely suspected criminals, because technically these individuals are still "innocent" (and could sue for defamation). The problem we have with pizzagate is pinning a provable crime on any specific individual.

       They

       I felt pretty torn on the pizzagate sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually discovered who one of the artists was, for an obscure piece of artwork found in the pizza joint, and the significance of the discovery was that it confirmed that 1. the artwork was definitely depicting child sexual assault, and 2. that the artwork would have been specifically sought out for its content, as opposed to randomly found at an art fair or by some other means.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to prove my findings, I had to expose sources that would have allowed for people viewing the sub thread to contact the artist directly, opening up the possibility of the artist being harassed by a bunch of crazy strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making that matter even worse, was that the artist was a victim of CSA with severe trauma problems, and her artwork was a simplistic-style (not detailed and graphic) representation of the psychological effects of CSA trauma, so it was part of her therapy and also used to raise awareness of how damaging CSA is to children. Someone was exploiting her artwork, she was a victim of pedophiles, and so she wasn't automatically some culprit and certainly didn't deserve to have anyone harassing her or accusing her of horrible things.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I shared the information with the sub, I wasn't sure if I was making the right decision or not, as in ethically right vs ethically wrong. If it could help build a case that could eventually expose criminals, which could lead to saving hundreds to thousands of children, then the risk would seem worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then most of the people who responded to the information were just making disparaging remarks about the artist. They didn't seem to value the information as something sensitive that was important to helping build evidence of reasonable suspicion of the pizza joint and those associated with it. They didn't seem perceptive or mature enough to distinguish between a victim expressing herself, and actual pedophile culprits. And it also struck me as almost alarming that nobody had been able to figure out over a matter of weeks how to do a 15 second image search on Google to find the artist but instead people had been asking if anyone knew anything, yet despite not being able to figure out something as simple as an image search, many people of the 4chan variety were speculating that maybe some FBI agent wanted them to do the FBI's job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it just all turned so pathetic and severely cringe-worthy as I was watching it. There is such a desperate need for people who are intelligent, mature and morally sound enough to dig into such horrific happenings in our world, but that sub was mostly full of edgelords who just wanted to gawk at a sensationalist pedo thriller story. In the end I regretted my decision to share and am glad it was removed.

       Thanks for sharing that. I think most users on
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       had honourable intentions, but CSA is an ultra-sensitive issue, and in truth the populist and irreverent nature of reddit means is not the optimal platform for a serious discussion about it, or how to combat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As regards the artist, I think you are referring to Kim Noble, who as you say is a victim - and a deeply disturbed woman. Even though her art may therapeutic value for her (as well as providing income) the extreme nature of her painting appeals to a certain type of person, and for the "wrong" reasons. It is hard to believe a normal, balanced individual would want to hang her pictures in their home, and certainly not in a pizza joint.

      <p>
       Correct, and that was the significance of the information. While her artwork has been very important and useful in raising awareness, it has no place in a pizza parlor with children. It also showed that whoever purchased and decided to display the art in the pizza parlor had been seeking such content specifically to display in such a place. But the majority of responses I was seeing to the info in that sub weren't even perceptive enough to see that point, and were instead just making very immature remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So naturally I felt like I had made the wrong judgement call in exposing places where she could be personally contacted, to a crowd full of people like that, when most of the crowd didn't even seem capable of making proper use of the information. It wound up being a risk to a very damaged victim, and then for nothing. So I swiftly regretted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like some people like her artwork for the wrong reasons, some people are interested in pizzagate for the wrong reasons, as well. Different reasons, but still wrong reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I still don't feel 100% confident on what is the "right thing" when it comes to the topic of doxxing people who may be connected to highly suspicious activity that reeks of pedo interests. Doxxing is extremely damaging and traumatizing to innocent people, and yet if the authorities do not do their jobs to investigate discretely and then apprehend culprits, that only leaves everyday citizens.. who don't know how to do things discretely and respectfully (i.e. all the potatoes who started leaving accusations on the social media of the people running the pizza joints). So maybe there is no "right" option, I admit. But I still felt bad about the risk to a victim that I was promoting, when it turned out to be for nothing.

       Justice is the "right" thing.  This might be a little cognitive dissonance, but do you know why they say that Justice is blind???  Justice is blind to the law.  When those who are tasked with upholding the Rule of Law refuse to do so, Justice does not sleep.  No, Justice recruits disciples to fulfill Justice in a vigilante form.  All we have is Truth, Freedom and Justice.

I explained that I felt ethically conflicted when I realized that I had provided a means to contact her directly through one of the sites I provided as evidence, to a bunch of people who were not only too stupid to figure out how to do an image search on their own in the first place, but who were also such immature edgelords that they just started leaving shitty comments about the artist herself, including a comment that she deserved to be killed which received upvotes, instead of focusing on the information as another piece of supporting evidence / that victims were being exploited. Your "no true scotsman" statement is hilarious given the point of my post and your own lack of reading comprehension skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I get the other point you are trying to make, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if some of the morons who started attacking those people on social media, were actually deliberately trying to sabotage the investigation by "tipping off" those people, causing them to set everything to private and also make researchers as a whole look bad. I get what you are saying, and I agree with you that there is always that factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't and am not claiming that the thread I made was "illegal" but just that I was disgusted by most of the responses from that sub and it made me feel regret over having shared the information. I would support a sub with quality moderation, that only accepted comments/threads of information and explanations of theories, along with the no doxxing rule. But it's too late for that now, isn't it.

       We all, in any investigation, need to be more critical and fact-checking indeed. Of course doxxing helps no one right now but your example is even worse. Was a guy named A***** K*** and there were 2 of them, one working for DNC or relatives - and he was not the first guy. So yeah I would be pissed if I was him too.

       TBH - i think PizzaGate is batting well below .300 in finding solid evidence on Reddit. 
There seems to be a surge of momentum but true conspiracy theorists have never ran at internet pace.  Not sure about how I feel at some people doxxing the innocent and proclaiming them to be part of something because they are 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon on instagram from some of the main people involved.

       I didn't say we were batting 0. Just under .300. 
Posting a photo of someone and their niece = fine. 
Posting a video of a person tied up = SaF. 
The tricky thing with conspiracies is that you can't be too sloppy. The people who don't want the story coming out live &amp; die on anything that the public can chew on and say "it's sloppy" or "they're crazy".

       If anyone has hard evidence of criminal activity, they should report it directly to law enforcement, not reveal the identity/ies of the perpetrator(s) on reddit. Pizzagate hints at such activities but doesn't specificy them - there is nothing directly indictable in the Podesta pizzagate emails that I'm aware of.

       I am too lazy to find anywhere else to post that since everything is so c0mpromised...
Just sort of odd how most of the things related to Pgate dovetial to other kid related things.
       <br/>
       Anyhoo, I notice that T. P0desta's ex, Heather was honored by N0 Kid Hungry. Looked into a bit &amp; noticed resumes of people coming &amp; going to it via Clint0n F0undation. It may even be a branch of it.
Then I saw the whole big KeIIogg backlash today. (they boycotted Brietbart advertising)
Huge connection between keIIogg and NKG. So creepy lady has no kids, just creepy art collection of them, but is named a HERO for a kid related org that also has ties to people connected to CLlnt0n Foundation and KeIIoggs ? Hmm.

       The more you look, the more connections become apparent. At this point, all children's charities need to be investigated, because they have the perfect cover for abduction/abuse as well as being hitherto "above suspicion".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1980s in the UK, there was well know charity promoted by the Establishment (and a particular celebrity called Esther Rantzen) called Childline which encouraged abused children to phone in and report their abuse. It appears that the real purpose was so that paedos could skim off vulnerable children who called in, stop them going to the police, and possibly shut them up altogether. Childline still exists, although it appears to be fully legitimized now.

       Wouldn´t it be best to recruit some actual pedophiles, for example from a pedophile support group on Reddit, and use them as bloodhounds so to say, and see if they can sniff out their own kind by reading and analyzing the Pizzagate data? I mean who better to catch a pedophile than another pedophile.

       Well, many reasons I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) A Pedo would probably don't hand over another Pedo. They are very networked as far as I can see and I guess like in most criminal circles, they don't backstab each other
B) Do YOU realy want to give a Pedo a way to get high ranking contacts with a way to make them do what he / she wants? 
C) I guess most leads have been sniffed out from the mail

       Can we create a r/spez sub? Obviously we couldn't make it directly r/spez due to witch-hunting, however,  we have to somehow burn this asshole to the ground for editing our messages to make it look like we were sending inflammatory and derogatory messages.

       I mean the scary part of all this is what's to say someone like him wouldn't send out C.P. on someone's behalf.
What he did is unforgivable and it actually could bring litigation against him.

       I can not  figure out if I think Pizza gate is a planted story or real. It's actually very suspect to me that Reddit shut down the story -- it could mean it's just that real. or --- nothing gives credit to a subversive story like getting shut down by reddit, this also could be a way of intentionally firing up the researchers - to shut it down, -- I mean that is what it's done. ugh. I really could see it either way.  There does seem to be a plethora of information that leads to near certainty some sort of child rape/murder/canibalism? crime ring exists within these pizza businesses. It's horrific. .....if all those emails and other collected evidence is real -- the crime ring is real. no question.  However I would not put it past the CIA to craft such a story through creating all of these discoverable images/emails/ posts/ texts/businesses etc. Like a mind-f easter egg hunt. And then use the uproar to shame and discredit the people who feel passionate about getting to the bottom of this and stopping the abuse/ - or there could even be some other motive for the mind-f. Is it horrible pedophilia nancy drew bait for free thinking good people? Or is it REAL??? I just can't tell either way, I think it's real. bt I think some things that are not real are tied in -- for example the madeline Mccann case seems like a clear hoax, Wikileaks itself seems like controlled oposition/cia, and I trip on on a few other things/; this story is swelling over thanksgiving vacation. there always seems to be leaked fake scandals on holiday time, -- I think they expect they need to take up peoples free time lest they rest and think their own thoughts for a few days. also the "tunnels" being dug -- are so small -- they are not really functional for what we are to think they are used for. this all might be a trick to mess with us. it also might be real/ i think Joe Biden is a real pedophole. no question. so where there is smoke there is likely fire --- there are A LOT of indicators bad creepy stuff is going on behind doors of political life. something LIKE this thing probably does exist -- but is this particular thing real or fake? it's surely walking and talking like a pedo crime ring duck. but the CIA loves to create fake morbid mysteries to capture american attention/ I really do not know how to be sure about this one either way.

       Pizzagate (paedo codes, spirit cooking, cannibalistic and paedophile art) seems like an ante-chamber adjoined to a great hall of
       <strong>
        actual
       </strong>
       child sexual abuse and sacrifice. But as yet, nobody has found the connecting door between the two. In other words, we are lacking hard evidence that will turn this investigation into a real criminal investigation. Until a door is found, we have to entertain the possibility that there is no door (or that there is, but that door is to be found somewhere else because pizzagate was constructed as a decoy).

       Thanks for your comment, I think you might be exactly right. it's nice to hear somebody else say it so succinctly. Seems clear to me something to do with rampant child molestation &amp; worse is happening among the "powerful/wealthy/insider/whatever" people. Biden is obviously a real molester imo, and surrounded by a lot of suspicious family death. And where there is smoke there is no doubt some kind of greater fire.
      </p>

       But this collection of evidence for pizza gate seems so Packaged -- so much like a typical CIA/whoever does this stuff misdirect.

       We shouldn't have to be the investigators!!!  Why are we the ONLY investigators?  Where is the FBI on this matter?  Not one word from them or the MSM.  The longer they ignore this issue the deeper civilians will go for the truth.  If they didn't want people investigating this "fake news" story then why dont they investigate it?  That would surely stop crazy shooters from going there- or is that why they are waiting, so that they can play media judge and jury so that no real trial is ever needed?  Awe, nothing to see here folks just another crazy pissagate looney toon...

       I tried to show you but the style of photo I sent you wasn't up to your standards.  I already told you I don't have an imagur or any photo apps, and his IG  account is private now so the only way I can send you pics is google images.  Im not spending my time making a full report for you, it's too long and too much work, especially since I think you'll have no appreciation for it- so no I'm not wasting my time sending you research that would take you far less time to investigate yourself.  You have no desire to, therefore I have no desire to do the work for you.

       I cannot open your eyes if you wish they remain closed.  If you want to take your children to his restaurant fine, do it, no one is stopping you.  If he didn't want people to have this opinion of him he should have chose more politically correct content on his public profiles, especially since he owns a business that children frequent and is even marketed towards children.  It seems to me maybe he wanted this all to happen to him, that's how blatant it is.  It's his own fault for so flamboyantly and publicly posting inappropriate content for all to see.  His jokes, pictures, slang of children are inappropriate, maybe not to you but to parents, it is offensive and very inappropriate.

       you mean when you send the two photos everyone is talking about and hwich are totally meaningless then tried to make it look like there was more by linking bad google searches which didn't even have meaningful results? you can't even describe an image other than the baby with euros and the girl with hands taped - neither of which are in the least bit shocking or untoward. there are no bad photos, no bad comments, no evidence what so ever - that's why you can';t point to it.

       I feel like you don't have much knowledge of psychology especially that of a pedophile.  He shows all the signs of being a pedo.  His mind is very much geared toward children, his humor, his pics, his business, etc.  It seems as though most of his thoughts are of children and as if his life revolves around them.  It's typical textbook pedo.  He has no kids of his own but has a keen interest in children and surrounds himself with them.  Most of his pics do not need "decoding" to notice this, just a basic knowledge of psychology and how pedophiles operate, his public posts go further to include inappropriate jokes some even being blatantly sexual and almost every pic has a child in it.  I never said he is guilty just that he should be looked into.

       so your entire evidence is that he's a nice guy who runs a family orientated business therefore he has to be a pedo?
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly i don't know what world you live in but if that was the criteria needed to get someone arrested then half the country would be in prison!
      </p>
      <p>
       so what do you want to see happen here, what would please you? how detailed to the police need to be? should they take him in for questioning&gt; should they search his premises?
      </p>
      <p>
       aren't you one of those people who quite likes the constitution? you don't want to see it scrapped do you? don't you think the fourth amendment is as important as the first and second?

       I never said arrested, you have a hard time absorbing information.  I have stated the reasons, logical ones, for why he should be INVESTIGATED.  He displays known characteristics of pedophiles, I don't feel it's necessary to repeat them again and again- it's more than two pictures as you stated previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can undermine his behavior all you want but it doesn't change known psychological behaviors that he willingly displays on public platforms.  Of course he isn't going to post rape photos on his IG, which is what I believe you are looking for in order to think he could be a pedo.  He will merely dance around the "idea" of rape and "joke" about the selling and killing of children, which seems to be a theme on his page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if he had a sense of humor outside of children, of pics without children, or any part of his life that was absent of children, then I could believe this was a "witch" hunt.  There are just too many indicators going off with him.  Text book indicators.

       i'll  ask again, you demand he is INVESTIGATED what do you mean by this? what level of INVESTIGATED will satisfy you? what needs to happen that you'll sit down and say 'yes he was INVESTIGATED and there was nothing in it' (assuming they find nothing in it)

       I can't believe I have to break this down for you.  His online activities, his connections, his computer files, you know an FBI INVESTIGATION.  Not a "sit down" let me ask you a few questions so you can spin your PC story.  From my understandings the FBI runs the underground pedo sites and know very well who the players are they just pick and choose who they arrest.  So an investigation performed by non-compromised agents is needed.  This is my last response to you.  Hope you are fulfilled by protecting the rights of pedophiles, everyone needs someone I guess, and they have you.  Best wishes to you and yours.

       so you're saying that you won't believe any official agency or organisation? seems like there's nothing anyone can ever say to convince you even though you have absolutely nothing but a vague feeling about someone.

       the is the point, you've decided they're guilty based on nothing and nothing anyone does or says can convince you otherwise, even though you have literally no prof.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the fbi thought they had a case then they'd be all over this, so would a dozen other agencies from the local police to fucking interpol = when this became news of course they all looked into it, and of course when there was nothing there they all shook their heads and move on to dealing with actual real crimes - i mean ffs, you think the agents who brought down Epstein and etc haven't had a look at this massive news story? all the good cops in the world have seen this and none of them have said 'oh that needs following up' and why? because there's nothing at all to this and everyone that's looked into it with an open mind has come to the same conclusion, only a very small group of dedicated anti-Clinton fanatics continue to push this.

       I'm 36 years old, so it's too late to save me from the pedos.  I thank God that I never was raped by the pedos, at least not to my recollection...  But, you know how the human mind works.  But, you know, my dad wasn't an engineer at some elite firm with a super attractive child. If only I were so lucky.  To be sodomized and secure a place in the pedarasty elite. LMFAO~

       I disagree, he was not a worm because he passed the patriot test with the anti cuck box he stuck his hand in.
He also was known to speak the cuck killing phrase "Make America Great Again." Praise Donald J. Atreides and his spice memes.

       Yeah... we sent 2 places running... I'm sure they knocked off all illegal activities... and that is a good thing. But to focus on them for 3 weeks after that is overkill. I posted a very well documented case of child trafficking via a pizza front along with evidence of military involvement... it was deleted because it "was not what pizzagate is about". Then I knew they were just locked onto Comet and won't back down until they see every employee hanging from a tree... They want to see instant justice... and can't move on until they've seen it. I hope the new board  promotes more than just Comet bashing... I'll get involved again if I know my research will be accepted and extrapolated on.... until then

       We, as redditors, don't have the right to be sharing the personal information of people regardless of its availability online. It's why we can't post Facebook accounts or anything else that divulges someone's personal information. People were harassing the establishments named on and offline.

       I made the jump to voat to keep up with pizzagate, but I'm still aware of reddit's basic rules. Some people weren't and damaged the movement's credibility.

       There are rules in place... you can't engage in a bunch of horseplay by the swimming pool and not expect to get kicked out when people complain. If reddit was a bastion of unfettered free speech then it would be filled with the exact kind of stuff that was all over twitter. They are as lenient as they can be without subjecting themselves to legal action which would endanger all the subs.

       No, don't jump to conclusions about your evidence when there is clearly not enough to substantiate the outlandish claims made by "pizzagate". I would take a step back and really access what evidence they have and ask yourself whether they are making wild leaps in logic and whether they have a case.

       Taken in a restaurant, with a caption about loving chicken? Maybe the kid loves to eat chicken? Sounds way more likely to me.

       Can someone better explain the kid taped to a table thing for me?

      <p>
