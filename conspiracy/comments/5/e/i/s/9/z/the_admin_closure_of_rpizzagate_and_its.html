        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reddit admins have shut down <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, a sub with nearly 25,000* subscribers, as well as certain other subs* which were set up to address suspected child abuse references in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails">Podesta emails</a> which were published by <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a>. </p>

<p><a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> now directs you to the following message:</p>

<p><strong>This subreddit was banned due to a violation of our content policy. Specifically, the proliferation of personal and confidential information. We don’t want witchhunts on our site.</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first time a sub has been closed down for contravening reddit rules relating to doxxing, brigading, harassment and witch-hunting. Amidst the cries of censorship, keep in mind that the admins are simply applying existing sitewide rules, and it&#39;s more than likely that reddit (and its majority owner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Avance Publications*</a>) have been pressured from external sources, with threats of litigation, removal of advertising revenue, etc. </p>

<p>So, where does that leave <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;Pizzagate&quot; is a new aspect of an established conspiracy which has long been discussed, and will continue to be discussed, in this sub.</p>

<p><strong>The key issue is that we, as a group, must ensure we don&#39;t break the rules set out by the admins, or this subreddit could be next.</strong></p>

<p>The mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have always been vigilant about preventing doxxing, brigading and harassment coming from this sub, and to their credit, the admins have respected our independence and rarely interfere in the way we moderate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>This sub is many things, but it is not, and cannot under the terms of reddit, be a direct action group. </p>

<p>We can discuss, theorize and rant about whatever we like, but there must be absolutely NO brigading and NO contacting or harassing individuals within or outside reddit, even if you suspect them of criminal activity. </p>

<p>Anyone who engages in these activities poses an existential threat to this sub, so if you see any examples of this please notify the mods immediately, and we will remove the comments and report the offenders to the admins. </p>

<p>*EDITS: Factual corrections.</p>

<p>Other subs shut down by Admins because of pizzagate: r/CivilianInvestigators, r/SliceOfJustice,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are what comes to people&#39;s minds when they see a post make it to the front page under from the sub &quot;conspiracy&quot;... they figure pizzagate must be about as credible as the least credible theories they have heard.

<p>As a member, i want to feel like that side bar can take me down a dozen rabbit holes as I pursue my redpill overdose climax of HO LEE FUK.</p>

<p>Also, you know the sweet wall animation when you upvote at r/the_donald ?</p>

<p>Every time i click a like button and see that wall building, i feel like some rat in a bf skinner maze getting his fix.</p>

<p>Maybe this new reddit you&#39;re talking about can have a bunch of rats scurrying when you flip the pizza over to upvote.</p>

Harassing Alefantis isn&#39;t the only thing they&#39;ve done they&#39;re actively tracking people, trying to work out who children are and etc, etc, etc... </p>

<p>of course reddit wanted to be distance itself from it, and 8chan which is known for two things, being full of pedos and being full of fbi.  i mean honestly just read it&#39;s encyclopedia dramatica page, and they don&#39;t even get into half the old drama...

    <div class="md"><p>he really wasn&#39;t though, he posted a funny picture of some kids playing around which were totally innocuous and some people desperate to prove their hatred of authority justified decided this means he&#39;s the devil. Honestly don&#39;t you find it a little bit absurd that this whole thing was cooked up in the minds of a website famous for Pedobear, idolising the characters from various childrens tv shows (mlp, the one with the funny wig, etc), and popularising henti fetishism in the west... i mean 4chon literally started because we were kicked off SA for shitposting henti in the forums!  </p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s not all bad, many times they&#39;ve been on the right side of things such as the habbo raids and etc but also it&#39;s an excitable muddle of confused and over-excited lunatics... many people who enjoy nothing more than causing chaos and suffering for their own amusement - i mean &#39;the internet hate machine&#39; isn&#39;t a title you get lightly... </p>

<p>i mean let&#39;s not get too deep into it but the whole &#39;secret code&#39; they&#39;re pretending to have discovered being used by the Clinton&#39;s was invented on he chan sites to get around filters moot put in place to deal with the pedos - that&#39;s where 8chan came from pretty much, people pissed off at being banned for breaking the almost zero rules wanted somewhere with actually zero rules which is why 8chan is famous for having actual pedo boards but then closed most of them and everyone split off into 8ch which split off into.... 8chan is like 4chans voat, literally the worst of the worst.  </p>

<p>what i&#39;m trying to say is the people complaining at someone for having a &#39;shocking&#39; picture of a baby holding a big stack of money like it&#39;s some form of gangster come from a site that&#39;s so vile even i can&#39;t bare to go there and i grew up on the chans! i had goatse.jpg as my laptop wallpaper ffs and that place make me feel queezy. they see darkness everywhere because they&#39;re looking for darkness, post those pictures on mumsnet with a similar joke he made and everyone will laugh like it&#39;s the cutest thing in the world, because it is, because that&#39;s what normal people do they play carefree games and get upto hijinks without once even thinking about digging a subterranean torture room to murder children and feast on their corpses in twisted satanic rituals, why? BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE NOT DERANGED BASEMENT DWELLING NECKBEAR SOCIOPATHS.  </p>

<p>Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.

    <div class="md"><p>I think what is strange is his connection to Brock &amp; in many ways how Brock &amp; Podesta&#39;s private life is very drawn to an art scene that is dark. 
My sister is an artist in the provocateur scene that meshes art &amp; fashion, &amp; gay club scene with lots of elite money / overseas money from very sketchy people. 
Lets be truthful in this conversation. There&#39;s a lot of creepy sex and drugs that occurs within those circles when they merge.<br/>
I know this because my sister hates my dad and discussed it in detail at the last Thanksgiving dinner my grandma will live to see. 
Is there pedophilia? 
Probably.  If you look at kids in the foster system in major cities that go to group homes instead of permanent ones , some will find refuge in this scene.  My sister is 24. She&#39;s had roommates that weren&#39;t old enough to get a driver&#39;s license. They were runaways looking to model - but most of their work comes from escorting with foreigners visiting NYC. 
Does everyone do it? NO. 
Does everyone realize it&#39;s an Elephant in the Room at Fashion Week? YES. </p>

<p>Without question we turn our back on these kids ( liberals and democrats).  And maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s complex.  Kids are having sex in our society at a much younger age. </p>

<p>If you think human trafficking doesn&#39;t exist in America talk to a person who works in social work.  Or a cop in a bad part of a major city. Hell the right inner city high school counselor could share a story or two with you. </p>

<p>The problem is that , like drugs that minorities aren&#39;t selling, it&#39;s a foggy world that we don&#39;t really want to look into.  But it happens. And it happens around money &amp; power. 
This isn&#39;t new. It&#39;s always been this way. 
The only thing that has really changed is that a certain part of society is afraid of what happens when the Pandora Box is opened and the troubled child who played victim isn&#39;t that innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you i presume are american thus also a paedophile? how can you deny it just look at the evidence from boys town!  </p>

<p>Yes there is a serious problem in America with paedophilia, rape, violence and all sorts of things however the existence of these real issues isn&#39;t enough to hang a person just for being American, or for liking art...  </p>

<p>art is often shocking, look at Egon Schiele or Balthus even Hieronymus Bosch - just liking art doesn&#39;t make you a pedo, you criticise these people for liking high art with a significant message because it doesn&#39;t fit some oddly Victorian moral set but you have no problem with <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.24694638.0052/flat,800x800,070,f.u1.jpg">this</a> for example and the fact all these allegations come from the same website that <a href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/140/462/cake-pedobear.jpg">invented this</a> doesn&#39;t seem to bother you? I mean if Podesa was sharing stuff like <a href="http://img15.deviantart.net/f9dd/i/2011/173/a/6/pedobear_montage_2_by_zelda1fiction1child-d3jnknb.jpg">this</a> then sure you&#39;d have to think maybe he&#39;s a bit odd, but no that&#39;s perfectly acceptable to anon... it&#39;s &#39;just a joke&#39; but somehow things that are just innocent jokes without even a tacit let alone overt theme of pederasty make podesta the worst person in the world?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re part of some pedo conspiracy, they may well be, however vague assumptions based on your dislike of successful people just isn&#39;t proof. Not everyone that likes are is a pedo, not everyone that decides to work as part of the government to try and make the country better is a sinister monster hellbent on destroying the world (that&#39;s mostly just the republicans, mostly) </p>

<p>If you really believe these things then change the system, don&#39;t waste your time in a pointless witch-hunt with no evidence especially not one directed at a random pizza shop - i mean honestly, doesn&#39;t this feel like massive distraction from the important things that are actually happening in the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your 1st sentence makes zero sense. </p>

<p>If you read my other posts, I have issues with Pizzagate in general. People are taking a lot of swings and batting below .300. 
Wikileaks (in many ways) was always solid at dropping files in batches to let the story develop slowly.  </p>

<p>Maybe - as an American - my problem is that child trafficking exists. As a minority I&#39;m aware of this because many come from Asia (my people), Eastern Russia,  &amp; Latin America. </p>

<p>The media doesn&#39;t cover it. And when they do they cover it as if it&#39;s a problem of the lower class that never leave that bubble.  It&#39;s alluded that they find work as sex workers in poor neighborhoods in big cities making money off of poor blue collar workers &amp; gang members.  But this isn&#39;t true at all.  Like high end drugs , you don&#39;t go through hell and consequences unless a payday is coming. </p>

<p>I am liberal because the ethics and morals relate to the world I want to live in. But I feel like there&#39;s child gloves for many of the people who hire child prostitutes. Or complete denial. Or fear that certain people being exposed as pedophiles would ruin social justice campaigns that they live &amp; die by the sword on.  </p>

<p>I think people in both Politics &amp; Hollywood cover it up because they know that their careers could be ruined if the story ever blew up.  </p>

<p>I believe that PizzaGate is unorganized.  But I do believe that why they are going after certain groups of people is an elephant in the room scenario - the same way that the Catholic Church &amp; Penn State University covered up something that would ruin their reputation, legacy, &amp; power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but ALL of this is &#39;i heard some terrible things happen in general therefore this exact thing is true...&#39; that doesn&#39;t make sense, you can&#39;t just say that because there are same bad people that everyone or a specific person is bad.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting note on what you talk about from one of the most prominent campaigneres against human trafficking, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elementary students across America are taught that slavery ended in the 19th Century. But, sadly, nearly 150 years later, the fight to end this global scourge is far from over. Today it takes a different form and we call it by a different name -- “human trafficking” -- but it is still an affront to basic human dignity in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>The estimates vary widely, but it is likely that somewhere between 12 million and 27 million human beings are suffering in bondage around the world. Men, women and children are trapped in prostitution or labor in fields and factories under brutal bosses who threaten them with violence or jail if they try to escape. Earlier this year, six ”recruiters” were indicted in Hawaii in the largest human trafficking case ever charged in U.S. history. They coerced 400 Thai workers into farm labor by confiscating their passports and threatening to have them deported.</p>

<p>I have seen firsthand the suffering that human trafficking causes. Not only does it result in injury and abuse—it also takes away its victims’ power to control their own destinies. In Thailand I have met teenage girls who had been prostituted as young children and were dying of AIDS. In Eastern Europe I have met mothers who lost sons and daughters to trafficking and had nowhere to turn for help. This is a violation of our fundamental belief that all people everywhere deserve to live free, work with dignity, and pursue their dreams.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to even imagine but this is still a major problem in the world, a friend of mine who grew up in Thailand was married to a Thai businessman when she was 14, he was in his fifties! He brought her over here (the uk) when she was 17, had barely had any education and wasn&#39;t allowed any friends or contact with anyone until she got pregnant and the social services talk to her and basically just said &#39;no don&#39;t be silly, you don&#39;t have to go back there if you don&#39;t want to...&#39; That was twenty years ago now and she&#39;s a campaigner against no-love marriages and human trafficking which she could so easily have been a part of instead.  It terrible but the reality of the world is complex, to go back to what i pasted before it presents some important things that people should be doing,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Citizens can help too, by advocating for laws that ban all forms of exploitation and give victims the support they need to recover. They can also volunteer at a local shelter and encourage companies to root out forced labor throughout their supply chains by visiting <a href="http://www.chainstorereaction.com">www.chainstorereaction.com</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>but to really have a serious effect this is going to have to be political,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to redouble our efforts to fight modern slavery. I hope that the countries that have not yet acceded to the U.N. Trafficking Protocol will do so. Many other countries can still do more to strengthen their anti-trafficking laws. And all governments can devote more resources to finding victims and punishing human traffickers.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>however one of the chief campaigners against sex trafficking and the author that open letter isn&#39;t going to be the next President, partly no doubt because of smears concocted by the right-wing especially people like Jerome Corsi that manufacture easy to believe pap to be pushed out through the blogs and side-channels so they can pick it up on their bigger blogs and say they&#39;re &#39;just reporting what people are saying&#39; then their media outlets &#39;just report that people are saying it...&#39; and they know exactly what they&#39;re doing because they hire the best psychology graduates and train them through secret NSA projects where they do all sorts of psychological experiments to work out the best ways of manipulating society to their own ends...  </p>

<p>You&#39;re fighting against people that are working towards global co-operation in the fight against corruption and sleaze, people that are introducing and fighting for legislation to end human trafficking on national and international levels - people that are genuinely fighting these things and who have genuinely made a difference.  </p>

<p>didn&#39;t it cross your mind that maybe this whole nonsense has been cooked up by the vast criminal conspiracy of greed that rules the world and thrives of suffering exactly because they want to defeat the people who were making their life difficult... I mean haven&#39;t you gotten it yet, the Republicans always talk about smaller government because they want to get rid of oversight, they want to get rid of all the protections that stop them being able to do whatever they like - effective government is what stops rich people being able to built child brothels and pay off the local police (as happens in countries without effective governments or the political will to challenge thees things)  </p>

<p>If you want to fight corruption then fight corruption, this is a complex process which involves increasing the checks and balances and opening the government so it&#39;s more transparent and accountable - simply running wherever Corsi points and attacking blindly really isn&#39;t helpful, you&#39;re just becoming a puppet of the establishment and protecting those who are the real culprits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we both know is that CTR is involved in this (Brock - who is associated in a homosexual polygamist relationship with the owner of Comet Pizza - note they may be no longer together although reports are conflicting). And when CTR&#39;s candidate is under fire PR judo takes place in the form of shills.  Now the general of CTR is under fire - which could lead to the reveal of what he paid 850k to have silenced.  So do you think that we won&#39;t see shills in or around this movement? </p>

<p>Chart both of these if you wish : 
What&#39;s the worst case scenario in this situation if PizzaGate continues its movement?<br/>
What&#39;s the worst case scenario if it is stopped into silence?</p>

<p>If PizzaGate continues and fails to find anything substantial, there&#39;s blood on the internets hands. But lets be truthful, we live in an ecosystem where this will always occur. In fact it often happens in a conscious manner from the MSM.   People will incorrectly doxxx a school shooter, people will demonize a professional athlete who didn&#39;t rape someone, etc.  </p>

<p>If PizzaGate is true , then CTR has to work harder than normal to irradiate the situation. They give scumbags second chances - because our society gives people those if they&#39;re required to.  See Anthony Weiner who was at the DNC partying with Bill &amp; Hill seconds before they both went on stage.  When it came out that he was a pedophile (again) - their job was to separate Weiner from the Clintons. </p>

<p>If people give up ( which both of us are wasting time to believe that that will happen ) then Children who come out will be seen as &#39;typical craizes&#39; like the children in Boys Town. </p>

<p>You claim to ask for an effective government. But just because a government is big doesn&#39;t mean that it is in any way ethical. 
Have you tried doing business in China?  Its near impossible to do it the legal way. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re smart &amp; liberal ask yourself this when watching the media + government speak. When are they deontological? When are they consequentialist?   My father left his country when he realized that the country used its power to pendulum back and forth between both. It helped him realize the people were not playing the same game that the people in power were playing. Even social &amp; cultural laws were meant to make impacts that would benefit the most powerful economically.</p>

<p>gay guys who sometimes screw but aren&#39;t too serious? OMG! THE WORLD HAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH SIN!!!!  honestly is the the twenty first century of the seventh?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when CTR&#39;s candidate is under fire PR judo takes place in the form of shills.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i mean i know this is a tough concept but don&#39;t you think the really, really rich people who are known to have used all sorts of corrupt and evil methods to resist regulation of their industries not only fund billions of lobbyists, media empires and etc but also have shills of their own?!  </p>

<p>just because shills exist doesn&#39;t mean you should believe anything on the internet that claims to be &#39;against the shills&#39; of could they say that people arguing against them are shills, that&#39;s number one tactic of shills! it even says so in their leaked documents.  This whole pizzagate thing could be an attack on the conspiracy movement and those fighting for a better world, using them to spread disinfo and destroy the groups and interests they want to protect.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the worst case scenario in this situation if PizzaGate continues its movement?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>they continue to waste time, make the community look stupid, possible they get carried away and cause real problems for innocent people and this gets picked up by the press who use it to justify sweeping new measures against &#39;false news&#39; which effectively silences any dissenting opinion and makes it possible for them to get away with a whole new level of terrible injustice against us....  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the worst case scenario if it is stopped into silence?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>people give up on the false lead, learn something from their mistakes and move on to seek out real forms of proof and actual methods of stopping the many injustices in this world.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If people give up ( which both of us are wasting time to believe that that will happen ) then Children who come out will be seen as &#39;typical craizes&#39; like the children in Boys Town.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>no one is saying that terrible things never happen, no one is saying not to fight injustice when it&#39;s really there - if anything i&#39;m saying stop wasting your time with pizza restaurants and attacking the democratic party (who have actually been working to introduce effective legislation to make trafficking impossible, to make sure people are heard when they speak out and etc) stop muddying the water with nonsense that makes no senses and instead try bring the actual facts to light - finding actual solutions to very real problems.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You claim to ask for an effective government. But just because a government is big doesn&#39;t mean that it is in any way ethical.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>obviously, nor does it mean it isn&#39;t ethical - i mean what are you really saying here? you&#39;re saying that you want to live in a mad max society where money buys power and nothing else matters? there are countries like that, why not move to a corrupt bit of Africa? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you tried doing business in China? Its near impossible to do it the legal way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes frequently and no it&#39;s not at all, they&#39;re a brilliant efficient nation full of wonderful people who are proud of their governments achievements in lifting so many people from poverty and providing such good educations and opportunities to people... sure there are problems in china, everywhere has problems but they&#39;re an amazingly successful nation which has done amazing things for it&#39;s people, i mean honestly have you seen the water management projects! it&#39;s magnificent, awe inspiring! and the numbers are amazing, the amount of people lifted from poverty and educated to a modern level is simply staggering, i mean compare it to Europe or America and it&#39;s impressive, compare it to the rest of Asia it&#39;s frankly dizzying. </p>

<p>learn a bit of Chinese and explore their culture a bit, it really is quite different to how the red scare &#39;america is the only way&#39; nonsense portrays it, our two cultures still have lots to learn from each other.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even social &amp; cultural laws were meant to make impacts that would benefit the most powerful economically.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes, that is how it works - powerful people make laws to benefit themselves,  i mean i&#39;m from England we have a queen for fuck sake, it couldn&#39;t be more obivious how the system works - this is the old system which we&#39;re trying to change by developing new system which enable the people to stand together and resist the power of the wealthy - however the rich don&#39;t like this, they fight against it - that&#39;s basically what the republican party is or the british tory party, they exist to try and return us to the feudal yoke which is why they&#39;re so vehemently opposed to anything that makes the working people more able to defend themselves, like good government, strong laws, etc, etc, etc.... </p>

<p>yes there is corruption all through politics, nothing is ever easy and often both sides are brought and paid for but does that mean we should just give up and attack everyone that&#39;s trying to put through decent legislation simply because some crazy on the internet pointed a bony finger and yelled pedo?!  </p>

<p>If you want to protect against shills demand good, strong proof of everything and give good strong proof of everything - it really is that easy </p>

<p>this isn&#39;t some petty game where there&#39;s a handful of satan worshippers messing up the world, it&#39;s hugely complex situation involving deeply entrenched power structures that wield huge amounts of power yet they&#39;re also week, they need people to believe in them and to follow them - that&#39;s why they have to do secret tricks to try and discredit wikileaks it&#39;s because they&#39;re weak, they&#39;re scared and they know the world is changing.  </p>

<p>we can win but we&#39;re not going to make a better world by running around after absurd things talking nonsense about everyone that likes pizza is a pedo. we need to be working on making systems that hold governments to account, that hold the systems we use to account and to make sure that we the people have more power than the government. we need software tools and community tools, we need to work together and build a positive new world in which corruption isn&#39;t possible and if someone tries to manipulate the will of the people then everyone knows about it instantly. </p>

<p>yes i&#39;ve seen all the evidence, debated the evidence with fanatics and always every bit of evidence has been accepted to be obviously false when we actually look at it, i mean honestly are you saying that everyone who likes art is a pedo or that you&#39;ve never seen art before? these are big name artists here, this isn&#39;t like some 4chan nerd with a hdd full of henti it&#39;s the sort of thing that gets reviewed in magazines and wins prizes - posting art on your socialmedia feed doesn&#39;t make you evil.</p>

<p>you&#39;re collecting a load of spurious nonsense and playing a game holding up one piece as a vital clue and then as soon as that&#39;s called into serious question you point to the massive mountain of shit and say &#39;but all that!&#39; and people say &#39;pick the best bit of evidence then...&#39; and you come back with some nonsense about underground tunnels and that&#39;s proven to be nonsense so you say &#39;but look at the mountain of bullshit, it&#39;s so big something has to be true...&#39; and so people say &#39;well get the best bit of evidence then...&#39; and we go through the whole thing forever because you never actually remove stuff that&#39;s discredited you sneak it back into the pile again when no ones looking...</p>

<p>I have searched for evidence myself, this is why you&#39;ll notice you&#39;ve not shown me anything i haven&#39;t seen before - like remember when you claimed they were digging a tunnel and i said &#39;not a picture of people doing routine maintenance on a small business.&#39; but it turned out that yes you were talking about that picture of a small, completely normal hole... etc, etc.. I think you need to stop and actually consider the evidence, think about each piece and if it actually proves or suggests anything or if it&#39;s just an over stretched fantasy... there is no evidence, that&#39;s why when i ask for a piece of evidence the best you can do it pictures from art gallerias or of routine building maintenance - there is no evidence because this whole thing has been imagined, probably by a group of people employed to spread disinformation... </p>

<p>Ah but that is exactly what you were doing, you were trying to convince me until i knew more about it than you then you backed off and now are saying you&#39;re above the argument - no, you just lost...  </p>

<p>also don&#39;t have an imgur account and didn&#39;t feel I need to package the links perfectly for you, I did it on the fly.  </p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t change the fact that two pictures of small holes that appear to be for building maintenance is not evidence of anything except building maintenance, certainly not an international conspiracy of pedos involved in the kidnapping of maddy... i mean really, this is absolutely baseless madness.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The links are out there for people with an open mind on this subject to look through.   </p>

<p>i have a very open mind, what you actually mean is you only want people who agree with you to talk about it because then it&#39;ll seem like you&#39;re right?  that is not a good way to do anything... certainly not look for a concealed truth in.  If you really believe in pizzagate then your most important task should be collecting the best evidence, putting it into a well sourced document and using that to convince people of the veracity of your claims --do you really think just wailing &#39;but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s true, you have to believe me or it&#39;s not fairrrrr!!!!&#39; is going to get you anywhere?!  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s only your responsibility to search the facts, stop getting hostile with others because you&#39;re lost on this matter.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m not getting hostile, i&#39;m debating the facts of the issue you&#39;re trying to have me and others believe - what possible reason would i have to want to let you post your spurious nonsense without countering it? Provide facts, provide good arguments, provide sensible inferences and people such as myself might listen to you, but run around screaming about the &#39;evidence&#39; without being able to point to a single thing is just stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This case hasn&#39;t been properly investigated by officials, therefore the irrefutable proof you are requesting does not exist at this point in time.  The only investigation the government has done is to direct the MSM to label it &quot;fake news&quot; thus allowing the media to play judge and jury of media court, in order to disarm the public conscious and reassure the people that all &quot;pissagate&quot; info is for crazies by crazies.  Meanwhile they completely omit the several past cases where it has been proven true, covered up and spun into a nice PC media package ready for mainstream consumption.  The MSM is biased, they have proved that time and time again.  They have covered for pedophiles before and they are willing to do it again.  Shit, they HIRE pedophiles, most of the movie producers/directors are pedophiles that are still allowed to work with kids.<br/>
We want an official investigation that&#39;s why we have brought this to attention, not so that crazies will go shoot the place up- which btw seems like another plot to make this scandal look fake and radical.  So the proof you&#39;re so desperately looking for, unfortunately isn&#39;t available, just a long trail of breadcrumbs.<br/>

<p>absolute, this is why some right-wing think tank invented and pushed it - it was a handy pre-election gambit to sway all those undecided conspiracy theorists then after the election when it doesn&#39;t matter they can turn on it along with everyone else and say &#39;see, fake news is bad we should remove it all, every last bit of it....&#39;  this means that all the genuine stuff get&#39;s lost too. </p>

<p>by jumping on board any old rubbish without demanding proof you&#39;re creating the excuse they need to shut down the more discerning people who seek the truth.  </p>

<p>this too is their game, they want sensible people to stay away so they can manipulate you without anyone pointing it out  - i know this and so will not stop saying the truth when i see it no matter how much you beg or threaten -- speaking the truth is important and i won&#39;t stop, not for you or for anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here buddy.</p>

<p>If it were an alt-right theory than the alt-right would back it, they don&#39;t nor do any MSM outlets.  There IS a very large under ground pedophile network, whether or not Comet Ping Pong is a part of it is only speculation right now.  It could be a decoy, but then why isn&#39;t the MSM covering it?  Why did Comet Ping Pong paint over the pedo art on the walls, if it was as innocent as he claims?  Why does he joke about kill rooms?  Why are babies and money referenced in multiple pics?  Why does he use sexual references of pics with kids in them?  There are so many questions, and the answers involve more than just taking a peak around his restaurant.  </p>

<p>The pedi network has been exposed many times, as the links provided above in my previous posts show, it&#39;s just a question of how big it is and who all is involved.  Many of these documented pedophiles have not been criminalized and are allowed to maintain their positions with no repercussion to their place of employment, society, or social status.  Which also means they&#39;re still allowed to work with children.   So if you can show me some real proof that this guy is as innocent as you believe, I would love to see it.</p>

<p>... which made clear that pizzagaters were harassing the people they believed to be involved. And <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was complicit in this -- there were threads there that <em>did</em> host private information of the people in question and the mods <em>did</em> refuse to remove said information even after the admins asked them multiple times.</p>

<p>Seems cut and dry to me. The <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> mods repeatedly neglected to address doxing in their sub, so the sub got banned. That&#39;s consistent with established Reddit policy. The only thing that the NYT article did was hold Reddit&#39;s feet to the fire and force them to finally pull the trigger on the rule that they <em>already had in place and were already in communication with the mods about</em>. Seems to me like the admins handled this very fairly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as a former mod of the aforementioned sub, there will be no proof provided because its absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>We absolutely did have a lot of PII getting posted but we were always diligent to remove it. Unfortunately, there were also a few people that were given mod authority that behaved inappropriately and could lead some to believe the entire team was complicit. These same mods were removed quickly once we noticed what was going on.</p>

<p>Finally, the allegation that we refused to remove PII is a flat out lie by <a href="/u/OgreMagoo">/u/OgreMagoo</a> that he has no basis for. We did have some strong disagreements with the reddit admins we were in contact with, in regards to what actually violates the anti-doxxing rule. We as a team felt the rule was both too ambiguous and heavy handedly applied. However, we also were very respectful and fully willing to adhere to their given instruction.</p>

<p>Just for clarity sake, they felt that the doxxing rule was being violated, not only when private information was publicly released, say from someones private facebook information, but also centrally collecting public information that is not originally associated. If the collective information had been in a central source from a news organization, it would have been fine, but since we were acting as journalists in this regard, it was disallowed.</p>

<p>Please define this in a way that suggests there was wrongdoing that occurred. All businesses have publicly listed information. Other websites collect this information. News organizations collect this information. The only difference I see in this is it was done publicly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>people still harassed those innocent people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the mods always urged people to avoid any contact with any of the mentioned people. There were a few times people decided to go to some of the mentioned locations but I never saw anything to suggest they were truly a disturbance in these situations. Others decided to post inappropriate remarks on the facebook and instagram pages of some of these people. Absolutely not cool and we most assuredly removed those threads and banned a lot of people for performing these sort of actions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>didnt have an ounce of journalistic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sub had been opened for just over 2 weeks. We had a lot of plans we were in the process of fleshing out with tools to help people collaborate and organize. We grew at several thousand organic subscribers a day, sometimes 4,000+/d, far more than any other non-default sub, probably ever (with exception to exoduses). We just didn&#39;t have enough time to get things organized before people started shitposting like crazy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not a single drop of evidence has been found or posted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly you haven&#39;t been following thing then. An investigation into anything always begins with a speculated circumstance. The fact that you ignore this tells me you never had an interest in the topic, and likely are only here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to call people stupid or crazy.</p>

<p>Do you understand how moderation works? People post things WITHOUT any checks. Then other people report it for breaking rules, THEN moderation kicks in and checks it...deleting it if rules are broken.  If a million people want to post personal info then a Mod team of 1/2 a dozen are going to struggle to keep up.</p>

<p>&quot;that subreddit didnt have an ounce of journalistic integrity&quot;  You obviously don&#39;t understand what a subreddit is cause it sure as hell is not intended to have ANY journalistic integrity.</p>

<p>&quot;that subreddit was a cesspool of retardation&quot;   Hahaha...welcome to Reddit! Now you&#39;re starting to understand...</p>

<p>The admin&#39;s word is good enough for me so long as there isn&#39;t any proof that they&#39;re lying. If the <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> mods release modmails showing that they were responding appropriately to the admins&#39; requests and had made a good faith effort to crack down on doxxing, then I&#39;ll change my mind. Or something to that effect, something demonstrating that they were actually treated unfairly. I&#39;d be upset with the admins about that.</p>

<p>Basically I trust the admins unless there&#39;s proof to the contrary. Burden of proof is on the mods to show that they got shafted.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll note that I do generally sympathize with these sorts of efforts, and that I would prefer that the admins provide more in-depth explanations for why they ban certain subreddits, especially those of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>&#39;s size. More transparency is always better.</p>

<p>E: good to know that this community is still a fan of downvoting what they disagree with even if it&#39;s a well-reasoned comment.</p>

<p>If the executives mentioned above want to close us down, then they&#39;ll find an excuse to do it. They&#39;ll plant some phony rabble-rousing users if they have to, doing the online equivalent of what happens to numerous legitimate in-person protests.</p>

<p>Ideas and discourse are considered a dangerous threat to these people. We--all of us here--threaten to upend their status as keepers of knowledge which has, for centuries, been the source of power. </p>

<p>I try shying away from predictions, but I&#39;m beginning to believe it&#39;s only a matter of time before <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> gets shut down. Maybe they&#39;re smart enough not to bring down an outright ban, but maybe it&#39;ll be through more pernicious avenues: JTRIG, forum spies, modifying our frickin comments without us knowing, shadowbans, etc. </p>

Yes they were censored... just like I would be censored if I called you names or posted all in caps... because that is against the rules.

On top of that the mods even suggested that people make a throw away account to investigate on pizzagate.</p>

<p>So then you have no basis for who is a shill and who&#39;s just trying to protect themselves. Lol. Stupid, if you ask me.</p>

<p>4chan is where it started and 4chan is where it should have stayed. No sub reddit is going to do the job of law enforcement and that&#39;s where pizzagate is and has been for the last month: awaiting a proper legal investigation. I kinda wish the admins would have banned it from jump street because at least then the perps wouldn&#39;t have so much time to peruse the freely available &quot;evidence&quot; against them. </p>

<p>I think it was like less than a week after the sub went up that Besta changed their logo. Hell, if that&#39;s not a clear cut sign that the perps are covering their tracks, idk what is.</p>

They allow it because they just think nobody is ever gonna believe you.

Its real easy to tell which story from any online news source is lying or truth telling by whether or not it has a comment section. People get pretty mad and convincing when they are lied to. TPTB can attempt to censor this content and any other telling of truth but their efforts will be in vain.

<p>If we are talking about site rules... What happened to sub quarantines? What happened to warning strikes? The behavior of the Admins is highly variant from what the subreddit shutdown process is expected to look like.</p>

<p>It would seem that almost every sub could be shut down if held to the same standard that r/pg was. This is similar to the fact that any police officer could pull over any vehicle if they follow them for long enough, based on how complicated and subjective traffic laws are.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s a privately owned website. They can do what they want. But, they can&#39;t hold onto any semblance of credibility when they crack down on people trying to stop organized child sex slavery, who have flown too close to the sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, technically it did. But if you look at the bigger picture and the history of Reddit and how these things have been handled in the past, it is blatantly obvious that the admins jumped on the first chance they got to shut it all down.</p>

<p>If that was a sub for knitting and they broke that rule, the whole thing would not have been shut down plus shutting down any other new sub that had to do with knitting, knitting shopper tips, and anything to do with sewing overall. We have been through this enough times as a community to see the pattern and as the people running the site get smarter on how to corral the sheep, they look for legitimate reasons that most people would not think to question or look beneath the surface of, and then hold a virtual pillow over the faces of anyone who disagrees till they stop breathing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;We the Pizza&quot; ordeal had OP post CP as proof of his story. Other people saw it and confirmed. It was an all day thing.</p>

<p>Then twittergate happened and some people started linking to the relevant twitter accounts. Other people had to warn users not to dig through the accounts because they contained CP.</p>

<p>&quot;Baseless allegations&quot; lol. I&#39;ve been following and supporting pizzagate since the 9th. I was there when everything went down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a mod in pizzagate. Yes, there was child porn posted twice. Twice both very quickly removed. But I&#39;m not showing you proof of that, because fuck that. We did keep on top of removing anything that broke the rules to avoid doxxing and witch hunts, and as we got to about 15,000ish subs the shills and trolls came fast as well so we added (well, mainly pizzathrowaway777 and ned_harrison added) a few more mods to stick around /new to keep in to of it. But oh well, they shut it down anyway.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean the end of it though. I&#39;m glad to see the exposure here. It&#39;s just the start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem is the sub did identify the pizza shop owner and he found that his business was getting brigaded on Yelp, people whose pictures were on the pizza place&#39;s website were getting their own FB and instagram pages brigaded, threats were coming at these people, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>The NYT article certainly brought a lot of attention to these things which put Reddit in the unenviable position of either letting a sub that originated this brigading, even to the point where people were going to the establishment to &quot;investigate&quot;, continue or to shut the sub down.</p>

My answer: tra cd is simple. dc art - DC ART TRANSFORMER KEY
so the key is transformer art dc. That is an art gallery/ incubator in DC that alefantis and podesta formed or sit on the board of. Can&#39;t tell which it is. If you check 4 ch@n, they&#39;re already following this lead. 
Yellow Brick Road can tie into people who say wIZARD OF oZ relates to mindcontr0l stuff.

<p>First, you <em>just</em> got done saying that these subs are doing no harm, and then you turn around and say that the admins are &quot;protecting&quot; those people? You&#39;re contradicting yourself.</p>

<p>Second: &quot;Child abusers&quot;. This is the exact reason these people need to be protected. These are only theories, nothing is concrete. Acting like these people have been tried and convicted and are guilty because they used to have a pedophile logo on their pizza is insane.

    <div class="md"><p>Devil&#39;s advocate here. Getting this sub shut down over #Pizzagate could actually be a huge fucking win for all of us. Think about, this is a large sub with a lot of users and even journalists pulling/pushing stories here, if we went down fighting it could send an awesome message and put the nail in the coffin for Reddit, who&#39;s time has come and gone. Let them shut us down for nothing, it will would be the worst thing they ever did for their &quot;business model&quot;.</p>

<p><em>What are we all here for anyway?</em> This is the holy grail of conspiracies. It seems our time has come, the doorbell is ringing, what shall we do? I&#39;m not saying we need to doxx or harass anyone to achieve this, but some direct action is needed. Get the information out there, keep it out there. Plaster those infographics all over social media. Warm up the meme machines. Put the tag in your comments. This is way bigger than a makeshift subreddit or community on the internets being able to stay together. We can disband and assimilate again for important causes. It <em>should</em> be this way, because then we are untouchable. Reddit is not the only place we can go, it is one of many. There are evil people in this world, and they are scared shitless of #Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is exactly what i was thinking. R/conspiracy has over 400k subscribers, we hold a lot more power than i think most of us realize.</p>

<p>What we need is an organized effort to continue the research of r/pizzagate HERE on r/conspiracy and dare the admins to remove us. Not by witchunting or doxxing, but by the unabashed well sourced research that got ALL pizzagate related subs banned. Spez got caught today, if they attacked us next they wouldn&#39;t be able to handle to backlash. We have the power to leverage them.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s stay in r/conspiracy. If it falls we&#39;ll leave anyways.</p>

<p>I&#39;m serious the real world requires evidence that can actually pass in court and everything you internet sleuths have come up with is like David Icke telling us that Illuminati is run by reptilians.</p>

<p>No, don&#39;t jump to conclusions about your evidence when there is clearly not enough to substantiate the outlandish claims made by &quot;pizzagate&quot;. I would take a step back and really access what evidence they have and ask yourself whether they are making wild leaps in logic and whether they have a case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I was a mod of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> until about 4 days ago (got removed due to concern trolling which sparked the unfounded perception that there was somehow an issue with regards my role in providing moderator oversight on <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>); it is important to understand the background dynamics going on with <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, as that is what ultimately lead to its closure.</p>

<p>Within the first week of moderating the sub, we received 2 warnings from different admins regarding PI on the subreddit. This lead to a post that I made, wherein I made it clear that, for the subreddit to survive, the mods were going to have to work diligently to remove PI of any kind.</p>

<p>The sticky was well received for the most part, users seemed to understand that, if they wanted to discuss that kind of info, they had to go offsite, and the mod team left up my announcement for 4 or 5 days. However, I was removed from the mod team while the sticky was still up and was unable to follow through with a lot of what would have been required by the reddit admins for the sub to continue functioning (they would have wanted to see some kind of automod reports to the modmail for facebook/instagram links, and they explicitly told us that were we to remove anything that could even potentially be PI for &quot;non-public figures&quot;, run it by them, and then reapprove if it was okay on their end.)</p>

<p>My removal from the mod team is relevant only because the people who were moderating the sub were all new to reddit, had little understanding of core site functionality (not to mention the very high degree of nuance required when dealing with the admins during site-wide TOS issues), and were still learning the ropes even after I left the team.</p>

<p>It was in that context that a perfect storm of mechanisms came together to engulf the sub in a conflagration; as an inexperienced mod team, with no understanding of how reddit admins apply their tos during maor &quot;shit storms&quot;, simply let their guard down and received their inevitable third strike. With no presence of any automod rules to help deal with the large influx of doxxing following the NYT piece (You can read former reddit ceo Yishan Lee&#39;s comment on how press effects reddit operations <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/58zaho/the_accuracy_of_voat_regarding_reddit_srs_admins/d95aoft/?context=5">here</a>, wherein yishan makesit quite clear that during &quot;press events&quot;, the influx of new users tends to overwhelm a community), the mods of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> were only one slip up away from being banned. Whether that slip up came in the form of a malicious actor intentionally trying to subvert the flow of information by having the sub banned, or simply a new user unfamilair with the rules of reddit as a whole, is, for the most part irrelevant as the sub was literally on its death kneel and there was nothing anyone could have done to save her.</p>

<p>Voat.co/v/pizzagate is a valuable resource for continuing the important work of the investigation, and I think it is absolutely terrifying that, <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/563846/twitter-child-sex-porn-ring-pizzagate-gamer-leaks-thousands-of-social-media-accounts">one day after 20,000 pedo twitter accounts were shut down as a result of this investigation</a>, the sub got banned; but I think it&#39;s clear the situation is far more complex than some would make it out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What struck me as ironic is the essence of pizza gate is a witch hunt. From the occult standpoint this investigation is partly about hunting witches, in a sense. </p>

<p>But I get what they meant. 
And here is a different view. The energy of that site was getting very intense. In the barely four weeks since the investigation started I think with all of the frustration and confusion of it, things were moving too fast. Some were getting paranoid, sometimes there wasn&#39;t enough caution emphasised etc.</p>

<p>I think this is a good opportunity to not blame the admins, but I think it was the energy of the group itself that needed a break and collectively chose this way to step back, if even only for a few hours, to reflect and regroup. </p>

<p>I read somewhere else the mods of that site were even swamped with issues people were having. I commend them for their efforts.</p>

<p>Pizza gate and where it leads needs to be grounded. You can&#39;t just have all this stress, anxiety, confusion, fears and consequences coming in from every angle at once. Sometimes it takes a little time to absorb it cause we can only handle so much at a time in one place.</p>

<p>At least from an individual standpoint. This will only make us stronger and more prepared in the days and months to come. </p>

<p>So take a break for an hour, a day. Rest your soul, give it time to heal from some of the things you become aware of. It&#39;s always good to do that so you don&#39;t overwhelm yourself. When each of us are overwhelmed to a point we then become a collective that is overwhelmed, and we will shut it down on ourselves again. So let&#39;s stay grounded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t buy a gun while you are going through a state of freaking out. </p>

<p>super freaky stuff has been going on for A LONG time. </p>

<p>when you start to realize any part of it -- is really happening -- you go through this crucible of shock/disorientation/paranoia - all sorts of bad feeling. it happens to everybody as far as I can tell. BUT it will pass. maybe in weeks, maybe months/ maybe less. but you will regain your equilibrium and you will start to be able to process that there is so much weird shit happenning that all your life you never realized. It really is ok. they are not coming to take you away. I promise. just go through this feeling. recognize it;s a kind of shock/withdrawl from your previous world view, and take it as easy as you can. and no weapons. not until you feel well again. </p>

<p>you might not ever be able to fully share this with your friends. if you can - -you are lucky, but don&#39;t push them too hard or judge them too hard if they just can&#39;t relate or hear you on this -- going through these stages of realization is deeply scary and painful and some people (I think) they just know they can&#39;t. so they don&#39;t. or if they do -- they need to do it for themselves -- and not feel pushed into it etc, so you might fee llonely that you can&#39;t talk about this stuff -- but other people are out there, you may meet them - it&#39;s hardly impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your great comment it really is beneficial for a person to look at it that way!
But will also strikes me is this fact. The fact that this unfolding is going hand-in-hand with the race to the White House! I fear if this will not be addressed, we could lose our sovereignty forever! Governments around the world are pushing his fees rhetoric of controlling the Internet!
I hope we all see the gravity of the situation and start realizing that we need to be woken right now. And it&#39;s not a matter of love hate relationship and it is a matter that runs way deeper than that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t wnt to suggest that what your saying isn&#39;t true, when in fact I do agree with you that it is true, free speech is super important, incredibly important. </p>

<p>however -- I am getting the feeling you are just starting to wake up to some of what is going on. and more waking up will help you get more perspective on the greater picture -- of what has been going on for at least a few hundred years, (very hard to know how long really). But I&#39; also not sure precisely which issue you are referring to being woken up to? is it the issue of repressing free speech on the internet? </p>

<p>as for the country&#39;s sovereignty, ugh. I&#39;ve got some dreary news for you that you may or may not be ready to hear rt now -- but our country has never been what the history books tell us it is, our sovereignty is a lot like santa clause, we believe in it, that&#39;s all. Who really controls us -- I don&#39;t know. there are plenty of theories on that. but our government at the top is playacting on all sides. and always has been, I promise you. we are not loosing anything we have, you are just realizing we don&#39;t have it. That&#39;s not to say we can&#39;t fight and get it. I think we can... but just to say -- there are a lot more layers here to figure out  A LOT. </p>

<p>you are right to  be fired up about what is happening rt now -- but with an understanding of all that is happening - yo might even prioritize what you are fired up about with broader scope.  </p>

<p>also about pizza gate specifically , I can not tell if it is real or a planted pile of evidence meant to freak out people just like you and me,  I looked at a lot of the evidence - and if it&#39;s all authentic well then it looks super like the accusations are completely factual. However, the CIA does PLANT stories like this - for the purpose of putting people off the track of what is really going on -- and completely filling their imaginations with awful things. so even if the story is a plant -- that&#39;s still horrible. I really can&#39;t tell what it is either way, but -- it&#39;s good to know that the CIA loves to plant fake stories to mess with people who are researching off the path MSM provides for the public. Unfortunately I can&#39;t yet think of a way to be sure about this one either way. but the fact that reddit banned it -- actually makes me wonder if it&#39;s fake -- like a planned tennis match to catch us up in and further fuel our obsession with needing to know, it&#39;s not above them to do that. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what brought down the hammer on this sub and the Italian sub, as well as mainstream media attacking the Pizza all of a sudden and the big push on the Fake News narrative. Monica Petersen is the key to all this. Hillary Clinton also gave that press conference without make-up last Wednesday hours after the Monica story broke. It&#39;s all fucking connected.
It was all fun and games until am American girl investigating the Clintons in Haiti hit the jackpot and paid with her life. When that was exposed - OPERATION PIZZA CLEANSE was initiated on all fronts - Reddit, Twitter, FB, NYTIMES, you name it.

I&#39;m not someone who just glanced at the &quot;evidence&quot; and then dismissed it immediately. I have taken it very seriously from the start because of the people involved, and have gone over all of the &quot;evidence&quot; multiple times. I just have a very different take on it than most of the people here seem to. I haven&#39;t seen a single thing yet that has convinced me it&#39;s real. I&#39;ve seen some tasteless jokes, bad performance art, and emails being taken out of context.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine if you feel differently about it all...there&#39;s no way <em>either</em> of us can know the truth. NONE of us can know for certain if they&#39;re innocent or guilty of anything, it&#39;s all just speculation at this point. Which is why I hate seeing <em>potentially</em> innocent people being harassed in real life.</p>

<p>It happens to me all the time, drives me crazy...I swear I&#39;ve reviewed what I posted, look at it a day (or even a few seconds later), and massive stupid typos.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather just believe I&#39;m losing it a little, that&#39;s a much more realistic explanation...I mean, it&#39;s one thing that admins let users who send PMed death threats to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users keep threatening <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, but something like purposely filling our posts with typos is just sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;all wonder why you&#39;re running around attacking pizza restaurants instead of connecting the dots between Epstein, Trump, and Clinton?</p>

<p>The stupid emanating from this pizza thing is discrediting and gives cover to actual corruption. And it&#39;s bad energy for your psyche, will be even worse when you find out you&#39;ve been had. (But maybe it&#39;ll teach a few people critical thinking? One can hope?)</p>

<p>So, yeah, it&#39;s an op, but not the way you think, they&#39;ve found a way to weaponize stupid -- try to be a little skeptical and a little inquisitive and try not to let them use you for their own aims next time. This one&#39;s even more dangerous because people have been encouraged to threaten people and businesses and download nefarious files - do you guys ever wonder about the identity of those who try to gin up this kind of thing - to get you to engage in criminal behavior in pursuit of &quot;good&quot; that they define based on outlandish non-evidence?</p>

<p>You should. You really, really should.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the evidence, and while obviously there is no smoking gun, there is definitely enough evidence for a serious investigation to be opened.</p>

<p>But, that&#39;s the problem. The government has ZERO credibility and will do nothing and we all know the government will do nothing, so all we can do is try to expose these heinous crimes to the public and let the public seek it&#39;s own form of Justice.</p>

<p>You call it mob mentalities...  Well, when the very government that is supposed to maintain the rule of law refuses to do it, then you naturally end up with vigilante justice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t participate in this sub much because I&#39;m not usually as well researched as most of the posters here. But even I don&#39;t believe that Reddit shut down <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> due to violating the rules. </p>

<p>I think that the whole &#39;witch-hunt&#39; thing is designed to be a catchall to stop legitimate discussion. While I completely understand having a &#39;let&#39;s not be a direct action site&#39; policy, I think that, for a site that supposedly promotes free speech, Reddit often seems to try to derail or suppress that very thing. IF someone is possibly engaging if child abuse, why is it a witch-hunt to investigate it? As long as people keep their investigations unbiased, why is it harmful? It&#39;s just a group of people trying to get to the truth. If that truth happens to involve specific people, then that&#39;s naturally going to focus the investigation on those people. That&#39;s kind of like the police saying &quot;well, the husband was at home when his wife was murdered and he was covered in her blood and was holding the knife while standing over the body but we need to investigate a bunch of other completely unrelated people or else it&#39;s a witch-hunt&quot;.</p>

<p>What I believe is happening is that Reddit, and many sites like it, are slowly stifling free speech and giving it no place to live. It&#39;s forcing people who are interested in finding the truth off of large sites where they are safer and onto smaller, more vulnerable sites where it&#39;s easier to suppress them. I&#39;m not saying this is Reddit&#39;s <em>desire</em> or <em>policy</em> but it is a <em>reality</em> of what is happening.</p>

<p>That concerns me.  It makes hiding things much easier for the powerful and influential. It makes shutting down your enemies much easier and more effective. It dilutes the concentration of people involved in any movement because they now have to go to 20 sites to engage instead of one. </p>

<p>Honestly, that scares me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you, but irrespective of the <strong>real</strong> reasons, the admins were gifted a &quot;legitimate pretext&quot; to close that sub down, and they used it. That is why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has to extra vigilant not to give the admins any valid cause to try the same thing here. </p>

<p>There is no problem naming actual criminals, but there are issues with naming what are merely suspected criminals, because technically these individuals are still &quot;innocent&quot; (and could sue for defamation). The problem we have with pizzagate is pinning a provable crime on any specific individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt pretty torn on the pizzagate sub. </p>

<p>I actually discovered who one of the artists was, for an obscure piece of artwork found in the pizza joint, and the significance of the discovery was that it confirmed that 1. the artwork was definitely depicting child sexual assault, and 2. that the artwork would have been specifically sought out for its content, as opposed to randomly found at an art fair or by some other means. </p>

<p>In order to prove my findings, I had to expose sources that would have allowed for people viewing the sub thread to contact the artist directly, opening up the possibility of the artist being harassed by a bunch of crazy strangers. </p>

<p>Making that matter even worse, was that the artist was a victim of CSA with severe trauma problems, and her artwork was a simplistic-style (not detailed and graphic) representation of the psychological effects of CSA trauma, so it was part of her therapy and also used to raise awareness of how damaging CSA is to children. Someone was exploiting her artwork, she was a victim of pedophiles, and so she wasn&#39;t automatically some culprit and certainly didn&#39;t deserve to have anyone harassing her or accusing her of horrible things. </p>

<p>When I shared the information with the sub, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was making the right decision or not, as in ethically right vs ethically wrong. If it could help build a case that could eventually expose criminals, which could lead to saving hundreds to thousands of children, then the risk would seem worth it. </p>

<p>But then most of the people who responded to the information were just making disparaging remarks about the artist. They didn&#39;t seem to value the information as something sensitive that was important to helping build evidence of reasonable suspicion of the pizza joint and those associated with it. They didn&#39;t seem perceptive or mature enough to distinguish between a victim expressing herself, and actual pedophile culprits. And it also struck me as almost alarming that nobody had been able to figure out over a matter of weeks how to do a 15 second image search on Google to find the artist but instead people had been asking if anyone knew anything, yet despite not being able to figure out something as simple as an image search, many people of the 4chan variety were speculating that maybe some FBI agent wanted them to do the FBI&#39;s job. </p>

<p>I mean it just all turned so pathetic and severely cringe-worthy as I was watching it. There is such a desperate need for people who are intelligent, mature and morally sound enough to dig into such horrific happenings in our world, but that sub was mostly full of edgelords who just wanted to gawk at a sensationalist pedo thriller story. In the end I regretted my decision to share and am glad it was removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing that. I think most users on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> had honourable intentions, but CSA is an ultra-sensitive issue, and in truth the populist and irreverent nature of reddit means is not the optimal platform for a serious discussion about it, or how to combat it.</p>

<p>As regards the artist, I think you are referring to Kim Noble, who as you say is a victim - and a deeply disturbed woman. Even though her art may therapeutic value for her (as well as providing income) the extreme nature of her painting appeals to a certain type of person, and for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons. It is hard to believe a normal, balanced individual would want to hang her pictures in their home, and certainly not in a pizza joint. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct, and that was the significance of the information. While her artwork has been very important and useful in raising awareness, it has no place in a pizza parlor with children. It also showed that whoever purchased and decided to display the art in the pizza parlor had been seeking such content specifically to display in such a place. But the majority of responses I was seeing to the info in that sub weren&#39;t even perceptive enough to see that point, and were instead just making very immature remarks. </p>

<p>So naturally I felt like I had made the wrong judgement call in exposing places where she could be personally contacted, to a crowd full of people like that, when most of the crowd didn&#39;t even seem capable of making proper use of the information. It wound up being a risk to a very damaged victim, and then for nothing. So I swiftly regretted it.</p>

<p>Just like some people like her artwork for the wrong reasons, some people are interested in pizzagate for the wrong reasons, as well. Different reasons, but still wrong reasons. </p>

<p>And I still don&#39;t feel 100% confident on what is the &quot;right thing&quot; when it comes to the topic of doxxing people who may be connected to highly suspicious activity that reeks of pedo interests. Doxxing is extremely damaging and traumatizing to innocent people, and yet if the authorities do not do their jobs to investigate discretely and then apprehend culprits, that only leaves everyday citizens.. who don&#39;t know how to do things discretely and respectfully (i.e. all the potatoes who started leaving accusations on the social media of the people running the pizza joints). So maybe there is no &quot;right&quot; option, I admit. But I still felt bad about the risk to a victim that I was promoting, when it turned out to be for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was illegal. I explained that I felt ethically conflicted when I realized that I had provided a means to contact her directly through one of the sites I provided as evidence, to a bunch of people who were not only too stupid to figure out how to do an image search on their own in the first place, but who were also such immature edgelords that they just started leaving shitty comments about the artist herself, including a comment that she deserved to be killed which received upvotes, instead of focusing on the information as another piece of supporting evidence / that victims were being exploited. Your &quot;no true scotsman&quot; statement is hilarious given the point of my post and your own lack of reading comprehension skills.</p>

<p>Look I get the other point you are trying to make, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if some of the morons who started attacking those people on social media, were actually deliberately trying to sabotage the investigation by &quot;tipping off&quot; those people, causing them to set everything to private and also make researchers as a whole look bad. I get what you are saying, and I agree with you that there is always that factor.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t and am not claiming that the thread I made was &quot;illegal&quot; but just that I was disgusted by most of the responses from that sub and it made me feel regret over having shared the information. I would support a sub with quality moderation, that only accepted comments/threads of information and explanations of theories, along with the no doxxing rule. But it&#39;s too late for that now, isn&#39;t it.</p>

<p>In the 1980s in the UK, there was well know charity promoted by the Establishment (and a particular celebrity called Esther Rantzen) called Childline which encouraged abused children to phone in and report their abuse. It appears that the real purpose was so that paedos could skim off vulnerable children who called in, stop them going to the police, and possibly shut them up altogether. Childline still exists, although it appears to be fully legitimized now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can not  figure out if I think Pizza gate is a planted story or real. It&#39;s actually very suspect to me that Reddit shut down the story -- it could mean it&#39;s just that real. or --- nothing gives credit to a subversive story like getting shut down by reddit, this also could be a way of intentionally firing up the researchers - to shut it down, -- I mean that is what it&#39;s done. ugh. I really could see it either way.  There does seem to be a plethora of information that leads to near certainty some sort of child rape/murder/canibalism? crime ring exists within these pizza businesses. It&#39;s horrific. .....if all those emails and other collected evidence is real -- the crime ring is real. no question.  However I would not put it past the CIA to craft such a story through creating all of these discoverable images/emails/ posts/ texts/businesses etc. Like a mind-f easter egg hunt. And then use the uproar to shame and discredit the people who feel passionate about getting to the bottom of this and stopping the abuse/ - or there could even be some other motive for the mind-f. Is it horrible pedophilia nancy drew bait for free thinking good people? Or is it REAL??? I just can&#39;t tell either way, I think it&#39;s real. bt I think some things that are not real are tied in -- for example the madeline Mccann case seems like a clear hoax, Wikileaks itself seems like controlled oposition/cia, and I trip on on a few other things/; this story is swelling over thanksgiving vacation. there always seems to be leaked fake scandals on holiday time, -- I think they expect they need to take up peoples free time lest they rest and think their own thoughts for a few days. also the &quot;tunnels&quot; being dug -- are so small -- they are not really functional for what we are to think they are used for. this all might be a trick to mess with us. it also might be real/ i think Joe Biden is a real pedophole. no question. so where there is smoke there is likely fire --- there are A LOT of indicators bad creepy stuff is going on behind doors of political life. something LIKE this thing probably does exist -- but is this particular thing real or fake? it&#39;s surely walking and talking like a pedo crime ring duck. but the CIA loves to create fake morbid mysteries to capture american attention/ I really do not know how to be sure about this one either way. </p>

But as yet, nobody has found the connecting door between the two. In other words, we are lacking hard evidence that will turn this investigation into a real criminal investigation. Until a door is found, we have to entertain the possibility that there is no door (or that there is, but that door is to be found somewhere else because pizzagate was constructed as a decoy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment, I think you might be exactly right. it&#39;s nice to hear somebody else say it so succinctly. Seems clear to me something to do with rampant child molestation &amp; worse is happening among the &quot;powerful/wealthy/insider/whatever&quot; people. Biden is obviously a real molester imo, and surrounded by a lot of suspicious family death. And where there is smoke there is no doubt some kind of greater fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to show you but the style of photo I sent you wasn&#39;t up to your standards.  I already told you I don&#39;t have an imagur or any photo apps, and his IG  account is private now so the only way I can send you pics is google images.  Im not spending my time making a full report for you, it&#39;s too long and too much work, especially since I think you&#39;ll have no appreciation for it- so no I&#39;m not wasting my time sending you research that would take you far less time to investigate yourself.  You have no desire to, therefore I have no desire to do the work for you.</p>

<p>I cannot open your eyes if you wish they remain closed.  If you want to take your children to his restaurant fine, do it, no one is stopping you.  If he didn&#39;t want people to have this opinion of him he should have chose more politically correct content on his public profiles, especially since he owns a business that children frequent and is even marketed towards children.  It seems to me maybe he wanted this all to happen to him, that&#39;s how blatant it is.  It&#39;s his own fault for so flamboyantly and publicly posting inappropriate content for all to see.  His jokes, pictures, slang of children are inappropriate, maybe not to you but to parents, it is offensive and very inappropriate.  </p>

<p>you mean when you send the two photos everyone is talking about and hwich are totally meaningless then tried to make it look like there was more by linking bad google searches which didn&#39;t even have meaningful results? you can&#39;t even describe an image other than the baby with euros and the girl with hands taped - neither of which are in the least bit shocking or untoward. there are no bad photos, no bad comments, no evidence what so ever - that&#39;s why you can&#39;;t point to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you don&#39;t have much knowledge of psychology especially that of a pedophile.  He shows all the signs of being a pedo.  His mind is very much geared toward children, his humor, his pics, his business, etc.  It seems as though most of his thoughts are of children and as if his life revolves around them.  It&#39;s typical textbook pedo.  He has no kids of his own but has a keen interest in children and surrounds himself with them.  Most of his pics do not need &quot;decoding&quot; to notice this, just a basic knowledge of psychology and how pedophiles operate, his public posts go further to include inappropriate jokes some even being blatantly sexual and almost every pic has a child in it.  I never said he is guilty just that he should be looked into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said arrested, you have a hard time absorbing information.  I have stated the reasons, logical ones, for why he should be INVESTIGATED.  He displays known characteristics of pedophiles, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s necessary to repeat them again and again- it&#39;s more than two pictures as you stated previously.  </p>

<p>You can undermine his behavior all you want but it doesn&#39;t change known psychological behaviors that he willingly displays on public platforms.  Of course he isn&#39;t going to post rape photos on his IG, which is what I believe you are looking for in order to think he could be a pedo.  He will merely dance around the &quot;idea&quot; of rape and &quot;joke&quot; about the selling and killing of children, which seems to be a theme on his page.</p>

<p>Maybe if he had a sense of humor outside of children, of pics without children, or any part of his life that was absent of children, then I could believe this was a &quot;witch&quot; hunt.  There are just too many indicators going off with him.  Text book indicators.  </p>

So an investigation performed by non-compromised agents is needed.  This is my last response to you.  Hope you are fulfilled by protecting the rights of pedophiles, everyone needs someone I guess, and they have you.  Best wishes to you and yours.</p>

<p>so you&#39;re saying that you won&#39;t believe any official agency or organisation? seems like there&#39;s nothing anyone can ever say to convince you even though you have absolutely nothing but a vague feeling about someone.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>the is the point, you&#39;ve decided they&#39;re guilty based on nothing and nothing anyone does or says can convince you otherwise, even though you have literally no prof.  </p>

<p>if the fbi thought they had a case then they&#39;d be all over this, so would a dozen other agencies from the local police to fucking interpol = when this became news of course they all looked into it, and of course when there was nothing there they all shook their heads and move on to dealing with actual real crimes - i mean ffs, you think the agents who brought down Epstein and etc haven&#39;t had a look at this massive news story? all the good cops in the world have seen this and none of them have said &#39;oh that needs following up&#39; and why? because there&#39;s nothing at all to this and everyone that&#39;s looked into it with an open mind has come to the same conclusion, only a very small group of dedicated anti-Clinton fanatics continue to push this.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s importnt that we still post about pizzagate here. over 400,000 subscribers to this sub, and if they see a bunch of pizzagate related posts at the very top of the page for the next few days and the new pizza/eye graphic (love it yb the way), that will tell them that this topic is being taken seriously by all on the sub, and it will encourage them to check it out.</p>

<p>But, we can continue a pizzagate sub-esque discussion at-</p>

I posted a very well documented case of child trafficking via a pizza front along with evidence of military involvement... it was deleted because it &quot;was not what pizzagate is about&quot;. Then I knew they were just locked onto Comet and won&#39;t back down until they see every employee hanging from a tree... They want to see instant justice... and can&#39;t move on until they&#39;ve seen it. I hope the new board  promotes more than just Comet bashing...

<p>No, don&#39;t jump to conclusions about your evidence when there is clearly not enough to substantiate the outlandish claims made by &quot;pizzagate&quot;.
