       Let's do the math, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the World Bank, 19% of the population of the United States is 14 or under.  Let's call them children.  The good Bank also says the US has 321 million people.  Now comes the hard part.
      </p>
      <p>
       19% of 321 million is.....about 61 million.  That's 61 million people 14 or under in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 in 92 is about 1.1 percent.  Now it's going to get really hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.1 percent of 61 million is 663,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, dear OP, you are saying every year, year in and year out, 663,000 children 14 or under go missing.  In five years that would be 3,300,000 missing kids (assuming none are dumb enough to be repeatedly missing).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to go with bullshit.

       I saw a stat in another post from a reputable source where I think the 1 in 92 number was from and it includes kids that were missing and found as well. It also includes kids taken by relatives and runaways. runaways were a large percentage of the stat.  I'll try to find it.

       I hope they do... I've been taking my non-Comet child trafficking findings directly to the FBI. There is so much more than Comet involved. I'll head to voat and help out if it looks like they will break out of the pointless Comet tunnel vision... cause this is widespread and having 99% of the users dedicated to pig piling on Comet wasn't getting anywhere.

       You may want to look into FBI sponsorship of, protection of &amp; participation in child porn &amp; pedo blackmail.  Start with McGowan's

       then read up on Louis Freeh, Penn State, Ray Gricar, and every director all the way from Hoover to Mueller, then delve into Bush Family pedophilia (YouTube Paul Bonacci) because the Bush Administration is where Comey came  from.

       I'm basing my opinions of the FBI based on their actions and words recently, not historically. I have no doubt that the FBI was a shady organization overseen by a minority of corrupt individuals looking to protect their own self interests... I am of a mind that the pendulum has swung back the other way and they are going to clean up their tarnished image... they are doing it right now. If you have no faith in law enforcement then the entirety of pizzagate is pointless unless you intend to go out and personally apprehend these suspects. As cocksure as all the pizzagaters  are I'm surprised no one has attempted a citizens arrest.

       It's not about progress; it's about respect. Stuff like this subverts the legitimacy of r/conspiracy. It's the equivalent of stringing Reptilian nutjobs and flat-earth nutjobs in with JFK assassination truth-seekers.

      <p>
       Pizzagate discussions will likely not be continued here. But, that doesn't change the fact that there ARE people here who are trying to do anything,
       <em>
        anything,
       </em>
       to find missing loved ones. And I'm sick to my stomach thinking what's going through their heads picturing their daughter trapped in a pizzagate-sourced sex trafficking ring.

       Bringing attention to it is one thing; mocking it, and the people affected by it, is another. ninjakick666 offered that no progress in the investigation would happen on r/conspiracy so I shouldn't be concerned with what degrading insults r/conspiracy was throwing at it. I admitted that r/conspiracy wouldn't want the discussions to continue here, but that I was sickened by the fact that they're on board with being lock-step with the corrupt admins and are meanwhile happy to make the sub look bad by mocking the victims by having a depiction of a sex slave gang-banged by pizza dicks. The discussion looks fine. The sidebar image has been changed to a less degrading picture, 40 minutes after I've asked it to. So, I'm more content with where things stand than five hours ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I see where we might have an understanding.

       My concerns were with the sidebar image, not the squabble over Voat's legitimacy. "They're [v/pizzagate] going to make progress with it no matter how much you [ninjakick666] complain" was the comment I replied to. My OP wasn't about pizzagate making progress here or there; it was about r/conspiracy disrespecting the victims and journalists.

       The numbers aren't as high as 1 in 92. They're still alarming though.

        Of the more than 11,800 endangered runaways reported to NCMEC in 2015, one in five were likely victims of child sex trafficking. Of those,

       That's true. Despite the one-in-five, you don't know until you know. If my niece was missing and I was looking for info anywhere I could find it, I could easily happen upon r/pizzagate. Well, I
       <em>
        could

       , until yesterday.
