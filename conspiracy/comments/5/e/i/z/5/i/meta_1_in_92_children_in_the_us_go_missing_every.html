    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do the math, shall we?</p>

<p>According to the World Bank, 19% of the population of the United States is 14 or under.  Let&#39;s call them children.  The good Bank also says the US has 321 million people.  Now comes the hard part.</p>

<p>19% of 321 million is.....about 61 million.  That&#39;s 61 million people 14 or under in the United States.</p>

<p>1 in 92 is about 1.1 percent.  Now it&#39;s going to get really hard.</p>

<p>1.1 percent of 61 million is 663,000.  </p>

<p>So, dear OP, you are saying every year, year in and year out, 663,000 children 14 or under go missing.  In five years that would be 3,300,000 missing kids (assuming none are dumb enough to be repeatedly missing).</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go with bullshit.</p>

<p>You may want to look into FBI sponsorship of, protection of &amp; participation in child porn &amp; pedo blackmail.  Start with McGowan&#39;s <em>The Pedophocracy</em> then read up on Louis Freeh, Penn State, Ray Gricar, and every director all the way from Hoover to Mueller, then delve into Bush Family pedophilia (YouTube Paul Bonacci) because the Bush Administration is where Comey came  from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m basing my opinions of the FBI based on their actions and words recently, not historically. I have no doubt that the FBI was a shady organization overseen by a minority of corrupt individuals looking to protect their own self interests... I am of a mind that the pendulum has swung back the other way and they are going to clean up their tarnished image... they are doing it right now. If you have no faith in law enforcement then the entirety of pizzagate is pointless unless you intend to go out and personally apprehend these suspects. As cocksure as all the pizzagaters  are I&#39;m surprised no one has attempted a citizens arrest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying, &quot;Hey outside world! We&#39;re a big fucking joke! Don&#39;t take anything you read here seriously!&quot;</p>

<p>Pizzagate discussions will likely not be continued here. But, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that there ARE people here who are trying to do anything, <em>anything,</em> to find missing loved ones. And I&#39;m sick to my stomach thinking what&#39;s going through their heads picturing their daughter trapped in a pizzagate-sourced sex trafficking ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bringing attention to it is one thing; mocking it, and the people affected by it, is another. ninjakick666 offered that no progress in the investigation would happen on r/conspiracy so I shouldn&#39;t be concerned with what degrading insults r/conspiracy was throwing at it. I admitted that r/conspiracy wouldn&#39;t want the discussions to continue here, but that I was sickened by the fact that they&#39;re on board with being lock-step with the corrupt admins and are meanwhile happy to make the sub look bad by mocking the victims by having a depiction of a sex slave gang-banged by pizza dicks. The discussion looks fine. The sidebar image has been changed to a less degrading picture, 40 minutes after I&#39;ve asked it to. So, I&#39;m more content with where things stand than five hours ago.</p>

<p>Edit: I see where we might have an understanding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My concerns were with the sidebar image, not the squabble over Voat&#39;s legitimacy. &quot;They&#39;re [v/pizzagate] going to make progress with it no matter how much you [ninjakick666] complain&quot; was the comment I replied to. My OP wasn&#39;t about pizzagate making progress here or there; it was about r/conspiracy disrespecting the victims and journalists.</p>

<p>Of the more than 11,800 endangered runaways reported to NCMEC in 2015, one in five were likely victims of child sex trafficking. Of those, <em>74</em> <em>percent</em> were in the care of social services when they went missing.</p>
