        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Origininal post here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/5e8prf/the_message_behind_the_crazy_rant_of_kanye_west/">self.Kanye</a></p>

<p>Hello everyone, before I start, I would like to say that I am a French fan of Ye since his early work (so forgive me for my future misspellings). And when I say that, I&#39;m talking about his rising since Roc-A-Fella Records. Now, I understand that what he did in Saint Pablo seems incomprehensible at first sight. Ye probably did a lot of harm to genuine fans who were going to his concert for the first time and to all the people who set aside some money to see him perform live.</p>

<p>But having said that, and as a sincere admirer of the man, I will continue to support him whatever happens, a fortiori during his darkest moments. Mainly because I believe that he said a lot of deep things in his &quot;crazy&quot; speech that day, and you don&#39;t even need to read between the lines to understand them.</p>

<p>Before going any further, I advise you to read the <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2016/11/20/kanye-west-transcript-sacramento">Full Transcript of Kanye West’s Sacramento Concert Speech</a></p>

<p>As you can see in the introduction, he begins by designating his target: the &quot;Radio&quot;, which refers to the &quot;mainstream media&quot; and the image of Power. From there he starts to invoke a multitude of names that he deeply respects, but who represent a caste that shade real talents: Drake is opposed to Frank Ocean and he even puts his own self under the talent of Kid Cudi. </p>

<p>From there, you can totally understand why he used a sentence as controversial as: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The figure of Donald Trump is used as a metaphore, what really counts here is what his election revealed: an organized lie which blinded us. His support is not a definitive political position but an impersonification of Trump&#39;s character: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’mma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’mma take his lead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does it again when he invokes his mentors:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro. A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro. [A$AP] Bari is alive tonight, bro. Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro. [A$AP] Rocky alive tonight, bro. Aye, y’all love my show.</p>

<p>The vibes is back. The vibes is back. Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does not retain the worst things said by the president elect but only the resentments that animated its invisible voters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again. Ha! You didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.</p>

<p>It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While he slowly speaks his truth about the music industry dirty games, he takes care to separate the employed actors from the real owners:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over.</p>

<p>Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, he understand that what he will say can end his career or even his life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.</p>

<p>Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys. But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years</p>

<p>Jay Z, call me. Aye, bruh, I know you got killers. Please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man. I’m not trying to be the man. I just am a man, the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal.</p>

<p>It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro. This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second. Do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. Wait a second. I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, Ye start to unveil his real concerns: in fact he wants to expose the mentality of people who have the ambition to represent the black community:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this [screams] and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.</p>

<p>People I&#39;m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening. The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton. You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up [and] you still can’t believe it!</p>

<p>Q-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me. I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. And things won&#39;t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over. [Drops mic]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the rest of his revelations is secondary from my point of view, all these points alone deeply remind me of Tupac words, of DMX speeches about the music industry, of Dave Chappelle &quot;crackdown&quot; on the power of money. Its seems like something is underlying in the black community of the USA. But i&#39;m probably too far from this country to undestand what it is.</p>

<p>Finally, what I wanted to say is this: please don&#39;t hate Kany, if you don&#39;t want to give him another chance it&#39;s understandable, but I think we shouldn&#39;t treat his words as pure madness. If he chose a concert to express his deepest feelings, It may be because he thinks it&#39;s the best place to be heard. This is his work, his life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening. The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models[...]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>kanye is attempting to expose the powers that be behind the music industry, but i dont think kanye really understands it completely himself. thats why i think he struggles so much to express himself. hes stumbling upon this revelation as he goes along and slowly putting the pieces together that were witnessing through his career. if you listen to his music you know that on new slaves he states:</p>

<p>See they&#39;ll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves</p>

<p>obviously hes confused as to what a new world order is, maybe he doesnt completely understand it, but he clearly understands the threat of private prisons and elitist corruption. </p>

<p>what i find really interesting in that rant was what he said about jay z and khaled having &quot;killers&quot;</p>

<p>wonder what else he knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like the full text version of this post was deleted. The other links are still good.</p>

<p>I think Kanye is vanguarding as best he can. He is attempting to use his status to make people aware of how the world really operates, from his perspective. He&#39;s doing his best to make it relatable for the rest of us without being too explicit, so as to not be perceived as a major threat to the establishment.</p>

<p>He is walking the line very close. Not a fun place to be, but only people in positions like his can do this sort of thing. It&#39;s heroic because we already see the consequences he&#39;s suffering for his actions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first time Kanye has said things like this. &quot;george bush doesn&#39;t care about black people.&quot; — Kanye During televised a charity drive for hurricane Katrina.  He just did it &quot;louder&quot; this time by saying it indirectly though his fan base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I interpreted it, for the most part I genuinely empathized with him. I think he was exhausted on some level and he just couldn&#39;t stand holding &#39;frame&#39; any more, and playing the &#39;game&#39; any more. I mean my first impression after finishing reading the whole thing was like... He really didn&#39;t say much of anything really. It was almost bordering on word salad a lot of the time. But as I thought about it I felt like in a way he actually did make a strong point, because look at how everybody now needs to feel like they are a &#39;winner&#39; by having something to say about &quot;Kanye&#39;s breakdown&quot; or whatever. As if it was something serious and concerning, or as if it was something super sad or made to be something to talk shit about him for. But that&#39;s just it, he was just saying what he was feeling in the moment. He felt some resentment, but he felt love and respect, he felt some anguish, but he felt some elation. He was just trying his heart out to be real. When he got around to talking about how he was just another person, just like anybody else in the room &quot; I just am a man, the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal.&quot;. I got the sense that at that moment he was having a genuine experience of being just as weak but just as real, just as fallible, but just as important, selfish and prideful but also willing to sorta cry out to people . Honestly I&#39;m falling into the same effect, trying to summon more meaning and intent in it than it really was. At the end of the day I was never even remotely a fan of his, but reading that I really feel for him. I think he&#39;ll be alright though. Have a good rest Kanye and try not to get too empowered by the way the story turns out to be exactly what you called out :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>full transcript is beautiful.  kayne is woke as fuck.  </p>

<p>so here&#39;s the thing though.  no one, not even educated whites are taking him serious.  all anyone talks about is the snoop reaction video.</p>

<p>so I had 15 people around me yesterday in a meeting all laughing at the snoop reaction, but couldn&#39;t tell me what Kayne actually said, hell these fools didn&#39;t even know what Snoop said.  they just heard it was funny.</p>

<p>from memory I started quoting what he said and suddenly I had the attention of the room.  within 5 minutes I had rich corn bread white people eating out of my hand by repeating Ye.  </p>

<p>by the end no one thought he was crazy and thought he was for sure on to something, but everyone agreed Snoop stole the show :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, he isn&#39;t crazy. And if he is, it is because he has to tell people this or he can&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t actually get what he is/has been saying. Man is actually a genius, possibly too quick at times. There is clearly a reason this happened now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye has a lot of thoughtful things to say. But i feel that the fact that he is uneducated affects his speeches. His mannerism and word choice make him sound illiterate. But i really feel like he is on the ball with changing the minds of the masses.  Nonetheless crying on stage about people that ignore u is sort of self centered when ppl paid to watch u perform. Not have u read ur livejournal. </p>

<p>p.s. Y&#39;know, the saddest aspect of ALL the SHIT going on in the world <em>right now</em> ... <strong><em>is it&#39;s Only going to get worse!</em></strong></p>

<p>But hey, you also know, &quot;It&#39;s always darkest before dawn&quot; ....</p>

<p>BUT,, I honestly believe that,  &quot;you and I, and the insignificant blobs of cybershit we generate Have, Are and will continue to be, TPTB&#39;s <em>greatest enemy</em></p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Becoz we talk about The Truth, at least we talk about &quot;the truth as we know it&quot; ,, and &quot;our speculation&quot; works a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">&quot;crowd-sourcing&quot;</a>
* </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Propaganda is <em>information that is not impartial</em> and <strong>is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>((Today the term propaganda is associated with a manipulative and jingoistic approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term))</p>

<p>And The Bottom Line is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what &quot;we&quot; Do, whenever we get together and discuss stuff like this! Sure &quot;we&quot; are going to make &#39;mistakes&#39; BUT, when we All contribute the &#39;bits and pieces&#39; of information <strong>about things like this</strong>, and &quot;where&#39;s Julian Assange?&quot; etc etc and as &quot;we&quot; are <em>very difficult to control</em>! </p>

<p>TPTB HATE &quot;the Internet&quot; for a few &#39;reasons&#39; But mainly because most &#39;online content&#39; <em>is beyond</em> their ability to &#39;control&#39; of! </p>

<p>Since politics began, TPTB have used one method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda</a> or another to &quot;inform the people&quot; of <em>what they want</em> &quot;the people&quot; to know.</p>

<p>Through &quot;their Control&quot; of what is &#39;reported&#39; by the MSM, which, since the start of the 20th century, HAD become (their/TPTB&#39;s) &quot;Propaganda machine&quot; - one which they wielded to great effect. </p>

<p>However, in 2016, more people than ever have access to this, &quot;unprecedented information sharing service&quot;, we now call &#39;The Internet&quot; --- a &quot;source of information&quot; TPTB have (so far, so good ..) been unable to &#39;counter&#39; with their &quot;Co-Intel&quot;, although you can bet &quot;the house, the kids, the car&quot;,, on the Fact, &quot;they&#39;ve Tried&quot; their darndest!</p>

<p>So far the &#39;best&#39; they can actually do, aside from &#39;turning it off&#39; is to Try and use &#39;shills&#39; to &#39;support <em>their ideas</em>, and (hopefully) &#39;convert&#39; the &#39;undecided&#39; onto &quot;their side&quot;. e.g. Hillary <em>almost just</em> pulled it off! </p>

<p>I believe it was the constant &#39;online chatter&#39; and the &#39;sane information&#39; &quot;the people were able to acquire, via &#39;The Internet&#39; that <em>essentially</em> stopped The Wicked Witch of the Whitehouse from LYING HER WAY into office!</p>

<p>Thanks ALL of you <em>across the World</em> and whomever you support, Red, Blue or Purple, for <em>sharing</em> the Love .... yeah, I know that <em>sounds</em> corny, BUT, I&#39;d rather sound corny and <em>feel</em> comfortable <em>knowing</em> that HRC will not become POTUS!</p>

<p>TBH I don&#39;t think there <em>could&#39;ve been Anyone worse</em> to be POTUS.</p>

<p>Good on ya People of the <del>World</del> Reddit .... Keep sharing the <del>love</del> dank memes!</p>

<p>and;  &quot;The Truth&quot; IS TRUE, it cannot be changed or altered to be <em>anything else but</em> The Truth&quot;.</p>
