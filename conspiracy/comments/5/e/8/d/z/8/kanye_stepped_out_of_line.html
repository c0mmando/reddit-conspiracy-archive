<p>The line from MJ&#39;s song Bad comes to mind: &quot;you&#39;re throwing stones to hide your hands&quot; </p>

<p>Also, from his song &#39;Is It Scary?&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Masquerade the heart</p>

<p>Is the height of haunting souls </p>

<p>Just not what you seek of me </p>

<p>Can the heart reveal the proof</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Initially I was like &quot;whatever&quot; regarding the talk about him standing up on stage and saying the things he did.  However, if what you say about his being held in a hospital against his will is true, then this puts a lot more weight on the possibility that he may indeed have said something that the power elite didn&#39;t like.  That makes me suddenly raise my eyebrows a little over what he did then, because maybe it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> just &quot;the latest meaningless, attention-seeking act by some msm hotshot&quot; kind of thing.  Maybe it was something a bit more authentic/genuine.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Interesting.  We&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just arguing with some of his clueless &quot;ex-fans&quot; on social media who were claiming he &quot;lost his mind.&quot; I said that I thought he made perfect sense and I happened to agree with everything he said.  I mean Kanye finally drops some truth knowledge on his fans and they call him crazy for it.  The truly crazy part about the whole thing is that it&#39;s  his clueless ignorant fans that are the people who have obviously lost their minds.  His fans get some truth dropped on them that most people in this forum already knew to be true and they dismiss him as mental and turn on him.  Wtf man, it&#39;s scary to think about the large numbers of complete idiots there are in our society now.  </p>
