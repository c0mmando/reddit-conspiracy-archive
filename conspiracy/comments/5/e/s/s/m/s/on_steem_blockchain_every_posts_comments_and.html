       you will be able to earn STEEM cryptocurrency, which you can trade anonymously for bitcoin on many bitcoin exchanges (like poloniex.com), then you can spend bitcoin on any shop in the internet or exchange for your local currency with localbitcoins.com or many others exchanges (some exchanges require your ID, some don't, but you can always trade bitcoins individually with help of localbitcoins)

       I proved over a month ago they censored my images by caching redacted imagery from imgur AFTER they published the unredacted ones, and locked that post so I could not edit or delete it.  I have at least 3 witnesses who saw this, and one irl.  I was one of the first people to take multiple screenshots of hillary's greensboro NC glitching and I made a whole narrative about it, exposing it as a CIA operation by the cass sunstein playbook.  Someone apparently did not like this
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't be the only one they've done this kind of thing to.  I'm not that special a snowflake.  Come forward others...let people know that steemit is control grid confirmed.

       edit:
People need to know...its timing is cuirious, they don't respond to people, and it's a whole ponzi scheme anyway.  It's designed to fracture reddit.  Defenders of steemit who have either willfull blindness or cognitive dissonance about it (ie: they have a sunken cost fallacy of swtichign over to steemit and liking it), say that the changes were 'interface level'...that doesn't matter!  It doesn't matter if your post is in the blockchain or they are screwing with the interface--either way, they deranged your post in a propaganda way to inhibit your free speech.  Therefore this argument is invalid so please do us a favor and don't revisit it

       I'm rather new to steem so will definitely investigate.  Have you checked your post on the uncensored version running on tor? And seriously i doubt anything you posted was censorship material for steemit.  Anyway to clear things up steemit.com is fully open source and the STEEM has always been and is decentralized.

       I know all those things are advertised as true, but used develop data-driven websites similar to fb and twitter for a living in php/js and I can assure you that I was made by my bosses to publish capabilities of websites that aren't true.  Especially at agencies....seo and video publishing... I know there are problems on the backend, and if you have the database and code access you can do anything.  We have got to stop taking everyone's word as scripture, just because they are ceos or they own the websites they run.   My screenshots and my experience are what's real to me, I don't care about any claims they make.  I checked my post on a VPN from moscow and it had the same problems.  I looked at the images on imgur and they were redacted
       <em>
        there
       </em>
       as well, which means that imgur was the source, however, they were not redacted when I posted, and steemit published the unredacted for about a day as I fwd this to other people via email.  They noticed it a day later and told me.  I checked on it and was super pissed off and very confused, given that I had also believed that steemit was not capable of this (re-caching redacted images after publishing unredacted imagery)
