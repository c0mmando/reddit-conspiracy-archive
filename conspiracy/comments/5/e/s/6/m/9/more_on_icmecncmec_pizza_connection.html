<p>Anyone paying attention to pizza knows that there was an ICMEC/NCMEC connection between Jeff Koons/Alefantis/Laurasilsby</p>

<p>Now, I was watching this corbett report video about pedophiles in the government and the chubby dude at the bottom right mentions some guy named Mark Foley. Foley was a pederast and got caught texting sexually explicit messages to underage boys</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley_scandal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley_scandal</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... we have 2 republicans, both are warmongering neocons and both are diddlers. Dennis Hastert was friends with Tony Podesta</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-podesta-support-pedophile/">http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-podesta-support-pedophile/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now... lets zero in on Mark Foley</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the House, Foley was one of the foremost opponents of child pornography. Foley had served as chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children. He introduced a bill, coined the &quot;Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act of 2002&quot; to outlaw web sites featuring sexually suggestive images of preteen children, saying that &quot;these websites are nothing more than a fix for pedophiles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pedophiles are literally running the anti-pedophile organizations. Remember that the MSM is trying to normalize this shit and say it&#39;s a sexual orientation. </p>

<p>EDIT: Here is the original video from Corbettreport about the ICMEC thing and Foley at the 12:39 mark <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZRQcSMeeM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZRQcSMeeM</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Koons connection is interesting. </p>

<p>I&#39;m Norwegian, and the biggest living Norwegian artist is Bjarne Melgaard, who lives and works in New York. He&#39;s notorious for his pedophilia-related art, specifically some pieces referencing NAMBLA. He&#39;s gay (of course), and all of his art is full of genitalia depictions and sexual depravity. </p>

<p>He&#39;s also part of the Norwegian establishment, to such a degree that our biggest bank commissioned him to design their new credit/debit cards.  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t checked if he&#39;s friends with the Podestas and the rest of the PizzaGate people, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. </p>

<p>Edit: For the record, I&#39;m not saying Melgaard is a pedophile just because some of his art references pedophilia. I mentioned him just to show how mainstream pedophile-related art has become, or rather -- how accepted it is among certain people in the elite. For all I know, he&#39;s a good person. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, by edict, had all the dirt on all the diddlers way back then and still does. </p>

<p>On the other side of the aisle there are others, just like her, that can wield power for the Public Spectacle. </p>

<p>John McCain and Lyndsey Grahame come to mind tonight but there are others, many...equally slimy as they spin and spin!</p>

<p>The House of Cards that Folded under the impending weight of The Bill Clinton Impeachment only drove the Power Hungry toward all things further entangled into Off Shore Investments and Escape methods, for the most vile, to not only survive but become obscenely wealthy. </p>

<p>To empower all the Little Freaks to become Movers and Shakers, that feed the Lust, until they too become power players with dossiers.</p>

<p>My salute to all that fight this! Never Bend Knee! Stay focused, determined and stalwart!</p>

<p>idk about PIE but NAMBLA was synonymous with the LGBT which makes one beg the question, should we really be giving praise to homos in the first place? People who were prominent figures in the counterculture and lgbt rights groups were also staunch pedophile enablers. Alan Ginsberg and Alfred Kinsey, both cultural marxists. </p>

<p>Lets put it this way, If I even mutter the word &quot;faggot&quot; on a college campus, I get crucified and called a homophobe, maybe even become a pariah. This is because the left has a pavlovian knee-jerk reaction and instantly recoils whenever someone says anything negative about homosexuality. You can&#39;t have a serious discussion with someone about the correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia. It&#39;s a slippery slope.</p>

<p>Tl;dr- LGBT was the first step, Transfaggotry was the second, and Pedophilia is the final frontier</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The area of DC was a known gay area and there was literally a Nambla bookstore down the street from comet ping pong. Ignoring the correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia is intellectually dishonest. You should research Kinsey and Ginsberg and other frankfurt marxists who pioneered the lgbt movement as a pretext for normalizing pedophilia. It&#39;s social engineering on a massive scale and they are slowly pushing the overton window by promoting sexual deviants in the media and giving praise to degeneracy.</p>

<p>Alfred Kinsey/Alan Ginsberg = Occultists who were both gay/pedophiles. Gays are more likely to be pedophiles. </p>
