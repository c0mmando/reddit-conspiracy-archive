        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So after thanksgiving dinner and some family time I had to go back to my work. I just pulled up actually. It&#39;s 2:25 am eastern time and there are about 6 different helicopters flying around. No lights on or anything you can just hear the sound of alot of helicopters and you can see them pass infront of the clouds. It doesn&#39;t look at all like a news helicopter or a private helicopter, they are flat black and the almost certainly look military. Anyone around metro atlanta see this shit? Is something going down?</p>

<p>Edit. <a href="/u/TylerBalius">/u/TylerBalius</a> posted <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5esenx/something_weird_is_going_on_in_atlanta/daeu17l">this</a> video at least 20 minutes away from me of the same exact noise. This shit is creeping me the hell out. </p>

<p>Edit 2: sorry for my profanity. This is happening outside my work, and I am the only one here so I&#39;m kinda freaking out.</p>

<p>Edit 3 It&#39;s 9:30 am now and the sound is gone and there definitely aren&#39;t helicopters up anymore.</p>

<p>HOLY FUCKING SHIT. I thought this was a joke. I&#39;m in marietta and it&#39;s loud as fuck. It&#39;s never this loud here.</p>

<p>Edit-<a href="https://goo.gl/photos/W5yzK6RaS7e1cGh17">Its 3 now and they are still up there</a></p>

<p>Edit again. <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/BDDgBwEJDFqgje8n6">It was like 11 am when I recorded this</a>, you can still hear it faintly but I don&#39;t know what would possibly be causing it to be so loud at 3am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I lived near downtown Los Angeles for a couple years, helicopters would sometimes do this, just hover really high up, like five of them sometimes, if there was a big game or event going on. I thought it was so... wrong. But that&#39;s just LA... and I guess Atlanta.</p>

<p>If you go to <a href="/r/LosAngeles">/r/LosAngeles</a> they have a helicopter in their logo for LA, they are that ubiquitous. I think the term ghetto bird came from LA.</p>

There have been a lot of these reports from various places throughout America lately, and we rarely find out exactly what&#39;s going on, other than some kind of mysterious military drill.

<p>Also saw it happening mid-summer here strange hovering in a kohls parking lot- military choppers.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll probably end up being a drill, and nothing more. A false flag is unlikely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Took me awhile but I finally found a post from here Nov 21st to an article I thought might be useful....<br/>
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies?utm_term=.xuV29qo9x#.xebxeZqeL">https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies?utm_term=.xuV29qo9x#.xebxeZqeL</a>    </p>

<p>Its an article about how we&#39;re being watched from above...the data I think is from Dec 2015 but it gives you a link to the site they got the info from which is <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/33.8,-84.5/11">https://www.flightradar24.com/33.8,-84.5/11</a>    </p>

<p>As far as I can tell there&#39;s only a couple of flights around Atlanta right now, although, I didn&#39;t pay for their membership? or whatever but then it occurred to me that if there was some creepy crap going on then the area around you might be &quot;sectioned&quot; off as it were.    </p>

<p>I live near a pretty big air base and the air around it is very difficult to get into without lots of procedures and permission.<br/>
Do you have any military bases in or around you that would account for flights or training?<br/>
If so, call them and ask what the flying (pun intended) f*ck is going on?<br/>
Or call the frickin cops, you can&#39;t be the only one freaking out, post what their official answer is so we&#39;ve got it.    </p>

<p>As a side note, my brother is a Huey Pilot and once flew over my house not terribly allowablely? low....it was SOOOO frickin loud and scary and that was just one, not five or six.</p>

<p>Sorry this is or has happened, we&#39;re with you in spirit and hope all is well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just checked, Dobbins Air Reserve Base is between Atlanta And Marietta and has Marine Helicopters and Army Helicopters stationed there, also, in a creepy twist the base is adjacent to the &quot;Lockheed Martin/Air Force Plant #6....&quot; and &quot;also shares the Dobbins runway. The corporation uses a 74-acre building to build the C-130 Hercules and the P-3 Orion. Lockheed built the C-141 Starlifter and the C-5B at that plant as well. Lockheed is currently producing the Air Force&#39;s F-22 Raptor, an advanced air-to-air fighter designed to replace the F-15 Eagle.&quot;<a href="http://www.dobbins.afrc.af.mil/AboutUs.aspx">http://www.dobbins.afrc.af.mil/AboutUs.aspx</a>     </p>

<p>So big business hand and hand with our Military...<br/>
So must be one or the other or both screwing around none of which makes you feel any better...sorry.</p>
