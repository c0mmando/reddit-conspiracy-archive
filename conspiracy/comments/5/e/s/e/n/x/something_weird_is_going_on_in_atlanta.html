       So after thanksgiving dinner and some family time I had to go back to my work. I just pulled up actually. It's 2:25 am eastern time and there are about 6 different helicopters flying around. No lights on or anything you can just hear the sound of alot of helicopters and you can see them pass infront of the clouds. It doesn't look at all like a news helicopter or a private helicopter, they are flat black and the almost certainly look military. Anyone around metro atlanta see this shit? Is something going down?

       video at least 20 minutes away from me of the same exact noise. This shit is creeping me the hell out.

       Edit 2: sorry for my profanity. This is happening outside my work, and I am the only one here so I'm kinda freaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3 It's 9:30 am now and the sound is gone and there definitely aren't helicopters up anymore.

        It was like 11 am when I recorded this

       When I lived near downtown Los Angeles for a couple years, helicopters would sometimes do this, just hover really high up, like five of them sometimes, if there was a big game or event going on. I thought it was so... wrong. But that's just LA... and I guess Atlanta.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to
       <a href="/r/LosAngeles">
        /r/LosAngeles
       </a>
       they have a helicopter in their logo for LA, they are that ubiquitous. I think the term ghetto bird came from LA.

       Damn.  You wouldn't last a day out here in LA.  You get so used to ghetto birds flying overhead so frequently here that I'm only just now realizing that there's been one hovering in the distance for I don't know how long now! lol

       Thanks for keeping us updated. There have been a lot of these reports from various places throughout America lately, and we rarely find out exactly what's going on, other than some kind of mysterious military drill. If I were to guess, I'd say we won't get any conclusive answers this time either.

       This was happening in Chicago about a month ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also saw it happening mid-summer here strange hovering in a kohls parking lot- military choppers. At first I thought nothing of it until it continued for over 5 minutes then I thought maybe it was having some sort of malfunction it wasn't until I started recording that it picked up speed and took off

       I wouldn't worry. It'll probably end up being a drill, and nothing more. A false flag is unlikely.

       But if you really don't feel safe, consider leaving until things calm down.

       Took me awhile but I finally found a post from here Nov 21st to an article I thought might be useful....

       Its an article about how we're being watched from above...the data I think is from Dec 2015 but it gives you a link to the site they got the info from which is
       <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/33.8,-84.5/11">

       As far as I can tell there's only a couple of flights around Atlanta right now, although, I didn't pay for their membership? or whatever but then it occurred to me that if there was some creepy crap going on then the area around you might be "sectioned" off as it were.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live near a pretty big air base and the air around it is very difficult to get into without lots of procedures and permission.
       <br/>
       Do you have any military bases in or around you that would account for flights or training?
       <br/>
       If so, call them and ask what the flying (pun intended) f*ck is going on?
       <br/>
       Or call the frickin cops, you can't be the only one freaking out, post what their official answer is so we've got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, my brother is a Huey Pilot and once flew over my house not terribly allowablely? low....it was SOOOO frickin loud and scary and that was just one, not five or six.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this is or has happened, we're with you in spirit and hope all is well.

       Phoenix has had a "military exercise" that lasted a couple of weeks with helicopters doing that same exact thing. It was both day and night hearing and seeing them, flying close overhead. Look out for a news report later, that's the only way I found out about our event. They seem to be doing these exercises in and around all major cities as of late, which that alone has me a bit on edge.

       I live in a medium sized city near the airport.. I hear military jets take off, C130s flying over our neighborhood on the regular.. But after Russia decided to go into Syria I heard an alarm I hadn't heard before and 15 minutes of jets taking off every 30 seconds. I really thought WWIII was starting.

       I heard a strange alarm at 3 am that sounded like a tornado warning alarm but different like there was some sort of huge vehicle moving with it. I drove around looking but it was gone. I never thought to look up.

       Today I saw a group of military helicopters so large it blew my mind. I have never before in my life seen more than 3 helicopters flying together. Today, I saw somewhere in the neighborhood of 11-14 military helicopters flying in formation and heading South over Castlerock, Colorado.

       Just checked, Dobbins Air Reserve Base is between Atlanta And Marietta and has Marine Helicopters and Army Helicopters stationed there, also, in a creepy twist the base is adjacent to the "Lockheed Martin/Air Force Plant #6...." and "also shares the Dobbins runway. The corporation uses a 74-acre building to build the C-130 Hercules and the P-3 Orion. Lockheed built the C-141 Starlifter and the C-5B at that plant as well. Lockheed is currently producing the Air Force's F-22 Raptor, an advanced air-to-air fighter designed to replace the F-15 Eagle."

       I lived in the A for awhile and remember CDC is over there by Emory. i have seen hovering lights above what might be the CDC from my apt on Cheshire bridge before. Also cnn is headquartered there and they could be working on their next movie.I mean news story.

       You want me to be honest? I don't even want to go outside. It's creeping me the hell out. You can definitely hear rotor blades, but not just 1 helicopter. It's got to be at least 5 or 6.
