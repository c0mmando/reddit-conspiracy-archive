       When the transaction volume gets high enough to force the issue which it still hasn't. Regardless of what the solution ends up being it will be fixed, or else a competing cryptocurrency will just overtake it which is in no ones interest, so the infighting will stop quickly enough when it has to

       I had a transaction disappear the other day. Showed up on my receiving wallet....no confirmations for 2 days then it disappeared from transaction list on both wallets. Was very confused. Luckily it was only $2 I sent from one wallet to another I own. But that worries me. Its still not bulletproof.

       well the wallet didn't tell me anything. it just said the transaction went through gave me a tx id and on blockchain.info it was not found.

      <p>
       I used the default fee, which is why I question if that's the reason. The wallets usually have reasonable fees by default.

       What you are seeing is the transaction limits being approached. Small value transactions no longer have a high enough default fee to go thru, but given that there isn't a lot of demand for small value bitcoin transactions it isn't affecting the value

       ahh. so because it was only $2 the fee was not high enough to be processed by miners? I've sent zero fee transactions before but that was over 2 years ago....they would

        always

       i have not tried since. I opened up two wallets with copay and sent $2 to each wallet. One showed up the other did not. All other payments I've made seem to go through fine.

       Segwit and LN are on schedule,  They are updates to the current protocol that don't require the network to hardfork.  If you look at softfork vs hardfork, a softfork is a much safer less harsh option.  Ethereum has had many hard forks that caused alt-coins and unstable synchronization.  One side of bitcoin wants to hardfork to a higher capacity but a lot of people don't agree with that option.  It is being debated and coded which is amazing.  There are also hundreds of alt-coins with individual characteristics that might give it value.  Most alt-coins are copies of bitcoin or ethereum protocol but there are some unique ones like monero which was an offshoot of cryptonote I believe, but monero has a similar distribution pace as bitcoin which keeps the mining fair.  It's an amazing new field and I can't wait to see which protocol makes it to the top.  Currently bitcoin holds that position because of it's massive network effect but it's an open field anyone can conquer.

       That can be hacked, deleted, updated, or expanded at any time. Meanwhile, IN REALITY, if your monetary system 1. ACTUALLY EXISTS (shitcoin is not a monetary system) and 2. IS NOT BASED IN FIAT, it is PERFECTLY, COMPLETELY, AND UTTERLY PROTECTED against any attack.

       It's true because bitcoin is an open sourced computer code.  If you understand the protocol you will see how it works.  The creator stepped away from development and never spent the shares he created via mining.  Mining is at its hardest and growing more than ever.  It might take a while to grasp, but it's all working cogs of decentralization.

        Of course people control it. Not only did one person create it (one person whose personal ties are ludicrously suspect), he has the power to destroy it at any time.

        The US government owns more than half of all shitcoins. It is entirely possible for a single entity to purchase all of them. It’s not money. It’s BARELY even currency.

       I had a transaction disappear the other day. Showed up on my receiving wallet....no confirmations for 2 days then it disappeared from transaction list on both wallets. Was very confused. Luckily it was only $2 I sent from one wallet to another I own. But that worries me. Its still not bulletproof.
