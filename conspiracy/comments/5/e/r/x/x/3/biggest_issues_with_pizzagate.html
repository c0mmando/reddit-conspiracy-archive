        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/pizza_shill.html">pizza_shill</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this for several weeks now and had posted on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> before it was shut down. I wanted to outline a few holes in the argument that I&#39;ve seen addressed. I sincerely doubt it will change any minds (if this even makes it NEAR the front page) but here is a skeptical view of the evidence. </p>

<p>1.) It&#39;s clear there is an underlying hatred of Hillary that&#39;s a strong motivator. If HRC wasn&#39;t involved, even tenuously, then this would be a non-issue. In fact, there was a brief time where people were scouting other pizza places around the US and trying to find clues. Pizzagate sleuths told them to drop it and focus on Comet Pizza (where there true crimes were happening). </p>

<p>2.) People cite the branding of Besta Pizza and Politics and Prose as evidence for Pizza Comet being the center of a pedo sex ring, yet no one is digging through those businesses instagrams or doing surreptitious explorations of those locations, even though their logos would make THEM suspicious. Instead, we&#39;re lead to believe that those businesses are indicators that Pizza Comet is evil but those 2 shops are totally fine. </p>

<p>3.) The &quot;code words&quot; can&#39;t be backed up by any source. You can trace back the logos (the triangle designs, etc) to an actual FBI document from 2007 but the &quot;pizza&quot;, &quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;ice-cream&quot;, or &quot;realtor&quot; codes literally came from a 4chan post. The entire investigation into pizza comet comes from one person claiming that common elements of a pizza place are actually code words for pedophiles. Please, someone, find a verifiable source that anyone uses those words for secret pedophile codes. </p>

<p>4.) The instagram of Pizza comet was &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;suggestive.&quot; - Pizza Comet is a pizza place, music venue, art gallery and ping-pong place run by a wealthy mid-40s gay dude who loves art. The most common evidence used against them is they advertise as &quot;kid friendly.&quot; Just because a place advertises as &quot;kid-friendly&quot; doesn&#39;t mean 8 year olds are hanging out watching a punk band play at 10pm. Just because this guy&#39;s personal / business instagram is &quot;weird&quot; doesn&#39;t make him a pedophile. Just because their marketing is suggestive and not family friendly doesn&#39;t make them bad. </p>

<p>This whole thing smacks of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I always thought the point of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was to examine the truth. This is 100% not finding the truth, but about bending the facts until they support what you already believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s a crazy wild coincidence then that Hillary Clinton personally went to Haiti to bail Laura Silsby out of jail after she got caught trying to traffic 34 kids and then gave Laura a job heading up a government program that&#39;s supposed to protect kids? At some point things stop looking like coincidences and in the case of pizzagate, I don&#39;t believe there are many coincidences.</p>

Anyway,  I am sending your mkultra slave Madeline McCann to drop it off via the underground tunnels under Washington DC we satanists constructed centuries ago to do evil shit in. 
-Carol,  you need to use code words.  Geez.  How did you get so high in the occult elite while being so tactless?
-Oh I forgot,  sorry.  You left your map on cheese pizza when we attended lucy&#39;s birthday and now your British protege will drop it off via DC subway. 
-Thank you.  Now I am going to eat oreos while watching Spanish television while drinking wine and wiping my face with cool whip and sitting in a bucket of blackberry jam while talking to a camel who is suckling a goat. 
- You sick fuck </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, what would a pizza related handkerchief be? With a &quot;map&quot; that she THINK&#39;s is on it?
And it&#39;s not casually talking about it. It&#39;s on a private e-mail server that they had no idea would be released to the public via wikileaks.</p>

<p>When you factor in the connections they have to known pedophiles, besta pizza, comet pizza and their instagram account with pictures and hashtags that are undoubtedly pedophilic.</p>

<p>You could write a novel on the all of connections and ridiculous &quot;coincidences&quot; that all lead towards some pedophile ring. So yes, I think it&#39;s more of a reach to think they are talking about an actual handkerchief with a literal map that is pizza related on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you look up &quot;map handkerchief&quot; you will see it&#39;s VERY common for maps of various locations to be printed on handkerchiefs. There&#39;s even a <a href="http://www.mankymaps.com/">website</a> dedicated to creating custom printed maps on handkerchiefs. So it&#39;s not that much of a stretch to believe that someone had a map of the DC area with a pizza symbol on it to indicate the location of Comet Pizza (owned by his friend, who may have ordered a bunch of them to give out to people), probably given to him as a gift which is why she thought he might want to keep it.</p>

<p>And why would she say &quot;<strong>A</strong> map&quot; if she was talking about cum?</p>

One poorly designed website that doesn&#39;t look like it gets much traffic doesn&#39;t make it &quot;very common&quot; to have a damn handkerchief with a map on it. So yes, still a massive stretch for a politician to be carrying one around and having someone refer to it as &quot;pizza related&quot;.</p>

<p>You also forgot where she mentioned I <strong>&quot;THINK&quot;</strong> there might be a map on it. If you look at one of those, you don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; there is a map. You know there is a map because it takes up the entire handkerchief. </p>

<p>Why would she say &quot;A map&quot;? Because it&#39;s a code word? I thought that was established. It&#39;s a map with his DNA that leads back to him. </p>

<p>Did you Google search &quot;map handkerchief&quot; like I suggested? If so, you will see how common the practice actually is...there are plenty of different map handkerchiefs out there, it&#39;s not just &quot;one poorly designed website&quot;.

<p>It&#39;s possible she said &quot;think&quot; because she couldn&#39;t actually recall what was printed on the handkerchief. She could&#39;ve discovered it days/weeks ago and only glanced at it for a moment, and was trying to recall what was actually printed on it without being certain.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already addressed this one multiple times elsewhere, so I&#39;ll just paste my interpretation again here.</p>

<p>Ok let&#39;s dissect this email and try to figure out what they could be talking about even though clearly we don&#39;t have the entire context of their lives/relationships/traditions.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So from this we can gather that they have a tradition of receiving a box of pasta+sauces as a gift from this person, which seems to come in a differently-shaped box than the one they just received containing cheese.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am awaiting the &gt; return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that &gt; we can demolish them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Demolish&quot; is a term often used to describe the consumption of food, so this is pretty straightforward. They are waiting until their children return from vacation so they can share the cheese with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As stated previously, there has been a &quot;change of strategy&quot; involving the shape of the box that they are used to receiving. Since he&#39;s asking whether he&#39;ll &quot;do better&quot;, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s just light banter regarding a tradition they have of playing dominos together on the pasta box that he receives as a gift each year when they get together. Perhaps it&#39;s just some competitive fun they have, and he&#39;s accusing the gift-sender of &quot;changing strategies&quot; because he lost last year on the pasta box but is hoping to win this time because of the differently-shaped cheese box.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just no way we can know for sure what he meant by that since we DON&#39;T KNOW these people or their traditions. But why would people jump to such wild conclusions involving having sex with children when there are many other innocent explanations that are more likely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest issue to me is that there&#39;s absolutely no evidence that pedophiles use words like pizza, maps, hot dog, ice cream, or anything else as codes for pedophilia. </p>

<p>If you take away the code words you&#39;re left with this: </p>

<p>1) A nearby restaurant used to have a pedo logo but changed it. Another nearby restaurant has a logo that vaguely resembles a pedo symbol. How those 2 places are related to Comet Pizza is unexplained. </p>

<p>2.) Comet Pizza has weird instagram photos. They must be the only instagram user in the world that has weird photos. Sex traffickers!!</p>

<p>3) They know a very well connected pedophile, who also happens to be connected to every other major politician (including The Donald) prior to being convicted. By this vein, every high ranking corporate worker or board member of Subway must also be a pedophile, because I&#39;m sure they hung out with Jared for over an hour. </p>

<p>I agree with all of that. You and I just disagree about the legitimacy of the evidence put forth so far in this one conspiracy. Nothing wrong with that...agree to disagree since neither of us can actually know the truth yet anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it could all be a coincidence.</p>

<p>It could be a coincidence that Podesta speaks in a code that is associated with pedos. Though there is uncertainty about its meaning, there is less uncertainty that it is a code of some kind.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that his acquaintance runs a pizza shop that has a known pedo symbol in its logo.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that there are pedo-suggestive pictures in his instagram--surely just an innocent misunderstanding.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that the bands hosted at the pizza shop use pedo-suggestive imagery in their videos and have pedo-suggestive lyrics--but hey, it&#39;s art.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that Podesta is an old friend of Hastert and Freud, who were convicted pedos.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that the Podesta brothers collect pedo-suggestive art.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that neighboring shops also displayed pedo-suggestive symbols.</p>

<p>And it could be a coincidence that there are financial ties among all these people.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a whole lot of &quot;coincidences&quot;. I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s not that easy to explain it all away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about changing minds but I want people to have another, skeptical side of the story. Everyone here is too affirming of each other&#39;s wildest notion and the all the evidence is circumspect at best. Plus anyone who disagrees is downvoted into oblivion.

<li><p>No, it isn&#39;t. If anyone was discouraged from researching other places, it&#39;s because the evidence points to Comet and the area around it, so investigation should focus there. I&#39;ve hardly seen anyone on the chans or reddit claim HRC is the focal point of investigation. There are tenuous connections linking her and the place - for example, she had a fundraiser there, and Alefantis&#39;s Instagram had a picture of a signed letter from her - but she hardly ever comes up. There are additional ties to the Podesta brothers in the emails and from other sources as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree more work should be done in these areas. There&#39;s just been so much to process with Comet alone, and it&#39;s hard to not retread ground by the very nature of a crowd-sourced investigation. People don&#39;t usually cite them as evidence of Comet&#39;s being suspect, but it is at least odd that so many weird coincidences would crop up around businesses that seem to all run along a section of abandoned subway tunnel. Feel free to start digging into them instead of complaining about it. Maybe another comment can fill us in on any other ways the businesses are connected.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, the &quot;official list&quot; of code words needs to stop being included in memes and graphics. I&#39;ve followed the investigation fairly closely from the beginning, and I have no idea how that suddenly became gospel. It&#39;s enough, however, to know that &quot;pizza&quot; is used in very, very weird ways in the emails and elsewhere. And &quot;cheese pizza&quot; has been a code word for many years, predating 4chan. From there, it is also true that &quot;pasta&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;hotdogs&quot; are all used in mysterious ways in the emails, and &quot;cheese&quot; at least is used oddly in the Comet Instagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigators are looking at not only the Instagram, but also many other strange aspects surrounding Comet - for example, the Youtube videos of performers there, a review citing hidden bathrooms; the fact that certain information of their website is heavily encrypted; the equally creepy website of their sister company, Buck&#39;s Hunting and Fishing; etc. - I&#39;d go on, but if you know the 4chan and 8chan threads as well as you seem to be claiming, you&#39;ll know what the sources of unease are besides the Instagram.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the map image, so what? How could that be considered &quot;pizza-related.&quot;</p>

<p>Your post is essentially a straw man in its entirety. No one who is serious about this investigation has claimed to have found a smoking gun. That&#39;s why we keep digging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post.  But I actually agree with OP about the handkerchief.   Handkerchiefs with maps on them are a thing, and Podesta was known for his &quot;Pizza&quot; (ie pedo) parties.   By far the most likely explanation is that he actually had a handkerchief with a map of pizza joints on it (perhaps a map of pizza joints that are also front companies).</p>

<p>IMO the most disturbing emails and text comes from the Luzzatto&#39;s.   </p>

<p>I disagree with OP that the Instagram is harmless.   There are a plethora of sexual references accompanied by pics of kids.   </p>

<p>1.) Bands - imagine if Lady Gaga performed there. Her artsy, provocative shows probably have a TON of pedo imagery if you believe that being &quot;creepy&quot; makes you a pedo. Just because an artsy punk band plays a show there doesn&#39;t make it a global pedophile sex trade location. </p>

<p>2.) Hidden bathrooms aren&#39;t actually hidden. The bathroom doors have wood paneling that allows it to blend in with the wall. </p>

<p>3.) Heavily encrypted portion of the website - maybe for internal use like Point of Sale data and budgeting? Maybe a log in for employees to record when they are available and when they aren&#39;t? Maybe it allows the website manager to do back-door changes to the website that the user (Comet Pizza) wouldn&#39;t be able to do OR won&#39;t let Comet Pizza dick with the code when they want to make a change. There are other reasons a website would encrypt portions of their site that don&#39;t involve fucking kids. </p>

<p>4.) Creepy Website -  <a href="http://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/">http://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/</a>
-I don&#39;t see anything creepy at all. I don&#39;t see any pedo symbols, code words, photos of kids, or anything that would remotely suggest they are involved in a global trade of children for sex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of odd things in all those pictures. But I don&#39;t see anything so odd that it screams &quot;center of global pedophile sex trade involving the top-brass of the democractic party, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and George Soros.&quot;</p>

If there&#39;s a remote chance that this place is connected to sex trafficking, it&#39;s worth investigating. If you want definitive proof, dig or try a different sub than r/conspiracy.

<p>I think you are very rational about all this, nicely said. The pizza theories needs a bit more research.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What I find unfortunate is a lot of well researched posts where totally ignored because they were relate to Haiti and not to pizza directly. Even posts or comments debunking &#39;evidences&#39;. I hope we&#39;ll get to discuss about this here.</p>
