       When you have such a concentrated attack by all MSM and all social sites censoring pizzagate, you know something is really up!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no actual evidence for the things pizzagate assumes for some of the pizzerias, some very small circumstantial evidence, so I was quite dismissful of it, but this concentrated and organized censorship is basically proof that there is something to it!

       The thing is the internet doesn't forget. Someone pulling up a tweet by the Twitter CEO from a decade ago when there was absolutely no social network on it, mostly just a bunch of Silicon Valley programmers sharing code snippets and chatting. It's not convincing, it's just sigh worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say really weird shit all the time. Someone being able to take a 10 year log of what I say, yeah you could jump to outrageous conclusions by me quoting movies alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thing has been guilt by association. How come the rich seem perfectly fine hanging out with convicted pedos, but the people I've known who are in gangs, criminals, served jail terms, etc. would beat the shit out of a suspected one in their neighborhood (it happens to sex offenders all the time) not go and hang out on vacation with one, or have a dinner party at their house. This was my kinda red pill for "something's wrong at the top". Don't get me wrong, I knew there'd be some, but this sounds like more than one rotten apple in the buschel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYT basically having the first article out over local papers and television, etc. The police and FBI seemingly being on top of it immediately, and then major social media corporations involved. They just hoisted a massive red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get accused of shit all the time, and it blows over. Why did it take less than 2 weeks for a massive scale response to help some little pizza chain. Even if nothing was up and he just had some politician friends. They're human rats, they'd flee not pull strings to help. So what the fuck is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My boss wouldn't get a NYT article espousing his innocence, why is this guy. Who the fuck managed to get the cops to actually move for at best a "cyber crime" of slander.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you'll kill the Prez and you might get a Secret Service member stop by to politely explain why you shouldn't be saying stuff like that. It happens, and they're surprisingly nice about it when it gets reported. But for at best slander, this pizza guy gets the whole fucking US upper echelons moving in days? They normally wouldn't have even got a memo between departments.

       So if literally anyone/anything is accused of doing something shady, regardless of any evidence or lack of evidence, it's proof of a coverup if people speak out against it? What if the pizzagate accusations aren't real and other people are just trying to tell you that and to stop harassing people

       I agree with you. Just why is it the NYT first, not the usual months/years long endeavor it takes for any normal or famous person. Why does some little pizza joint get the NYT defending him, but Michael Jackson didn't get any defense, but a witch hunt. On really shady heresay evidence too. This is no difference, but the King of Pop can't get what this nobody got.

       Well part of Michael Jackson's was that he had actual (supposed) victims. Pizzagate is just "they must be doing this" even though there isn't anyone who claimed/heard/saw any victimization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the internet and social media are bigger, these things can enter into mainstream conversations more quickly and easily. So why not tell people that something probably untrue is probably untrue. I personally see no issue with the media having a small rally against fake &amp; false news.

       This. In the videos where the comet pizza owner is interviewed and giving a tour, he's asked why he started a pizza joint. He said that's all he was good at. So he emphasized his apparent smallness. He's just a regular dude that opened a pizza joint... that gets defended by the NYT and Washington Post and Snopes and has Twitter, FB, YouTube, and Reddit all pulling content that makes this poor guy look bad. He's just a poor pizza shop owner trying to serve his customers god food and make it fun for the family. Awe shucks.

       Yup. And the way to have all bases covered is to hide the real conspiracy within a fake conspiracy and then cover that fake conspiracy up. Then we also fool the critical thinkers. Not saying I suspect that to be the case with Pizzagate but these two are events that may be examples of that:

       im not even a big conspiracy dude, and I started following on day 2 just after the election.. I honestly feel super confident that some degree of shadyness is ongoing, and the reaction we have seen in the last week only confirms that we've hit a nerve... then once you start looking more into similar cases reported in the last 20 years the correlations, the people, the way its been suppressed is all almost identical.. as far as Im concerned the only reason it hasnt been fully suppressed at this point, or has managed to gain so much traction is compared to previous reveals is due to the emergence of the internet as we know it, and its gone viral.

       I've seen to convert a mainstream audience to the reality of Pizzagate. I used it to convert many. Pizzagate is a very powerful gateway meme, because everyone cares about children. (except people on r/ Drama
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/5eqequ/uspez_did_us_a_huge_favor_and_nobody_noticed/">
        apparently
       </a>
       ). It was the top post on r/ Pizzagate at time of shutdown. Edit: haha I just got banned from Drama for perfectly friendly comments. My first ban ever on reddit, an important milestone.

       I hear your skepticism. With no victims directly or indirectly linked to pizzagate it's tough to get an official investigation going. Circumstantial evidence is really strong to get the ball rolling if there's a crime committed, but until then the majority of brainwashed masses accuse everyone of tinfoiling.

       I am not convinced either way, but because they took on the subject and are making claims that pizzagate is all false, the onus is now on those MSM news outlets to prove it's false, with real proof, like the real journalists they claim to be.

      <p>
       It's basically impossible to prove a negative, we're the ones making a claim and it is our job to put forward evidence supporting that claim. They could try to shut down our evidence to make our arguments fall apart, but they won't bring up actual evidence involved in order to explain it away because that would just give a bigger spotlight to the suspicious connections we've all seen. And there's no way they could explain it all away without saying "Well, it's clearly a code, but we just don't know what it's a code for," and they wouldn't want to admit wrongdoing of any kind.

       This is their headline: "Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria as Nest of Child-Trafficking"
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your your statement that a theory needs to be proven before it should be believed and that it is on the supporters of the theory to provide credible proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with the title of the article they are claiming that all of pizzagate is fake, but the majority of the story is about how it affects his business and employees. At no point do they write what part they know is fake, or disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can say that a theory is not backed by (police) evidence for example, but you can't dismiss a theory as being fake unless you have proof that it is fake. That's the distinction I was trying to point out.

       I agree that the onus is always on the accuser. I've said exactly that. The NYT is making a claim that pizzagate is false. It could have used words like; unsubstantiated, internet rumor, theory not backed by police evidence, unproven speculation...or any other terms that imply doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by using the word 'FAKE', they are making a statement of fact. It is not an ambiguous word. Can they prove that fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have made an accusation that something is fake, and in doing so they have now become an accuser. They should have evidence to back up the claim they have made.
      </p>
      <p>
       It being the NYT, I hold them to a high standard on using the proper words.

       In your scenario there are only two parties. You the accuser,  and me the accused. You still need burden of proof.
However, a third party, the NYT now writes a piece called Mr. Bargles is a Liar. But the entire article describes how your claim has affected my life, but no where do they say how or why they know you are lying.
If they want to title a piece calling you a liar, then they should provide evidence backing up that claim. Otherwise they should not have used that word.

       The term fake news has a specific meaning lately because people have created lots of it with zero evidence to drive ad traffic.  If the NYT needs to treat each of these stories with respect of "doesn't seem supported by evidence this far", it just emboldens the crazies to continue the witch hunt.  All stories don't deserve the same treatment.

       Ahhhhhh,  but read the OP again. You see that dismissing the matter by calling it fake actually encourages certain people to continue. Isnt that the point of this thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, not all stories deserve the same treatment, and yes, a lot of stuff on the internet is exaggerated or made up to garner views. But if a large outlet like the NYT is to take on a story then it should treat it properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will believe pizzagate allegations no matter what, some people won't ever believe. Dismissing the claims off hand by calling pizzagate fake does not help get anyone to the truth however.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, it's not up to the newspaper to provide proof. We will have to wait for proper police investigations on the matter. But don't go calling something fake unless you know its fake.

       The point of the story wasn't to give a detailed reporting on the truth of the story.  It started with a premise that the story was false, and was really about the scary consequences to normal people working at a pizza shop when the online witchhunt brigade goes too far.

       I take exception to "naive" and "clueless".
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's far fetched. Because it's difficult to emotionally invest in a theory that, like many others, may eventually fall apart. PsyOps are real, it's hard to know sometimes. And quite frankly, it seemed too good to be true.

       In general or specifically? The former should be pretty easy to find on your own, the
       <del>
        former
       </del>
       latter is an extrapolation of what we've seen in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it this way, if you were charged with protecting a real pedophile wing, what better way to do so than by propping up and feeding a story about a fake one. You get a whole bunch of people emotionally invested in the fake story, and spreading the information about it far and wide. Then you "disprove" it, or merely disprove certain aspects of it. Then next time, when people discover an actual pedophile ring, others are much less apt to believe it. "Oh yeah, just like pizzagate, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is the case, but it's a possibility that can't be discounted.

       Ahh gotcha, all of this info is disturbing and can't be over looked.  I mean I was distraught when the movie Spotlight showed all the cases of child molestation at the end of he film.

       It's hard to say, but there are a number of theories, ranging from them actually believing that doing so grants some power in a magickal sense, to children's blood having rejuvenating potential in a scientific sense, to it simply being a natural predilection they have, to power over children being concomitant with desiring power in a political sense, to it being used as a blackmail token in order to induct these people into higher positions of power. I think it's likely a combination of these things, though the last one seems fairly compelling to me.

       Thanks for the insight.  The occult and magick is fascinating.  It would appear there people are apart of the left hand path.  Using magick for their desires and power.

       Yeah, I'm gonna do more research on it.  I use stuff like gratitude and visualization to manifest shit or make my mind anytime with what I want.  But that is more right hand path stuff in occult.

       The MSM is one long-term continual psy-op. Operation Mockingbird, 9/11 (the one day where the laws of classical physics did not hold apparently), yellowcake ("fixing facts . . .

       Exactly, I haven't seen a more orchestrated misinformation campaign on any conspiracy theory to date..just saw NYT run a story about "how pedophilia is a disorder, not a crime". In combination with that, the Biden bro memes starting the same day, and the MSM desperate attempts at soapboxing about fake news makes me lean towards something is very real about that story

       Your statement lost me after you couldn't understand why you, a redditor from [insert where you're from], would ignore the fact that the White House doesn't allow food from outside to enter into it - making the pizza/hotdogs comment entirely awkward and inappropriate in this context if taken literally.

       Strange, mothers are told that if they 'suspect' [not know, not 'have evidence] to err on the side of caution. Yet when something strikes most people around the world as seriously dodgy, when jokes are made about selling children, by people with sexually orientated names we are supposed to shrug our shoulders and say 'meh'?
All we want is someone to investigate and let us know that nothing bad is happening, but nobody is actually even looking into it. It's akin to tell a mother to eff off and not to worry, even if she has a strong suspicion.
We don't want anything more than someone to take a good, hard LOOK, so we can all sleep easier. Why is that not granted after everything out there that is at best done by really tasteless people, that should be exposed for what they are and at worst by paedos?

       Can you trust those that look? Here in Britain a lot of judges and heads of police have been involved in paedo rings. 
However,  I trust that there are decent police people out there that once they had a look would let us know, then we could all sleep better, knowing we did our best to protect children.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to it, you always err on the side of caution and never just dismiss it. I would happily know that all this is just oddballs [who know paedos and like half naked children as art] rather than people who harm children.
Wouldn't you???

        I do hope real, unquestionable, substantial evidence is dug up and put these alleged pedos to justice. Up to this point, though, it sure seems like a long shot.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well yeah.  Of course.  It’s certainly a hell of a long shot that these pedos will get brought to justice (on this plane of existence anyway), but it’s NOT out of any stretch of the imagination whatsoever to logically assess THAT THEY’RE FUCKING PEDOS in the first place.

       And
       <em>
        that

       is the big contention here and immediate criticism with your previous response.  You called the substantial mountain of circumstantial evidence continuing to build up “flimsy” when the fact is that it’s anything but.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s disturbingly strong, actually.  And it’s continuing to mount.

       That doesn't mean you have the right password though. Look up 'hidden truecrypt volume', same concept. One password gives you a dummy file, another password gives you the actual file. All of the downloaded files were the same menu file, meaning there was another passwird that gave you an alternate download.

       Yeah, but one level deeper, all speculation here, but lets say there is a mountain of evidence for organized pedocracy (and there is) wouldn't it be easy to send out an easily disprovable fake allegation, get truth seeking folks all flamed up about it, then easily disprove the fake allegations in public in the mainstream and then whenever future evidence leaks that actually is provable the mainstream regular Joes will write it off because that one time there was a crazy witch hunt about these things. The whole thing stemmed from one 8chan post about pizza code words and is all built on circumstance and jumping to conclusions. It really reeks of disinfo and was probably spooled up by internet agent provocateurs.  I think the whole pizzagate thing is a red herring to discredit any future leaks when there is actual smoking gun evidence.  Even here, the old stickied side bar post hasn't been mentioned at all from what I've seen, even though its super, super relevant to this whole subject.   (

       I think you are right. The elite have been afraid of the internet because it has the power to unite ppl. I think they ran some think tanks and found how to use the power of the internet to their advantage. Just as in the old days the Romans would cause fires and destruction then theyd say it was the enemy and offer solutions. Now they are just starting fires online and pronounce bs to throw everyone off.

       One easy thing to investigate are the victims. As you saw from the Houston, the Franklin, the Dutroux and Casa Pia scandals, the victims do either talk or are murdered. 
E.g. in Houston the number was 500 dead boys per year. Lots of boys started talking in secret - not to the press of course. These numbers cannot be covered up.

       I'm amazed at how people automatically shut it down and call you an idiot for even suggesting something weird could be going on. We don't have definitive proof, but when you look at all the things going on it seems pretty fucking weird. Is it really that crazy of an idea that some rich and influential people could be part of a pedo ring? It seems like to a lot of people think that's impossible, which is pretty concerning.

       Makes me wonder who these people hang round with to not think the comments on their instagrams and they fact they are linked to high powered people with links to childrens charities, sex trafficking cases etc wasn't really fucking weird. You are who you hang with like trees are to leaves. I don't hang round with convicted paedos or the friends. of them

       What is the Streisand affect. Which is what I love and hate about how life is now. Social media is a double edged sword that no one knows how to wield porperly, wether it is good, ill or for lulz, it is there forever stained how the "public" views it. This election proved it. We never have been this connected this quickly. this rabbit whole still doesn't have an end to it I can see.

       This is why we have climate change deniers and flat earthers.  To people who have absolutely no interest in evaluating the evidence and a deep distrust of absolutely all authority, anything can be a conspiracy.

       Saw people arguing in the thread about the guy who wrote the fake news articles saying, "Yeah but just because he made it up, does that REALLY mean it didn't happen?"  Like, even when they have irrefutable proof that something is totally bullshit, they are still so blindly convinced that they are being lied to that they refuse to accept it.

       It is because the people running our government really are a bunch of pedophiles - and they are absolutely terrified of being publicly exposed.

       Once you put everything through that filter it all makes perfect sense. But of course then you have to get over the idea that people you thought were trusted TV personalities are actually covering up for a lot of horrible crimes including the rape and murder of children.

       These were baby pictures posted on social media by the parents themselves.  Fairly certain they are then part of the public domain.  Which is why they were so openly used on reddit, and the obvious ties to pedophilia were daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think it is interesting most pictures cover the faces of the adults, but none of the children?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in regard to MSM and practically everybody trying to censor the investigation which was just a bunch of BS anyway right?  So much BS that NYT literally wrote a fucking article trying to disprove it, but wait, disprove what?

        everybody

       puts pictures of their children on social media. In addition, everybody would gladly come to your house and shit in your mouth if you posted their baby photos on a child porn conspiracy page.

       From reading through your posts I can see that you're intelligent, but not as much as you'd like to think. I'd assume that you have a rather small circle jerk so your logic models have a rather short life span. No offence taken ;)

       You make a good point. Even though there is legitimate reason to investigate, the online sleuths have totally rooted the investigation by dumping any and all material they found online without reasonable redaction such as say, blanking out a childs face before posting photos of it online alongside accusations of crimes.

       I agree. It felt like a feeding frenzy with no regard for victims' privacy, just people who wanted Hillary to go down as hard as possible trying to uncover the truth at any cost. It wasn't pretty. But I do think the pizza-pedophilia is real.

       I haven't seen any legitimate reasons to investigate.  Awkwardly describing a handkerchief? These people are nerds who travel the world talking to non-native English-speakers every day. It isn't surprising that they might pick up some idiosyncratic speech patterns. That doesn't begin to justify a witch hunt. As a person who himself uses weird phrases when talking to friends, I find the whole idea frightening and disgusting.

       What if they play dominoes together? What if they play dominoes together on a kitchen table? What if they play so often, they have running jokes about when they play better, like if they have to set the dominoes on top of things, and they get superstitious?

       You're talking about people's personal emails about their personal lives. These aren't business settings. There's no expectation or need for uniformity or formality. You have thousands and thousands of these, you've found less than a dozen that are idiosyncratic, and you think that proves something??? I guaranty I could find ten emails in your history that are more convincing that you are a secret vampire than this bullshit leads to global illuminati pedophilia.
      </p>

       Also, did you not see how much Subway Jared paid to fuck children? Like $100. And he's a celebrity. Rich people don't need global charities and private jets to fuck kids. Go to vice.com, there are kids all over America just waiting to be fucked at affordable prices.

       Actually, I found seven comments in the first three pages of your reddit comment history strongly suggesting that you are a wight, an undead creature very similar to a vampire.
      </p>
      <p>
       How else do you explain comments like this?:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        DIE there are to many humans and that is why there getting displaced
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Once you understand that wights are not native English speakers and make frequent spelling errors, the rest follows quite reasonably.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ill eat one whit u but mine,s made out of chocolate
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sentence doesn't make sense in any context. However, a search of 4chan shows that "chocolate" is another word for black person. It becomes clear that you and another "whit" are planning to devour your victims, but yours is a black person.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there is no problem whit a different opinion at all.
I am not mad at u for example ;).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one doesn't make sense in any context. It must be code.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a its not all lie,s.
I am not from the usa.
Its a lot of tong twisting and manipulation.
But its not all lie,s.
Same whit RT there kind off propaganda but there is real news on there to
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one makes reference again to how wights are not native to America and are not English speakers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        i wonder witch is more corrupt the west * inc the usa *
Or the middle east.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also make several references to witches.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hfull of nyt Washington post and so on site,s claiming its fake and a witch hunt
       </p>

      <p>
       This next one doesn't make sense at all. It has to be code for the undead and undead activities.

       So what do you think all of those discussions about houses and realtors are? Did that actually happen, or was that all a fiction to mask the pedophilia code? Are these people pedopimps who pretend to lead normal lives, or are they ordinary people who traffic children on the side?
      </p>
      <p>
       If these emails are fabricated to cover up the code, can you poke holes in it? If you went to a site like Trulia, would you find every house they described on the market? And would those houses have every feature they described? And if it's the case that every house and every room is exactly as they say it is, then doesn't there reach a point where they probably are just talking about a handkerchief that everyone is too busy to bother with?

       That is besides the point. My response was to your statement that there was no context in the Podesta emails and that is provably false.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are free to interpret the context however you like. While I have Pizzagate sympathies, I'm not convinced enough to argue one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my honest opinion, people trying to rationalize all the emails are trying to see something/pigeonhole a narrative just as much as those who see a pedophile child sex ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I am 90% convinced of is that Podesta is talking in code and I am 66% convinced that it is probably something illegal.

       So, do you believe anything should be done at this point? Because any kind of investigation would be hugely antithetical to the Bill of Rights at this point. I can understand why Constitutional concerns might not stop someone who genuinely thinks children are being harmed, but if all that you know is that someone is speaking in code on their private emails, don't you think they should be left alone?

       I am one of the most credulous people you will find. I have been combing through pizzagate materials just trying to find something vaguely sinister, that might possibly reference a double meaning or code or something.

       But all I see are parents talking about their own children and weird internet sleuths implying that they are pedophiles.  I mean, Jesus Christ, do you people never pepper your casual conversation with irony? Entertainment doesn't have to mean skull-fucking, it might mean a playing in a pool.

       Really? So Laura Silsby attempting to traffic 40 children out of Haiti is not suspicious in any way? Even after she was caught the first time she was then arrested for trying to traffic an additional 33 kids out in a bus! The kids had parents and yet she was trying to take them out of the country? And when Laura gets caught who comes to her aid? None other than Hillary Clinton. Not just that but there's a load of Wikileaks E-mails where they discuss this Laura Silsby woman.

       That makes sense if the public were aware of such a thing in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better question is why would an employee take such a risque photo
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       tag his place of employment? This alone would be national watercooler news, and warrant a visit by the Department of Health.

       Another example is the barman uploading a drawn picture of a couple 69'ing on a slice of pizza with an invitation to 'come visit'.  In any sane world these two employees would be fired on the spot.  Two sexually suggestive pictures posted by two different employees with invitations to 'cum/come over' is too coincidental for them to be considered isolated incidents by batshit crazy employees begging to be fired.

       It seems that one of the employees, Josh, uploaded at least one other sexual picture, the one with a penis masturbating pizza slices, along with the invitation to 'come visit'.  Either this guy is just really good at not getting fired, or he just makes the best damn pizzas. I say give the boy/man a raise.

       Ill boop ya head is something you playfully say to a toddler.  Baby talk coming from an adult towards other adults?  Why would anyone without a sick mind do this?  Child play and family fun go hand in hand within the pedophile lexicon.  Are you involved in grooming of toddlers for child torture and rape?  You ARE suspicious and MUST be investigated.

       podestas child abuse art gallery and serial killer victim sculpture, ties to clinton, ties to comet pizza, friendship with epstein and other pedos convicted, the police sketches of the little girl kidnapping case, the instagram of the pizza place, the heavy breathing singer at a show at comet pizza laughing about babies crying and the manager liking little boys, the restaurants having multiple fbi-recognised pedo haven symbols.. you don't even need the obvious code talk about pizza (over 80 emails related to pizza, over 70 about pasta, mostly in bizarre out of normal context ways) to make a case here. it's blatant as fuck, that's why it has grown so quick

       Everything I have seen about this is grossly out of the ordinary. I don't care if people are satanists, eat cake shaped like a person, have pictures of bound children on their wall, use known paedo pictures in their logos or make jokes about babies that are a little under the beltline, with sexual screen names. I don't even care if they have 'art' on the wall of their establishment that shows clear interest in the occult, I really couldn't care less. However if I was a parent there is no way I'd take my kid to their place, find it OK to joke about 'preferences' [after someone shouting 'boys'] during a [funny] speech. It is all fine and dandy as long as adults doing it in an adult environment. 
The kicker and the worry stems from this being marketed as a FAMILY restaurant, that there are performances by bands whose videos have paedo signs in them and a grown woman, dressed as a child is singing, the band's name is Sex Stains [Planet Pizza's own home band] and who are performing for the whole family after 23:00h. 
You see where I am getting at here? Nobody cares what adults are doing but when they are doing dodgy stuff, I hope nobody expects this to be from a Family orientated place. Which it is. Therefore it's NOT ok. Need investigating as clearly these people are not quite Mary frigging Poppins!

       No, I don't get where you're coming from, man. Is this about running a global cannibal pedophilia conspiracy, or is this about having a potty mouth? You're trying to justify this explosion of outrage, because after all, with this much outrage and this much outrageous evidence, there must be something!!! But look at you, you're calling for one pizza restaurant that you've never been to to be investigated over a band name. You're every retarded person who ever wanted to arrest Ozzy Osbourne.

       It's fine to have a potty mouth but it's unacceptable for a family business. I don't want all those people crucified but I'd like them to be checked out. I don't feel comfortable with jokes about young boys followed by a 'preference' joke being made in a place that is frequented by children. 
Would you hand your money to a bank that 'jokes' about money laundering, stealing and has pictures of known conmen on their wall?

       Do you honestly think the top front page post on reddit for the past week has been about exposing young children to age inappropriate music? These people are delusional. If you don't believe that either pedophilia or cannibalism is  being systematically practiced at that restaurant, don't support them.

       All the banks I've used were serious about their money laundering and customer theft. Those "pictures of known conmen" are the CEOs and the Masters of the Universe, son. We glorify conmen in this civilization, we make them rich.

       Here is my question. So far on the "official news stories" I see online, they claim that pizza gate has officially been debunked. On what basis are there claims for it being false? Simply that the people involved were asked and they said "no that's not true" and nothing more? I i'm not saying that I 100% believe absolutely everything uncovered but after the Franklin cover-up I have been more than open-minded when it comes to these sorts of things being true. So far I just see this being dismissed as just a case of conservatives trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton. That's way too easy for me to believe that pizzagate is completely false. So again am I missing something on official sources for this being factually debunked?

       I didn't believe they are innocent, its just that there were no real evidence to support the claims. Just small, unconnected circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe them to be innocent, I was a neutral party that tended to not believe the full ongoing internet story due to lack of evidence, but what we've seen is an orchestrated and concentrated effort by MSM and social sites to ban, censor and dispute these claims, that is a GIANT RED FLAG!

       Because it doesn't just randomly happen all within a 30 hours time span that twitter, facebook, reddit, NYT, Politico, CNN, etc... all start censoring, banning, editing comments, posting non factual opinions as "fact checks", etc... against pizzagate. When has this ever happened? All these MSM and social sites acting in unison within a 30 hours time frame to censor and ban this story?
      </p>
      <p>
       If people were impartial and not motivated from a coverup angle, then we wouldn't see a concentrated and organized effort to ban, censor and sway the story on this! Not this concentrated, not this organized level!

       I'm saying that before it was improbable that that was the case, now its very probable that it is. You don't see coordinated attacks on an "issue" like that if there is ZERO truth to it, if it was all just silly, unfounded speculation.
      </p>

       What you're doing is called confirmation bias. You have a preconceived notion in your mind that there is nothing to that story, so you're actively trying to reinforce your own beliefs rather than weighing the evidence in an unbiased manner. When you do something like that, it's very easy to convince yourself of anything. 
You even go so far to misunderstand people on purpose. Clearly what he means is that the government is leaning on the media to fight fake news.

       You just trying a little bit to hard to make other people sound ridiculous. Like now, why bring Obama into that? 
It looks like your first aim when answer to a comment is to discredit the other person instead of reasoning. Instead of trying to understand you exaggerate and ridicule.

does it really matter who? Clearly the chef from comet ping pong, who knows podesta, his ex boy friend is a high official and the chef himself is #49 on the gq list of the most influential people in DC makes a call and the media start to pull pizzagate.
Do you wonder why a pizza chef of a cheap pizza place outside DC gets #49 on that list.

       You're completely leaving out politicians donating thousands of dollars to the pizza shop. That is what did it for me. I was like ok yeah Podesta are creeps hanging artwork of young kids in their house in their underwear. So what art? Yeah Podesta bros are still bff with pedos. FBI releasing Pedo logo documents. Meh coincidence. Jokes in the basement about the owner preferring children caught on video  and his creepy taped up kid pics on Instagram. Meh. But the donations from politicians to keep David Brock's (millionaire) boyfriends half ass half ass basement looking pizza shop open?! Clinton donated a few grand if I'm not wrong. Why is that level and type of money being donated to a pizza shop?! If not pedo ring then somethings else extremely sketchy. Yeah no.

       I did not know that. An other possibility is that the pizza chef just has sexual relationships with a couple of high officials and they just donate out of love. They are just really nice and loving people. All the creepy stuff, the pedo jokes are just bad humour, the art is just art, podesta buys what he thinks is edgy to impress his totally not  pedo friends. The emails are really just about food, and just poorly worded. Written in a hurry. All just a big big coincedence

       I didn't want to go down the pizzagate hole. But you are correct that it could either be taken innocuously or harmfully. When I first saw them talking about pizza gate, I thought they were idiots. Then I checked back a month later and my guard was a little up. The problem is they just have tooooo many Pedo friends.

       Freud Clement, Denny Hastert, Epstein. It's all creepy humor until you have pedo friends I suppose. Who knows.

       That's the thing, you don't have to guess you have to ask. That's all anyone at pizzagate is doing, asking questions. The people that harassed individuals were wrong. Flat out, imo. You don't have to go to the top and question Obama, there are things that don't match the whole way through and people just want to know why. It seems crazy and far reaching at times but the consequences of missing the truth on this one are too terrible to not ask the questions.

       Yep your absolutely right there. Some of the behaviour is completely unnecessary, just stupid. I think a large part of it is legitimate though and you can't get bogged down by people who are taking it to the extremes. Like I said there are questions, some are more complex than others but we just want answers. The fact that some of the simplest things like the question I asked you is a huge problem for me, there's no excuse not to know the basics at least at this point and the officials involved aren't addressing it and the implications of this being true are inconceivable.

       The point of what the person is trying to ask you, about the handkerchief, is to carefully read the email from bottom to top and to pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually brought this point up before, and this specific exchange is what confused me and made me actually think that there might be something to it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, I originally assumed it was a gift perhaps, of maybe a treasure map with pizza on it. But seriously, and I promise you that I'm not trying to be condescending at all because I was thinking the same exact things about it as you, just think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The realtor emails the woman about finding a handkerchief. The only defining details that she gives, at all, is that it's square and black and white. That's it. She doesn't mention pizza, nor does she mention a map. Just the color and shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the woman who received that email, forwards it to Podesta, and says that the realtor found a handkerchief that she "thinks" has a "map" on it that could be "pizza-related".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when I realized that the woman who emailed Podesta described the handkerchief in a totally different way than the realtor, I thought that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       the realtor had given her a phone call perhaps to describe it more. Although to be honest, if the handkerchief had an actual map or pizza on it, she would have described those details rather than saying it's just black and white and square.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if they had spoken, and she was given more details, why would she use words that suggest she isn't sure? Why would she say she "thinks" it has a map and that it could be pizza "related" if she was
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       it had an actual map and/or pizza on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       After seeing artwork of a child being raped on a small piece of cloth, and seeing that DNA from semen or blood left on fabric/scene of the crime has been referred to as a map,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       that, in this case, pizza could absolutely be a code word, it..just made sense that it could be a possibility. And that combined with everything else, it starts to paint a clear picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to explain what they were getting at when they were asking you about that email. Hopefully I explained properly and coherently why it absolutely (in my opinion, and many others) seems off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to explain it to you myself because I also had originally asked the same questions you did before I decided to pay attention to the exact wording used and to what each person in the email actually said.

       No problem. I realized the same odd stuff about that email myself maybe a week or two ago, and it's honestly the thing that convinced me I needed to look deeper and not just assume it's some form of "satanic panic."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately though, there are a lot of people who will just assume it means nothing, without investigating all of the other stuff that makes all of this suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be really frustrating knowing there is something off and having people call you crazy for seeing the lines connecting the dots. All we can do is try to explain and get people to open their eyes so they can look at all of this information honestly and without bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, the right person will realize there's possibly something very wrong, kids could be in danger and not care that people will call them a looney for making sure all of this suspicious stuff is or isn't true.

       I agree the consequences are too dire not to ask the questions, and there are too many oddities for it to be nothing. Eventually podesta and sandler themselves will have to come out and answer these questions otherwise this is never going to do way.

       You said yourself may people are acting like it's 100% confirmed these people are pedos, and it was irritating you how sure they were. You are using as much conjecture as they are going the opposite way. I told you people have questions and if you can't even answer this one simple question you have no right to tell someone else not to ask it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How do you know the woman didn't read that initial email, then speak to the realtor on the phone at a later time where they got more details about the handkerchief?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I actually mentioned this in my post specifically
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       I asked the same question. I already answered that question. Did you read my entire post or just skim it?
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate - (Aside from the fact that we see the email in which this handkerchief was first brought up, which shows us that they hadn't had a conversation about this handkerchief
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the realtor sent her this email and thus realistically
       <em>
        would have
       </em>
       given a proper description with the actual defining details, such as pizza and a map, rather than simply shape and color, in the first email it was brought up.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       the realtor had called this lady after sending her the email describing the handkerchief, with some extra detail (instead of doing that in the first place, as any normal person would have done), the specific words used to describe it to Podesta is the actual
       <em>
        strange
       </em>
       parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the realtor told her it specifically had a map and pizza on it - it seems strange that she would say she THINKS it has a map that is pizza RELATED. If she was told specifically, again, most rational people would instead say something like "the realtor said it had a map and pizza on it." Instead, her language implies she isn't sure. Which wouldn't make a hell of a lot of sense if she had received a call with the specific details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there was an email that happened outside of this email chain (and these emails themselves
       <em>

       </em>
       ) then the same logic would still apply. The point being that the realtor gave a description that never mentioned pizza or map, and even if she had somewhere else before the lady emailed Podesta, the second description uses language that implies doubt or being unsure.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Btw, "map" is NOT actually an official "code word" meaning semen. That has already been debunked as originating from 4chan itself...so we know that whoever created that original image where it brokedown "commonly used code words" was being deceptive
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about any kind of official code words in regards to the term "map", and I'm not going by anything posted on 4chan because I haven't even
       <em>
        seen
       </em>
       whatever image it is that you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the term map in this instance makes
       <em>
        sense
       </em>
       because any kind of bodily fluids containing DNA, left somewhere where a crime occurred, could be used as a sort of map leading to the perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only am I positive that I've heard it used that way at least once on one of those crime shows, but it isn't as if the word map never shows up around DNA, such as genetic mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sitting here saying that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       email is some kind of smoking gun, nor is it even close to being the only "evidence" that there might be something going on here. All I'm saying is that this is why a lot of people found that specific email suspicious and that combined with the multitude of other emails, connections and pictures, it seems even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not saying that these people are definitely guilty. It could be nothing. However, to me, and a lot of other folks, everything combined is enough to at the very least, investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are investigated based on suspicion alone all the time. Unless you're caught red handed, investigators have to dig, make connections and find evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, all of these people are innocent until proven guilty, and they all deserve a fair trial. I don't know they are guilty or innocent. All I believe, and plenty of others believe, is that there is absolutely enough here (not JUST this email) to investigate and look, to make sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There absolutely seems to be something wrong, and I sincerely hope that sooner rather than later, someone with authority will be allowed to investigate this. I don't see how anyone who
       <em>
        honestly
       </em>
       and without bias, can sit down, look at
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of the  available information, and not seriously think that it's very possible a lot of children could be in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do think that a lot of people who are rolling their eyes at this, and hand waving it away, are either automatically assuming that it's all bullshit because the people looking into it are nothing but nutjob conspiracy theorists, or they're not honest to God looking at
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the information available. I'm sure there's a few people who just don't want to believe it, as well as people who never will until an actual authority figure tells them so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, there's nothing I can do about any of those people except try to explain why people find some of this stuff very suspicious, and combined with everything else, downright scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, if I can get even one more person to take an honest look into everything, then hopefully it's worth tons of people calling me crazy.

       So you read the emails from top to bottom correct? I got the first three emails, but what did the ones after those mean? Who were they and why we're they apart of the chain?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so confused why is the real estate agent messaging him about a handkerchief? Was she like having a open house and he had left it there, like it's his fav one, and if she is just a real estate agent how would she know who it belonged too?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it was a pedo thing. Why would again the real estate agent have the hanky and why would a real estate throw a pedo party or whatever (what do you think happened, sex party?) or is it just a guise and she's not a real estate agent.

       The emails are read from bottom to top friend. It looks like they may have had a get together at a rental property perhaps? It is only the last two messages (the top two) that interest me, other people have theories about the whole thread I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the last two messages you can see the realtor emails Susan Sandler about a handkerchief she found, she describes it as a black and white handkerchief, Susan emails JP and describes it as a handkerchief that seems to have a map that might be pizza related. My question is why did the description change so drastically and if it is one of those novelty towels with a map of it all on it or anywhere, why did the real estate agent not use that in her description?

       I agree with the Reddit banning/response given the belief the investigation is without merit; but, I am unsure the media reporting is consistent with their normal behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, their articles read like a propaganda pieces, which again puts into question their motives. It could be a cover-up or psyops of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply not certain that online conspiracy theorists are worth the time reporting about or articles (even anti-pizzagate ones) would be endorsed by the "victims" if everything is as it appears on the surface.

       Our definitions of "everybody" must be quite different. Re: the guy who stormed in there with a gun. The "pizzagate" hypothesis doesn't explain anything. "Pizzagate" is a load of horse manure that only a crazy person would take seriously. Especially considering that the "evidence" that it boasts is manufactured by combining a number of different sources to create it's "proof".
      </p>
      <p>
       The saddest part of it is that there is enough real stuff in the Clinton emails to actually get upset about. It would be more productive and useful to look at that stuff than to create some kind of dangerous conspiracy theory about what it doesn't actually contain.

       Sure. Emails that were between two people you don't know make no sense. MUST be child sex trafficking ring. Ockam's razor. What the fuck is this? An episode of "Ancient Aliens"?

       It makes zero sense that people in the government would use their own emails to coordinate a sex trafficking ring using code that they are well aware the investigative agencies are hip to. They stopped short of spelling out the pay-for-play operation between the DOS and Clinton Foundation but use known shorthand for their sex trafficking deals. Nope.

       Your claim was that the "Pizzagate" scenario explains some odd emails and that it is an " abductive argument". A  point you then you back up and claim there was no evidence or proof. You want to have your pizza and bullshit conspiracy theories too. . . How's that corner? Cozy?

       my claim was that it explains 'shit loads' of things. Weird emails being the only example i could be bothered to offer you. and the only example i needed to refute your idiotic claim that it explains nothing.

       I read spin talk as much as name calling of accusers even though case is sketchy at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more worrying to me is the way the press is speaking about those who could be accused. Like how ridiculous it is for such people are to well known, famous, rich, powerful to be involved in such crimes and if they did such things it would have come out years ago.
      </p>

       Crap.. Like schizoids and other mental issues, paedophiles aren't defined by nationality, ethnicity, class, social standing, ability, intelligence, etc ..
      </p>
      <p>
       As for a powerful person hiding this sickness; well as they say with the more power and influence the easier it is to hide your sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegations of paedophilia in high places has been around since dot. The Cleveland Street scandal and Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and heir to the British throne (as well as Jack the Ripper suspect) is one from last century.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual allegation of J.Edgar Hoover being a homosexual is that he was having sex with boys. What I have read (in my opinion), this account is rejected by msm, not because of the woman who made the allegation was done for perjury in another matter, but because he was Director of F.B.I.. I think that if J.Edgar had been a school janitor who wore dresses, drove to work, had lunch, then dinner, went home with, and then went on holidays with same man, no one would doubted he touched up boys and he'd been given life with out a 2nd thought.

       Further that the powers that be do cover up such cases is proven by Johnny Rotten talking about Jimmy Savile being a pervert 20 years ago while Saville was still at large. If Johnny knew and the interview was censored, then the powers at the BBC also knew and were actively protecting the man.

       unfortunately I think pizza gate is a hoax perpetrated by the CIA and MSM and the NYT and all there secret network evil folks whoever they are. I think that your reaction --- well if NYT writes a horrible but eager defense of comet pizza then pizza gate is true and the conspiracy goes to all depths!! unfortunately I think this is exactly what they want you to think . and in a way ---- that means -- yes they are all in on it and it's horrible depths, but I think the actual clue bundle is nothing short of cat fishing for researchers. ---- somewhere among these liars is a real pedo network, that seems a certainty. but this pizza thing seems like a misdirect how we can root it out. -- ultimately it's probably an effort to weaken our credibility as researchers - to make us less likely to be heard, or even believe ourselves when we get closer to the real thing. but who knows, it's pervy as hell for them to fake such a story -- whoever is doing this needs to be taken out no matter what the truth behind the story is.

       Where do you think you are credible as a researcher? You constantly shitpost and seem to do more to discredit conspiracy than anything else. 
We're not allowed to use the $hill word without being censored and idk if that even fits you, but anyone can see from your post history that your some type of agitator

       The article was published because of the impact it had on the establishment and the people who worked there. My f'ing Instagram profile is dissected in one theory video because I commented on a post made by a friend of mine who works there. I've been receiving a constant stream of messages and comments on my Instagram account from inane conspiracy theorists calling me a pedophile and a Satanist. It's all bullshit but it's had a real impact on people. I had no clue what it was and had no clue why I was getting messages telling me to kill myself because I'm a satanic pedophile until someone sent me a link to the video. My friends and I were cackling watching the video I'm featured in because he tries to tie pictures of Homer simpsons artist's comics and shoe boxes from Unif into his theory. The NYT article illustrates the fake news epidemic that's going on right now and how in some instances it has real consequences (i.e., pizza restaurant employees being harassed by tin-foil hat wearing keyboard warriors).

       Isn't this in direct response to the outcry that Google and Facebook are allowing fake news on the internet? How can people cry out that this is allowed then cry out when it's removed, exclaiming cover-up and free speech violation???

       I wonder why the Pope is advising to stop focus on "scandals and all sorts of human failure", in an effort to not let "tragedy of human suffering and the mystery of evil" to become entertainment. Or did he mean evidence instead of entertainment? Interesting since there is a plethora of evidence showing that #pizzagate and elite pedophilia is a worldwide evil, going back for generations and deeply entrenched in the Catholic Church. There are plenty of allegations and testimony against Pope Francis, especially in years prior to becoming the Pope, regarding pedophilia and sacrifices. No wonder he'd advocate for turning our heads to something else.

       Not really.  It's important to remember pizzagate isn't the start of this pedo ring.  Far from it.  In 1977 the Chicago Tribune ran a cover story outlining the John Wayne Gacy case.  They document that he was a patsy for a large national child trafficking ring.  The lead investigator found 30k index consisting of high profile politicians in Washington.  These index cards were the customer base.  What happened to the cards?  As you see in the article they were turned over to the FBI.  What did the FBI do with those cards?  They lost them.  Here is the link.  To question our credibility any longer implies that you are no fan of history or literacy.

       It's just impossible to take it seriously when it's presented with "and Hillary Clinton is in charge of it all!". It's like a conspiracy theory that starts with "Obama's Muslim caliphate", at this point we've just heard so much hyperbolic bullshit from 4chan folks that it's just another drop in the ocean. If this story is true, thank your frothing anti-Hillary comrades for muddying the waters enough to to obscure it.

       But it's happening, it's documented...Like why is it hard to take seriously?  Why limit your thoughts?  It's been going on for decades, for sure, no doubt.  But pizzagate is impossible?  Who the fuck are you trying to kid?

       I haven't seen any convincing evidence. I'm not closed off the possibility. I just think people want so badly to believe this about Hillary Clinton that they think the evidence is a lot more conclusive than it is. Feel free to change my mind though.

       Start with Gacy and the Franklin Cover Up.  Detailing pedophilia within our government...Who is part of our government?  Hillary most certainly is, any wise and prudent person is going to look into her.  Again, it's not as if this started with pizzagate.  Their emails put us back on the trail.  It's not as if these ring just stopped existing.  People like you, who fight it at every turn, ultimately just need to read for themselves.  That's what I ended up doing and it was eye opening

       I do not see cover-up here.  This is how I would expect someone to react if they think it is not true and it is a witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW from the outside looking in, it really does look like a witch hunt being driven by people with agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why some people are trying to put a stop to it because although today you are targeting a pizza place, they are afraid that tomorrow you might get fabricated evidence from someone with an agenda that leads you to falsely believe that it is their business or family that is involved in something horrific.

       So as the evidence I seen with it first started popping was a picture of a little girl in a field with a hastag of #chocolatecake and that is pedo talk. Look up how pedophiles talk. They have a dictionary learn it. Then start reading they emails and tweeter. Also #chocolatecake had no food just a little girl playing. So maybe just ask why? Do some thinking and research. Now days there is no thinking just being let by the news but no independent thinking.

       100% this. I am totally behind the investigation, but this is more serious from reddit's pov than the Boston bomber situation. If you didn't believe these claims, this looks like a bunch of innocent people being accused of the worst possible crimes with an angry mob of 100s of 1000s howling for their blood. Even if the admins did suspect it could be true, expecting them to allow it to continue shows a lacking of willingness to admit Reddit is a private for-profit company with all that that implies.

       I didn't believe they are innocent, its just that there were no real evidence to support the claims. Just small, unconnected circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe them to be innocent, I was a neutral party that tended to not believe the full ongoing internet story due to lack of evidence, but what we've seen is an orchestrated and concentrated effort by MSM and social sites to ban, censor and dispute these claims, that is a GIANT RED FLAG!

       I agree with the Reddit banning/response given the belief the investigation is without merit; but, I am unsure the media reporting is consistent with their normal behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, their articles read like a propaganda pieces, which again puts into question their motives. It could be a cover-up or psyops of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply not certain that online conspiracy theorists are worth the time reporting about or articles (even anti-pizzagate ones) would be endorsed by the "victims" if everything is as it appears on the surface.

       Strange, mothers are told that if they 'suspect' [not know, not 'have evidence] to err on the side of caution. Yet when something strikes most people around the world as seriously dodgy, when jokes are made about selling children, by people with sexually orientated names we are supposed to shrug our shoulders and say 'meh'?
All we want is someone to investigate and let us know that nothing bad is happening, but nobody is actually even looking into it. It's akin to tell a mother to eff off and not to worry, even if she has a strong suspicion.
We don't want anything more than someone to take a good, hard LOOK, so we can all sleep easier. Why is that not granted after everything out there that is at best done by really tasteless people, that should be exposed for what they are and at worst by paedos?

       It is because the people running our government really are a bunch of pedophiles - and they are absolutely terrified of being publicly exposed.

      <p>
       Once you put everything through that filter it all makes perfect sense. But of course then you have to get over the idea that people you thought were trusted TV personalities are actually covering up for a lot of horrible crimes including the rape and murder of children.

       It does take a big mental step to go through that particular portal, but the facts all support it.
