       Did you mean to address the same set of questions to me? I'll be happy to do the best i can, if so. The graphic details of abuse are difficult though so i'll shy away from that in a public post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I experienced physical, emotional and sexual abuse mostly in the context of ritualistic acts, though non ritualistic physical abuse for whatever reasons occurred too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of my parents were involved as well as extended family members and family friends. I believed at one time my mother was not involved but i've had memories surface of her involvement as well recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was ongoing and repetitive. I believe it began in infancy. I have DID and this makes recovery of memories a slow and harrowing process. Lots of parts that hold their own specific memories and not everyone wants to talk but i've recovered a lot of them in the last 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP maybe deleted their account because speaking up is scary business, and i don't know if they have DID also but many of us do, and some of our parts are much too afraid to talk about these things. The urge to run can get overwhelming sometimes.

       What is the difference between ritualistic and non-ritualistic abuse?  Is the ritualistic nature of the abuse relating to anything satanic in nature? or is it called ritualistic more because it is ongoing and…
      </p>
      <p>
       No.  I just kind of answered the question for myself here.

        Ritual
       </a>
       pretty much
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       means “religious in nature”.  As such, the kinds of religions that advocate child predation and sexual abuse tend to necessarily (if not exclusively) be satanic, service-to-self, and what many would consider “evil”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did your family come from a religious or satanic background?

      <p>
       Do you have an idea as to what the motivation may be behind the condoning of such activity?  I mean…what possible reason can a parent have for not only allowing their own baby/child to be subject to ritual, sexual abuse, but often time
       <em>
        performing
       </em>
       the abuse themselves?  What is the rationale/reason?  Were you ever privy to why they were doing what they were doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because Moloch or whoever says “great things will come to you” if someone engages in such abusive activity to another?
      </p>
      <p>
       Abhorrent as it definitely is, the fact that
       <em>
        so many
       </em>
       people engage in satanic ritual abuse of this sort indicates that it cannot be simply categorized as an act that “only mentally deranged” people do.  Too many otherwise “normal” and completely sane people (if not rich and elite people) have been shown to regularly engage behind closed doors in this activity for anyone to think that “only the deranged” engage in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So wtf is going on?

       Sorry for taking a while. Needed a break from pizzagate stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes,i think even though practitioners might say they follow this or that entity or ideology that doesn't necessarily talk about"Satan"..it's still sums it up because these are dark powers they believe in and it is evil. We can all probably safely call it "the devil".
      </p>
      <p>
       Though my experience was an "enlightenment" cult that you will see shades of in things like Marina Abramavic's "performances", there's nothing enlightening about hurting kids or worshipping death if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My family had been involved for generations- going back centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the idea of torturing kids like this is that in is a process of initiation into a state of empowerment, both for them and supposedly the child because they go through hell and become charged with these demonic powers. Whether you believe those powers exist or not its widely believed that fracturing the spirit and causing DID allow those beings to come in to the soul of the kid. It also, of course, ensures secrecy because you wall off these memories in new dissociative states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since these things are done generationally, its all abused becoming abuser over and over. Rarely someone can break away and its a lifetime of recovery then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was never privy to exact reasons "myself", but i have alters who were and since those have come to a point of feeling some safety from the past, they have shared some of these things. I want to share them with others but its a hard road when most of the world can't accept it even happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that it's not just matter of being "psycho" as a lot of people feel. I don't think after all i've seen that i have a choice about believing in the supernatural. For me its proven. Yes, these powers do apparently give these people success and fame and riches. Not worth it if you ask me though. Even the godlike power they aspire to wouldn't be. I would rather embrace life than death no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot i could say that would be too crazy for this public sphere and many are not even ready to believe it happens but thanks for caring and reading this stuff and being a part of looking into it. That means a lot to people like me.

       I’ll say.  No need to hide or run from Death, but A) don’t
       <em>
        worship
       </em>
       it, and B) if
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       part of whatever you worship also involves hurting other people (to say nothing of
       <del>
        hurting
       </del>
       violating kids), then it seems whatever you’re doing is little more than ignorant and evil.

      <p>
       Are you still involved in it in today?  One would think that the obvious answer would be no, but if your family is that deeply involved, I could see how it would be difficult to get away from it.

        Part of the idea of torturing kids like this is that in is a process of initiation into a state of empowerment, both for them and supposedly the child because they go through hell and become charged with these demonic powers.

      <p>
       People can be charged with POSITIVE powers too, of course.  Demonic powers aren’t the only powers one can have after all.  One can have amazing powers that don’t involve demons or hurting others.

       Even if the philosophy you described is true and valid (and I don’t doubt that it is), I wonder why one would

       This is not just abuse.  It’s planned, systematic, and
       <em>
        generational
       </em>
       abuse that’s condoned on a familial and genealogical scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a type of abuse that seems to go against a level of human nature that one would think is almost evolutionarily
       <em>
        ingrained
       </em>
       in a species - i.e. do not hurt/irreparably damage members of your own species.  These practices you describe seem so utterly foreign to what one needs to do in order to foster a healthy human that one wonders how they ever came to be, much less actually proliferate, in the first place.  It seems like it would almost be evolutionarily impossible for a species to take on this practice since it would literally fracture and ruin the species itself, no?

       No, i am not still involved now. My parents are dead and i moved and am away from all people connected now, not that i ever feel 100% safe but life has improved. I think without having friends who were willing to help and a belief in a God who is about life and not death, i would be stuck still.

       That's what it comes down to. People can choose good over evil and good is stronger than evil, that's why evil does all its deeds in the dark. It's cowardly. That's the choice i've made. I hate the agenda of evil. I hate what it wants for humanity and all the sneaky ways it wants to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When i said "demon", that's how i view these entities now and i think that's an apt description, but they would not call them demons. To them they are the ascended masters, they're minor ancestral deities.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing about human nature is that power is an addiction and if something is seen as a way to power there's really no limit for some as to how far they will go to have it. I don't know if it fits with evolution at all if you look at it from that standpoint alone, but these people also believe that they are literally a different species than average humans. They consider themselves superior, not unlike something reminiscent of Nazi Germany's belief in the Aryan race.

       Sorry i couldn't watch the whole thing. She's a bit hard to understand with her thick accent and the beginning was kind of getting to me a bit. She began talking about sexual abuse and i can at least confirm that's pretty much universal in all of this. It only differs for me in that i am male but yea, this seems to happen to us all regardless of gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe i heard references to her abusers being Catholic clergy. Also pretty common that churches and certain denominations particularly are used for fronts for ths kind of thing. As far as the "normal people" were concerned my family was Catholic but the symbolism and rituals of the church meant something entirely different to "us" than to the mainstream church goers. It's not hard to switch those things around because so much of that was originally pagan to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the same fronting is not uncommon in the Mormon church.

       I'm really sorry you got all the opposition. I would guess it's mostly from a refusal to see that R/A is a thing. If you're like me and blocked out a lot of shit for years, the refusal to see can be understandable. WE don't even want to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i think the thing that can do the most good in undoing that is the completely priceless validation that is empathy when it comes to ritual abuse. All of us survivors suffered seemingly alone. The secrecy is a huge part of what perpetuates it, because the realization that we're NOT alone gives us the motivation to say fuck that. This is not acceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's worded terribly but I'm going to assume you know what I mean, fellow survivor.

       Hold on to your innocence. Hold on to your empathy. It's what made us NOT THEM.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was trafficked and in CP from about age 4 to age 10. Sexually abused by both parents and obviously, lots of other random people.
       </p>
       <p>
        My parents have killed multiple little girls. I know police knew and actively covered it up. I tried to report what I remembered as an adult and was met with harassment and denial.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both parents and some extended family participated in the intentionally traumatic abuse. My dad knows how to call forward certain "alters" with code words. I was given ECT at millitary hospital-like places any time I talked about the ritual abuse.
       </p>

       Oh damn im sorry I deleted my account. Not sure why, but I'm still logged on from my phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I deleted it because I thought I would be in danger. If anyone reading grew up in a cult, yall know what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as I tell myself fairly often, if they were going to kill me, they probably would have by now. I did a lot of risky, sorta dumb, resisting as a kid. Not about to give up how.
      </p>
      <p>
       For REAL, thanks for copying and pasting what I said. It's all true and I would be willing to answer other questions for sure.

       Did you mean to address the same set of questions to me? I'll be happy to do the best i can, if so. The graphic details of abuse are difficult though so i'll shy away from that in a public post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I experienced physical, emotional and sexual abuse mostly in the context of ritualistic acts, though non ritualistic physical abuse for whatever reasons occurred too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of my parents were involved as well as extended family members and family friends. I believed at one time my mother was not involved but i've had memories surface of her involvement as well recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was ongoing and repetitive. I believe it began in infancy. I have DID and this makes recovery of memories a slow and harrowing process. Lots of parts that hold their own specific memories and not everyone wants to talk but i've recovered a lot of them in the last 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP maybe deleted their account because speaking up is scary business, and i don't know if they have DID also but many of us do, and some of our parts are much too afraid to talk about these things. The urge to run can get overwhelming sometimes.
