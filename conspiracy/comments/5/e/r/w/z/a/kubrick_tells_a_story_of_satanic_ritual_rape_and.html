       It is a thousand times better if you see it for yourself and so easy ! 
This is Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut Slow Speed (start two you tube pages, open up two versions of this link, start one version @ 0:00 and start the other version @ 1:30:00. The scenes are stitched together and are meant to be viewed as a whole. Easily the greatest artistic achievement is the history of all art. -----&gt;

         What is Kubrick's Kube ?

       </strong>
       **** We are seeing Kubrick for the very first time ever and he is revealing through coding a paradigm change in history, ethics, religion, and society. *
       <strong>
        <em>
         Kubrick secretly hid an instruction for us to RE CUT his film Eyes Wide Shut, and when you do and you play both movies at the same time, he tells us what it was he could not reveal by words alone
        </em>
       </strong>
       **... about the existence of everything that we are now learning about in PizzaGate and more, Kubrick was revealing through a very coy code which has never been used before in the history of meaning transference: he actually edited the film so that when they are viewed together they offer to each the spliced scenes, stitched like no other, the complete understanding that he was trying to convey. Actors appear next to the characters whose masks they don in similar scenes, their actions and spirit becomes recognizable. The story unfolds and reveals the nature of SATANISM in the world. The very heart of darkness indeed.

       Kubrick tells a story of Satanic Ritual Rape and Murder      article 3
      </p>
      <p>
       Full Metal Jacket saw Stanley Kubrick treat the silent issue of gang rape and murder set in a story line of Vietnam, but was he really even telling a story about Vietnam or was he saying that "Rape/Murder is a real Vietnam for all of these woman that are being raped and slaughtered in the occult sex trade market". Clearly Full Metal Jacket deals directly with the rape and murder of woman that they referred to as prostitutes. It was a movie made for those who could see it. Kubrick was putting in front of the elites faces what they were doing to woman, trying to cause them to have a conscience. They have refused and held onto their Satanism. Kubrick decides in last ditch effort to save the world by unmasking the Satanic elites at the head of this sex trade/rape/ritual murder industry that they are a head of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you know that the Shining was about Apollo 11, then the scene where Jacks wife is swinging the bat at him becomes the Illuminati swinging the bat at Kubrick. (WATCH THIS:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtI0uG6tjew">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtI0uG6tjew
       </a>
       )  Kubrick was Jack Torrance and Danny. They were two aspects of his own personality. When his wife finds his manuscript what is really happening is that "the Illuminati find out the true meaning hidden within the movie, which probably happened two decades ago I gather. She holds the bat in her hand looking at him very very deranged, like "how could you do this to us Stanley Kubrick ?" Well he kept his agreement with the government he said virtually nothing at all about Apollo 11 other than Danny actually wearing the the shirt. So technically he said nothing. Metaphorically, is another issue entirely. The story gleamed through use of allegory and metaphor an entirely different story entirely. Rather than being an example of a sociopathic killer who is after his own family is this twisted thriller; yet in reality, Kubrick takes his mask off by his use of Shining us the truth, that is saying what he can not say out right, by metaphor and allegory alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kubrick is walking up the stairs after his wife who has the bat, and Kubrick through Nicholson is instructing his wife who is in this moment the Illuminati, to hit him with the bat, which she finally does and he falls down the stairs. I believe that was his demotion by the Illuminati written as the very point of awakening. Do you understand that this is perhaps one of the greatest moments in cinematographic history ? And nobody even know knows it unless you are in the Illuminati. The Illuminati love the Renaissance period of the enlightenment. This was Kubrick way of enlightening the Illuminati, and his enlightenment to the Illuminati is this: he, Kubrick is smarter than the Illuminati, he, Kubrick, literally outsmarted the Illuminati. Not many people can say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, just a few people could ever claim to have actually outsmarted this SATANIC ruler-ship of enlightened Illuminati. Its a short list really. Mahatma Gandhi, Julian Assange, and Stanley Kubrick head this list. That my friends is the most elite class of individuals our people have ever seen. Kubrick manifesting himself again as his son in the maze has Kubrick having successfully "covered up his tracks" so the Illuminati would never even imagine that he could tell the entire nation that it was he, Stanley Kubrick himself who faked the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. Danny's covering up his footprints in the maze is Kubrick covering up his own tracks. And how did he do it ? We all just "Overlooked" everything, that was Kubrick's joke to the elite. He beat them because they "overlooked" and underestimated Stanley Kubrick.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once you understand that Kubrick is now telling us to cut the film @ 1:30:00, half way through when he tears up a dollar bill and hands it to the taxi driver. The taxi driver is us. He was handing the exact location of the cut to us. And when you make that cut and play two versions of a slow 3:15:56 version of Eyes Wide Shut Kubrick reveals the true meaning of Eyes Wide Shut, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. It is a cannibalistic ritual slaughter of innocents. He is documenting the secret sex slave trade hidden within occult circles so powerful that he could literally not even speak their name of his family probably would have been killed alongside him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nicole Kidman has the single best performance in the history of all actresses. This is the single most powerful dramatization I have ever seen in my life. Taken together, both scenes stitch together Eyes Wide Shut making a cohesive whole not only of this movie, but of all his works and of this very universe itself. Kubrick is saying that we are all in grave danger. That our leaders are Satanists in the league with Gillis de Rais the namesake message Kubrick was trying to further employ by using the word Gillispie. As both scenes playing makes excruciatingly clear, "that's a not a Jazz" means "that's rape, that's murder". Kubrick's choosing to use a real life married couple highlights his message, that this is not just a movie. This is really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sonata = "that's a not a"
like: "that's not sex, that rape"
or: that's not a dream, it's real"
"that's a not a Jazz" when Cruise looks into the face of the woman at the morge whos death he was "responsible" in some way for".
"Sonata". You have to say it fast to get the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistently what we see in this film is a recurring theme of salvation and sacrifice. They are the same thing. This I believe seems to point to an initiatory bargain, implicit within the covenant of Satan, somehow he, Cruise is "responsible for this woman's life". Again, Kidman flashes her ring at the same time as her alternate ego Marianne, the sex slave (MKULTRA Beta Sex Kitten Sex Slave ). This ritualistic sacrifice of an innocent is made implicit by all these references to Satanic Moloch worship. Again, these issues I will cover in the short future, but relate directly to the mirror meaning of Stephen King's Children of the Corn where the two most evil child controller are named Isaac and Malachi. Isaac was the son of Abraham, brought to the mountain to be sacrificed, but was saved by a sigh from God. Yet, this god that Abraham was sacrificing Isaac to, was it a Judaic/Egyptian based montheistic capital G God, or was it really the pagan small g god ???
      </p>
      <p>
       Malachi similarly, in the Children of the Corn is another representation of Moloch, which we can see that the true meaning of Children of the Corn is that parents are still giving up their own children and other peoples children to the pagan god of Satanism: Moloch. Again we see George Lucas as well tackle the mythological identity of Moloch in his own character "Darth Maul". I have treated this subject at length in Cipher Dios, which is a gnostic interpretation of Star Wars, which I have made free by download through my website
       <a href="http://kheprirising.com/">
        http://kheprirising.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       THE MEANING OF MKULTRA REVEALED THROUGH THE WORKS OF STANLEY KUBRICK
The meaning of MK Ultra is defined by Kubrick in Clockwork Orange to be "moloko milk", something they would drink before a good romping of "Ultra Violence". This is a reference to MK Ultra, a covert CIA based operation. "Moloko" tells the story, this is Moloch. Milk is again a reference to the Canaanite pagan god Moloch whom devotees would sacrifice the own children to. Allen Ginsberg would pen his greatest work, "Howl", railing against the evil of Moloch, an evil he could only hint at. MKULTRA violence plays a prominent role in the works of Stanley Kubrick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could Full Metal Jacket also be talking the tough issues of Satanic based CIA programming MKULTRA Beta Sex Slaves in the occult as he is talking about them in Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. Again, even in the Shining at the very beginning Nicholson remarks yet another cryptic laid meaning: he asks Danny, "do you know about the Donner Party?". Then he says, "they ate people to stay alive". Isn't this as well an reference to the Satanic practice of ritualistic cannibalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that it is. Later in Eyes Wide shut he tackles the issue of Satanic cannibalism once again. One of the chief symbol messages he is trying to transmit through his use of "mirroring meaning" or "shining" is through his mirror of Sonata Cafe and Gillispie's Cafe. See Article 1 for more on that.  The meaning inherent in using the magic of "mirror meanings" or "shining" allows one the ability to stay alive while still keeping their covenant with Satan. The message: "that's Sonata Cafe, that's a Diner", or "that's a not a cafe, its a "die" ner". The truth was revealed on the mirror image of Gillispie's across the street at Rainbow Rentals, it reads "Diner", with a n arrow going down to indicate, the Diner at the end of the Rainbow, a cannibalistic Dinner after the Covenant with Satan, which appears to be part of the covenant itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was Douglas Adams book, "the Restaurant at the End of the Galaxy". Guess what I bet that movie is really about ? That's right. Ritualistic Cannibalism. The meaning of Ishtar as a feminine Satanic deity becomes clear by Kidman's repeatedly saving Cruise, once through a call to avoid him sleeping with Domino the prostitute with aids, and again as Kidman's alter ego, Marianne. Kubrick's true story is just unfolding. Just as we had Overlooked the Overlook Hotel, so did we sleep through Eyes Wide Shut. Now we are AWAKE.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hunch ? The metaphor is made clear made Cruises look into the abyss at the morgue, the girl who would save Cruise with her life. This look is something Kubrick referred to in Full Metal Jacket is the "1000 year stare". Perhaps it is a look at the last 1000 years under a Satanic Ruler ship, since a dynasty was apparently reborn through he royal lineage of John Lackland Plantagenet. Or perhaps this hearkens back to 1314 with the fall of the Knights Templar's coinciding with the earthquake which topple the Lighthouse of Alexandria, a metaphor for the light and wisdom removed from the world, and a new age of Satanism begun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through Kidman, Kubrick again tackles the most difficult task of shedding light on a sex slave/trade business that has its origins not only in the highest echelons of society but in the highest echelons of church and secret societies and mafias across the world. A phenomenon which has come to me known as "PizzaGate".

       Watch Kubrick like you have never seen him before, tell us of what we are now uncovering in Pizzagate nearly 20 years ago. Thanks Stanley. Knowledge is power. He was giving us the slaves a power that we have not known previously. Kubrick has risen from the dead ! to defeat the elite Satanists with giving love and tenacity to detail and determination. Each scene stitches its meaning into the very soul of the work. Easily understood now as the greatest in the history of movie making, and perhaps the very greatest art work of any medium, ever.

       Your praise for Kidman misses her alleged real-life membership in the U.S. military's global Nazi Satanic SS pedo cult.  For starters.  Refer to Fiona Barnett.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hesitate to share this comment.  The subreddit is now at its dumbest in over 2 years.  Taking Barnett at face value is also just a blind buy.  I could invent a new Satanic pedo story, put it on 4chan, claim to be an insider, crosspost it here, and watch it snowball.

       It's laughable the level of ignorance prevalent these days on this sub. These patriots trying to snuff out the bad guys and thinking Trump is gunna help em do it. Fact of the matter is, Podesta or not; this shit ain't going away and the root of it is far more sinister then code words in
       <em>
        leaked
       </em>
       emails, whether Russia had anything to do with it or not. You think because evil has a face and/or name (Rothschild) that the elite can be touched? They can't. They run the show and if they even bother to give a shit about the ramblings of a bunch of racist dweebs we'd be lucky to get much more than a chuckle from them. The only thing that is going to stop this shit is this species annihilation. I believe this shit has weathered global calamity going back 50 thousand years.

       Kubrick was a fucking genius and we know that TPTB would not allow any of his films to be released including Eyes without their thorough inspection. It strengthens their ritual to allow us to see what they really do. I believe Kubrick's ability to hide code in his films that made it past these very censors is what makes him genius. Was The Shining his confession to helping the Govt fake the moon landing? Who knows. I'd say he knew what he was getting into.

       It was Big G God.  LORD Almighty.

       God ordered the Israelites to clear the promised land.  Joshua was unsuccessful, for the people did not listen to God.  Thus the Canaanite pagan god orgy and child sacrifice which still permeates our society today.

       Forget everything you ever read or known about Kubrick's movies and watch them without any presumptions like you were watching them for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this because I have done this recently and it has allowed to interpret his films more clearly and allowed me to form my own thoughts and theories on the films.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with some of the stuff you say but mostly I believe you have stretched the rubber band to the point of breaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kubrick was an artist and like any art can be interpreted many ways. I believe reading all of the theories online can be fun and entertaining, but taken too seriously ruins the films.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, these are just might thoughts. I could be right or I could be wrong, who knows.
