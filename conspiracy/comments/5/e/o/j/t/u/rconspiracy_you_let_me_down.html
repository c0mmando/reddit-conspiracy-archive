       A computer scientist has claimed that the Russians could have hacked into the electronic voting systems of the United States changing the results of the election.  This has spurred Jill Stein to raise $1.5 million in one day to force a recount.  Yet, all you can talk about is pizzagate and the reddit admins changing a few posts.  The one article about the recount just has comments like Hillary lost, deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to you?  When I was a kid we thought that George Washington was replaced by Adam Weishaupt, John Dillinger was actually five people and the reptilians from the planet Nibiru are taking over all mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that the election was rigged, but I certainly expect r/conspiracy to say that it was.  What happened to the New World Order only keeping pennies around to collect samples of your DNA?  What happened to element 115 releasing antimatter to power faster than light travel in UFOs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just got elected!!  This should be a conspiracy theorist's wet dream.  For shame...for shame.

       Pizzagate is a legit political conspiracy but Russians hacking the US election is MSM?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't pizzagate just a false flag to distract you from the fact the Putin installed Trump as US president in order for Russia and the United States to join together and overthrow the UN to install a New World Order?

       Im not saying there not "real shit" im saying that all of this is happening infront of our face. Idk what u were talking about with the pennies but thats not a concern when we have a real problem of suppressed media such as shutting down pizzagate. What you are saying about Trump could be true and we should also focus on that.  But dont put everyone down about pizzagate this is "real shit" and we were finding real evidence that just got deleted by a media company. If this shows us anything its that we are being suppressed and we beed to put a stop to it before every right of ours is suppressed.

       It's probably because a lot of us don't believe the election is anything but a PR stunt. Also, pizza has taken over the sub along with the chans and T_D.

       There is a NO good "side" to defend. Everything is rigged against us by a monolithic system of controllers. Everything we know and everything we think we know is rigged against us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are no longer satisfied with just rigging everything, they must crush our few voices of concern - that's where we are now, at the cross roads of complete chaos and perpetual boot about to stomp on our faces.

       There's bigger issues. Are you telling me you're weren't aware that those electronic voting could be hacked?  And how the fuck does Russia even come into this. You really think it's Russia that would hack the American election?
       <br/>
       Here's the conspiracy with the election machines. It's widespread fraud since Bush was elected the FIRST time, it's criminal bankers and military industrial lobbyists, and a lying fucking executive office torturing people and assassinating civilians with murder drones. Russia is sitting back thinking 'wow... let's not let it get as bad as America, okay comrade?'

       The bigger conspiracy would be that is what the people paid and bought by the Clintons would want to be believed so she gets ushered in as our new president. Think protests are a thing now. Wait until they force the president elect out and put in a crooked criminal.
