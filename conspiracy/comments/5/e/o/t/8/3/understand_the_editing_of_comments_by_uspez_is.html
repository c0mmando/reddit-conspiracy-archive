        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">104</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/BransonOnTheInternet.html">BransonOnTheInternet</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I originally posted this as a comment, but upon further thought I believe that this deserves to be a post all it&#39;s own.  People here, and as a whole, need to understand what we are working against and how far reaching it truly is  A warning though, there is a lot of information here and it&#39;s a lot to process, but in order to gain a full understanding of the scope of this problem one must look at all aspects of it.</p>

<p>This is not about <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> or PizzaGate, though both of those fit into the bigger picture of a much larger whole. This is about the <a href="https://nsa.gov1.info/data/">collection</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/corporations-google-should-not-sell-customer-data">control</a> of massive amounts of data and the subversion and manipulation of the public at large.  This is about numbing people down to the point of acceptance of these types of operations and procedures under the precedent of &quot;fake news, propaganda, conspiracy, etc&quot;.  This is about getting people to the point of thinking that this type of thing is okay, as silencing the few, is accepted as an appropriate step in order to ensure the safety and civility of the general public.  This is about the distribution of services and systems to ensure this control and subversion though the means of controlling any and all narratives, thus controlling the flow and allowance of information.  This is bigger then any one thing and something we should all be concerned about and fighting against.</p>

<p>For more information regarding the Pizzagate situation as well as the issue of editing comments by u/Spez please see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eis9z/the_admin_closure_of_rpizzagate_and_its/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/?limit=500&amp;st=ivvm84v3&amp;sh=f1aa6be1">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5emh5e/leaked_reddit_admin_default_sub_powermods_chatlog/">here</a></p>

<p>With that being said:</p>

<p>Do not kid yourselves, this is not unique to reddit. This is, and has been happening, all over the web for some time now. </p>

<p>Its not overt. They are not mass editing comments or things of that nature generally, its much more covert and subtle. </p>

<p>The difference here is someone, for whatever reason (I imagine will be discussing the true whys of this for some time honestly) , decided to out themselves and their behavior this time. Thus shining a very bright and unavoidable light onto it. </p>

<p>What should scare people is that it may not be frustration that motivated this, as claimed, so much as a complete belief that at this stage in the game it no longer matters if we as users, and the public as a whole, know. And the implications of that are rather terrifying. </p>

<p>The best advice I can give, and which I think all should strive for going forward if you were not already, is don&#39;t be pushed down by this, speak up and keep it public, keep pressure on the nerve and continue digging. At the same time though you have to face the very real reality that you are playing with a deck stacked in the houses favor. They have the upper hand, you must always remember you are playing at a disadvantage. You are not anonymous. Remember everything you are saying is being cataloged and correlated into a collection of data that represents you (think an extremely detailed Facebook page, for lac of a better description,  that the government has access to with every bit off information you&#39;ve ever had online, in your phone, or on your computer) and is being collected and broadened every single day. </p>

<p>The 147 Companies Who Control Everything - Created by three system theorist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich this complicated and descrptive overview shows how the true control of coporations control almost everything radiating out from the middle.  Both an article about such via Forbes and the PDF itself.</p>

<p>Who Controls 90% of the Media in America - An interesting infographic and article from Business Insider detailing how 6 companies control most of the information we receive.</p>

<p>What&#39;s important to remember here is that almost all of these leaks, and information is for the most part years old at this point.  This is what they were, and are still using.  Do not kid yourself there is even more now, and the data collection <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">programs</a> are ever expanding and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/22/ipbill-uk-surveillance-snowden-parliament-approved/">increasing</a> in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files">reach</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/nsa-gchq-targeted-kaspersky/">scope</a>.  More importantly this is not unique to just the government, corporations are engaging in this type of behavior as well, as information is power first and foremost.  Protect yourselves and be ever vigilant even in the face of overwhelming power. </p>

<p>Do not be silenced, do not be ignored, and do not believe the greatest propaganda of all, that you &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;.  </p>

<p>Edit (my own not Reddits ) - for grammar and to add a bit more depth to the overall point of this post/discussion.  </p>

<p>Edit 2: Added a bit more links to more information regarding the overall scope of this problem.  Links regarding NSA, Google collecting of data, Apple, Telecoms, as well as the increase in scope of the collection, specifically within the UK (GCHQ).</p>

<p>Edit 3:  Adding more information for the purposes of documentation and enabling a better understanding of the situation as a whole.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really agree. I think previous control systems being employed failed during the election run up that allowed Trump to get elected. Specifically the &#39;alternative&#39; news sources...Reddit being a big one. The increased attention and controls are simply a backlash of Trump&#39;s success and controllers working to ensure it doesn&#39;t happen again.</p>

<p>Just my opinion.  Love the post with a ton of resources! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did they fail though?  I don&#39;t know the answer myself.  But I can definitely see how they would, and are attempting, to use everything that has happened to their advantage. Especially in regarded to squashing down on &quot;fake news&quot; and getting people okay with the idea of censorship. </p>

<p>These are all things they&#39;ve had to by and large keep in the shadows, but now they are beginning to operate right out in the open, as society is so disillusioned they are buying into it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they intended for Trump to win, but they also knew it ultimately didn&#39;t matter, their systems of control will remain no matter whos in power. They damn well did intend to get the public to this point though. </p>

The guy loves money and women, both very easy for them to manage with him.  They could destroy Trump&#39;s empire and he&#39;d do anything to avoid that.</p>
