    <div class="md"><p>That is what I saw someone say about the video on youtube. However, just review election night in your head. First call was what, Kentucky? Then Indiana I think? There was nothing for the family to be jumping up and down about on election night. Not at ANY time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a few days since I have seen the video but it would be worthwhile to go back and analyze the clothing. Things like Bill&#39;s tie, any jewelry. </p>

<p>It was easy to snw people about this being ON election night, because on that night, no one really saw Clinton. Earlier in the day she had on some kind of brownish plain pantsuit crap. My guess is that on election night, she probably had on something in white. Why? that is the traditional color of Coronation throughout history. Notice she had on white for Dem nomination. Those who realized the historical significance called it her Coronation Outfit. Only someone with extreme powerlust would do something like this. She&#39;s not a normal person.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll never see her Election Night outfit. Maybe she vomited all over it.</p>

<p>Yes I believe you are right. She did well there because Trump made the mistake of playing nice. Then she got KAPOWed in debate #2 where she had on the grandma Tuesday afternoon bingo outfit on. It was a great choice because you could really see that fly crawling on her. It was a fine moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <strong>KNOW</strong> this video was taken way before election night because I remember this video surfacing around then again and I knew I had already seen it weeks prior, but now I can&#39;t find the original anywhere. Can anyone find a copy of this video that was uploaded in October?</p>

<p>EDIT: See clothes from 3rd debate night: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/6otm6z.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/6otm6z.jpg</a></p>

<p>Have to wonder if it was scrubbed for a reason.. unless someone can find the original source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I get one you illuminati/occult experts to help me out with interpreting Chelsea&#39;s hug. I mean, who the fuck clasps their hands behind their mother&#39;s back while giving her a hug? I know we sometimes read too much into thing, but at this point I sorta don&#39;t care, so I want to know - is there is any known precedent for this sort of hug, and does anyone know if there is any meaning or symbolism behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things, first it&#39;s not occult it&#39;s  more of a body language issue. </p>

<p>When you lean in to give someone a staged celebratory hug and you don&#39;t really feel love for that person you won&#39;t embrace fully. So she claspS her own hands to avoid a fully loving embrace. When you do that you don&#39;t express the energy through the sense of touch; it&#39;s sort of like putting a barrier between yourself and the other person.</p>

<p>That should tell you all you need to know about their relationship.</p>

<p>Second, Hitlary may have a bunch of &#39;gear&#39; running down her back and Chelsea knows and doesn&#39;t want to disturb it.</p>
