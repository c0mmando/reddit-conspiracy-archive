       I've seen this multiple times so far with people denouncing pizzagate (dumb mistake means not using burner emails), obviously with no intention to ever actually investigate its claims.

      <p>
       Doublethink isn't some dystopian future, it already exists. Have no doubt that this particular doublethink was deliberately programmed.

      <p>
       If you aren't already aware of the nature of the control system, pizzagate will pry your eyes wide open.

       actually cog dissonance specifically is the mental stress of holding 2 conflicting beliefs, while doublethink is the acceptance of both without mental stress and is much more deeply delusional and i would say rare, where as pretty much everyone experiences cog dissonance all the time. just my interpretation of 1984 but it's been a while since i read it

       Not saying this conspiracy is true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't surprise me if it was true. Sex slavery is not rare by any means. Like drugs there are large sums of money to be made through all kinds of slavery. People don't become powerful by following the rules. At the very least they push the envelope and write the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case compartmentalization and plausible deniability accounts for mistakes of conspirators most of the time. We exist in a world of insulating bureaucracies and loopholes, so long as you can afford the legal services.

       Because everything just connects. He performs luciferian rituals, there's emails connecting him to pedophilia, so it's not too far-fetched that a man who worships lucifer likes to molest little boys.

       Your thinking is why code speech works wonders for criminal behavior.  If you were to hear someone in a depraved poor neighborhood in Baltimore say, "Hey, know where I can find snow white?"  you in your nievity would actually think a grown ass man is looking for a fictional character.  Funny thing is, an undercover cop wouldn't even hesitate to take action over such terms.

       Except your code word is pizza, and it's a pizza shop. If someone walked up to a Disney employee in Disney world and said "So you know where I can find snow white?" You in your paranoia would think this person is looking for drugs? Funny thing is a psychologist wouldn't even hesitate to take actions over such insane leap of logic.

       But your example depends on the context of being in Baltimore in an area where drugs are trafficked. If someone asked me for "snow white" in a different context, it would actually be unreasonable for me to start spreading malicious rumours that they were a drug user. There is no such context here. John Podesta wasn't sending these emails to the president of NAMBLA. He was sending them to his friends. You have zero reason to think he is even aware of some of these alleged alternate meanings for pizza. I certainly wasn't.

       So when the word "chickenlovers" is being used by the owner of comet pizza in reference to a picture of man holding a child, guess we can only reasonably conclude they love the hot wings.  No need to bring up the fact that his previous social media pictures had shown half naked gentlemen and a guy wearing a t-shirt that says "I love children".  Do I need to mention the girl taped  to the table?

       The kid thing is weird. I really don't know what to make of that. But again, that's the most I can say about that. Also, this guy is gay. So I guess it's not so weird to have pictures of half naked men. It's a pretty ugly slur to associate homosexuality with pedophilia.

       You're putting way too much effort into monitoring this thread and not enough effort into investigating the subject at hand.

       I'm not monitoring anything. I made a single comment, then responded to replies. I find this theory interesting, and I'm impressed with the amount of work people seem to put into thinking about it, but I don't see it as anything more than a series of interesting observations. I'm surprised at how sensitive you are to criticism. I think that's a big problem with this sub. Everyone wants to expose the "sheeple" who blindly follow msm or whatever, but people immediately start launching personal attacks against anyone who approaches their grandiose claims with skepticism.

       So when the word "chickenlovers" is being used by the owner of comet pizza in reference to a picture of man holding a child, guess we can only reasonably conclude they love the hot wings.  No need to bring up the fact that his previous social media pictures had shown half naked gentlemen and a guy wearing a t-shirt that says "I love children".  Do I need to mention the girl taped  to the table?
