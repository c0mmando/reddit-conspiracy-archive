<p>Doublethink isn&#39;t some dystopian future, it already exists. Have no doubt that this particular doublethink was deliberately programmed.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t already aware of the nature of the control system, pizzagate will pry your eyes wide open.</p>

<p>The occult pedophile conspiracy has already been confirmed, <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/p/free-ebook-lifting-veil.html">I&#39;ve devoted over 100 pages of writing about most of the big case studies here if anyone is interested</a>, but now for the first time we see how synonymous it is with the political elite of the United States.</p>

<p>Be on the look out for events to push this story out of the mainstream news.</p>

<p>Literally the entire post documents the unnecessary and proven danger of the vaccine and that&#39;s the immediate response. It&#39;s incredible level of double think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually cog dissonance specifically is the mental stress of holding 2 conflicting beliefs, while doublethink is the acceptance of both without mental stress and is much more deeply delusional and i would say rare, where as pretty much everyone experiences cog dissonance all the time. just my interpretation of 1984 but it&#39;s been a while since i read it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying this conspiracy is true or not.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was true. Sex slavery is not rare by any means. Like drugs there are large sums of money to be made through all kinds of slavery. People don&#39;t become powerful by following the rules. At the very least they push the envelope and write the rules. </p>

<p>In either case compartmentalization and plausible deniability accounts for mistakes of conspirators most of the time. We exist in a world of insulating bureaucracies and loopholes, so long as you can afford the legal services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your thinking is why code speech works wonders for criminal behavior.  If you were to hear someone in a depraved poor neighborhood in Baltimore say, &quot;Hey, know where I can find snow white?&quot;  you in your nievity would actually think a grown ass man is looking for a fictional character.  Funny thing is, an undercover cop wouldn&#39;t even hesitate to take action over such terms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except your code word is pizza, and it&#39;s a pizza shop. If someone walked up to a Disney employee in Disney world and said &quot;So you know where I can find snow white?&quot; You in your paranoia would think this person is looking for drugs?

    <div class="md"><p>But your example depends on the context of being in Baltimore in an area where drugs are trafficked. If someone asked me for &quot;snow white&quot; in a different context, it would actually be unreasonable for me to start spreading malicious rumours that they were a drug user. There is no such context here. John Podesta wasn&#39;t sending these emails to the president of NAMBLA. He was sending them to his friends. You have zero reason to think he is even aware of some of these alleged alternate meanings for pizza. I certainly wasn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not monitoring anything. I made a single comment, then responded to replies. I find this theory interesting, and I&#39;m impressed with the amount of work people seem to put into thinking about it, but I don&#39;t see it as anything more than a series of interesting observations. I&#39;m surprised at how sensitive you are to criticism. I think that&#39;s a big problem with this sub. Everyone wants to expose the &quot;sheeple&quot; who blindly follow msm or whatever, but people immediately start launching personal attacks against anyone who approaches their grandiose claims with skepticism.</p>
