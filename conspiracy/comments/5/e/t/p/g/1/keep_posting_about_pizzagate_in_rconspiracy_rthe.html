The only Pizzagate story that could get to the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> frontpage is one showing how Pizzagate &quot;investigators&quot; as crazy neckbeards living out PTSD justice fantasies in relation to their own childhood abuse and trauma. Some kind of story that undermines the credibility of the messengers in Pizzagate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this because you all should know it&#39;s coming. Attacking the messenger is a tried and true strategy. And routinely used because it is effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s naive to think they are not gaming Reddit or other  social media. The Judicial watch FOIA showed Hillary&#39;s state department spent 65,000 on facebook likes. So on Free platforms like Reddit, Twitter, they are probably gaming that shit like crazy. When breaking news happens on these big subs, you definitely see paid action behaviour take place.
 Election time was obvious. Also Reddit is a major news distribution center, something like 70 percent of <del>Americans</del> Reddit users get their news from Reddit. This makes Reddit a valuable platform to control conversations about news and how we digest that news.</p>

<p>Edit: after a closer look it appears it was removed. There is no response about why, but when i scroll through the new posts it is not there. It does have a <strong>ABD</strong> on the end of the title when I goto it through my profile.</p>

<p>Hold up --- we&#39;re in a democracy that relies on information to be passed to the population</p>

<p>aren&#39;t you saying we should only read favorable stories of Trumps picks or the press should not have access to Trumps transition teams?  </p>

<p>First, we are not a democracy-- we are a federal presidential republic.</p>

<p>Second, stories of the transition team are full to the brim with several unsubstantiated accusations. For example, I saw several articles stating that Steve Bannon, the guy that worked for a news org founded by a Jew intended to be pro-Israel was antisemitic. The angle at which the articles are written is most definitely the same anti-Trump bias we saw through the election. CTR and the r/politics board is working hard to keep their front page anti-Trump while masquerading as a neutral politically related news source. THAT is what I have a problem with and I am in no way suggesting that we should only read about the cabinet and transition team picks through a positive lens.</p>

<p>There are no &quot;good&quot; people in American politics. Even Bernie, who I supported in this shitshow, supported the imperialism of the US government, and the mass murder that comes with it.</p>

<p>I not fucking stupid enough to believe that it would be any better under Clinton because the human species is really not going to be in control of events as the planet cooks thanks to our species endless fucking hubris.</p>

<p>But yeah, it really gets under my craw that I have to pick some side and become a moralizing twat because most humans are too stupid or too scared to see through obvious fucking propaganda. </p>

<p>It&#39;s shill country because any contrary opinion to expected narrative is immediately stamped out. You know, like Bill Clinton is a rapist, or that HRC sold out the country through the Clinton Foundation.

<p>The sucker is gonna pop regardless of who is in charge. We all fall down. My suggestion, and this is real, is take that hatred and channel it into making your life and your community more resilient for what may come. Hatred is a waste of energy and time. I spent the Bush years filled with hatred at a fucking buffoon. Don&#39;t waste your time doing that with Trump. We, as a species, are running out of time, and our options for leaders are out of touch and exist in another reality completely. At some point, the federal government will hit the wall of complexity (if it hasn&#39;t already) that befuddles bureaucracy in dying regimes. And their power will be impotent in many ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally, Seaman has been on this and I commend him. Right or wrong, this is THE most sensitive topic one can talk about and he took a big old chance really getting in on it. MSM  will not touch this till the arrests start. On some forums if you even mention this (or things like it), they just delete it. </p>

<p>Do you have any feelings for how big this can be and right when Trump gets in? I mean how will they quash this? And if people go down, we are talking Podesta, Elites, Clintons, etc. i can&#39;t think of a bigger even in our recorded history. If it takes down a lot like we think it can, this would be the 3rd WW so to speak, because it removes the freaks doing all the killing and sadistic stuff. At least that is my feeling here. Tip of a big old sick iceberg.</p>

<p>So, you trust the FBI? The leadership? </p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m being cynical, but I wouldn&#39;t count on supposedly good people in the FBI. I&#39;m sure they exist, but the leaders will strike down any attempt at an investigation -- if those very leaders themselves are implicated directly, or risk being brought down (or killed) if the house of card falls. And they do risk that, obviously. </p>

<p>Edit: after a closer look it appears it was removed. There is no response about why, but when i scroll through the new posts it is not there. It does have a <strong>ABD</strong> on the end of the title when I goto it through my profile.</p>

<p>Edit:2 I guess ABD means Administrative banned Domain. Guess the site is banned for some reason.</p>
