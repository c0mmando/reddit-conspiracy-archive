    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about a lack of evidence. Lack of evidence is a main staple of human interaction on the internet. </p>

<p>The problem here is doxxing, plain and simple. The academic, political, scientific, and business world has all recognized that doxxing is harassment and has negative consequences. As such, it is tolerated about as much as any other form of harassment is. The reason conspiracy theorists get bad reputations is that they believe it isn&#39;t harassment, or they believe it&#39;s a tolerable amount of harassment because the ends justify the means. </p>

<p>That is where they are really out of touch with reality. </p>

<p>Edit: judge for yourself. Here&#39;s the Instagram account.

    <div class="md"><p>There is undeniably something sketchy with those emails, and I say that with a passionate rage for how much T_D has hurt Reddit. I think the sub should be banned or get some mods who aren&#39;t total assholes. But just because people I can&#39;t stand, who often can&#39;t communicate any sort of effective argument, doesn&#39;t mean literally everything they come across is wrong. This should be looked into, but this. is. not. the. way. Innocent until proven guilty. Remember that video on Ad Hominem that half of Reddit watched a few weeks ago? Well, this is a great example. To deny completely the idea that something is happening based on the fact that supporters of the theory are mostly nutters is Ad Hominem by association, and it&#39;s irrational. The people of pushing this conspiracy got their own sub banned for not following TOS, and that&#39;s what should have happened. But it doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t be looking into this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homie, what&#39;s your point? Your comments are full of you acting condescending. What do you want to prove? I&#39;m listening. I&#39;d love to think that it&#39;s all innocuous, but some of that terminology and symbolism within a select few of the images you&#39;ve also seen is fairly well known to be pedophile jargon. I&#39;m not making any connections to the band bullshit or the Clintons or Obama. I don&#39;t believe 99% of what I&#39;ve read, but there&#39;s a seed there. So if you care so much that you spend hours and hours arguing about it, do you wanna debunk it? I&#39;m open to a new view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m speaking out against. I&#39;m trying to build bridges. We need to be talking about all of this without calling each other names. I&#39;m not advocating anything related to any political party specifically, but we shouldn&#39;t just shut up either. Your replies seem like the shortest reply a person could think of to discredit me. Why? </p>

<p>Edit: Is there some reading you could recommend on the subject? I&#39;m a skeptic, but that also means I won&#39;t totally reject a premise without good reason. What alternative meaning could some of those words have? There&#39;s the specific pizza map whatever one. The argument that they&#39;re actually talking about food seems weak to me. As for the meaning of the icons and so on, it&#39;s circumstantial at best. But it does paint an interesting picture worth looking at.   Also, please don&#39;t assume I&#39;m some The_Donald shitposter. I voted neither Democrat nor Republican, which is an entire other bag of snakes I don&#39;t want to get into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the subject is personal for you. But jumping to weird conclusions, or supporting those doing the jumping, is not a good way to go about this.</p>

<p>Pizzagate began posting information classically associated with doxxing and with ill intent. There is currently no evidence for any misconduct and only the strange and convoluted allegations brought from these emails.</p>

<p>I see the same emails and I don&#39;t draw the same conclusions. I do not support Pizzagate or their &quot;mission&quot;. I  do support the decision to censor Pizzagate on this private forum. Private meaning that it is not a public resource, it is owned by individuals, and we as users do not have 1st amendment protections for or from it.</p>

<p>But probably what I found most disturbing was the owner&#39;s Instagram account. If you&#39;re going to post an abundance of pictures of children in between sexually explicit material and then make references to pedophelia and sadism in the comments of those pictures you are absolutely opening yourself up to criticism and you can&#39;t be surprised when it affects your business.

<p>The only photo I saw with a kid and sexual innuendo is one at the beach, the sexual innuendo is clearly about the very attractive man in a speedo in the picture. They&#39;re talking about his ass.</p>

<p>Every other photo with sexual innuendo either had no kids, or the innuendo was stretched so thin or completely fabricated as to be humorous. </p>

<p>It is his personal instagram account. Should he have a more professional distance between his business and personal life? Yes. Is it illegal or nefarious? No. Does it imply there is a secret pedophilia ring operating internationally with him as a central figure? No.</p>

<p>THat is simply not true.

<p>Trust me, I&#39;m very skeptical of the pizzagate thing.. But if he&#39;s willing to have this in his office, one can only assume he has some pretty weird shit in his private collection</p>

<p>My problem is I don&#39;t really understand how you make the jump from him having creepy artwork to he&#39;s a cannibal and pedophile. </p>

<p>I have the perfect example. I have a couple records framed in my bedroom (Lennon&#39;s Plastic Ono Band and Pink Floyd&#39;s Animal). One of my dreams is to get a copy of the Beatles &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; - aka <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/The_Beatles_-_Butcher_Cover.jpg">&quot;The Butcher Cover&quot;</a>. As can be seen in the image, it depicts dolls of babies flanked by meat. Why do I want it? Because it&#39;s a cool piece of Beatles history that many people don&#39;t know about. It&#39;s a funny as fuck picture, too. If a picture of Comet guy surfaced with said record framed in his house, it&#39;s cause a huge fucking shitstorm. Not only are the babies (&quot;Children&quot;) naked, but they&#39;re also clearly going to be ate. Thus pedophile cannibal! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s still just artwork. Like the same artwork that has caused &quot;controversy&quot; as long as culture has existed. The same artwork that the Vatican and Hitler supposedly burned. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they are photographs of children having sex being passed around as &quot;artwork.&quot; </p>

<p>These are paintings. Paintings with symbolic meanings to the artist and viewers. Paintings that can be interpreted. Paintings that can be political. You made the mistake of letting someone else do the interpretation for you and now associate it with pedophilia. </p>

<p>Let me give an alternate analysis. If you think it&#39;s absurd that&#39;s fine - because I think your analysis that it&#39;s pedo art is equally absurd. Why can&#39;t the painting represent something about the submission of power and feminism (urgh)? Young women are forced to kneel against &quot;a wall&quot; imposed by society. I mean, it is Washington DC the people we&#39;re talking about are connected to the DNC. The DNC who just ran a candidate on &quot;being the first woman president.&quot; Most of that voter base believe that they lived their childhood in a time when genders weren&#39;t so equal and pushed those barriers. So yeah, not exactly surprised that a symbolic submission of power as young females is a political theme in that base. Since politics is Washington&#39;s culture, it&#39;s also not exactly surprising that women and power pop up in the wealthy&#39;s &quot;taste of the week&quot;. </p>

<p>This whole controversy is even more absurd, because 90% of the questionable artwork doesn&#39;t even have a direct connection to Comet. It&#39;d be like if I went through your Facebook, found some creepy/quirky friends interest, made some &#39;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&#39; jumps to find a questionable link to homosexuality, and posted a comment &quot;proving&quot; that you&#39;re a gay dude. </p>

<p>I am near certain if I saw that picture for the first time totally unbiased I would be absolutely creeped out.</p>

<p>We agree that the picture involves seven young girls with the major theme being submission. Yes your alternate analysis involving deeper meaning is a real possibility, but it seems unreasonable to claim that the &quot;face value&quot; meaning is not also a real possibility.</p>

<p>I should point out wonderful_wonton said &quot;art with children in it is not &#39;pedo art&#39; ... I hope you realize how much perversion is being projected by the people who are persecuting this storyline&quot;.
I argued that it is not so perverted to find this artwork questionable. I provided an example of the art and explained why I thought it seemed like &quot;pedo art&quot; (not the words I would use but that&#39;s how it was originally phrased). I did not say anything about Comet and I did not say anything of the artist&#39;s motivations</p>

<p>Haha oh it definitely is creepy. Surreal/dark etc., </p>

<p>I did look at some of her other shit (<a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/Work.html">http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/Work.html</a> if you&#39;re interested). It&#39;s all pretty equal level of weird - especially the Seven Deadly Sins set. I&#39;ll admit some of them (Mainly her &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; set) are a bit racy especially with children.</p>

<p>But context is what is important. Maybe 3 of her 50 painting have &quot;questionable&quot; or even outright pedophilic themes. You can see which Podesta has <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">from this article</a>. Pretty sure <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/LivingInOblivion/6SynchronizedSwimming.jpg">one is this</a>, <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/HotBed/4Moor.jpg">one is this</a>, and the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fGbKqKL.png">last one</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, the three pictures you&#39;ve linked are not incriminating. I don&#39;t think the art works are an important piece of evidence, just an interesting aside. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in some reading I found <a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/">this summary</a> to be fairly reasonable, although some parts are still too circumstantial for my liking. </p>

<p>The most important parts to me are the &quot;Laura Silsby&quot; part, and the &quot;Epstein Connection&quot; - if these claims are true they are quite damning and not as ambiguous as a lot of the rest.</p>

<p>Although I realise it&#39;s circumstantial I think a lot of the rest is very strange: Jimmycomet&#39;s instagram, the 12 minute monologue video (what the fuck?), and a few specific emails that are very questionable (pool party, hot dog friday, headcount for pizza, did you leave a handkerchief, spirit cooking invitation)</p>

<p>You seem like a reasonable person so I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on each of these. I do admit I enjoy indulging in this fantasy (for lack of a better word) so it&#39;d be good to hear a more critical perspective</p>

<p>Gladly, I&#39;ll start with my history with the conspiracy first. </p>

<p>So the intro I got to the whole conspiracy was the cheese, dominos, and pasta email. I always read the wikileak drop synopsis, so I heard this one in its infancy. The first time I saw the mention of pizza, the emails seemed to be completely coded the first half dozen times I read it pre-censorship. Truth be told, I wasn&#39;t too invested at first - basically thought &quot;well there&#39;s bullshit going on here, but it&#39;ll be swept under the rug so meh.&quot; Then the reddit/twitter ban happened. </p>

<p>After <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned, I turned my skeptic hat on. Honestly, I think Reddit has been pretty reasonable with the content they allow over the years. I&#39;ve been here since Digg died - so I&#39;ve seen my fair share of shitstorms. The only time that I recall mass site-wide blatant censorship = <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> ban (agree with), <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> ban (disagreed with), and the Boston bomber incident (agree with). So naturally, seeing <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> made me a little more invested and I wanted to see if it was an overreach or if it was a &quot;doxing&quot; issue. Note that, I never read shit on the MSM so I&#39;m not corrupted with that bias. When it comes to these issues, I&#39;ve learned to look at just the evidence, make my own conclusions, then compare my notes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Podesta emails</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 5th or 6th time I looked through the Podesta emails, something clicked in my mind when I read the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">&quot;cheese/pasta/dominos&quot;</a> email. This is what triggered my skepticism. When I read it that time, I had a new perspective. Now, I don&#39;t believe the email to be encoded at all. </p>

<p>So to explain my interpretation. Hilariously, I thought about how my parents would go about writing an email to friends. The first important thing is the date. It&#39;s around Christmas. </p>

<p>Next, &quot; shape of the box&quot;. Ignore the whole strategy thing for now. If we take it literally, they&#39;re talking about receiving something in the mail. &quot;instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses&quot; Wait... They received a box of cheese for Christmas. The &quot;strategy&quot; of previous years was a basket of pasta. Hence why the box is different. &quot;I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them&quot; The sender is talking about eating the cheese with their kids/grandkids. </p>

<p>So my perspective of that whole email went from &quot;holy shit, that&#39;s code for PEDOPHILIA&quot; to &quot;oh... someone received a cheese box for Christmas and was expecting pasta&quot;. </p>

<p>But the comment about dominos still stood out. So I searched through other emails and found &quot;Thanks for teaching me the domino game—I’m going to get a set!&quot;. From there I concluded the sender is indeed talking about dominos and making a really dry joke based on the last time they met. I&#39;m guessing last time they ate pizza and played dominos. Now they&#39;re making a joke about eating cheese and playing dominos. Probably is softly suggesting a dominos night. </p>

<p>From there, I went and reread other Podesta emails. They went from seeming like encoded shit to basically old people gatherings. Makes sense to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say the same about the pool party/hot dog friday When I dug into Podesta a bit, he obviously has a passion for cooking (a video about Podesta and his cooking). It seemed to fit what I&#39;d picture Podesta would do with friends/family. He entertains old rich people, basically. </p>

<p>The handkerchief thing was a bit strange and I can see why it tipped a lot of people off. I think it&#39;s important to at emails around that date. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54044">8/25</a> Podesta arriving at HMS&#39; location</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41500">8/27</a> The Podestas met with HMS &amp; SES. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/51820">9/1</a> Domino email from SES</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">9/1-9/4</a> Realtor emails SES about handkerchief email. SES forwards to Podesta. </p>

<p>I&#39;d conclude he really did forget a pizza handkerchief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jimmycomet&#39;s instagram</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Podesta conclusions, I reviewed my &quot;guilty&quot; on Jimmy. I am now 95% certain the guy is completely innocent and is stuck in the middle of a shitstorm. That&#39;s why I think reddit banned <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. He seems to be the target of the pitchforks, with most of the focus on him currently. If you look in my post history, I&#39;ve commented on him a bit today, but I&#39;ll give you a summary. </p>

<p>One problem with the analysis of his instagram is you&#39;re really looking at 2 different categories: stuff posted directly by Jimmy and stuff tagged with Comet Ping Pong (meaning shit that anyone can post if they mark they&#39;re at that location). </p>

<p>First, I believe his instagram is mostly innocent besides a few sexual hashtags here and there. The really fucked up image on first glance was the german baby with a $1200 price tag. With a more skeptical eye, I looked at it and realized it was a doll. Almost all the images of children on HIS page are of the same female child over a 4 year period. Meaning, he either has really good self-control around that snack and hasn&#39;t ate her... or her parents (who regularly like his images - including the tape one) don&#39;t feel he&#39;s a threat. The &quot;I Love L&#39;Enfant&quot; image refers to a cultural center in DC named after Pierre Charles L&#39;Enfant - not quite &quot;I Love Children&quot;. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/10/14/with-la-boum-boum-room-d-c-just-got-a-lot-weirder/">The Buom Buom Room</a> is an event at a bar in L&#39;Enfant Plaza. </p>

<p>The only out-right inappropriate image that I can think of is the full-on nudity at the art museum. </p>

<p>The second category includes the numerous pizza porn images. Those were not posted by him. I can forgive it as restaurant as popular as that gets a lot of guests, you&#39;ll have a crude one from time to time. Also: graffiti in bathroom fits in this category. </p>

<p>Last thing worth a mention are the construction images. Especially after the conclusions I&#39;ve come to elsewhere, I don&#39;t believe them to be anything sinister. Looks like plumbing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Podesta Artwork</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding this one in, but I figure why not make an all-inclusive post. This is owned by Podesta, not Jimmy. Comet Ping Pong doesn&#39;t have any inappropriate art that I&#39;ve seen and it&#39;s often misassociated with Jimmy. Not fair to blame him for his restaurant being vandalized. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 minute monologue video</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t know what that refers to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laura Silsby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t look all that deep into the other conspiracies, because truth be told, I don&#39;t doubt them. That said, I think it&#39;s hard to deny that Silsby kidnapped kids. </p>

<p>So if I conclude that, the next is a connection to Clinton. I&#39;d once again say, Clinton Foundation was at least familiar with Silsby. To be fair, the Clinton Foundation does a lot of shit around the world in suspect countries with widespread corruption. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if they accidentally funded/were involved with child trafficking. That said, I don&#39;t really see the benefit of the Clintons being the ringmasters of child trafficking. So I&#39;d say unintentionally associated yes, complacent, not enough to conclude. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein Connection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some fucked up shit definitely went on there and I don&#39;t even want to know what. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Clintons protected him</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a stubborn conspiracy theorist who is open to damn near any theory, but am difficult to convince. I do my diligence and I feel I&#39;m at the &quot;end of the road&quot; with this one, unless someone can present evidence that&#39;s outside of what I&#39;ve seen. Personally, I think all of the Podesta emails make sense with context. I don&#39;t think Jimmy is running a child solicitation ring. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a pedophile. I&#39;m open to any respectful discussion/related angles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We really do see things differently, I see one girl with glasses/goggles of some sort and no girls with swim caps. Most of the girls have pigtails/ponytails which don&#39;t seem practical for swimming. There is zero evidence about two piece bathing suits, I&#39;m much more inclined to call it underwear. In my mind bikinis are for the beach, swim teams would rarely wear bikinis.</p>

<p>Anyway we can agree to disagree. I&#39;m not arguing that this is proof of anything, but you said it was perverted to see any of this as &quot;pedo art&quot; but that&#39;s truly my first thought when I see the image and I&#39;ve explained my reasons for that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think pedophilia is one of them. Though I do think submission is part of the puzzle, but in a non-sexual way. </p>

<p>I think the context of Washington DC is important in understanding why someone would have that piece or different pieces by that artist. It&#39;s probably a feminist message: young girls are kneeling and facing a wall by society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At it&#39;s very best that can ever be taken within any context within a realm of possibility... your comment is delusional as shit. Not even going into what thoughts I have on the artist because I don&#39;t really have any simple ones (I&#39;m guessing they do this to deal with a personal traumatic incident), but that&#39;s child abuse artwork, as indicated by the scenes of child abuse. The child in the red bathing suit is duct taped by his wrists. Do not be intentionally obtuse. That&#39;s a theme.</p>

<p>No fucking artist on planet earth just rolls out with a child abuse painting as a one off thing and then gets back to work painting normal ass still life shit. This is a thing, you observe people&#39;s art through the context of their other art. This isn&#39;t like, some obfuscation technique or something. People look at Fucking Darwins work through the context of his other work.</p>

<p>Being friends with 5 convicted pedophiles is circumstantial evidence..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Five? Tony Podesta was friends with Hastert but the relationship with Clement Freud was fabricated. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that either of them knew Epstein either. Who are the others?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>connections to others with similar connections suggests a network. Knowing the history and connections of these people to a larger network is telling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everybody is connected to everybody else, literally. National politicians and their associates are connected to thousands of people. An analysis of Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s appointment book concluded that he had more than 22,000 acquaintances. Podesta&#39;s email on wikileaks has email from more than 4,200 email addresses (not all different people, of course).</p>

<p>Mostly they&#39;re connected because they&#39;re Democrats. We shouldn&#39;t forget that this is the reason they were targeted. This is why Podesta&#39;s email was hacked and this is the reason that hundreds of 4chan and The_Donald creeps examined every aspect of their lives that they could find.</p>

<p>The code words were made up on 4chan three weeks ago. Go back and read the emails. They&#39;re talking about <em>food</em>.</p>

<p>The email that&#39;s from is a thank you note for a box of cheeses sent as a Christmas present. He mentions dominos because it&#39;s something they do together (as mentioned in a couple of other emails). It&#39;s a way of connecting.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just trying to write an engaging thank you note instead of a perfunctory one. Instead of &quot;Dear Grandma, thank you for the sweater. It is very warm,&quot; you can write &quot;Dear Grandma, Thank you for the beautiful sweater. It goes well with the shirt you sent me for my birthday. I can wear it the next time we play shuffleboard!&quot; Google &quot;how to write a thank you note&quot;.</p>

<p>In the email chain that&#39;s from, a realtor writes about showing showing rental properties on Martha&#39;s Vineyard to the Sandlers (83 year old Herb and his daughter Susan). Later she writes back &quot;I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the <a href="http://imgur.com/zaqGYB4">kitchen island.</a> Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it. I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.&quot; Susan then forwards the emails to Podesta (who was staying with them) with the message: Ihe realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.&quot; Podesta replies &quot;It&#39;s mine, but not worth worrying about.&quot;</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m trying to figure out how you can spin this as anything sinister. Maps printed on handkerchiefs <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/map_handkerchief">are a real thing</a> and there are <em>tons</em> of pizza-related accessories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=pizza%20accessories">https://www.etsy.com/search?q=pizza%20accessories</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/pizza+bandanas">http://www.zazzle.com/pizza+bandanas</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Are you saying that it&#39;s unlikely that he had such a handkerchief? Why? Would it be more or less likely if she had said it had a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/122351983/ryan-gosling-as-a-slice-of-pepperoni">pizza that seems Gosling-related?</a></p>

<p>If you use the (maximum lulz) pizza code from 4chan, you get &quot;I think it has a SEMEN that seems GIRL-related.&quot; Yeah, that doesn&#39;t make much sense.</p>

<p>If it was such a secret, why did Susan Sandler CC Podesta&#39;s assistant on the email? Why send an email at all?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just someone who saw this thread from the front page, and have never heard of &quot;pizzagate&quot; until just now, but I want to say that the code word of &quot;cheese pizza&quot; has been around FOREVER. I remember back in my more edgy days, 4chan was rampant with assholes in 2009-2013 that would spam cp and they would call it cheese pizza. That term isn&#39;t 3 weeks old.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem, right here. Those aren&#39;t evidence, and those &quot;code words&quot; are what started all this nonsense. The entire &quot;code word&quot; idea came from people reading the email strings - including previous messages - and saying to themselves, &quot;they sure are talking about pizza and cheese a lot while they swap messages about this pizza party they&#39;re having. What could I make up that could turn their pizza party into something nefarious?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I went through this whole album, and I&#39;m even more convinced that this Pizzagate stuff is just crazy bullshit.</p>

<p>Most of the pics are just pizza-related, which makes sense considering it&#39;s a pizza place. The majority of the pictures of kids seem to be of his sister&#39;s kids, which isn&#39;t weird at all, and most of the rest seem to be of <em>other people</em> tagging their kids eating pizza. The weird-ass art stuff can be chalked up by these people being weird-ass art folks, hence a bunch of weird-ass art shit (once again, the majority of which <em>he didn&#39;t even post</em>). Some of them are REALLY hamfisted attempts (Pics of Obamas playing ping-pong posted by ping-pong place? CONSPIRACY). The pinnacle of ham-fisted comes at pic #5, in which a comment obviously made about the half-naked man taking up most of the photo is somehow construed as pedophilia.</p>

<p>To the normal observer, pretty much all of this evidence just comes off as forcing extremely vague &quot;evidence&quot; to fit a narrative rather than anything pointing at any truth. I don&#39;t think pizzagaters understand that normal people look at stuff like this and see normal goddamn posts. It&#39;s only through the crazy goggles that this starts to look like legitimate conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing in that picture to denote pizza, or the fowl known as chicken.</p>

<p>There is, however, a man holding a infant.</p>

<p>In the pedo scene, that&#39;s a chickenlover.  It&#39;s also a derogatory term, because apparently even to half the pedo scene, it&#39;s considered sick to take advantage of someone you can&#39;t groom into being compliant.</p>

<p>Next picture, the one with Comet owner at an adult party, between two male strippers, wearing a shirt that says in french &quot;I &lt;3 children&quot;.</p>

<p>This is what we talk about when we say that normal people refuse to see the obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, which sounds more likely to you; the guy in the picture ordered a chicken pizza and got tagged as such, or that the owner publicly incriminates himself by using some weird-ass pedo code (which no normal goddamn person should know; why the hell would that be the FIRST assumption of the term you jump to?) on an open social media page for literally no reason at all?</p>

<p>As for the T-shirt thing, this was debunked in another thread. Google &quot;L&#39;enfant DC&quot;. The shirt&#39;s probably either in reference to the plaza, the bar, the hotel, the architect... literally any other reason besides the guy wearing a shirt that says &quot;I&#39;m a pedophile&quot;.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by interpreting the evidence to fit the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I most definitely can say this is bullshit.</p>

<p>One of the first issues is that you&#39;re using obscure <em>fucking urban dictionary definitions</em> for all of these logic jumps. You think the pedophile community is getting together and scouring for decades-old made-up definitions with 50 likes for their lingo? The ONLY reason these words have ANY relevance to you is because you popped them into Google and scrolled down until you found something to do with pedophiles. Once again, fitting the narrative. (To give you an example of this crazy logic; Mr Roger&#39;s full name is Fred McFeely Rogers. OH SHIT, MR ROGERS IS A <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=McFeely">SEXUAL PREDATOR!</a>)</p>

<p>As for the music videos, refer to my earlier explanation of weird art folks doing weird art shit. Just because it&#39;s weird it doesn&#39;t mean they are diddling kids. As for the Africa thing, that&#39;s just taking a logical leap right off a cliff (e.g. there&#39;s an Asian kid in PSY&#39;s Gangnam Style video/Asia has massive child sex trafficking rings/PSY is a child-trafficking pedophile).</p>

<p>As for the logo thing, god forbid a <em>pizza place</em> has a logo that <em>looks like pizza</em>. (For the logic jump example on this one; did you know wacky inflatable arm men are <a href="http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/life-rune.html#.WDnWSn21XFI">racist Nazi symbols?</a>)</p>

<p>Why would they put all of this evidence out in the open, connected to their real world identity? Why would they conduct their activities at their place of business, in front of everybody?</p>

<p>I get that believers think they use code to skirt around the dark reality of their actions, but are we really supposed to believe they are just so arrogant that they do not believe they will be discovered? Or is it that the conspiracy is so far reaching that they believe themselves to be protected and untouchable?</p>

<p>I have watched videos and read posts concerning this conspiracy, and I agree there are lots of oddities. But this honestly seems like people are connecting dots to create the narrative they want, not necessarily get to the truth.</p>

<p>Because twitter didn&#39;t &quot;uncover&quot; a god damned thing.  They banned people who were reporting it and left the CP offending accounts up.</p>

<p>So, if you do mean 4chan, yeah they were the ones that broke it, but there were many people in PG finding new ones at a constant rate.  Someone claimed over 5000 accounts before PG got wiped.  But 4chan was calling it pizzagate as well, so not sure what your beef really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, your problem is that you think too much. Here&#39;s how this conspiracy works:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. You hate politicians, don&#39;t you? They&#39;re all evil liars, right? Ok cool, let&#39;s go to step 2.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Now that we&#39;ve established they&#39;re all liars, we can pretty well assume that they&#39;re lying all the time because they have a bunch of shit to hide, right? Well, we got ahold of their private communications via Wikileaks...so now they&#39;re totally busted, right?! Oh wait, the emails don&#39;t reveal anything that significant yet...unless, wait a second...CODE WORDS! Those sneaky bastards thought they could fool us, but we&#39;re just too clever.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Remember that this &quot;conspiracy&quot; was first uncovered on 4chan, so what do you think these code words are hiding? Pedophilia, of course! Now let&#39;s go through their social media accounts and find any photos of family/friends that includes children and post them alongside any other pictures of sexual humor (the dude is gay and we know gay dudes love sexual humor), because they&#39;re totally all related.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> (Optional). Oh btw are you religious? Because if you&#39;re religious, you should also keep in mind that these aren&#39;t just your run-of-the-mill pedophiles we&#39;re dealing with here...these are the <strong>satan worshipping</strong> variety! They&#39;re totally performing those Eyes Wide Shut occult rituals and shit while they bathe in the blood of those babies they just fucked before eating them (did I mention they&#39;re probably cannibals too? cuz they probably are).</p>

<p>So now that you&#39;re totally convinced it&#39;s 100% legit, just remember that anyone who actually questions that legitimacy is either a pedophile themselves, a shill being paid by the pedophiles, or just one of the brainwashed masses being manipulated by the MSM. There&#39;s literally no other explanation for why someone wouldn&#39;t believe such solid evidence.</p>

<p>Welcome to PizzaGate!</p>

<p>Yes. Remember, the only reason Comet Pizza was investigated on instagram was because of the Podesta emails, if those emails hadn&#39;t leaked, and certain communnities on the interent didn&#39;t stumble upon suspicious communications, these people would still be posting pictures of children in inappropriate cirrcumstances. Without Podesta emails being leaked they continue on doing whatever it is they were doing before.</p>

<p>No, I believe they were communicating in code on instagram because they were arrogant and got complacent.</p>

<p>Your argument consists of &#39;they can&#39;t be so stupid as to get caught&#39; and that&#39;s not really an argument. Why did James Alefantis post pictures of a secret underground tunnel being created under his property?

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Copy-pasting harder evidence for your satisfaction:</strong> The story about child abductor Laura Silsby is probably the hardest hitting evidence I have seen following Pizzagate.</p>

<p>Laura Silsby was arrested for abducting 33 children in Haiti under the front of a philanthropic child adoption agency. She was jailed in Haiti and Clinton may have been involved in getting her out as she was kept well informed and updated about Laura&#39;s situation according to the wikileaks.</p>

<p>Also more recently it was uncovered that a student researching the Haiti human trafficking supposedly found a connection to Clinton and subsequently &quot;committed suicide&quot;.</p>

You have no context with these posts, yeah maybe they are all veiled references to an international pedophile conspiracy that has corrupted the highest levels of business and politics, but they also could have been friendly comments that you don&#39;t understand because you don&#39;t know any of these people.<br/>
This is a lynch mob, no two ways about it, you can pretend to be sensible and just &quot;investigating&quot; but you need to have way more evidence to publicly accuse private individuals of being pedophiles.  Honestly if no one else has been able to drill that into your skull yet then I doubt anyone ever will but since you claim to be a phd candidate I assume you have some capacity for critical thinking so Im giving it a shot.  Maybe Ill be proven wrong, but the idea that a private individual can get absolutely slandered over such absurd shit is more frightening to me than a pedophilia conspiracy is.  </p>

<p>Decide for yourself. This is the Instagram account of the owner of Comet Pizza. Despite being a middle-aged man with no children, you&#39;ll see quite a few pictures of children with references to sexual abuse and sadism in the comments. <a href="https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM">https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to act like a pedo on social media then you can&#39;t be surprised when people call you a pedo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Decide for yourself, but here&#39;s a statement to lead you to the same conclusion I made.&quot; You can&#39;t genuinely want someone to decide for themselves and then lead them to a conclusion before they&#39;ve even had a chance to review the evidence. You&#39;ve already altered their perception before they&#39;ve looked at it. I&#39;ve not studied psychology at all, so forgive me, but that seems like a manipulative way to make someone think they arrived at the conclusion you led them towards all on their own, intentionally or no. </p>

<p>And I think that&#39;s what this pizzagate shit is really all about - telling someone &quot;Heres a bunch of random shit from someone that was mentioned in these leaked emails, here&#39;s all their social media stuff that correlates to our pre-drawn conclusion, and here&#39;s one potential, highly sexual meaning of each of these phrases. I&#39;m just collating the information for you, man, decide for yourself (despite the fact that I&#39;ve already told you what the conclusion is.)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, there are ways to direct people to a certain conclusion, but I didn&#39;t say anything misleading.</p>

<p>There <em>were</em> lots of pictures of kids. There <em>were</em> depictions of sadism (half naked man covered in blood, multiple references to a &quot;kill room&quot;), and there <em>was</em> sexually explicit material. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t make people believe just anything, like you seem to be suggesting. There has to be <em>something</em> there. And there are a lot of somethings in pizzagate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how is any of this evidence of someone &quot;acting like a pedo?&quot; You conveniently skipped that part. </p>

<p>You are positively insisting that something exists, when literally every piece of information you have is <em>incredibly</em> weak circumstantial evidence. What I see is someone who has perhaps a dark sense of humor promoting his pizza in a way that might be intended to shock or appeal to an alternative group of people, who happens to also love his sisters children (and not in a sexual manner). None of these things, even in conjunction with one another, is in anyway evidence of pedophilia, and making such accusations without sufficient evidence is INSANELY dangerous (and criminal). </p>

<p>What you are doing is, as someone else said, intellectually dishonest, and I honestly hope you never get your degree in psychology until you come to realize this. This is how you plant false memories in someone&#39;s head - by insisting there is a connection between disparate, unrelated bits of information.</p>

<p>You are attempting to will something into existence here because you are excited about the possibility of being part of an investigative group that uncovers some grand conspiracy to hide and harbor pedophiles. I get it, but what you are espousing is incredibly dangerous with barely even a shred of evidence. This is the kind of shit that ruins people&#39;s lives, <em>regardless</em> of whether or not it&#39;s true. Have your suspicions by all means, but don&#39;t try to poison someone else&#39;s perception with your own, just as someone has clearly done with your own. You are <em>not</em> thinking critically, you are thinking emotionally.</p>

<p>What kind of stupid fucking bullshit is this? &quot;Yea, well, he got his own life ruined by liking kids (in a non-sexual way) and posting about it in such a public place. How we&#39;re we supposed to know he wasn&#39;t a pedophile?&quot;</p>

<p>You talk about thinking critically, but there is a noticeable absence of critical thinking in your posts. This is the <em>exact</em> thought process behind victim blaming. It is a way for you to temper your owner responsibility if you end up being wrong, and it is absolutely disgusting. This is not logic. This is emotion and bloodthirst.</p>

<p>I hope to God you never counsel anyone until you reconcile this, because this is an incredibly dangerous thought process to expose to a vulnerable patient.</p>

<p>Why would I post something about gaming on my Facebook one day, and then post something about cars the next? Seems odd, don&#39;t you think? And way, what about this post about social justice? Hmmm... none of these things <em>seem</em> to be related. Why would I post them on the same social media account? There <em>must</em> be a relation between them!</p>

<p>Perhaps because when I make every one of these posts, I&#39;m not even considering the items I have posted before. Who the fuck thinks &quot;hmmm... does this fit in well with the rest of my social media posts?&quot; Literally no one.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that we&#39;ve looked at the &quot;evidence&quot; means we <em>are</em> being critical of comet pizza. But we&#39;re not convinced, which means going around and declaring this guy a potential pedophile has literally no place in <em>any</em> discussion. That could ruin somebody, true or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the photos in the presumed &#39;private instagram account&#39; were misappropriated is established. Anyone wanting to say these kids were specific to that account, needs to present evidence for that case. Far beyond rehosted BS. I don&#39;t know about you, but </p>

<p><a href="https://sli.mg/">https://sli.mg/</a></p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t really strike me as a web site I can trust. Beyond that, you have random images, and random text, interspersed with hugely innocuous posts like OMG I GOT PIZZA FOR MY BROTHERS BIRTHDAY!</p>

<p>The onus isn&#39;t on anyone to say these &gt;aren&#39;t&lt; legit photos. The onus is on the motherfuckers making public accusations against people as pederasts, linking to pictures of children and claiming there are victims of a pedo ring. These are not neutral claims, these are not innocuous charges. The parents of these kids, and the kids themselves, are being introduced into this claim with no say in the matter.  </p>

<p>The fuckwits on r/pizzagate are not the best and the brightest, they are not trained investigators. They have been using the cloak of anonymity to make dangerous, libelous claims. Every legitimate third-party media outfit that has looked at this has said the images were repurposed. </p>

<p>Either every single professional organization that has looked at this is compromised and part of a sinister pedo cabal, OR reddit is overrun with reactionary cocksuckers.</p>

<p>I have seen enough of this shitstain website to know, with absolute certainty, that the second possibility here is the truth.</p>

<p>Laura Silsby was arrested for abducting 33 children in Haiti under the front of a philanthropic child adoption agency. She was jailed and Clinton may have been involved in getting her out as she was kept well informed and updated about Laura&#39;s situation according to the wikileaks.</p>

<p>Also more recently it was uncovered that a student researching the Haiti human trafficking supposedly found a connection to Clinton and subsequently &quot;committed suicide&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more hard hitting evidence but this is imo the hardest single piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve unfortunately spent the time going through most of it, and it&#39;s either circumstantial, misleading, completely nonsensical, or outright lies.  For instance, first watch the &quot;leaked&quot; video of comet ping pong with the masked comic telling some dark jokes in a sinister voice.  It has been edited with commentary that makes it seem like its about pedoohilia and baby murder.  But then watch the entire video, unedited, without commentary, and you will realize that the jokes are totally legit, and the editor of the video is obviously out on a smear campaign.</p>

<p>But there are so many lies swirling about from every direction, so don&#39;t believe me - verify for yourself.</p>

Nobody in any official position was calling for  a vigilante citizen investigation squad that publishes and reviews evidence, identifies possible suspects, interviews witnesses, tries to locate the perps, etc all in a public forum... that was reddit users&#39; own doing. It was well-intentioned, but a bunch of anonymous amateur sleuths aren&#39;t going to have the same standards as  professionals who are actually held accountable for their actions.

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI and law enforcement set up a nationwide tip line, sifted through thousands of tips and mountains of evidence, found the guys responsible, shot and killed one, and mobilized tens of thousands of cops to conduct a massive door-to-door manhunt for the second one, putting their lives on the line and shutting down a major American city to (successfully) capture him and bring him to justice. The people of reddit falsely identified an innocent person as the bomber (who, as it turns out, was already dead before the bombing happened). I&#39;ll let you be the judge as to who was more effective and who &quot;won&#39;t do shit.&quot;</p>

<p>There is no &quot;inconsistently&quot;. Like I said before, most half-baked conspiracy theories aren&#39;t taken &quot;for real&quot; by mainstream news agencies. i.e. considered worthy of attention. I don&#39;t see Time Cube or David Icke getting a rebuttal from the New York Times. </p>

<p>Sure there is. The Boston Bomber accusations were reported upon as news, while the pizzagate accusations were refuted as bullshit.</p>

<p>The only ideas either one has ever had which have been taken seriously by enough people to have any impact on the general public are climate change denial, Holocaust denial, and 9/11 conspiracy theories. All of which I an assure you <em>have</em> been addressed. </p>

<p>But hey, you keep on thinking whatever you want to think, man. If the fact that nobody cares enough about Gene Ray&#39;s schizophrentic ramblings or David Icke&#39;s claims that shape-shifting lizard-men run all world governments enough to refute is sufficient evidence of a satanic child sacrifice ring for you, then go for it. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not the distinction that I made. Hence no &quot;inconsistently&quot;. </p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about ideas that were only made serious by the media&#39;s attempts to take them seriously. The Boston Bomber accusations were one of them. The Pizzagate accusations were another of them. </p>

<p>But hey, keep on moving the goalposts and assuming my stance on a particular conspiracy theory (which I haven&#39;t revealed, by the way) if that floats your boat. </p>

<p>We&#39;re at a point where no investigation conducted by a government organisation is going to succeed, a look at history will show you that. So what does it matter if an investigation is compromised? At this point all we want is as many pedos placed under scrutiny as possible.</p>

<p>They were getting off the hook before the internet, before vigilante justice, they were getting off the hook when investigations were conducted by the book. Face it, the US Government is utterly compromised and only a mass revolt will purge it of its compromised pedos. And that is what pizzagate is about, do away with the corrupt middle man, dig for evidence and let the people decide because all alternatives have proven dead ends.</p>

<p>and thus commit a felony by linking to CP, or looking at CP. you are putting <em>your own</em> people at risk. Do you think a jury will acquit you if you say &quot;BUT I WAS INVESTIGATING?&quot;</p>

<p>they will roll their eyes and laugh, the same as if you used &quot;it was an accident&quot; or &quot;I got a virus&quot; as an excuse. </p>

<p>you, and most people on that sub are not qualified to conduct an investigation, continuing to investigate puts you in legal jeopardy, which should you be arrested, the only outcome is jail, or a ruined record. You don&#39;t have legal backing, and until you do. you are fucked AND IF YOU TURN UP ANYTHING, congratulations, it&#39;s inadmissible in court and you get your ass sued off for libel. And now it&#39;s THAT MUCH HARDER for a legitimate investigation. ALL YOUR DOING is helping your &quot;enemy&quot;. there is no circumstance in which you end up on top unless you mass file formal complaints with the police, who know what they are doing and can do it legally. and since you don&#39;t trust law enforcement...how do you expect to punish these people if by some miracle, you DO pin them to the wall with evidence, somehow not able to be thrown out in court, and SOMEHOW doesn&#39;t result in you being thrown in jail due to even &quot;looking&quot; at the damning evidence necessary to put them away? How do you expect a jury to take you seriously, should you get caught looking at &quot;evidence&quot; of the pizza kind when the sub you work with also claims demonic worship is occurring?</p>

<p>and if you say &quot;well violent revolution&quot;, congrats, now you&#39;re a domestic terrorist and human rights no longer apply to you, enjoy being disappeared off to some black site.</p>

<p>you want to help? get a law degree and have credentials and skill sets to make these investigations waterproof while simultaneously fighting the corruption.</p>

<p>If you are not willing to do that, or think its useless, you are part of the problem. we need GOOD PEOPLE in law enforcement, as judges, as politicians, as lawyers. THEN you can be in a position to do something and have it actually hold up, instead of flailing around, looking like a nutter and making the bad people stronger by not building toolsets to fight them. </p>

<p>&quot;But-but-but we don&#39;t have TIME for that, that&#39;s not quick enough. That&#39;ll take too long&quot; If that train of thought crosses your mind, THAT&#39;S why we are in this predicament, because good people don&#39;t want to take the time and build up the tools to fight the bad people who DO take the time to build up tools. They took the time to have the skills to take control, why the fuck are so many unwilling to play the same game and beat them senseless at it? Play the fucking game, and if you win, you get to write the rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did. A TLDR of my findings: The Podesta email was describing a cheese basket sent around Christmas - in previous years they sent pasta, the Podestas like playing dominoes, the &quot;I Love Children&quot; tshirt is actually talking about a place named after a culture center in DC called &quot;L&#39;Enfant&quot; which is named after Pierre Charles L&#39;Enfant, the Buom Buom Room is hardly a secret place - it&#39;s a monthly event held by a gay bar in L&#39;Enfant plaza, the scotch taped child/picture of an infant/picture of a child with Euros in her mouth are his Godchild and the same person, the German baby with a $1200 price is a toy doll, the &quot;secret bathroom&quot; is the public bathroom based on a video,  and many of the racy pizza-porn images were from people TAGGED at Comet Ping Pong - one of whom is a drag queen.</p>

<p>If you doubt any of that, feel free to read my original two posts that basically went through the motions of trying to debunk it. </p>

<p>Post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5edxi5/admins_are_censoring_rpizzagate_in_less_than_an/dacbc9k/?context=3">1</a>, Post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5edxi5/admins_are_censoring_rpizzagate_in_less_than_an/dad37hz/?context=3">2 - the better of the posts</a></p>

<p>Truth be told: I didn&#39;t find a single claim that seemed to suggest that the Podestas or James were guilty of anything related to pedophilia/cannibalism/child trafficking. Literally half of the accusations can be easily debunked if you take a moment to research to investigate - so to bounce the ping pong ball back at you &quot;did you research pizzagate extensively?&quot; </p>

<p>The closest thing to any evidence suggesting pedophilia is the Haiti charity that the Clinton Foundation donated to or something. </p>

<p>By the way, nothing is &quot;unfalsifiable&quot; but everything can be obscured by a complicit media and political class. Present the facts, probe the events, and provide hard evidence that does not require a belief in Coincidence and the &quot;unfalsefiable&quot; could be proven wrong. </p>

<p>If they took their job seriously and told the truth even when it hurt they might have some credibility. </p>

<p>Riddle me this, why do the media always expect us to write off damming pieces of circumstantial evidence as coincidence? Are they really coincidence or have the hard answers been obscured by layer after layer of propiganda to discredit the truth? How many coincidences do I need to start considering where there is smoke, there is fire? </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just skeptical and know if a DA had that kind of evidence against me, they would at least bring it to trial. In fact, if your not a political big wig, most convictions are based on circumstantial evidence,  not a smoking gun as the media keeps asking for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like everything fishy about this election, consider the timing of introduction as well. Pizzagate seemed to get going right after Comey&#39;s Weiner email letter came along to remind everyone of Lyin&#39; Hillary, along with the scheduled wikileaks releases. Leading up to election day, pizzagate and marina abramovic&#39;s blood sacrifice dinner BS were dominating this sub; so now not only was Clinton responsible for starting ISIS, threatening WW3 with Putin, playing fast and loose with US secrets, but she was suddenly also complicit with an international elite politician child rape and pornography and  trafficking ring, AND THEN satanic worship and blood rituals, both right out of the &quot;ritual satanic abuse&quot; narratives from the 80&#39;s-- all of it false, of course, but just imagine how fucked it would be if it&#39;s true! The mere suggestion and dissemination of this stuff is like the dream combination to scare the shit out of middle America.  </p>

<p>It took the combined efforts of all the far rightists around the globe, for the past few decades at least, to build and maintain all this doubt. I&#39;m hoping this doesn&#39;t turn into a historically bad dupe of humanity, fingers crossed. </p>

Private organizations like Correct the Record are following in their shoes, though I doubt the mess they created was what they had in mind. Constant accusations of shilling, regardless of how mundane the comment that ignited the accusation was. Actually, now that I think of it, the shit show of Correct the Record might have been a lessen to online propagandists. Online opinion might be too difficult to shift in one direction to be worth the effort, but creating chaos and partisanship seems to be pretty fucking easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold your horses, cowboy. </p>

<p>Fuck anyone who goes to Comet and causes problems in person. </p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve disavowed, can we still talk about it?</p>

<p>Are you judging an entire group of people based on the actions of a few?</p>

<p>Are you advocating taking action against an entire group of people based on the actions of a few?</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shut down for generating hatred for President-elect Trump? His life could be ruined based on all of the disinformation presented about him in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Shut that down too while you are at it.</p>

<p>Oh shit, fuck it all, just shut anything down where anyone might talk about another living creature or anyone associated directly or indirectly with said living creature because somebody might read what was said and might do something illegal based on that information.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ve got a conspiracy for you all, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been taken over by concern trolls. &quot;OH, PUH-LEASE, THIS conspiracy again? Can we please get back to talking about how aliens killed Kennedy because he was a rogue alien who was trying to help humans fight the alien invaders by jump starting our space program? Enough with these fake conspiracies, guys, seriously. CNN said this one was fake, obviously it&#39;s fake, why do you talk about fake things?&quot;</p>

<p>edit2: and now I&#39;m getting pissed off. Some pizza place in DC gets trolled by a few people and we&#39;re up in arms defending them ... let&#39;s not forget what&#39;s at the heart of the pizza gate conspiracy: children being sold into sex slavery. You want to act like you care about people? You should care about getting to the bottom of this. And one more time, no, nobody should be going to Comet Pizza and causing problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that disavowing harassment isn&#39;t enough when doxxing is well-established as a method by which people are harassed. We don&#39;t tell pedophiles that they can go fuck themselves if they diddle the kids we leave in their care - that&#39;s neglectful of the reality of the situation. Doxxing is no different, which is why no legitimate web service or company tolerates it. </p>

<p>Doxxing is harassment, not just a vehicle for it. If you have a connection that could save children, pass it to different authorities, or report it to the news media. They both have mechanisms in place to protect individuals from blatant harassment, and they can be held liable for errors.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the &quot;hard evidence&quot; that they were circulating over there.  It was the worst kind of bullshit witch hunting with absolutely ZERO evidence, just a bunch of people jumping on every word or piece of art or entirely unrelated email and letting their mind wander until they finally made up enough shit to come to their fabricated conclusions.</p>

<p>And then believing the shit they made up so hard that they took it into the real world and started treating innocent people like they were child rapists because that&#39;s what their fucked up minds convinced them was reality. </p>

<p>One was a drawing of the Madeleine Mccan suspects which looked a bit like Podesta and his brother. Turns out they were two drawings of the same person, so not possible to be the two of them, and also evidence of how inaccurate drawings are.</p>

<p>Another was a picture of a young girl and a man and woman saying &#39;nothing like pizza blah blah blah&#39;, i don&#39;t remember what the rest of it was. Anyway apparently it was evidence enough to spread around to people outside the pizzagate sub. Well I did a reverse image search, didn&#39;t take long to find out the two adults were political prisoners freed by Hillary who had JUST been reunited with their daughter who had been in the US. It was literally a heartwarming picture about how this family had been reunited, and this toxic &#39;investigation&#39; turned it into a child rape thing. Now there is a bunch of people who think they are pedophiles and molesters. Awful.</p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s not how hashtags work. Hashtags are a way to describe and classify <em>the picture</em>, not whomever posted it. </p>

<p>Sure, maybe there are equally obtuse and convoluted explanations for all of his behavior. Maybe him and his friends have sick and twisted senses of humor and repeatedly reference things like sexual abuse, murder, and buying and selling children. And maybe they legitimately don&#39;t see that, as a business owner, Instagram might not be the best avenue for such macabre and lurid drolleries. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s the thing, when you have to perform such mental gymnastics in attempt to justify these things it&#39;s a bit curious. I&#39;m not insinuating you&#39;re a pedophile but I&#39;m wondering why you&#39;re going to such great lengths to explain away his behavior. And why are you so unwilling to admit that his account is inappropriate, to say the least, and that it gives a certain impression? I think that&#39;s a perfectly valid question to ask. </p>

An organized campaign to attempt to tie political opponents of the new government who seems to have had explicit support from the intelligence services and Russian Psy ops to child porn and child abuse rings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously this is like saying &quot;Holocaust deniers...if it&#39;s just harmless, crazy, conspiracy nuts making wild claims, why have laws in Germany banning it?&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe because it&#39;s so pants-on-head retarded that it&#39;s just simply not worth the sheer number of fucking man-hours that would be spent debunking it over and over and over and over again ad-infinitum. So you just ban it and move on with your life.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the little part where it&#39;s actually NOT harmless at all, and just like millions of surviving victims of the Nazis don&#39;t deserve to hear people &#39;harmlessly questioning&#39; what all the fuss really was about...a bunch of poor fucking pizza place owners don&#39;t need to be called pedophiles and harassed 24hrs a day by an army of no-life idiots on the internet.</p>

<p>I mean the pizzagate shit is so retarded that I truly and honestly though it was all just a joke at first. After wasting my time reading through the &#39;damning&#39; evidence on Wikileaks, I think the major crime that&#39;s been committed here is that 100,000 idiots have been depriving themselves of fresh air and need to go the fuck outside and turn off the computer.</p>

<p>Those posts are hardly excessive.  It sounds more like you&#39;re the one trying to cope with your pedophilic thoughts and you do that by acting repulsed by any display involving children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but the timing of it has undeniable intent, which is at the very least suspicious. If it were 5 or 10 years ago, sure, maybe there would be some legitimacy, but at the very end of the election cycle? Please. Stories can easily be made up, witnesses can commit perjury. I wouldn&#39;t put it past an organization to stoop so low, when they&#39;ve been caught red handed sending provocateurs to Trump rallies.... with the intent of causing violence. This includes, &quot;paying some seriously mentally ill people, to do some really F&#39;d up shit.&quot; </p>

<p>Maybe you should produce some evidence, without quoting okeefe&#39;s history, as you so often like to leave that sort of correlation out of discussions about democrats and the left, you should leave it out of this one. Produce some evidence the videos are faked. Or that the high ranking people in the democratic committee that lost their positions, aren&#39;t real. </p>

You are so quick to defend &quot;business owners&quot; but why aren&#39;t you coming to defense of someone who is being demonized by mainstream media before he has been convicted? These poor business owners you speak of are victim of what ever free speech anyone else is cable of speaking out loud. If they can&#39;t survive it that sucks.... Right?

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on your point that the harassment is a bit harsh and can hurt these businesses that have been implicated has pedo rings. However, specifically targeting the owners of Comet Ping Pong pizza and Beasta Pizza; shouldn&#39;t the emails and the pictures on IG as well as the logo that depicts a known child abuse logo be enough to hurt these businesses? These are not random acts of harassment. They are undeniable proof that something &quot;could&quot; be going on. Isn&#39;t that enough to hurt the business of Comet Ping Pong and Beasta Pizza? </p>

<p>I guess if people don&#39;t actually do some real research into the WL&#39;s long list of emails, they would never know that something &quot;could&quot; be going on at these businesses. But yes, the random acts of hate toward these pizza joints should not be tolerable. However, what we do know should be enough to hurt the flow of customers flocking to these pizza places. </p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong&#39;s logo in no way, shape, or form &quot;depicts a known child abuse logo&quot;. It has some stars and moons on it, you know, to go along with &quot;comet&quot;. </p>

<p>Besta Pizza&#39;s logo was a B made of stylized slices of pizza. When anything that&#39;s made up of concentric shapes or spirals becomes a &quot;pedophile logo&quot;, then you&#39;re going to have to start harassing a fucking shitton of businesses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your continued argument here sounds great. You even took excerpts from my post, how cute. (: I can see where you get the whole &#39;b&#39; in the logo of Besta Pizza, however, with all of the evidence(and yes, it is actually evidence, even if you claim it is false. I can say that the sky is purple and swear that it isn&#39;t blue, however the evidence and just common knowledge would prove otherwise) ergo, the FBI coming out with logos that are connected to known pedo rings just HAPPENS to look a lot like Besta Pizza can&#39;t possibly be a coincident. Please offer up some other businesses that have a logo that looks almost identical to the pedo logo and I will cease my case. And I would like to think that you looked at every single email, which is good. I can agree that there isn&#39;t any golden ticket in the emails, however, there is a lot of incriminating stuff that users of Reddit have found, which come with links and all that good stuff, that show that something &quot;could&quot; be going on. </p>

<p>Lastly, and I should have said this earlier, but with something like this, you have zero control over people&#39;s actions. Fact is, there are dumb people in the world. These dumb people will react in harsh ways to something like this and, again, we have no control over them. We can tell them no, but at the end of the day, they will do what they please. We shouldn&#39;t be focusing on the jarring actions of others, we should be focused on what matters: A further investigation into these businesses. But you don&#39;t really seem interested or are extremely close minded like most people in this world are so I won&#39;t waste anymore your time. </p>

<p>Edited: whole bunch of mistakes that I am too lazy or just don&#39;t give a f to change. Also using my phone to write this, also yes, if it seems like I am an asshole, it is because I am. I&#39;m just sick an tired of having to open people&#39;s minds to the truth in this world. Really takes a toll on ones mental state.</p>

<p>I mean, the Besta Pizza logo doesn&#39;t even look somewhat close to the &quot;boy lover logo&quot; you&#39;re referring to, but go ahead and google &quot;triangle logo&quot; or &quot;pyramid logo&quot; or &quot;triangle spiral logo&quot; and there are hundreds of results that look just as much like the Besta logo as the &quot;boy lover logo&quot; does.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to investigate. There isn&#39;t anything even kind of strange or worthy of investigation. If there were any actual evidence whatsoever of missing or abused children I&#39;d be all for it, but there simply isn&#39;t. What you&#39;re saying is &quot;well witches would be really bad, so we have to let the hunt continue.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please forgive me, I only looked one of your examples up, and I almost dropped my phone from uncontrollable laughter. (Not lying, I almost did drop my phone) And I&#39;m not sure if you are actually looking up the boy lover logo, seems like you are cause you actually know the name of it (:, then you can&#39;t possible tell me that the Besta Pizza isn&#39;t at least 90% identical to the boy love logo. You literally just have to reverse the Besta Pizza logo counter-clockwise and it would be almost identical.(other then the random stuff at the bottom which in my head kind of looks like blood, but what could just be my way of thinking) </p>

<p>Look, you have your beliefs. I have mine. One of us are right, the other is wrong. At the end of the day I have nothing to prove that these pizza joints are in any way connected to a large scale peso ring, but with the things that I have read, the pictures I have seen, something stinks here. At least IMO it smells funny. But you don&#39;t smell it, which is fine.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think that being close minded is a healthy way to live. Especially if your talking about a global pedo ring that involves the lives of innocent children. Just doesn&#39;t float on my boat. </p>

<p>Edit: I gotta work on my rebuttals. I think I&#39;m getting the hang of it though. Even if you don&#39;t agree with me. </p>

<p>This is a lose-lose situation for both of us. You won&#39;t ever change my mind and it seems like I won&#39;t even get a dent in yours. Goodnight. (:</p>

<p>Why would this band be playing music at a family pizza place? And what does it say about the kind of crowd they are attracting?</p>

<p>Its just music, its art, just like Marina Abromovic&#39;s spirit cooking &quot;performance art&quot;...its just art, right? They hide their deepest darkest secrets and desires in the art they surround themselves with...its clear as fucking day. Pedophilia is a &quot;sexual preference/orientation&quot; to them and just because the lowly scum masses that they view us as, dissapprove of their tastes and preferences, it isnt going to stop them from getting what they want....that cheese fuckin pizza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can we even know what&#39;s real anymore? We already know that Reddit admins can put words in people&#39;s mouths. So, what&#39;s the US government capable of? How can we really be sure that the vitriol being used as an excuse to shut this down is genuine? At the end of the day, continuity of government is the top priority of the powers that be. Such as it is, they&#39;d do anything to prevent this from blowing up. Not only to save their own skin, but to retain the peoples faith in government. For that reason, we can&#39;t trust law enforcement to take it from here and get justice. The only way that we can force their hand on this is to bring forward irrefutable evidence of abuse, which, as of now, we do not have. And they know this. Which gives them a motive to shut this down before we do. Bottom line - <strong>we</strong> have an obligation to sort through this mess until we find absolute resolution, whatever that may mean. We <em>are</em> talking about child abuse, here. We must err on the side of protecting children.</p>

<p>associations with other people (or 5) who have been convicted of pedophilia is considered by law circumstantial evidence.Especially considering the characteristics of, history of, and modalities of pedophile networks.  Enough of it and you have yourself a problem.  In this case, there are at least 10 points of data pointing them in the same direction.</p>

<p>But you know, it&#39;s very convenient to presuppose innocence or guilt and then cherry pick data to support those preconclusions, as you&#39;ve done.  It&#39;s clear you&#39;ve ignored these connections</p>

<p>What is the end-game for any sort of subreddit like this one? It comes down to documentation about people and organizations that incriminates them in some manner (in this subreddit it incriminates them of conspiracy). That&#39;s honestly a big problem for a website like Reddit, where the ground rules are set up to protect the privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>There are three parts to that series. Part 2 and 3 are on this page if you scroll down. Kinda of a Humorous Macabre podcast if anyone hasn&#39;t listened to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Forest Hills-Tenleytown area, the idea that a restaurant might stay open late, provide entertainment for its customers and--horrors!--even let folks sit outside on a summer&#39;s eve is a shocking invasion to some residents. But for once, the District&#39;s byzantine form of neighborhood democracy--which heavily favors the tiny group of people who despise any street life, cling to the notion that they live in a suburb, and have nothing better to do than attend ANC meetings--produced a result that reflects the wishes of the great majority who choose to live in the city expressly for the busy street activity Alefantis seeks to foster.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all: Neither I nor you nor anybody is allowed to decide if someone should be <em>allowed to love their life</em>. That is a seriously sick suggestion from you.</p>

<p>Second: If our goal is really harm reduction we should treat pedophilia as what it is: a psychatric disorder and should give everyone with that disorder all the help necessary to avoid actual sexual abuse of children. </p>

<p>Third: People like <a href="/u/WTFppl">/u/WTFppl</a> seem to show no respect for human life - this lack of empthy is far more monstrous than pedophilia without actual sexual abuse. A non-soziopath pedophiliac will still now that his sexual urge is morally wrong while people like <a href="/u/WTFppl">/u/WTFppl</a> think that they are morally right. </p>

<p>Or go a step further: Pence as VP means bad news for PP, means bad news for sex ed and will likely result in another surge of teen pregnancies. And yet.. nobody gives a damn. Or take the reaction in <a href="/r/The">/r/The</a>-Donald after Trumps &quot;closet talk&quot;. This is a person in power abusing said position to gain sexual favours and people were okay with it....</p>

<p>whatever.</p>

<p>Actually no,. It is a heavy trauma but the child doesn&#39;t have to be defined by the trauma. In reality (as almost all child molestion happens within the family) something else happens: Family tells the child &quot;to let it go&quot;, builds up peer pressure to bury the topic and the child has to carry his/hers demons alone.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The example would serve future child molesters what the outcome of being caught is.</p>

<p>see, my goal is prevention and not revenge. You didn&#39;t differenciate between pedophilia (the urge) and child molestation (acting upon the urge..). If we can trust the statistics there are a lot of pedophiles which never act upon their urge - those should get every help we can give them ..instead we play a game of human vs. monster while never even realizing the costs of this idiocity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you will stay idle when someone comes to molest or kill you? I&#39;m gonna call bullshit on that one!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>No, I won&#39;t. But I also won&#39;t stay idle if someone comes to kill me or anyone else because he deems them unworthy of living. </h2>

<p>A friend of mine was repeatedly raped as a child and because the whole topic is &quot;oh such bad for the family&quot; it was sorta hushed up. 20 years later her rapist (her uncle) married and his wife got a child and my friend went out and tried to get the baby away from him. It was to late because this arse frigging raped is own baby. </p>

<p>I dunno what I will do if I ever see this guy -  I probably won&#39;t be able to do nothing. But this won&#39;t help avoid other cases and neither does dehumanizing pedophiles. Instead of hunting for the bigbad pedophiles monsters we should seek to prevent child molestation and we have to start in families. </p>

<p>For me it&#39;s because I&#39;m unable to untangle random crazy talk from potentially useful information.</p>

<p>I likely missed the original posts, but most of what I&#39;ve seen here seems to be apparently innocuous emails about pizza interpreted somehow as evidence of terrible crimes.</p>

<p>If someone presented a short, clear exposition of just the most convincing parts and none of the hyperbolic parts, I for one would find it much more useful.  As it is, I feel completely out of the loop.</p>

<p>You take the absence of media coverage conveniently as confirmation of your own foregone conclusion. You wouldn&#39;t believe any article that states there&#39;s nothing to it. You also wouldn&#39;t believe it if the FBI came out and say it&#39;s all a load of BS. Congratulation, you&#39;ve successfully immunized yourself from anything that might convince you otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read all of them. The best we can tell is the Clinton&#39;s know tons of pedophiles, which is surprisingly common with people in powerful positions and basically always has been. However full blown rings usually attract attention once they get big. Sure, you have dirt on hundreds of pedos, but once one is caught doing something outside the ring (and pedos aren&#39;t exactly the best at impulse control...) they&#39;ll lean on their powerful friends to make it disappear or use their names as leverage.</p>

<p>The symbols are a great touch but something out of the da vinci code. The real issue is you don&#39;t want to be found so you don&#39;t make symbols. The priorities for such a thing would be convenience. An hour with most of the people involved costs over tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. If they&#39;re doing something for fun it&#39;s not a matter of spotting symbols or recruitment, but just doing it. </p>

<p>Honestly, there&#39;s way more evidence of Epstein being a ring leader than anything about the actual pizza place. The dudes are clearly creepy, but I&#39;ve known super creepy people on instagram who write stupid shit just to fuck with people. </p>

<p>That said, I think it&#39;s totally possible Bill fucked on epstein&#39;s plane. It&#39;s not even the only billionaire&#39;s plane he&#39;s had sex on in the last 20 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are able to see it because NYPD was privy to a federal investigation of Wiener emails because it tied to a local case for them. Last month their investors threatened to make everything public if the FBI didn&#39;t move forward. With how slow as molasses investigations goes, if there is an truth to this conspiracy, it can be cleaned up in a week, two thoroughly. But more than a month without any arrests or witnesses pulled in? It has been mopped up enough for the big players. Clinton losing the presidency was probably the best thing that could help the investigation, since it severely weakens the power base, as her camp is directly linked and while Trump has similar issues, he doesnt seem a part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can convince people to start voting for a start. When nearly half of eligible people wont vote in the presidential election, less than a third in the primary, and roughly a third in the last mid-term, it tells the people in power that the majority of the populace doesnt give a shit what they do. People might not feel like their presidential vote matters but every other vote does, local votes matter the most and local elections are least likely to draw voters. </p>

<p>For example, if you dont like what your local police are doing in Ferguson, Mo, maybe vote for officials that lean towards your view. April 2014 12% turnout (mayor of Ferguson unopposed), August 2014 29%, April 2015 election 15%, April 2016 election 19%, August 2016 26%, November 2014 44%.</p>

<p>12%, If you dont vote in even the small elections only shit is going to filter to the top</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top comments on this thread upset me.
I understand that some people are crazy, and that maybe some of the people accused are innocent.</p>

<p>I understand that PII sharing is wrong, and that &quot;witch hunts&quot; can be very dangerous and life destroying for the hunted.</p>

<p>By to say this is <em>ALL</em> bullshit started by &quot;crazy&quot; people is ridiculous.
To say there is no proof is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The proof is there, even if companies are deleting account and trying to hide things, one simply cannot deny that what has been uncovered at least deserves investigating.</p>

<p>And as long as it&#39;s public, which it is, the Internet <em>will</em> investigate. </p>

<p>This pedophile thing is not new, it&#39;s hundreds of years old. It&#39;s undeniable that is has historically been tied to mostly the elite and those in some sort of power. This is a fact. It was part of the societies in those times, and clearly not much has changed but the fact it is not hidden.</p>

<p>I get that giving it the &quot;satanist&quot; label may be in attempt to make it sound more evil than it is.</p>

<p>But this is a fact, rituals did occur, and certain people participated in it. The &quot;High priestess&quot; (forgot her name) has admitted this.
It&#39;s black magic rituals. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, this is the truth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t say anyone has to believe everything involved in this. But to dismiss the whole thing?</p>

<p>That is also ridiculous.</p>

The subreddits were banned because it&#39;s against the rules to run smear campaigns on reddit.  Lynch mobs are evil,  even other evil people want to stop them (except the ones who benefit).</p>

<p>Why do all the posts about Pizzagate have so many comments about how convincing the evidence is?  All the alleged &quot;evidence&quot; did was make me squint a bit and wonder why people considered it so convincing.

<p>You weeded out the fallacies, good job. That&#39;s what crowd sourcing is all about. That&#39;s what <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was about. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, from what I saw, there was a mix of morons and serious people. The morons would believe anything and everything, like the pizza place in their town was somehow also connected. It went out of control. Just like how every conspiracy does. But just because one person believes in one related conspiracy (like the different 9/11 conspiracies or JFK) doesn&#39;t mean they believe in all of them. It is the same with what you linked. </p>

<p>There is still something to uncover with pizzagate, and to neglect it based on a fallacy already weeded out while there&#39;s still a lot to explore ... I think that&#39;s a problem.</p>

Maybe if people had just been investigating then there wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but if you simultaneously investigate and accuse then you&#39;re going to have problems since the evidence you have for your accusations is still being assembled.  In this day and age calling someone a pedophile is serious, you need serious evidence to make that accusation or it will not be tolerated.</p>

If <strong>I</strong> wanted to jump to conclusions without evidence, I&#39;d assume it was drug related, on account of high flying washington types and all their fucking cocaine.</p>

<p>Although I would also believe the current accusations if there was a shred of evidence.  Right now all the evidence points towards a politically motivated smear campaign.</p>

It wasn&#39;t confirmation bias. They were looking through the emails for intent with the illegal server and/or proof of bribery (pay to play). They came across this, did a little digging, and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper.  I also doubt you are the only one that feels that way. It doesn&#39;t make you right.  I&#39;m not trying to insult you in any way but it reminds me of my very religious friends who question things like carbon dating because it goes against their narrative. Pedophiles exist. Human trafficking exists. It&#39;s powerful people that run it. Why is that so hard to believe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is not a movement, it&#39;s an investigation. There are no leaders, belief systems, or public gatherings. We&#39;re just like-minded people looking into a conspiracy theory for answers. There&#39;s nothing to co-opt here, nowhere to send undercover police to incite violence, nothing to oppress but an idea. What are they going to do? Co-opt Reddit? It has already begun, yet here we are still talking about it openly. Soon, this may no longer be a platform for this discussion and the people just move to other places. This is just business as usual. FBI takes over another site? Mass exodus ensues and the ideas follow.</p>

<p>Disinfo is fed into the MSM and social media on a daily basis, that&#39;s exactly what is garnering Pizzagate more attention in the first place. The blatant and comical use of disinfo to suppress Pizzagate is exactly why OP thinks this entire conspiracy theory is a distraction from something more sinister.</p>

<p>That and the fact Alefantis is the ex of David Brock who runs media matters and correct the record (which the wapo did NOT mention how connected he is to a major media power player) means that whatever they and cnn and other mainstream outlets are reporting on is instantly suspect now. Just check out their Dakota Access Pipeline coverage.

<p>I&#39;ve been following this from the very beginning and I DO research my own theories. I formed my opinion on PizzaGate long before MSM even touched the subject, and I did so through my own personal analysis of the &quot;evidence&quot; rather than allowing the popular opinion of this community to influence my opinion on the matter. I love how anytime someone disagrees with you people they must automatically be part of the &quot;brainwashed masses&quot; and unable to think for themselves.</p>

<p>One huge problem, though, is that law enforcement and the judicial system both have gone out of their way to protect these people. So, now we are left with ordinary citizens asking questions and digging up information.  It would be best to leave it to the professionals, but if the professionals are compromised, then others need to step up.  </p>

<p>the reality check is that both Podesta brothers were a little bit too old to be personally kidnapping children from holiday villas, they were in their mid 60s back then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clement Freud, who died in 2007 and was a known pedophile, was accused by at least three separate girls of molesting them while they were underage. There is a photo that has emerged that many have speculated could be Madeleine McCann playing cards next to what is clearly John Podesta, a few years after she had been kidnapped. Progressive police sketches of what Madeleine might look like at that age are unsettlingly similar. There is also a Fox news clip where they say they know who kidnapped her, but cannot prosecute them due to complications in International law, which is quite odd considering the magnitude of the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Tony Podesta does not associate with convicted pedophiles? </li>
</ul>

<p>Tony Podesta is also friends with convicted pedophile and former House Speaker, Dennis Hastert. Podesta and Hastert did a 3-4 month trip to Japan for the People to People Student Ambassador Program and, according to leaked WikiLeaks emails, they still keep in contact despite Hastert’s heinous convictions. Tony is also rumored to hold his birthday party at Comet Ping Pong of all places.</p>

This is such a classic problem though, you have a group of people doing something and some segment of that group starts behaving badly and it negatively impacts others.

<p>I just want to get this straight, because this seems like a strange concept: you&#39;re so passionately against doxxing that you want to show it by attempting to dox someone? get a life girl.</p>

<p>For one thing, the accounts you listed don&#39;t show a fascination with children and sexually explicit material, do they? And i certainly didn&#39;t list any individual&#39;s social media in a threatening way. Do you not see the difference?</p>

<p>Do you honestly not see the difference? What&#39;s the point you&#39;re trying to make? That doxxing is ok only when it doesn&#39;t have to do with apparent pedophiles?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of &quot;acts like a pedophile&quot; is patently absurd. A guy says &quot;hotard&quot;, posts a pizza dick picture, some guy with fake blood, and his family&#39;s kids, all on a personal account -- this to you is &quot;acting like a pedophile&quot;. You are causing chaos in real people&#39;s lives with this conspiracy nonsense, without any reasonable evidence, based purely on wild speculation. It&#39;s terrifying how this vigilante mob judges others behind a veil of morality. And yet in the face of others calling out your intellectual disregard, you ask them why they&#39;re responding emotionally to you? Because you and the perpetrators of this conspiracy theory are reprehensible.</p>

<p>One of the rules of Satanism is &quot;Do not hurt little children.&quot;  You can easily look that up. It is interesting that there is not anything similar in the ten commandments. </p>

<p>Luciferianism is discussed here:  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism</a></p>

<p>The General Beliefs heading is insightful.  </p>

<p>I am currently reading Illuminati: The Cult that Hijacked the World</p>

<p>It is available as a free pdf.  </p>

<p>It discusses Luciferianism, Freemasonry,  and the Illuminati.  This is what you want to understand to understand what is going on in the world.  </p>

<p>You asked for references and I gave them to you.  At least have the decency to look at them.  It will open your eyes.</p>

<p>The conflict is not white vs. black, Jew vs. Muslim, Protestant vs. Catholic.  These are just distractions to keep us from fighting the real enemy.  </p>

<p>The fight is the super rich vs. everyone else.  When I say super rich, I am not talking about billionaires.  I am talking about the trillionaires that print the currency.  </p>

<p>I am an Atheist, so I understand your point.  </p>

<p>However, if you read about Lucifer, you will see that he wants to be a God.  That is why these people worship him.  They also want to be gods; gods of this material world.  Understanding what THEY believe will give you insight into how they behave.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shut it!!  LOL.  </p>

<p>But movies are often based on real events...  The question is &quot;Did Stanley Kubrick intend for Eyes Wide Shut to mirror real events?&quot;.  There are a ton of discussions about this...  I can guess what your position is, but mine is different based on what other information I have.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the movie is very different from the novel.  Very different...  The question is, why?  </p>

<p>We can forget it, if you like.  I do not want to waste your time.  But, if you have something interesting to say, I would love to hear it.  I am not afraid of being wrong about anything. I hate to think that you have learned nothing from the information I have given you.  </p>

<p>Did you watch the Paul Bonacci interview?  You did not comment about it, so I assume you did not...  </p>

<p>Starting at 8:59-</p>

<p>PAUL BONACCI:  &quot;And, uh, I seen, at the time, Vice President Bush going in and, all he did was, the kid performed oral sex on him and that was it.&quot;  </p>

<p>INTERVIEWER:  &quot;The kids what?&quot;  </p>

<p>PAUL BONACCI:  &quot;Performed oral sex on him and...&quot;</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER:  &quot;The kid performed oral sex on him?  Which kid?  The white kid or the black kid?&quot;</p>

<p>PAUL BONACCI: &quot;Both of them.  Well, first, I seen him at two different times...&quot;  </p>

<p>Eyes Wide Shut seems tame in comparison.  At least it was about adults...  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that maybe the &quot;reality&quot; we are presented with is much different from the true reality?  </p>

<p>In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick uses the colors of the rainbow in certain scenes to represent the world that we, the governed see.  The scenes that involve the secret cult are less colorful because it represents reality.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you want to go where the rainbow ends?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. On the attack of the 10 Commandments. The Bible describes a God who didn&#39;t need to address that in the 10 Commandments because it was already addressed in the non-sacrifice of Isaac. In a culture where child sacrifice was prevalent, the story of Abraham and Isaac shows that the Jewish God did not desire child sacrifice. That was established way back at the beginning of the Jewish faith. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They support the protection of the natural world. Both the arts and sciences are crucial to human development, and thus both are cherished. Luciferians think that humans should be focused on this life and how to make the most of it every single day. The ability to recognize both good and evil, to accept that all actions have consequences, both positive and negative, and to actively influence one&#39;s environment, is a key factor.</p>

<p>For Luciferians, enlightenment is the ultimate goal. The basic Luciferian principles highlight truth and freedom of will, worshipping the inner self and one&#39;s ultimate potential. Traditional dogma is shunned as a basis for morality on the grounds that humans should not need deities or fear of eternal punishment to distinguish right from wrong and to do good. All ideas should be tested before being accepted, and even then one should remain skeptical because knowledge and understanding are fluid. Regardless of whether Lucifer is conceived of as a deity or as a mere archetype, he is a representation of ultimate knowledge and exploration: humanity&#39;s savior and a champion for continuing personal growth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain how it is backwards.  They are Freemasons, and the Illuminati is a sub-group of Freemasonry.  The symbolism they use indicates the worship of Lucifer.  They want to be gods in this material world.  If you control the printing of money, then you are essentially a god because you can create money out of nothing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moreso they put the word GOD on the money as a magic trick and people fall right in line. Money is GOD anymore. 
As far as the Lucifer stuff there are many many books on spirituality that you can read to get the whole story. It&#39;s the occult so by name much of it is hidden. You have to do the reading yourself to find what it true for you. 
r/occult is a fantastic sub and the first community I embraced when I began reddit under a different u/ years ago. Give them a shot. 
Also they used to have a link for a library in the sidebar but I looked and couldnt find it. Someone there might be able to give you the name of it because I&#39;ve forgotten but much of the content that you&#39;d need to read would be in there and wouldn&#39;t be the semi fiction from today&#39;s writers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost but the internet gave us all of their secrets. It&#39;s up to us to use it responsibly. Honestly all of that stuff; magick, the mysteries etc is about evolution through responsibility for yourself. That&#39;s the bottom line. Those evil bastards are exploiting a loophole that they don&#39;t think they&#39;ll ever have to pay on. Completely incorrect. They&#39;ll owe big time &amp; find that so long as they harmed others, they&#39;ve harmed themselves in return. Same goes for the priests that abused children etc. they have all this knowledge but no wisdom. Apes. Unevolved apes. 
The golden rule, the golden mean, still applies. Do onto others while the Law is Love. 
Even that last bit, that&#39;s from Crowley and is something JayZ put in a tshirt for dummies;
Do what thou wilt.,. Bla bla .,. Under the Law of Love. 
That love part really effes with being a satanic bastard so they pick and choose what they&#39;ll obey. 
I hope you come to enjoy your occult studies. IMO it&#39;s really all about learning to use Art properly as Art is the first human technology. That&#39;s why so much occult stuff pops up in art, it&#39;s the basis of it. But eyes to see and all that. </p>

Look at what the Kremlin&#39;s been doing with internet media and fake news. You don&#39;t need to look far because you&#39;ve all fucking hooked yourselves up to it on a goddamn mainline. You like it on facebook, you upvote it on reddit, you listen to it on Infowars, and you think you&#39;ve found some fucking rabbit hole showing how evil &quot;the elites&quot; are. No, you&#39;ve found what fucking happens when Russia decides to put it&#39;s intelligence services to work in an offensive capacity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I mentioned the msm. But now that you&#39;ve brought it up yes, media with an actual editorial process is generally more credible than youtube videos, Facebook, and whatever hilarious thing Alex Jones decides to grab onto this week. As for the Russians, they&#39;ve been extremely active with targeted offensive cyber strikes and disinformation campaigns against countries in eastern Europe for years. In a lot of ways they&#39;re a lot better at it than the west, or at least they&#39;ve shown themselves far more willing to wage a low level war for hearts and minds electronically via straight up black propaganda. </p>

<p>That said, I bet you could find a dozen stories written by teenagers in Macedonia that say that Russia would never be so underhanded. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re well sourced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We keep hearing about the Russians, but the internet has replaced the anchorman. There are no verifiable, open source proofs that &quot;the Russians&quot; are doing any of this. Just &quot;trust us&quot;, &quot;our source&quot;, etc. Everything that came up during the election had at least some shred of tangible evidence that wasn&#39;t behind a gatekeeper. Even loosely put together, it&#39;s miles better than &quot;our source&quot;. If the old guard wants to maintain it&#39;s level of credibility with me they&#39;re going to have to be a little more transparent. </p>

<p>If what you say is true, it&#39;s a damn shame the information gate keepers in the US aren&#39;t doing more to recapture credibility with the masses of people who tuned out. </p>

<p>It seems like a ton of circumstantial evidence to not look further in to. Even though there are not photos of John Podesta skull fucking a Haitian kid, when did pedo art become chic and acceptable to decent human beings? What the fuck was going on with that Instagram account? Where can I find more humor in that tone? Because I haven&#39;t seen it before. Are you just sweeping the twittergate day under the rug? Just another unfortunate coincidence? </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know. I would not participate in nor encourage any unlawful behavior in terms of investigating it. It would be one thing for there to just be a pushback against the doxing, but there&#39;s a pushback against everything. I really hope for the sake of random children it&#39;s just the most unfortunate string of coincidences in the history of social media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me clear that up. I view pizzagate, based only on it&#39;s origination in The_Donald and the Wikileaks subs, both of which are so fucking aligned with Russian geopolitical goals and biased against America it isn&#39;t even funny, as entirely without credence. It is literally not worth even reading about or investigating based solely on where it originates. </p>

<p>This goes back to my original post, that banning the subreddit and a &quot;hitpiece&quot; by the Times are entirely reasonable because it&#39;s an idiot theory propagated by idiots who are so far into a media bubble populated by actual russian trolls and people who&#39;ve realized how much fucking money you can make by lying your fucking ass off on the internet that Pizzagate is entirely unworthy of any consideration. </p>

<p>TLDR if you think this shit is legit you need to fucking delete facebook, reddit, and your infowars bookmark because you&#39;re literally the cancer killing this country. This retarded &quot;conspiracy&quot; is emblematic of why we just elected a fucking corrupt facist. </p>

Are they really coincidence or have the hard answers been obscured by layer after layer of propiganda to discredit the truth? How many coincidences do I need to start considering where there is smoke, there is fire? </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just skeptical and know if a DA had that kind of evidence against me, they would at least bring it to a grand jury and start serving supoeanas. In fact, if your not a political big wig in the Democrat party, most convictions are based on circumstantial evidence,  not a smoking gun as the media keeps asking for. </p>

<p>Here is what thirty seconds of research turned up from reputable news sources. Clinton&#39;s association with Jeffery Epstein&#39;s high class Caribbean whore house would be easily more than enough to open an investigation on any other public figure. </p>

<p>Gimme a break, anyone else would be crushed and you couldn&#39;t claim the server ate my homework when the supoeanas were served. How on earth can anyone claim the Clintons arn&#39;t getting special treatment. </p>

<p>Edit- It seems WP has removed most of the photos of the Art which is why you only find photos on underground websites.

<p>I know I can google links but google may personalize the results. So I may not get the same results you do which is what I want. I want to make sure that I&#39;m looking at the exact same source you&#39;re looking at because that&#39;ll make it easier to have a discussion about it if we choose to. </p>

<p>Plus the topic is an emotionally-charged highly political one which means there&#39;s a lot of BS out there to sort through. And doggone it I don&#39;t trust most things I read online. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll look over the links you shared. And again, thanks a bunch!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like Jon Rappoport (Canada Free Press) is the type of guy who gets embarrassed when he looks at a picture of Michelangelo&#39;s David. Here&#39;s what I found.</p>

<p><strong>Tony Podesta</strong></p>

<p>The images that you sent are from Serbian artist Biljana Djurdjevik&#39;s <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/LivingInOblivion.html">Living in Oblivion series</a>. I haven&#39;t found evidence that these are hanging in Tony Podesta&#39;s home. To my knowledge they&#39;re not considered child pornography by American law enforcement. If they are then the FBI is gonna come knocking on our doors in the near future.</p>

</ul>

<p>The one that&#39;s actually hanging in Tony Podesta&#39;s home from the Laura Wainman&#39;s June 2015 Washington Life article <em>Inside Homes: Private Viewing</em> is called <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/LivingInOblivion/6SynchronizedSwimming.jpg">Synchronized Swimming (2008)</a>. If you go to the article, you can see it hanging on his wall.</p>

<p><strong>The Naked Teenagers</strong></p>

<p>From the article of controversy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents&#39; suburban homes.<sup>1</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading the above passage, the author never makes it clear that pictures of naked teenagers are hanging in a Podesta bedroom. It says that multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan are hanging in a bedroom. They might be. They might not be. Given the Jessica Dawson article, it&#39;s unclear. Katy Grannan has a large body of work, and there&#39;s plenty of nudity, adult and otherwise, to choose from. <a href="http://www.katygrannan.com/">www.katygrannan.com/</a>. </p>

<p>If Podesta really wanted to stir things up, he should&#39;ve gotten hold of some Nobuyoshi Araki or Robert Mapplethorpe to stir things up. Maybe leave a copy of Erotica Universalis laying around.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> 
<a href="https://archive.fo/HhWH9#selection-3795.0-3799.56">Dawson, Jessica. &quot;Married, With Art
Tony and Heather Podesta Are a Study in Power Collecting.&quot; Washington Post, <em>23 September 2004</em>.</a></p>

<p><strong>Comments on Jon Rappoport&#39;s article</strong> </p>

<p>Far as I can tell, Rappoport&#39;s article makes him look like a crank. He&#39;s surely doesn&#39;t conduct himself like a journalist (He may be gonzo, who knows?). This article is another online editorial rant, that one rant among millions lucky enough to gain real-world traction. Most of the article is Rappoport attempting to pass off his internal dialogue as evidence of craven and degenerate behavior by politicians and their familiars. I&#39;m not saying that people in DC aren&#39;t degenerates. Surely they are. But Rappaport offers no evidence of that as it relates to Tony Podesta. If anything, the article makes Rappaport look like a puritanical moralizer, the type of guy who&#39;d fly into a righteous fit at any woman discreetly breastfeeding in public.</p>

<p>The thing that tipped me off that Canada Free Press (CFP) is likely not a credible source of information is their tagline: Because without America, there is no free world. First, CFP is a publication advocating for a particular, pro-American view. There&#39;s nothing wrong being pro-American. However, I cannot trust that the information being given is accurate and credible. Second, without America there is a free world among which is Canada, all of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, etc.</p>

<p>TL;DR I found nothing damning on Tony Podesta and I cannot take Canada Free Press seriously.</p>

<p>Were they pizzagaters? Also,  most people would not regard a pizza place that gets donations from George soros,  whose owner is one of the top 50 most powerful people in the political center of the world&#39;s most powerful nation,  and displays art of an ejaculating ping pong player with the motto &quot;shut up and fiuck&quot; as a &quot;normal&quot; pizza place.

<p>About the Clintons,  they might not be paedophiles,  but how often can you fly on the &quot;Lolita express&quot; and hang out with a guy who offered kids to powerful and wealthy folks for sex until you start to draw suspicion?  Trump did the same thing, do you really think he didn&#39;t have sexual with any of Epstein&#39;s girls?  And as for Hillary,  what possible excuse does she have for being connected to Laura Silsby?

That&#39;s just sort of normal human behavior. No one&#39;s feelings are hurt. No one is being paid. My interests are being threatened, and I&#39;m trying to protect them. Calm the fuck down.</p>

<p>There have been accusations on both sides but so far everyone is innocent until proven guilty. One of the women that accused Trump just had a press conference with Gloria Allred to beg Trump not to sue her so I don&#39;t think that one is going to trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve commented on this sub, and I don&#39;t have any evidence or really know where I&#39;m going with this. I just wanted to point out something that I noticed that got me thinking. If there is any truth to pizzagate then it has got to bigger than just one pizza joint in DC and is part of much larger network. </p>

<p>I was watching the video of the Al Smith Charity dinner where I saw Cardinal Timothy Dolan sandwiched  in between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hilary+dolan&amp;amp;biw=1229&amp;amp;bih=607&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVrN-RicbQAhXIy4MKHTC3Bq0Q_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=hillary+clinton+cardinal+dolan&amp;amp;imgrc=H3i5IItWfHZQeM%3A">cutting it up with both</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Dolan is the Catholic Archbishop of New York and took over the role in 2009 as Clinton was finishing up her time as senator.  We all know the problems the Catholic church has had with pedofilia.  The connection I made was Cardinal Dolan&#39;s St. Louis roots.  Less than 5 miles away from the Seminary (where they train priest) in St. Louis is/was a place called <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=dojo+pizza">Dojo Pizza</a>.  The owner has been brought up on child porn charges and makes me wonder if more places throughout the world are directly or indirectly connected to pizzagate. Again, nothing solid, but it got me wondering how deep this whole thing really goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not fake news,  but an effort that was spurred by many,  many connections to paedophile-related material.   The weird symbols, the connections of the owner to the podestas,  who display pedophilic art, some depicting torture,  and who are themselves friends of politically prominent convicted paedophiles such as Denny hastert, the podesta&#39;s boss Clinton&#39;s bizarre connection to Laura Silsby,  who was arrested for stealing Haitian children after earlier thwarted attempts.   Just too much freaky shit has been dug up related to pedophilic activity,  starting from this pizza place that had a painting of an ejaculating man playing ping pong with the motto &quot;shut up and fuck&quot;. Which gives a little credence to the contention that &quot;ping pong&quot; and &quot;Play,  Eat,  Drink&quot; (PED) have sexual connotations. And probably isn&#39;t a great place for kids to have sleepovers.</p>

<p>Anyway,  all this crap attracted attention from people who want to find out what the hell is going on and assumed the worst. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see why this could get to a point of being harmful. Being falsely accused of something like pedophilia if you are innocent can destroy a life. That much is certain. However, I see that we have a group of folks on here who, I believe, have the best intentions. Shit, lets face it, Anyone with a brain can look at the world and know that there are some clear facts. 1: Children are kidnapped and put into conditions of sexual slavery and pedophilia so disgusting as to make you wretch just reading about what may be being done to them. 2: Most likely these children have been taken by a highly coordinated individuals or groups, which require money and logistical support of a nature that would lead me to believe its not one of these dirty weirdos that live in their mothers basement seeking porn on the internet 3: In fact, a large pedophile scandal has already been exposed within the aristocracy of Britain. This includes members of Parlaiment[SIC] and members of high society. To think that this group, who clearly was well coordinated and able to bring to bear forces to protect themselves through coercion and legal hurdles put in place by possibly compromised members of law enforcement, is some sort of minority or aberration, is to blind oneself to reality. 
Something is going on that much is clear. Whether it has something to do with Pizza...well...there is some smoke there. The part of this that seems the most sad is that there are so few in real positions of power, who might be able to do something about this, doing it. Shit, doesn&#39;t it at least feel like there is a cover up? It sure as hell does to me. I don&#39;t want to wait 20 years to have some 30 year old woman recount her abuse on some forum and say that in those darkest hours she wondered &quot; why doesn&#39;t someone help me?&quot; 
We want to help. We want to stop this. We want to expose those who are truly guilty of this. I think it&#39;s worth looking into. 
I don&#39;t want innocent people to be ruined. But where the hell are the people that can do this with legal backing? No-fucking-where. </p>

<p>A deputy headteacher&#39;s haul of 1,500 spycam photographs of young boys undressing was found when he hanged himself after being questioned over indecent images of children.</p>

<p>Martin Goldberg, 46, was found hanged in the garage of his home in Shoeburyness, Essex, the day after he was quizzed by police over child pornography he purchased online, the inquest into his death heard.</p>

<p>When evidence is covered up and professional investigations are never conducted its up to the average joe, the people that never asked for it, to figure out what is going on. No one wants to believe in a pizzagate ESPECIALLY the people who are investigating it but they found too many circumstances that point to a disturbing reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, this &quot;MSM&quot; stuff has to stop. I worked as a reporter, and I know lots and lots and lots of reporters and producers who work at &quot;mainstream&quot; broadcast networks and publications. </p>

<p>I can assure you they are not sitting in meetings with freemasons and senators and CEOs coming up with elaborate plans to influence the American people. They are regular working class people making like $50,000 a year, who are just trying to hit their deadlines, fix the leaky shower head, go to the gym more, etc. They write and produce their own material, and I can promise you that if an owner/publisher started telling them what and how to report on stuff, you would hear about it immediately.</p>

<p>When you talk about the &quot;mainstream media&quot; - or &quot;the government,&quot; for that matter - you sound like a potsmoking 15 year old who just watched V for Vendetta for the first time and wants to &quot;bring the system down.&quot; </p>

<p>If you think there is a problem that isn&#39;t getting enough attention in the news that&#39;s one thing, but claiming that they are all working together as part of some massive, nationwide conspiracy is laughably naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my dad teaches journalism. he, at one time, published and edited a newspaper.</p>

<p>I think I can elaborate on my statements, however. </p>

<p>different media outlets have varying levels of power and influence. if the editors of, say, NPR or CNN or <em>NYT</em> would have, at the very least, to face great risk of embarrassment and disgrace if they veered a little too far away from what you would expect to hear or read. I think that it falls into the realm of following unwritten rules of conduct. they do, not want to stray too far outside of consensus reality or anger too many people. </p>

<p>I believe that they do fear a top-down backlash but that they also fear a backlash from the people and guilt and fear at having acted against societal norms. I also believe that the editors, publishers and programmers of those large and powerful outlets also have convictions and beliefs and they would not want, for example, to see Trump get elected President. so no, I do not think that they fear death squads sent out by the Clintons but more the massive social fallout, let us say, among other things. </p>

<p>and the smaller, less influential publishers, while also subject to same internal and external pressures, follow likewise.</p>

<p>I have given a simplified version of what I think just as earlier I gave an even more simplified version.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re confusing &quot;simplified&quot; with &quot;non-specific.&quot; You just made a bunch of general statements based on personal beliefs and assumptions, with no evidence or experience to back them up. Which is my entire point. </p>

<p>Based off your comments, I&#39;ll hazard a guess that you&#39;re a Trump supporter. And, like it or not, your opinions on &quot;mainstream media&quot; are the direct result of his campaign strategy.  Before the primaries even began, his campaign staff planted the seed that the &quot;mainstream media&quot; were a bunch of liars, in bed with the Democrats, and hell bent on bringing him down. It was kind of brilliant, because from then on he had a built-in response to any sort of criticism. No matter what news outlet, no matter what story, he and his supporters could completely disregard it, simply by saying &quot;See? I told you the liberal mainstream media would be out to get me.&quot; It also gave people the green light to start reading and trusting extremely biased blogs and fake &quot;news&quot; sites, which are completely devoid of any journalistic ethics and whose &quot;reporters&quot; have zero credentials or training. </p>

<p>Who, exactly, are the &quot;mainstream media?&quot; Is Fox News in that category? How about the Huffington Post, or Buzzfeed, or Breitbart? Is there an actual list, or is it simply any news outlet that publishes stories you don&#39;t agree with? </p>

<p>Yes, CNN is a turd sandwich, as is Fox. But can you give me one, specific example of the New York Times acting inappropriately, or altering their coverage due to the &quot;top-down pressure&quot; you&#39;re talking about? If their coverage was as biased or slanted as you say, how come there have been no lawsuits filed or retractions issued during the entirety of the campaign? </p>

<p>My point is simple: there is no such thing as the &quot;the mainstream media,&quot; in the sense that people use that term. That&#39;s like saying that candy sucks just because you don&#39;t like Mike and Ikes. And, more importantly, the distrust that people have developed for mainstream news has nothing to do with accuracy or actual corruption. It&#39;s the result of a carefully crafted campaign strategy that encouraged people to disregard any news that they don&#39;t personally agree with, or that doesn&#39;t conform to their established sociopolitical views. Because it&#39;s easier to believe there is a massive national conspiracy involving thousands of journalists and editors than it is to admit your candidate, party, or worldview has a few flaws.  </p>

<p>not at all. I volunteered dozens of hours for Bernie. I voted for him the local primary and then voted for Jill Stein. if I had lived in a swing state, I think I would have voted for Hillary. </p>

<p>personally, I try to read around the spectrum, from all sides.

<p>I will tell you what has influenced my POV on this: the works of the sociologist Erving Goffman, McLuhan, Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary and Noam Chomsky (in <em>Manufacturing Consent</em>), Charles Fort and Adam Curtis (though I do not take his POV as gospel).</p>

<p>also very influential: <em>The Cultural Cold War</em> by Frances Stonor Saunders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for assuming your affiliation. As an independent I get that all the time, and I should have known better. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t cited one example of the New York Times &quot;bias.&quot; If they have a pattern of slanted coverage, as you say, it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. And most large publications do not issue retractions &quot;all the time.&quot; It&#39;s very, very rare, and usually results in at least one termination. Corrections, maybe, but those are simply issued due to a small, unintentional errors, like getting someone&#39;s title wrong. Retractions are issued when a publication has most of a story, or at least some major points wrong, or their sources proved to be liars, etc. </p>

<p>If the Times was as wrong as often as you say, they would have been sued and forced to issue retractions. They even employ an ombudsman, who works as an objective overseer to ensure coverage is fair and accurate. </p>

<p>Off topic, but a lot of the critics you mentioned either focus on society at large or systems of government. Few, if any, would posit that &quot;mainstream media&quot; are working in concert with the government to push an agenda, as you claim. Again, we&#39;re talking about dozens of separate, competing companies. The idea that they can all be referenced as one single entity is ridiculous. </p>

<p>the <em>NYT</em> did not, as far as I know, speak directly about the evidence that the Democrats deliberately undermined Bernie&#39;s campaign. or any of the other material damaging to the DNC and to HRC released via Wikileaks. the MSM spoke of the damaging effect of the leaks and the possible Russian connection but I regard that as a distraction from the main issue. </p>

<p>so that stands out. </p>

<p>it also stands out that, AFAIK, no major US newspaper endorsed Gary Johnson or Bernie Sanders or, for that matter, Donald Trump or Jill Stein. so this would indicate to me embarrassment or shame at the idea of swerving away the consensus, for better or for worse. </p>

<p>and the meat industry hires people to make sure that they slaughter cattle &quot;humanely&quot; but that does not mean that they do the really humane thing and not kill cattle at all. (as you will have guessed, I do not eat meat.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>newspaper publishers and editors live in society, too, and they live under systems of government. </p>

<p>I did not state so. the Saunders book, though, does indicate that you cannot always trust that what you see around you happened just by chance. even if deliberate government and corporate manipulation does not exist, information systems of control exist. the Saunders book showed me that perhaps things which sound completely crazy maybe do happen in the real world. </p>

<p>I would actually read his work on the Eight Circuit Mode of Consciousness rather than dismiss it out of hand. specifically, I think that his description of the terrestrial circuits and of reality tunnels sound plausible. he gets less plausible as he talks about the post-terrestrial circuits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This took about 30 seconds to find. It reports on both the leaked emails and the DNC&#39;s attacks on Sanders:</p>

<p>There are more. Is it possible you don&#39;t really read the Times, and just assume they don&#39;t report on things because that&#39;s what other people say? This is my point in a nutshell. General statements, opinions and assumptions based on personal feelings, rather than actual facts. </p>

<p>This is why people are so uninformed. Everyone believes they are so smart they don&#39;t need to research - they just &quot;know&quot; the truth. </p>

<p>And nobody endorsed Sanders because he <em>wasn&#39;t running for president anymore.</em> Maybe nobody endorsed Johnson or Stein because they weren&#39;t good candidates. Hillary wasn&#39;t either, which is why many publications chose to endorse no one. Saying a publication is biased simply because they didn&#39;t endorse your candidate is about as childish as it gets. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>exactly what I predicted has happened. we have started to get bogged down on a particular claim versus my larger argument. </p>

<p>I would not describe myself as upset about it. but given that Bernie did run as one of two Democratic nominees and given that the editors and publishers could have endorsed him (let alone a Republican or someone else), yes, that does seem to indicate a problem.</p>

<p>if the major media outlets in a country default to a predictable position on who to endorse, I say that indicates a problem. </p>

<p>I brought up Jimmy Savile as an indication that powerful media entities can in fact collude to at least not go on the offensive against a powerful person who committed sexual assault over the course of decades. if it can happen there it can happen here. (I don&#39;t know if any of the tabloids picked up or talked about it.) yes, I do know about the Louis Theroux documentary. even that came out after he would have done the most damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, this &quot;MSM&quot; stuff has to stop. I worked as a reporter, and I know lots and lots and lots of reporters and producers who work at &quot;mainstream&quot; broadcast networks and publications. </p>

<p>I can assure you they are not sitting in meetings with freemasons and senators and CEOs coming up with elaborate plans to influence the American people. They are regular working class people making like $50,000 a year, who are just trying to hit their deadlines, fix the leaky shower head, go to the gym more, etc. They write and produce their own material, and I can promise you that if an owner/publisher started telling them what and how to report on stuff, you would hear about it immediately.</p>

<p>When you talk about the &quot;mainstream media&quot; - or &quot;the government,&quot; for that matter - you sound like a potsmoking 15 year old who just watched V for Vendetta for the first time and wants to &quot;bring the system down.&quot; </p>

<p>If you think there is a problem that isn&#39;t getting enough attention in the news that&#39;s one thing, but claiming that they are all working together as part of some massive, nationwide conspiracy is laughably naive. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t cited one example of the New York Times &quot;bias.&quot; If they have a pattern of slanted coverage, as you say, it shouldn&#39;t be that hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the <em>NYT</em> did not, as far as I know, speak directly about the evidence that the Democrats deliberately undermined Bernie&#39;s campaign. or any of the other material damaging to the DNC and to HRC released via Wikileaks. the MSM spoke of the damaging effect of the leaks and the possible Russian connection but I regard that as a distraction from the main issue. </p>

<p>so that stands out. </p>

<p>it also stands out that, AFAIK, no major US newspaper endorsed Gary Johnson or Bernie Sanders or, for that matter, Donald Trump or Jill Stein. so this would indicate to me embarrassment or shame at the idea of swerving away the consensus, for better or for worse. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Times was as wrong as often as you say, they would have been sued and forced to issue retractions. They even employ an ombudsman, who works as an objective overseer to ensure coverage is fair and accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the meat industry hires people to make sure that they slaughter cattle &quot;humanely&quot; but that does not mean that they do the really humane thing and not kill cattle at all. (as you will have guessed, I do not eat meat.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Off topic, but a lot of the critics you mentioned either focus on society at large or systems of government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>newspaper publishers and editors live in society, too, and they live under systems of government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Few, if any, would posit that &quot;mainstream media&quot; are working in concert with the government to push an agenda, as you claim. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not state so. the Saunders book, though, does indicate that you cannot always trust that what you see around you happened just by chance. even if deliberate government and corporate manipulation does not exist, information systems of control exist. the Saunders book showed me that perhaps things which sound completely crazy maybe do happen in the real world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Tim Leary? Seriously? The guy was an acid enthusiast who simply ranted off the top of his head. He is not an authority on anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would actually read his work on the Eight Circuit Mode of Consciousness rather than dismiss it out of hand. specifically, I think that his description of the terrestrial circuits and of reality tunnels sound plausible. he gets less plausible as he talks about the post-terrestrial circuits. </p>

I view pizzagate, based only on it&#39;s origination in The_Donald and the Wikileaks subs, both of which are so fucking aligned with Russian geopolitical goals and biased against America it isn&#39;t even funny, as entirely without credence. It is literally not worth even reading about or investigating based solely on where it originates. </p>

<p>This goes back to my original post, that banning the subreddit and a &quot;hitpiece&quot; by the Times are entirely reasonable because it&#39;s an idiot theory propagated by idiots who are so far into a media bubble populated by actual russian trolls and people who&#39;ve realized how much fucking money you can make by lying your fucking ass off on the internet that Pizzagate is entirely unworthy of any consideration. </p>

<p>Being friends with 5 convicted pedophiles is circumstantial evidence..</p>

<p>Five? Tony Podesta was friends with Hastert but the relationship with Clement Freud was fabricated. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that either of them knew Epstein either. Who are the others?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>connections to others with similar connections suggests a network. Knowing the history and connections of these people to a larger network is telling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everybody is connected to everybody else, literally. National politicians and their associates are connected to thousands of people. An analysis of Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s appointment book concluded that he had more than 22,000 acquaintances. Podesta&#39;s email on wikileaks has email from more than 4,200 email addresses (not all different people, of course).</p>

<p>Mostly they&#39;re connected because they&#39;re Democrats. We shouldn&#39;t forget that this is the reason they were targeted. This is why Podesta&#39;s email was hacked and this is the reason that hundreds of 4chan and The_Donald creeps examined every aspect of their lives that they could find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha look at yourself. look how angry you get when you&#39;re wrong. &gt;Now look motherfucker
lol whats the matter with you? stop acting like a child.  </p>

<p>I just want to get this straight, because this seems like a strange concept: you&#39;re so passionately against doxxing that you want to show it by attempting to dox someone? get a life girl.</p>

<p>For one thing, the accounts you listed don&#39;t show a fascination with children and sexually explicit material, do they? And i certainly didn&#39;t list any individual&#39;s social media in a threatening way. Do you not see the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s still just artwork. Like the same artwork that has caused &quot;controversy&quot; as long as culture has existed. The same artwork that the Vatican and Hitler supposedly burned. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they are photographs of children having sex being passed around as &quot;artwork.&quot; </p>

<p>These are paintings. Paintings with symbolic meanings to the artist and viewers. Paintings that can be interpreted. Paintings that can be political. You made the mistake of letting someone else do the interpretation for you and now associate it with pedophilia. </p>

<p>Let me give an alternate analysis. If you think it&#39;s absurd that&#39;s fine - because I think your analysis that it&#39;s pedo art is equally absurd. Why can&#39;t the painting represent something about the submission of power and feminism (urgh)? Young women are forced to kneel against &quot;a wall&quot; imposed by society. I mean, it is Washington DC the people we&#39;re talking about are connected to the DNC. The DNC who just ran a candidate on &quot;being the first woman president.&quot; Most of that voter base believe that they lived their childhood in a time when genders weren&#39;t so equal and pushed those barriers. So yeah, not exactly surprised that a symbolic submission of power as young females is a political theme in that base. Since politics is Washington&#39;s culture, it&#39;s also not exactly surprising that women and power pop up in the wealthy&#39;s &quot;taste of the week&quot;. </p>

<p>This whole controversy is even more absurd, because 90% of the questionable artwork doesn&#39;t even have a direct connection to Comet. It&#39;d be like if I went through your Facebook, found some creepy/quirky friends interest, made some &#39;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&#39; jumps to find a questionable link to homosexuality, and posted a comment &quot;proving&quot; that you&#39;re a gay dude. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like it. But I did google Biljana Djurdjevic and her works are actually supposed to reflect the violence and helplessness following the self destruction of yugoslavia.  </p>

<p>I somehow thought that we are past the whole &quot;it is perverted!!&quot; critique of art. Everyone who listens to metal is a satanist, Rock&#39;n&#39;roll is perverted black music.. blahblahblah. humans never learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, the three pictures you&#39;ve linked are not incriminating. I don&#39;t think the art works are an important piece of evidence, just an interesting aside. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in some reading I found <a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/">this summary</a> to be fairly reasonable, although some parts are still too circumstantial for my liking. </p>

<p>The most important parts to me are the &quot;Laura Silsby&quot; part, and the &quot;Epstein Connection&quot; - if these claims are true they are quite damning and not as ambiguous as a lot of the rest.</p>

<p>Although I realise it&#39;s circumstantial I think a lot of the rest is very strange: Jimmycomet&#39;s instagram, the 12 minute monologue video (what the fuck?), and a few specific emails that are very questionable (pool party, hot dog friday, headcount for pizza, did you leave a handkerchief, spirit cooking invitation)</p>

<p>You seem like a reasonable person so I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on each of these. I do admit I enjoy indulging in this fantasy (for lack of a better word) so it&#39;d be good to hear a more critical perspective</p>
