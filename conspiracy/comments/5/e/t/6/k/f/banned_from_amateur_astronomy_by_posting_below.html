       Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote a rather compelling "idiot asking people who know what they are talking about," post where I asked simply for an explanation on to the phenomena in the video, and whether or not anyone else had seen [out of the ordinary] anything in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Thunderstorm Asthma last week... SNOW in Tasmania today?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Today i went back to check my post;
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been banned for the following reason:
we don't do pseudo-science
      </p>
      <p>
       Date the ban will be lifted: Never
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I understand it may "pseudo-science," but I believe any real scientist will concur that we don't fully understand physics, the exact mechanics of the universe etc. We understand alot, don't get me wrong.. but the fact that the NASA EM Drive works and "defies known physics," basically proves my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it very.. odd to be banned FOREVER without even a candid (Australian) reply or anything as a response.

       The mods on most other subs of reddit are nazi's, you cannot talk to them because they are all powerful. No appealing to their human senses, just make another account and re-post, although you may have to generate karma first before being allowed to make any submissions etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A different sub the mod wanted me to apologize, for being right in the point raised after being baited and goaded to death on a propaganda submission, a submission that was removed. I finally insulted back after being called a million names first. The mod still banned me after apologizing. Nothing I would have said would have made any difference. Another sub I was given a death threat and sworn and insulted, but I was banned because I went against that sub's grain and the other user threatening my death weren't, because the mods were children. Another mod banned me for swearing, but told me to fuck off. Reddit has some real asshole troll mods on it.

       Interesting post. Your guess is as good as mine and obviously you would want that question answered

       A few different origins and cultures undoubtedly and like with the rest of humanity this doesn't always translate very well. Then you put ordinary people into positions of authority who are active on their sub's and this soon leads to much more increased bias and it becomes like groups of people causing their own power plays influencing with friendship circles favoring a specific side so much more etc. It is avoiding those subs where you get that kind of influence more, many of those gamer subs, fire them all, the silly teenagers who are prejudice to what they think are such super awesome video games, because they are godlike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully on this sub its mods for the most part have an open mind, because it is conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of this is to blame on how the website handles its systems and the protocols that it enforces. This karma system does not promote free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are nice people and sometimes there are bad people, sadly we can't always choose. But that prejudice is largely found in ham enthusiasts considering what is relevant and then producing more bias, because they weren't acting impartially if they are active on that sub. Then possibly if you are a mod who is responding to a complaint they don't always look at the full comment history and possibly don't understand what it all means or what caused your reaction to cause that ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       However for people to be impartial they shouldn't be active on their sub's, they should be independent and then perhaps it could be fairer. All it takes is some sense of understanding and common ground, something for the most part that we all lack within reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no excuse to ban somebody asking a question like in this topic. Perhaps the content was wrong, but even that should be argued as what was wrong when asking a question and seeking assistance, providing that it wasn't false, fake or a troll. Like hey guys is it true that there are horizontal pussies? Well that topic is obviously banned.

       At the bottom of numerous glaciers green grass and flowers have been found...this indicates to me what ever climate change happened it happened very fast and at a warm enough temperature to catch the "delicate green" plants before their annual die off and then.... well the depth of the glacier tells the rest of the story!  If it were not for changing weather patterns we would still be in the ice age so changing weather does not surprise me.  What does frighten me is the speed at which a weather change can occur based on scientific findings.... I personally think we are ultimately headed into another cold weather age not the other way around and I think many people will be blindsided and perish due to being ill prepared, (if there is anyway to prepare for such an event at all).

       Does that raise any red flags to you? Many webcam images are missing photos in the "opportune," moment lately as well. Look at Antarctica cams.. and it becomes quite evident something irregular is happening in the sky.. whatever it is.

       I have sent an email to the two named-persons emails that were available in their contact area.. I'll see what happens! Something is wrong though worldwide. It's snowing in Japan right now.. snowing in Tasmania (days before summer?) -40C in areas of Russia that do not reach those temperatures in November.. huge floods in Italy, UK. Massive late tropical storm in South America.. animals dying left right and centre.. the JET STREAM has moved! Literally the list is endless and it is accelerating everyday. I'm going to do a big-post on it soon

       I understand the climate changes, I am merely talking about its HEAVY acceleration over the last year and whilst we do not leave a good foodprint, I refuse to believe we are causing it to happen this fast. Putin said recently.. "can you not feeling the impending danger? The world is being pulled in an irreversible direction."

       Don't know why this is such a hard concept to grasp. The scientific community has been warning us of this for 30 years.

       If a big asteroid would hit the earth or the sun would expand I'm sure you would also call it climate change because both would fit the same dogmatic trope which sounds "logical".

       no. i don't believe earth's climate has anything to do with asteroids hurling toward us at thousands of miles per hour from millions of miles away. damn....we need to fix education in this country.

       You seem to not get the point I'm trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       The previous poster mentioned points of extreme weather phenomena and you directly jump to "climate change" because that's the current narrative dogma and it sounds so "logical".
      </p>
      <p>
       But that does not make it
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       . We don't live in an isolated environment where every change to our environment can only come from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before jumping to these preprogrammed conclusions how about good ole observation and collect the facts until we understand the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting the stamp of "climate change" with its implied human cause on every climate extreme is just plain lazy thinking.

       Amazing, I'm surprised you didn't get any photos.  What did the people around you think?  Are there any available photos anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       So far all you've provided are photos of a lens flare and now an anecdote without any pictures.  It will take more than that to convince the hundreds of thousands of people who look at the sky that you've discovered something nobody has any evidence of whatsoever.

       This photo was taken in Copenhagen, Denmark last Saturday about..35 minutes AFTER the sun had set. This is facing SW and the sun had set on the right hand side of this image and was well below the horizon. Yet a distinct 'red' cloud covered sun remained. The strangest cloud formation I've witnessed
