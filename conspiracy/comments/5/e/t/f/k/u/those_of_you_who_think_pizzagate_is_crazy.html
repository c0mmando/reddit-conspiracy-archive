    <div class="md"><p>Is it a pillar of your investigation?</p>

<p>Still no crime, no witness, no transaction, no victims.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Regarding the map</strong>: </p>

<p>It could have been a printed invitation with a map or simply a map with the comet logo, printed on a piece of fabric. That&#39;s not that special and unique.</p>

<p>It would make sense a hipster pizzeria would send a custom printed handkerchief as invitation. </p>

<p>I also know Podesta and some friends participate to some family rally (can&#39;t remember the name), it&#39;s in the wikileaks and on 2 occasions if I remember well. Maybe the &quot;pizza-related map&quot; is actually a rally map and the sponsor of that rally happens to be a pizzeria. Just giving you some stuff to look for if you want to disprove this.</p>

<p>I think those examples are quite rational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start by not calling it &quot;pizzagate&quot;.  That is an utterly ridiculous name.  Also, jumping on events or gatherings as &quot;satanic&quot; is likewise silly.  America has freedom of religion.  A person being a satanist is completely acceptable (for instance, Alex Jones&#39; crowing about the &quot;Luciferian&#39; rites in Bohemian Grove.  Who cares?  It&#39;s not illegal).  Pictures on Instagram are not evidence of crimes unless they depict crimes.  <em>Having</em> certain photos on your Instagram account is meaningless.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shocks me that they would leave their victims alive after all of that - the bizarre patterns of behavior are one of the things that are sort of putting holes in the pizzagate theory for me.  There doesnt seem to be a standard protocol or procedure to all of the behavior.  Why would you leave anybody alive and risk the chances of them telling (regardless of whether you think people would believe their stories or not); especially if they were so willing to kill/sacrifice people in general.  Just really weird and erratic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then just ignore all historical claims by journalists and investigators who made claims before hard proof evidences were brought forward.

<p>I&#39;d even bet that if your child&#39;s  daycare (hypothetically speaking) had a picture of an alien with an erect penis in the boys bathroom saying, &quot;shut up and fuck&quot; and your son came home complaining about his anus hurting, you would just have to chalk it up to &#39;no hard evidence&#39;.  </p>
