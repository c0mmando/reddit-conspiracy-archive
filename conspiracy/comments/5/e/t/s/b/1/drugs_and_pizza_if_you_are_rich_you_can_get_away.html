In other words,  its neophytes only surprised that Podesta and company dick went astray.   There is NOTHING new here,  just a recent possible example,  and so a new generation waking up goes viral.   It would be nice if this WAS the tipping point,  but the cover ups till now have been amazingly effective,  considering that child abuse and drug trafficking have been the order of the day all the way through the 70&#39;s,  80&#39;s,  90&#39;s,  2000&#39;s till now.    What would really be news was if the elites were to lose their cover.    On everything.    Including 9/11.    Including JFK.    Let&#39;s not get loony,  and let&#39;s stay focused on the big picture here folks.    Let&#39;s remember who has been doing FAKE news on every major story for our WHOLE lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any code. I tend to believe it was the high priests of Egypt of the middle dynasties who began the more extreme control of information.</p>

<p>But once ancient man realized if he knew something others didn&#39;t, he could then control what he told them and use that to his personal gain.
 That is why in most religious origins in society a member would bring his or her possessions, metal, food, and offer it to a Code. A deity or symbol that represented the hidden truth and a sense of power. Selling your soul to the devil is analogous to that. Lucifer being knowledge in modern occult. The light bringer, it enlightens you. Etc. The snake in the garden of Eden. The snake a symbol of what is underneath, or the hidden knowledge.</p>

<p>The Lucifer distortion principle in high effect as a symbol of the ultimate sacrifice, your life for the knowledge of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought Crowleys Book of Lies was about this very subject. Read it once ages ago.</p>

<p>We take it for granted we do this sacrifice to Lucifer, in a metaphorical way, everywhere. Not only cultists in their misappropriated sense of power derision. But all the sacrifices  to knowledge in countless other ways. 
I had the day off work, I didn&#39;t sacrifice myself to labor and money and economy today, which is but another sacrifice to Tptb. Instead I will sacrifice some of my life to spew knowledge about the occult and how we have been controlled by tptb.</p>

<p>If you look at everything in that way, of a sacrifice, our religious genesis&#39;s are ingrained in the very things we do with our lives and how we perceive it.</p>

<p>There is always a sacrifice for action. There is a fear and a consequence for everything in reality. Knowledge, is what you experience. So there is an ingrained perception into experience that there must be some sacrifice for having that experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I propose that the establishment of walled communities,  restrictions on tribal migrations,  heirarchical social structures,  replacement of experience based shamanistic rites with belief and status based priestly regurgitations,   exponential explosion of population centers compared to the relatively limited size of migratory tribes,  and a thousand other details of the rise of the age of sedentiary agricultural communities spell the beginning of a thousand perversions.</p>

<p>Consider the anti social changes that can be provoked in laboratory rats and even dogs when the rule system imposed conflicts with a more organic expression of their evolutionary path.  Speaking of Hammurabi,  what would it be like to live without a set of written rules,  and under what circumstances would written rules tend to become valuable to bother with.    Formalized institutional structures.   Artificial personhood.    The invention of god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think living without a set of written rules would be absolute chaos for probably many years. You would most likely only see pockets of &quot;utopia&quot;, and those would exist for the shortest amount of time before being decimated from either within or without, based on the nature of man that&#39;s been defined in the past zodiacal ages. A major shift in human consciousness and self-healing/self-reliance needs to occur to even realistically think about having a chance for anything better than a &quot;The Road&quot; scenario if the curtain finally falls on the present global society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was speaking in the context of the timeline of human history,  the unfolding of modern civilization,  the invention of tools,  of writing.</p>

<p>I am not proposing the abolition of rules at this point,  in fact,  the rule of law and the invention of common law are now offering humans an opportunity that was not there during the reign of organized religion,  specifically period of dominance of the Catholic Church,  with its absolute authority.    Now that we know its humans who make the rules,  not god,  we have to face ourselves.   Face the monsters we have made,  the monsters we have become.    Look at the walls we have built.   We are in the middle of that chaos already.   As for utopia,  I think the model we see of organisms within an environment,   the patterns in nature,  provide a more realistic model of adaptation,  and its not utopia.   Utopia is a relic of an older myth,  the garden of eden,  a period of ignorant innocence.    The apple was tasted,  and there is no longer any reason to feel guilty about it.    God can take a hike.</p>

<p>The curtain might have already fallen on the present version of global as defined by the corporations.   The new version of global,  recently emerged,  has not yet been described,  but it is more based on things that cannot be corporatized.   Resources that cannot be private property.    Our real wealth,  that which makes us civilized.    I am not for the abolition of private property,  but the idea of hoarding stuff and power has shown itself as toxic and corrosive,  and those who have pursued this path are the present crop of psychopathic lords of the drug trade and the perversions that are referred to under human trafficking and sexual predation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In any group there&#39;s always going to be those at the top, by virtue of IQ, luck, strength, etc. Some of these people will due to their nature take advantage of that position. How else can it be? Wanting everyone to be equal is useless, since we&#39;re not. If somehow decent, noble people happened to land at the very top of the heap, it would only be a temporary position. Soon enough, they&#39;d be replaced by some corruptible others. </p>

<p>If we think the present situation is bad, in the sense of achieving a sort-of balance between good and bad, just wait until genetic manipulation allows the elite to essentially become supermen compared to the masses. Viewed from that POV, I guess we still have it good.</p>

<p>Well that and perversion is a powerful tool of manipulation. Being able to manipulate powerful people is in itself a key to power, so it would make sense that this sickness be perpetuated within the ruling class because it serves as a tool to keep the entire system congealed and afloat. </p>

<p>However this is also their key weakness, and should it be revealed, the entire charade collapses. This is where we are. This is perhaps the first chance in human history for the people to remove this sickness from society. </p>
