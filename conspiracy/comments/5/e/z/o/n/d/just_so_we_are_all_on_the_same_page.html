<p>It seems like Podesta got a bit cocky with it when he had a tour group come into his bedroom for an eyefull of naked girl.  Oh, haha, its &#39;modernist&#39; art (i am not going to post examples of this, because its in bad taste).  </p>

<p>What I will post an example of is the type of artwork those who have been abused by elites like Roman Polanski produce when they become adults. <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jXMIsK3dV50/SxWdanj5_YI/AAAAAAAAX-A/RjL5xcMYUXM/s400/347bd017d211041208587.JPG">link</a> The ruling class does not worship the same god that we worship.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hilarious living in the 2000s.</p>

<p>People think that one of the most permanent elite culture perks (pedophilia) just vanished in thin air 1 hundred year ago and that&#39;s it, now to believe such a thing is tin-foil.</p>

<p>Greeks had it as a social institution (don&#39;t remember the word now), it was use for adult males to &quot;love&quot; little ones.
Romans elite would do anything they could come up with in regard to this (to bastard children and low class obv).
Then came christianity and we all know the priests - no reason also to believe the lords refused to partake.
Then 100 years ago all of this vanished... Now if we hear a story of how a priest raped some kiddo we cry horror and want to believe it&#39;s an anomaly. Nope, it&#39;s not an anomaly, it&#39;s working as intended (don&#39;t mean all priests are like this, but i believe in a good fixed percentage), only they don&#39;t want to see it.</p>

<p>Things never changed, they only put some beef on people&#39;s eyes. Or inside their brain, dunno. The more we go on the more the &quot;conspiracy world&quot; seem to enlist more and more obvious things... Not by elite truth seeker choice, but by denial at the bottom of the population. They push in there everything they don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even blame the elite too much these days. Most people would be cattle anyway even without evil masters. A world of idiots is always up for the taking. I mean all they needed to do was crafting the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; meme and slur it everywhere and people loyally stay away. I can&#39;t feel empathy for this anymore really, it&#39;s getting more and more retarded by the day. Aight, sorry for the rant. Good post. These things are the fucking bottom bases of obviousness.</p>

<p>&quot;For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover, or to a lover than a beloved youth. For the principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honor, nor wealth, nor any motive is able to implant so well as love.  Of what am I speaking? Of the sense of honor and dishonor, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work... And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other’s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into this passage before. From what I recall, the Greek word for &quot;lover&quot; used in this text translates to either &quot;lover&quot; or &quot;beloved&quot;. In English, of course, those terms have different connotations.</p>

<p>If one takes the meaning &quot;beloved&quot;, Plato could be seen as writing about fraternal love between men as opposed to an erotic relationship. This doesn&#39;t disprove that he meant an erotic relationship, but I feel the actual meaning is still ambiguous.</p>

<p>Notice the #faggot hashtag where she&#39;s holding a bundle of sticks.
(Note: There is much speculation involved here, but it appears to ring true.)
Both &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;fascist&quot; derive from the Latin root Fasces. Faggot refers to the bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism. When people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.
Child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it&#39;s presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice and bury the past.
Similarly, the term &quot;faggot&quot; has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture that&#39;s still in place by the global fascists today.
Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews, using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.
One last thought... People in a victim mindset, those who have endured trauma, are easy to manipulate. MKULTRA writ large.
Conclusion: &quot;Faggot&quot; was originally a slur for Fascists, who used child rape and torture in Roman times as their command and control structure, just as they are today.

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces">fasces</a> probably plays in to this. It&#39;s a giant axe, used for legal executions by the state in the roman empire, that had a handle made of a bundle of sticks (a faggot) for stability, weight, and strength. The association with the state&#39;s use of this object is likely where the word fascism comes from. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the US congress building has two fasces inside  on the wall, on either side of the main speaking podium: <a href="https://2012patriot.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/fasci.jpg">https://2012patriot.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/fasci.jpg</a></p>

<p>It does make sense that they&#39;d try to normalize &quot;ancient pedophilia&quot; through revisionist interpretation of ancient art and literature. I&#39;d always heard that the slur &quot;faggot&quot; was derived from boy servants who would carry faggots for their masters, but that could be obfuscation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t know although some personalities as far as i know could be suspect like Nerone or Caligula.. for the rest i&#39;m pretty sure the rich  romans partied pretty hard.</p>

<p>edit: found this on a quick look (caligula)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A citizen once insulted him to his face in a fit of rage, and Caligula responded by having him tied down, and beaten with heavy chains. He made this last for 3 months, having the man brought out from a dungeon and beaten, until Caligula and the whole crowds that gathered were too offended by the smell of the man’s gangrenous brain, whereupon he was beheaded.</p>

<p>Caligula’s favorite torture was sawing. The saw-blade filleted the spine and spinal cord from crotch up to chest, and the victim was unable to pass out due to excess blood to the brain. He also relished chewing up the testicles of victims, without biting them off, while they were restrained upside down before him.</p>

<p>He had another insulter and his entire family publicly executed one after another in front of a crowd. The husband and wife were first, followed by the oldest child and so on. The crowd became outraged and began to disperse, but many stayed in morbid fascination. The last of the family was a 12 year old girl, who was sobbing hysterically at what she had been forced to watch. A member of the crowd shouted that she was exempt from execution as a virgin. Caligula smiled and ordered the executioner to rape her, then strangle her, which he did.</p>

<p>He publicly had sex with his three sisters at banquets and games, sometimes on the table amid the food. He was finally murdered by the Praetorian Guard and some senators, leaving the Circus Maximus after the games. His body was left in the street to rot, and dogs finally ate it. He had ruled for 4 years.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pedophiles/satanists can be controlled by blackmail. Get each of your minions on video raping and/or murdering a child, and it ensures that when you give an order, it will be carried out... <em>OR ELSE.</em></p></li>
<li><p>As a prerequisite initiation, it ensures your minions have no moral qualms about carrying out your orders. Kill a family? No problem. Start a war? You got it, boss.</p></li>
<li><p>As an initiation, it ensures that no Good Guys will infiltrate your ranks and expose or disrupt the operation. It&#39;s a filter, a barrier that most of us could never cross even with the best of intentions.</p></li>
<li><p>As OP suggests, it&#39;s a major perk for evil pedophile satanist fucks. Just do what you&#39;re told, and you can rape and kill all the kiddies you want with zero repercussions. These sociopaths lust for nothing more than power. What is a greater expression of complete domination of another than rape, torture, and murder... of children... of <em>babies?</em></p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s so over-the-top evil that even if it&#39;s exposed, nobody in the mainstream will believe it. You might as well try to tell people that zombie dolphins from the planet Zoltar have infiltrated the government.</p></li>
<li><p>It allows the evil elite to hide behind non-pedophile homosexuals, just as they hide behind the jews.

    <div class="md"><p>The satanist angle is where you lose track. MKULTRA had a sub project designed to perfect sexual black mail. They made several high level government officials into pedophiles, filmed them commuting sex acts with children, and then use the footage as black mail to ensure further funding for their projects. Now if you&#39;re the CIA and you see how effective this was, why not do your best to entangle the elite circles of the world into pedophilia? They engrained and addicted the first generation and reinforced it into the culture over the next decade. They Made it available and made it a point of status, envy and power. After awhile they&#39;ve become this self sustaining pedophile power ring. The CIA has washed their hands of direct involvement long ago. Maybe they&#39;ve developed the satanic parts on their own or maybe the CIA introduced it as a medium for relaying this sick ideology. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the part where you&#39;re wrong. They benefit because the religion programs their psychology to better enable them to be psychopaths, with less moral hangups and regret. So starting a war is less of a big deal, if you&#39;ve already ritualistically killed many people with your own hands because the religion you were brought up in required you to do so</p>

<p>I understand what you say. But you must agree that people like that Alefantis, and all the lower grade traffickers, didn&#39;t get any position of power. He&#39;s a fucking pizza parlor for Christ&#39;s sake, can go into White House once a year but no more than that. And those pedo traffickers are dozens, and hundreds in the world.

<p>So what&#39;s the purpose of all their business, if not to run a cult of some sort? A cult where those in power believe, and think they can use to mantain their power? People like that Alefantis or that crazy fucked Abramovic are priests.</p>

<p>Thanks for the rest of the post though. It&#39;s a sacrifice they make for power. The ultimate sacrifice. I think they associate the act with the power they receive from it. So it&#39;s a constant source of power and they are addicted to it. Pure corruption of power. It doesn&#39;t get any more corrupt than taking innocence to maintain the secret.</p>

<p>Like you mentioned too. It&#39;s a contract you enter into. The way Biden was seeming to be offered up that little girl as her dad was sworn in, for example.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible people do that to gain power they would otherwise never achieve.</p>

If anything the elite believe in no god. How could you when you subject your fellow man and Gods supposed creation to such evil acts, seemingly without any empathy or remorse? </p>

<p>Was bohemian grove an occult gathering? Who really knows. Watching Alex Jones video, it seemed more like watching a play, and not a religious ritual (even if it had tons of occultist references). </p>

<p>Im not saying the chances of satanic/occultist rituals occurring in the upper echelons is nil, just that we need to quit playing make believe and acting these people are getting their power over us through the worship of old gods. Its just silly. </p>

<p>They have their power because they are able to dissociate themselves from whatever humanity they had in them, to gain as much money and power as possible without any regard to morals. No religion is real, theyre all man made ways to invoke a feeling of tribalism while secretly (but not really that secretly) holding power over you. Just another way to rule men. The earliest form of government and law. </p>

<p>i have been there many years ago and it isnt what people think . it is worse . once you are in you never get out alive . they dont run the world those above them run it , the people who attend bohemian grove have a master .. it is the whole of the law ( it is not satan or any God ) it is much worse , it is a set of old esoteric teachings from thousands of years ago , the world has secret leaders and a hierarchy above that , people think the &quot;elite&quot; own it , they couldnt be more wrong .</p>

And I have heard of Nixon saying &quot;anyone can be president of the US but only a select few will be president of the bohemian grove&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Baphomet  &gt; the devils idol , an esoteric construct based upon esoteric philosophies (google is your friend) and what the devil worships .</p>

<p>Lucifer&gt; a rebel angel who stood against a dictator who wanted to keep man in bondage.</p>

<p>Illuminati &gt;created by the devil a long time ago , not to be confused with the Bavarian Illuminati who are a counterfeit </p>

<p>this Illuminati (Bavarian) seek to dominate and are as you say Fascists.</p>

<p>the devils  Illuminati were men given spiritual knowledge to awaken man from his slumber and bring a new enlightened age to the world , this knowledge fell into the hands of freemasons who bastardized it over the years </p>

<p>the Bavarian Illuminati are not involved with the worship of the devil nor the real Illuminati .</p>

<p>you are spot on thinking that  Jews are connected to Illuminati but not directly.</p>

<p>in the ancient world it was the teachings of the devil (the rebel angel) who gave knowledge to the jews to free them from mental bondage, the ancient teachings of the jews are almost the same as the real Illuminati  , these teachings (kabbalistic in nature )were lost around the time of king Solomon, the knights Templar are said to have unearthed this knowledge by digging under the great temple , the knights Templar are affiliated  with Freemasonry and where the Elite are said to have gained their knowledge and wealth (think king Solomon&#39;s mine ) and how the teachings of the devil became twisted and bastardized...</p>

<p>the ruling family of the U.K belong to the royal arch freemasons .. and are connected to quite a lot of ruling elite around the world.. this is its self gives weeks worth of reading ..</p>

<p>a good place to start is with a guy called fritz springmeierbut that PDF after taking a glance at it has a lot of interesting things im going to read up on .</p>

<p>to call it satanic is not the truth it is a bastardization of the real spiritual teachings the Devil gave to man and knowing what i do it is easy to see how the Devil became the worlds biggest victim of propaganda , all he did was rebel against a corrupt communist dictator but the church of Rome needs gold , a good guy and a bad guy , guess who pulled the short straw ? </p>

However, I have made some tantalizing discoveries recently that point directly to a mystery cult involving child rape and human sacrifice. It&#39;s not lucifer per-say, it&#39;s not molech. It&#39;s the Templars, which are one of a large pool of gnostic belief systems. Documents detailing the cult of Baphomet have just been translated from Latin into English for the first time in history and along with it photographs of their artwork.

    <div class="md"><p>The guy I responded to said we should blame the humans who perpetrate evil and that worship in any God is silly. This quote alludes to us being just as much a God as an infinite God could be, despite still being human. So worship in a God is simply worship in yourself, and evils perpetrated by mere humans are evils perpetrated by God.</p>

<p>P.S. Even though I capitalized every instance of God I&#39;m not specifically trying to reference the Abrahamic God, just the idea of an infinite power/presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really blaming some being, but rather what infinity entails. Everyone talks about how gods are omnipotent/omnipresent/omniscient, etc. That is, they are infinity.</p>

<p>So getting all up in arms over people who worship something is just as silly as the worship itself. Infinity is infinity, and we are a part of that. What we do is divine, just as God is divine. Evil pedos are just as much a part of this infinity as total saints are. </p>

Only thing I disagree with is that Ba&#39;al/ Satan are necessarily the same, and that they became before God. God is Source, even Ba&#39;al came from God. Any &quot;god&quot; that was not Source, is an entity that came after, and not really a &quot;god&quot; in the same way Source is. I would call them a higher/more evolved entity of some sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said this in another thread recently, but I&#39;ll say it again here.</p>

<p>God, LORD Almighty, Father in heaven, ordered the Israelites to clear the promised land. Joshua was unsuccessful, for the people did not listen to God. Thus the Canaanite pagan god orgy and child sacrifice practices which still permeates our society today.  Satan is the deceiver, not exactly a false idol.</p>

<p>You and others are dead on though when it comes to &quot;privilege,&quot; &quot;bonding them together,&quot; &quot;form of blackmail,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Finally, I just watched a PizzaGate video in this sub before checking out this thread, and it ended with a powerful quote from the Word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.&quot;  - Ephesians 5</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also include a less important quote for my brothers and sisters here who have yet come to know God and are still unaware of the devil.</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#39;t exist.&quot; - Keyser Söze, Usual Suspects</p>

<p>And finally:</p>

<p>&quot;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.&quot; - James 4</p>

<p>There may be a God type figure, or maybe not, but either way the bible is bullshit and makes no sense and that means the supposed devil is a myth as we know him aswell.</p>

<p>With it being so prevalent in elite circles, I don&#39;t even think we can claim that they don&#39;t exist with 100% certainty, anyways. The popular views of them are probably false if they were to exist, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I am not dismissing Gods, devils, spirits, angels etc etc etc.... As I cannot prove they exist or don&#39;t exist. But I can apply logic to the bible and make a decision on whether it is true or not. I have read the bible many times and none of it adds up. The way they portray their God and the reality around us have no consistency nor do they validate each other.</p>

<p>The only way you can support a christian God of peace and love in this day and age is to grasp at straws. Whereas to disprove the christian God all you have to do is open your eyes and ears and its quite obvious the christian faith (as presented and enforced) is a complete lie.</p>

<p>Atheists and christians are both wrong because neither have anything to validate their claims. I cant speak for other religions because my knowledge of, say the Koran for example, is greatly lacking and my views therefore are uninformed and irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to me none of this dark arts satanist stuff is real. Mysticism holds no real power, even if they are doing their own rituals.</p>

<p>And the only reason they engage in this stuff is because if you give a human too much power they start doing fucked up things. Humans are capable of the worst of atrocities. It&#39;s in our nature to be capable of both good and bad, the same as how fire can either destroy or help create. </p>

<p>If they are practicing some ancient religion it&#39;s in their heads and they gain no benefit from it. And there&#39;s no proof otherwise besides anonymous people here who claim anecdotal evidence that I can&#39;t take at face value. </p>

It&#39;s a giant axe, used for legal executions by the state in the roman empire, that had a handle made of a bundle of sticks (a faggot) for stability, weight, and strength. The association with the state&#39;s use of this object is likely where the word fascism comes from. </p>
