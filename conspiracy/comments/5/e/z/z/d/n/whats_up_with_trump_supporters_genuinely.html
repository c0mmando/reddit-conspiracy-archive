       Not a Clinton supporter by the way. I hate them both, although I hate Clinton much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a smooth-talking psychopath billionaire who has stated he wants to increase government spying and thinks we should torture our enemies for information regardless of if it works or not, and yet his supporters are cult like. You're not allowed to criticize Trump AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       These loons honestly believe he's going to lock Hillary up too. Hahahaha they're so dumb they don't even realize he was just pandering to get their votes. He's been close friends with the Clintons for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they mentally retarded? Are they gullible? What is going on? He's going to sell us out just like Hillary would have sold us out.

       Because they confuse Nationalism with Patriotism. Because they consider cable news and YouTube to be credible sources of information. Because he's on the TV. Because they don't actually understand outsourcing, bankruptcy loopholes and inheritances. But mostly, because they don't read, travel or breathe through thier noses....

       Gullible and incapable of critical thought thanks to the US public educational system. They are indoctrinated into a "football mentality." You are either with 'em or against 'em - there is no abstention.

       But surprise! Trump absolutely does not want the job, but his ego wants to be able to say that he won the election (people love him!) and he had the job (most powerful position in the world!). He's not interested in executing the mundane details of the office, there's no money to be made, and really the only direction for him to go at this point is down - to start screwing up domestic and foreign affairs the extent to which people  seriously question his suitability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was the salesman, Pence and the neo-con agenda (same old song and dance, my friends) is the real product.

       excellent example of the "knee-jerk" training from the "Dumpster". if you cannot effectively argue and/ or CONVINCE them, do the very next easiest thing and INSULT them... and you and your fellow "dumpster divers" probably constantly genuinely wonder "Gee, we don't seem to be able to win anyone over to our way of thinking... Well, it must be cause they are all CUCKS !" well done, you MUST be "proud" of your self. you REALLY represent EXACTLY what your candidate STANDS for!

       personally always point a flat hand at them. and to be very generous from the beginnings of the Donald, they were deliberately divisive, hateful and rude. later on after some internal power plays several of the more rabidly course mods were let go but there wasn't ever any real change there. many of their posts are at very best inaccurate" unless you believe literally every conspiracy. many are easily PROVEN wrong by a simple look else where. and they DESPISE Politifact, Fact Check, ect calling every judgement "biased"...

       Stereotype them as divisive, hateful and rude. Label all their claims as at the very best inaccurate or a conspiracy theory. Then portray them as not listening to main stream media reason.

       Thats a blanket argument. Alot of people are critcal of trump because he has no real laid out plan. can't deny the fact alot of trump supporters are in some form bigots. Not all of them but id bet a good chunk.

       The flag people are trash, notice the flag is never on a nice car. They are just people that have nothing in their life so they use race as a positive. Both sides are so fucking annoying, I'm a fairly liberal guy, but I hate most of clintons people more than trumps because they are phony, and only using the liberal thing for social standing. They champion shit that is a non issue while ignoring real problems.

       The issue is that those statements you make about Trump are products of the last 50 years of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Trump supporters will ignore anyone who uses that programming in their "intelligent" discussion since that programming is the antithesis of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's such a division right now about thought. Either you're coming from a system that taught you how to think or you're not. I have always questioned authority and felt that the system wasn't right, so I've been able to dodge such programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say I'm no longer a skeptic. Trump may well have just had some insight into America and took a risk with his campaign by betting it all on the strength of the anti-establishment propaganda. We will see in the next 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump campaigned for anti-establishment and apparently enough American voters bought that. He is definitely not a "smooth-talking psychopath billionaire", that's just what his opponents say. Will he deliver? Who knows? Can you see the future?

       By the way, my assessment of Trump is far from unintelligent. What's unintelligent is his cult-like fan base convincing themselves he's who he says he is. He is a fraud. He doesn't wanna fight the establishment, he is the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knew Americans were fed up with "the man" and decided to play off of that.

       In my more charitable moments I like to think that they're simply desperate and will cling to any hope, no matter how ridiculous. But no, they bought it hook, line and sinker. The mainstream news networks appeared to hate him! They made it seem like he was genuinely an outsider. Of course it never occurs to any of them to ask why they would have devoted so much attention to him...
