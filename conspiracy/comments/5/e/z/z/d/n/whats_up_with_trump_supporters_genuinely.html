<p>Trump is a smooth-talking psychopath billionaire who has stated he wants to increase government spying and thinks we should torture our enemies for information regardless of if it works or not, and yet his supporters are cult like. You&#39;re not allowed to criticize Trump AT ALL. </p>

<p>These loons honestly believe he&#39;s going to lock Hillary up too. Hahahaha they&#39;re so dumb they don&#39;t even realize he was just pandering to get their votes. He&#39;s been close friends with the Clintons for decades.</p>

<p>Are they mentally retarded? Are they gullible? What is going on? He&#39;s going to sell us out just like Hillary would have sold us out.</p>

<p>But surprise! Trump absolutely does not want the job, but his ego wants to be able to say that he won the election (people love him!) and he had the job (most powerful position in the world!). He&#39;s not interested in executing the mundane details of the office, there&#39;s no money to be made, and really the only direction for him to go at this point is down - to start screwing up domestic and foreign affairs the extent to which people  seriously question his suitability. </p>

<p>Trump was the salesman, Pence and the neo-con agenda (same old song and dance, my friends) is the real product. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that those statements you make about Trump are products of the last 50 years of programming. </p>

<p>Many Trump supporters will ignore anyone who uses that programming in their &quot;intelligent&quot; discussion since that programming is the antithesis of intelligence. </p>

<p>There&#39;s such a division right now about thought. Either you&#39;re coming from a system that taught you how to think or you&#39;re not. I have always questioned authority and felt that the system wasn&#39;t right, so I&#39;ve been able to dodge such programming. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m no longer a skeptic. Trump may well have just had some insight into America and took a risk with his campaign by betting it all on the strength of the anti-establishment propaganda. We will see in the next 4 years.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Trump campaigned for anti-establishment and apparently enough American voters bought that. He is definitely not a &quot;smooth-talking psychopath billionaire&quot;, that&#39;s just what his opponents say. Will he deliver? Who knows? Can you see the future?</p>

<p>You really wouldn&#39;t &quot;be willing to bet (your) life&quot;. How can you even say that in the same sentence you say, &quot;No, I can&#39;t see the future&quot;? </p>

<p>I know how the world works. I&#39;m not delusional like so many of my fellow Americans. I know the government is controlled by elite globalists who have too much invested in the game. If anyone truly believes Donald Trump was gonna be the one to get rid of them, then I have a bridge to sell them.</p>

<p>Trump is snake oil salesman.</p>

<p>You keep accusing me of being a &quot;mainstream media shill&quot; like his cult following have been trained to do, but I haven&#39;t watched cable news in years. I don&#39;t subscribe to the default subreddits, I have no Facebook and no Instagram. So try again.</p>

Of course it never occurs to any of them to ask why they would have devoted so much attention to him...</p>
