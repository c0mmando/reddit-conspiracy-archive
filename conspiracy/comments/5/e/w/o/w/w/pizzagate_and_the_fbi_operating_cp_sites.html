       So whenever I hear people talk about PizzaGate no one seems to bring up that the FBI has operated known CP Tor sites. I mean I know they made a statement saying it was to deploy malware on the people using the site, but this is r/conspiracy! So I was wondering why no one seems to bring this up?
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI admitted early in the year to operating one site for under 2 weeks in 2015.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=/amp/amp.usatoday.com/story/79108346/&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sLiLzcLQAhUF0oMKHQpXDLEQFggoMAI&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAnbJSw3JYCdX23ht27ftn-06c0Q">
        Here is a USA Today article on it.
       </a>
       (I'm currently on mobile so I'm not sure how the link will work on desktops.  If it isn't working please let me know.) The FBI seized the site,  Playpen,  and began hosting it on their servers. They left the site running,  they let more than 100,000 people access the content.  Of those 100,000 only 1,300 had their true location revealed,  and only 140 of those were charged. But even then many of those cases were thrown out because it over stepped the jurisdiction of the warrant they obtained. I mean great they caught a few,  but because of their tactics  they loss a large amount of cases. Just even the fact that they
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       revealed about 1% of users using this tactic is disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey get this though,  this isn't the first time they've had known CP sites hosted on government servers!
       <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/fbi-operated-23-tor-hidden-child-porn-sites-deployed-malware-from-them/">
        Here is an article on it.
       </a>
       It was revealed that for two days in August of 2013,  not only one,  but
       <strong>
        23
       </strong>
       sites were operating at government facilities.  However the sites displayed a message instead of the usual content of the site, along side a hidden program to help reveal the user's identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this first time they did it, they protected the children that have already suffered on those 23 sites by disabling the content (supposedly).  However in 2015 they allowed the abuse of those children for two weeks by allowing content to stay accessible.  It makes me sick that they would allow anyone to access child pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well okay r/conspiracy, now I have a bit of a conspiracy theory  I want to discuss with you all.  At one point we
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       the FBI had access to these 23 sites and hosted them at a government facility. However they did not allow access to content.  Later they also operated just one site but for two weeks and left content accessible. So this is just what we've been told.  Does it really sound too farfetched that they have done this some other time  without the knowledge of the public?  I don't think so. Who knows what they could actually have done with those sites?  I mean,  with all of this stuff on PizzaGate it's becoming pretty obvious that some higher-ups in the US government are pedophiles.  And it just so happens that the FBI has operated sites of their sick fetish.  I mean come on,  these sites must be so easy for these people to access then! They wouldn't have to worry about someone finding out their IP because guess what?
       <strong>
        They are the ones who are in charge of finding it.
       </strong>
       The fox guarding the hen house if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would seriously love to hear what you all have to say about this.  If you can disprove that this is even a theory,  please do.  I was just curious about why no one else sees to bring this up.  Thank you!

       Jeesh I hadn't seen that. . .  And at a Little Before 3 minutes into that video Grassley  says "We aren't just talking about regular pornography we're talking about  child pornography.  And child pornography is a crime to take down. "  Yikes, that's a real doozy of a slip up if it is one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around 5:20  Grassley also makes a comment about it being bad that its a criminal act to download something.

       Edit: Fixed my caps issue and added a little more!

       And that is why crowd-sourced journalism/investigation will overtake centralized monolithic structures that currently do it. Crowd-sourcing works better whether it be for encyclopedias, operating systems, or criminal investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next step: crowd-sourced tribunals &amp; juries (for crimes against humanity) and crowd-financed sentence execution.
