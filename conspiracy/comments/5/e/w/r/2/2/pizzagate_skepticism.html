    <div class="md"><p>Let me just first ask you this, since when is everybody OK with censorship? Freedom of speech is gone, and nobody gives a fuck. A whole subreddit being banned doesn&#39;t make you just a little suspicious?</p>

<p>Second, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for pizza gate, and even if you want to dismiss that, have you researched anything about pedophilia and the elite? </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for me to comment right now because I feel angry writing this. All people have to do is dig for themselves. </p>

<p>It won&#39;t be hard to start forming the connections. Go through the points made on the post and research them. You&#39;ll find the truth.</p>

<p>Instead you want somebody to sit here and do it for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not mad at you. I&#39;m just not understanding of how people read ONE post on Reddit and assume that&#39;s enough to know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>I also up voted so people can give their input and help you with your search.</p>

<p>But a simple search on pizza 
gate on this sub will give you thousands of links.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually subscribed to that subreddit. The majority of people will not believe shut unless a major new source says something is true. The majority of people refuse to look beyond what the media tells them. So if that&#39;s the case, there&#39;s not much we can do.</p>

<p>If this person really wants to know the truth, they can simply start researching. The problem is most people lack skills for evaluation. They want other people to evaluate for them.</p>

<p>However, they have their doubts, so they come here. They want their doubts invalidated so they feel better, so they can sleep at night.</p>

<p>Who wants to believe this shit? I don&#39;t. It&#39;s so sickening. The handkerchiefs and the references to little girls and boys...and it just makes me want to throw up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is an alt-right conspiracy theory that a pizzaria in D.C. is a hub for a satanic pedophilia ring.</p>

<p>We should not care expect that these people have begun a campaign of harassment against said pizzaria owner and his staff and his friends, and that it&#39;s another glaring example of the alt-rights pention for buying into fake news, absurdist conspiracy theories, and cheap scare tactics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So,  now you know the &quot;fake news&quot;  corporate MSM types are trying to dress this up.</p>

<p>Here is my take:   there is some speculation going on about strangely worded Podesta emails and some other circumstantial evidence.   Nothing solid yet,  but worth keeping an eye on if any new developments.</p>

<p>In the meantime,  there is little doubt from the Hastert,  Sandusky and Savile cases that there is a lot of political resistance to investigating (and then prosecuting) real,  documented,  proven instances of criminal pedophilia.    Its not like the pizza leads are entirely baseless.</p>

<p>It is really hard to question the theory and discuss it critically with it’s believers because of the very poorly defined nature of the theory. I have tried to question individual pieces of the puzzle but the general replies are one of the following:<br/>
1. You need to dig deeper, educate yourself.<br/>
2. Okay you have a point but have you seen THIS.[link to at least 10 other loosely connected pieces]<br/>
3. Shill.<br/>

<p>*I found this introduction unnecessary and pointless. OP did not say much here other than there&#39;s a lot of theories on the subject matter. Well, yeah, there are thousands of emails/connections. It&#39;s going to take some time to research and sift through it all. I get that. However, this introduction just seems too drawn out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I dug deeper and the further into the rabbit hole I got the more and more clear it became that everything is pure imagination. The general problem I have with the theory is that there’s no single narrative and no one piece of evidence that everyone who buys into the theory believes. Everyone who believes the theory has different ideas of what’s real and what’s not, but they all believe some pieces of it. Basically it hinges on everything rather than on a few key pieces. Further on most, if not all, all who believe it will just present pieces rather than cohesive thoughts and actually connecting the pieces.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Pure imagination...really? So Obama just randomly order $65,000 worth of hot dogs. Come on now...</p>

<p>Did you hear anything about Soros funding Comet pizza? </p>

<blockquote>
<h1>The evidence</h1>

<p>I will address most of the ”evidence” that I have found including the commonly linked, the less commonly linked and the obscure evidence used to build the loose narrative by some of its believers. For sure it won’t be all the evidence because there’s just so much that keeps getting thrown in and it takes a lot of time to research and write about, and some of it is in the form of hour long youtube video rants. But I hope I can raise the bar for the conspiracy theorists and their evidence, and I welcome them in showing me more evidence rather than just saying I didn’t dig deep enough, and also to comment on the holes in their reasoning which I will point out. For the non-believers reading this out of interest I hope to show you the quality of the believers investigative work.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*OK. He does little to address the best evidence. He addresses obscure evidence throughout his post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way I can think of addressing the evidence is by rough chronological order of when the pieces appeared. It has been brewing for a long time with questions about the clinton foundation and loose accusations of child trafficking but I believe it really started to take shape with FBIannon.  </p>

<h1>1. FBIanon</h1>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/hgW5q5Kx">http://pastebin.com/hgW5q5Kx</a>  </p>

<p>It is of course impossible to disprove that it was a real FBI whistleblower doing the Q&amp;A and the repeated mantra is ”plausible deniability” which is the reason FBIanon didn’t provide any proof of being in the FBI. Further on he claims that some of the outrageous claims made (like Mossad was behind 9/11, holocaust didn’t happen) is for further plausible deniability. I could probably write an entire post about why I strongly believe it is a clever troll but you can just click the link and read some or all of it and decide for </p>

<p>*Well, they said it here. Read and decide for yourself.</p>

<h1>2. Cheesybay</h1>

<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP">https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP</a> (I feel I need to point out that everything in that link)</p>

<p>*There is way better evidence than this. Not sure why such focus on this? I can link you to better evidence in the thread. Pedophilia amongst the elite has been exposed thousands of times.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>3. Codewords and E-mail leaks</h1>

<p><a href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/191/070/af6.png">http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/191/070/af6.png</a>   
This was the real start of pizzagate as a term. In case you don’t recognize it, it is an anonymous poster on /pol/ giving us the key to solving the puzzle. Every news site or forum post which covers the codewords used in the e-mail leaks has the exact same source for the codewords, an anonymous 20 word post from 4chan, or the screenshot of the post. I think anyone capable of critical thinking should see why this is so weak.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Ad hominim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wrote and dismissed the code words here. It was too long to quote.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Pedophiles use code words. They have to.
<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hot_document/features/2007/the_pedophiles_secret_code/_2.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hot_document/features/2007/the_pedophiles_secret_code/_2.html</a></p>

<p>If these are not code words, then you honestly think they are meant to be taken literally? </p>

<p>A good code word is obscure and difficult to decipher. </p>

<p>If they are code words, but aren&#39;t related to pedophilia, then what are they related to?</p>

<p>So, is it more likely that they are or aren&#39;t code words?</p>

<p>If it is code words, then what are they related to?</p>

<p>You really do not find that suspicious at all?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why all the theories come in. There are going to be many theories with a code. So what is your theory?</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>4. Artwork and Instagrams</h1>

<p>The real eye-catchers which makes for really good clickbait and really brings out strong feelings are the pictures.<br/>
I have tried to discuss it with the believers, trying to reason that a lot of it is artists doing their thing. Some of it is dark humor and a lot of it seems to be jargon. If you look at the pictures while already convinced that they are pedophiles I understand that it must be terrifying. Especially if you’ve never seen those types of artworks before outside of creepy pastas and other conspiracy theories. However if you look around the globe I’m sure you’ll find a few bars in any larger city which has some creepy and morbid artworks on their walls. Either way how you perceive the art is completely subjective and I can’t really argue that it is or isn’t </p>

<p>I believe all of the instagram accounts that were being thrown around turned private really quick, which a lot of believers took as proof that they were on to something. However it turns out an angry mob were sending death threats and accusing the instagrams of pedophilia. I would make my instagram private if that happened as well. And frankly I’m nervous about posting this write-up because I think there’s a high chance of getting doxed even if I.’m using a throwaway.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*This is long but worth it.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rpwpK8irfBQ">https://youtu.be/rpwpK8irfBQ</a></p>

<p>There is no way you can not be suspicious of the Instagram accounts and connections after watching this. If you really want to know the truth, watch this and tell me your thoughts. It made me sick to my stomach.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>5. Satanism and the convicted molesters</h1>

<p>So a lot of the artwork leads the conspiracy theories towards suspecting satanism, canibalism and witchcraft. If you visit voat’s pizzagate discussions you can easily see this. And it is the part of the story that I hope they can just drop entirely because it is so far fetched and unsubstantiated.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Why? What proof is provided here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another angle is that they are all friends with a few sex offenders, it’s a very touchy subject regarding doxing so I won’t name them.<br/>
But how did these sex offenders get caught and convicted if it’s a huge conspiracy, and where are the codewords and satanic rituals in their cases?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*You claimed you researched this. Did you really? Start with the fundamentals of pedophilia and satanism and why they are linked.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Final words</h1>

<p>I hope I managed to make a few good points, maybe convince a few people that pizzagate is a goose chase. </p>

<p>Is there anything which isn&#39;t obscure evidence? I&#39;m looking at the other links you posted:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">http://archive.is/MrsGu</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually did read this before. His reasoning as I see it is: Systemic pedophilia in British Parliament and Catholic Church + Suspicious E-mails + Suspicious Art + Laura Silsby = Investigate systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC  </p>

<p>So the suspicious e-mails are obscure evidence in your words (I call it dogshit/nil).<br/>
The BP and the Catholic Church is okay, we should be vigilant.<br/>
Laura Silsby weird, I can&#39;t explain it, probably the best evidence. I&#39;m not sure what the narrative of the theory is though because she is just brought up as something weird. What is the context, what does it have to do with the art, pizza, codewords, satanism?<br/>
And the last link you sent (vigilantcitizen) is just artwork and instagram analasys. So almost the entire investigation and most of the best evidence is just analyzing art poorly? I&#39;m sorry but that is worse than I thought. Thank you for your reply though.</p>

They are encouraging a style I really don&#39;t approve and that shouldn&#39;t be sold. But now we get on the topic of what is art and freedom of expression... :/</p>

<p>I just not gonna start judging people by how they look or what crappy art they say they like otherwise a lot of innocents with poor/sick taste would be in jail!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t get modern society. Everything goes now...except odd little certain things.</p>

<p>You can fuck dogs, get 30 abortions now, and have the most disgusting art in the world...</p>

<p>But don&#39;t ever say somebody is fat or youre a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get how some things are out raging to people and some aren&#39;t. We censor some things and not others. There are so many double standards. I&#39;m not saying this is you btw. And I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m necessarily against abortion or anything. But our society is so mixed up and it pisses me off.</p>

<p>The same people who will say those paintings/pics are OK are the same who will talk about being offended by any little thing.</p>

<p>To me, the paintings...art? are sick. Do they have a right to exist? Sure. But the implications lead me to certain directions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh I&#39;m 100% with you on this and feel the same. It would be nice if they&#39;d just stop pushing the limits too much but I guess it goes against &quot;art&quot; and &quot;freedom of expression&quot;.... A meatdress is a piece of art and freedom of expression now, go figure! meh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you keep saying is &quot;there&#39;s better evidence than that&quot; without posting them or elaborating.</p>

<p>The FBI symbol link you posted is the one with the triangle and hearts. It doesn&#39;t say anything about hot dogs, breastmilk, pizza, and all the other stuff that came from some annon. </p>

<p>If your code word was so difficult to decipher, it&#39;s not a bunch of beginners who would have figure it out in 2 weeks like &quot;Hey guys, do you think hot-dogs means.....?&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>If you are all that good in deciphering codes, why not all try REAL CODES like the ones from Ed Edward!</strong> </p>

<p>That&#39;s what the FBI means by &quot;hard to decipher codes&quot;. Your pizza code is as obvious as the teenager code to go smoke in secret.</p>
