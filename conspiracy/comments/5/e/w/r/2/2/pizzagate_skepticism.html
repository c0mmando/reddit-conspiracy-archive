       Let me just first ask you this, since when is everybody OK with censorship? Freedom of speech is gone, and nobody gives a fuck. A whole subreddit being banned doesn't make you just a little suspicious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for pizza gate, and even if you want to dismiss that, have you researched anything about pedophilia and the elite?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard for me to comment right now because I feel angry writing this. All people have to do is dig for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't be hard to start forming the connections. Go through the points made on the post and research them. You'll find the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you want somebody to sit here and do it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not mad at you. I'm just not understanding of how people read ONE post on Reddit and assume that's enough to know what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also up voted so people can give their input and help you with your search.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a simple search on pizza 
gate on this sub will give you thousands of links.

       I'm actually subscribed to that subreddit. The majority of people will not believe shut unless a major new source says something is true. The majority of people refuse to look beyond what the media tells them. So if that's the case, there's not much we can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this person really wants to know the truth, they can simply start researching. The problem is most people lack skills for evaluation. They want other people to evaluate for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they have their doubts, so they come here. They want their doubts invalidated so they feel better, so they can sleep at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wants to believe this shit? I don't. It's so sickening. The handkerchiefs and the references to little girls and boys...and it just makes me want to throw up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you realize that if these people are running the world, well perhaps evil is real.

       I didn't write the post, but I'm doing my research as well and I didn't find anything that was incorrect in the post I linked. So I figured, maybe I'm biased from not believing the theory before reading the post, maybe you guys would argue against the criticism.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pizzagate is an alt-right conspiracy theory that a pizzaria in D.C. is a hub for a satanic pedophilia ring.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should not care expect that these people have begun a campaign of harassment against said pizzaria owner and his staff and his friends, and that it's another glaring example of the alt-rights pention for buying into fake news, absurdist conspiracy theories, and cheap scare tactics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So,  now you know the "fake news"  corporate MSM types are trying to dress this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my take:   there is some speculation going on about strangely worded Podesta emails and some other circumstantial evidence.   Nothing solid yet,  but worth keeping an eye on if any new developments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime,  there is little doubt from the Hastert,  Sandusky and Savile cases that there is a lot of political resistance to investigating (and then prosecuting) real,  documented,  proven instances of criminal pedophilia.    Its not like the pizza leads are entirely baseless.

        1. You need to dig deeper, educate yourself.

        So I dug deeper and the further into the rabbit hole I got the more and more clear it became that everything is pure imagination. The general problem I have with the theory is that there’s no single narrative and no one piece of evidence that everyone who buys into the theory believes. Everyone who believes the theory has different ideas of what’s real and what’s not, but they all believe some pieces of it. Basically it hinges on everything rather than on a few key pieces. Further on most, if not all, all who believe it will just present pieces rather than cohesive thoughts and actually connecting the pieces.

        I will address most of the ”evidence” that I have found including the commonly linked, the less commonly linked and the obscure evidence used to build the loose narrative by some of its believers. For sure it won’t be all the evidence because there’s just so much that keeps getting thrown in and it takes a lot of time to research and write about, and some of it is in the form of hour long youtube video rants. But I hope I can raise the bar for the conspiracy theorists and their evidence, and I welcome them in showing me more evidence rather than just saying I didn’t dig deep enough, and also to comment on the holes in their reasoning which I will point out. For the non-believers reading this out of interest I hope to show you the quality of the believers investigative work.

        The best way I can think of addressing the evidence is by rough chronological order of when the pieces appeared.

        It is of course impossible to disprove that it was a real FBI whistleblower doing the Q&amp;A and the repeated mantra is ”plausible deniability” which is the reason FBIanon didn’t provide any proof of being in the FBI. Further on he claims that some of the outrageous claims made (like Mossad was behind 9/11, holocaust didn’t happen) is for further plausible deniability.

        This was the real start of pizzagate as a term. In case you don’t recognize it, it is an anonymous poster on /pol/ giving us the key to solving the puzzle. Every news site or forum post which covers the codewords used in the e-mail leaks has the exact same source for the codewords, an anonymous 20 word post from 4chan, or the screenshot of the post. I think anyone capable of critical thinking should see why this is so weak.

       If these are not code words, then you honestly think they are meant to be taken literally?

       A good code word is obscure and difficult to decipher.

       If they are code words, but aren't related to pedophilia, then what are they related to?

        The real eye-catchers which makes for really good clickbait and really brings out strong feelings are the pictures.
        <br/>
        I have tried to discuss it with the believers, trying to reason that a lot of it is artists doing their thing. Some of it is dark humor and a lot of it seems to be jargon. If you look at the pictures while already convinced that they are pedophiles I understand that it must be terrifying. Especially if you’ve never seen those types of artworks before outside of creepy pastas and other conspiracy theories. However if you look around the globe I’m sure you’ll find a few bars in any larger city which has some creepy and morbid artworks on their walls. Either way how you perceive the art is completely subjective and I can’t really argue that it is or isn’t
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe all of the instagram accounts that were being thrown around turned private really quick, which a lot of believers took as proof that they were on to something. However it turns out an angry mob were sending death threats and accusing the instagrams of pedophilia. I would make my instagram private if that happened as well. And frankly I’m nervous about posting this write-up because I think there’s a high chance of getting doxed even if I.’m using a throwaway.

        So a lot of the artwork leads the conspiracy theories towards suspecting satanism, canibalism and witchcraft. If you visit voat’s pizzagate discussions you can easily see this.

       I actually did read this before. His reasoning as I see it is: Systemic pedophilia in British Parliament and Catholic Church + Suspicious E-mails + Suspicious Art + Laura Silsby = Investigate systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC
      </p>
      <p>
       So the suspicious e-mails are obscure evidence in your words (I call it dogshit/nil).
       <br/>
       The BP and the Catholic Church is okay, we should be vigilant.
       <br/>
       Laura Silsby weird, I can't explain it, probably the best evidence. I'm not sure what the narrative of the theory is though because she is just brought up as something weird. What is the context, what does it have to do with the art, pizza, codewords, satanism?
       <br/>
       And the last link you sent (vigilantcitizen) is just artwork and instagram analasys. So almost the entire investigation and most of the best evidence is just analyzing art poorly? I'm sorry but that is worse than I thought. Thank you for your reply though.

       The FBI symbol link you posted is the one with the triangle and hearts. It doesn't say anything about hot dogs, breastmilk, pizza, and all the other stuff that came from some annon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your code word was so difficult to decipher, it's not a bunch of beginners who would have figure it out in 2 weeks like "Hey guys, do you think hot-dogs means.....?".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you are all that good in deciphering codes, why not all try REAL CODES like the ones from Ed Edward!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what the FBI means by "hard to decipher codes". Your pizza code is as obvious as the teenager code to go smoke in secret.
