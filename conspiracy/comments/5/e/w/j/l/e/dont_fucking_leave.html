First thing I&#39;d do  is never write a post to say let&#39;s leave this Fucking sub. We have won a lot people. Don&#39;t be surprised that the shills will put you off your own beliefs. I know it&#39;s Fucking angry when nobody listens, but this sub has won a election along with wikileaks.  Fuck the podestas.  I want to know where assange is?  Pizzagate sounds so Fucking bullshit worst name ever. In my country today there was a breakthrough a pro footballer came out as abused. This Fucking put more and more of his team mates to come out and admit they have been abused by the same coach. Fuck this Shit and don&#39;t leave progress is working. Conspiracy is getting high on r/all </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all definitely growing. Every time something happens that sparks up this community, more people understand that the truth isn&#39;t as bland as it seems. I&#39;m talking about years and years back. I&#39;m certain many of us grew up during/after 9/11. Many of us have this ingrained in our lives, I&#39;m certain I will never give up whatever movement we have here and across the internet and I&#39;m also certain many other people feel the same way.</p>

<p>All I hope for is that this pedophile thing doesn&#39;t go away, sometimes subjects like this only survive during the peak period of the story. However, if we keep on pushing, someone else will have this ingrained in their life&#39;s and they&#39;ll have something to fight for.</p>

<p>I for one do not accept behavior like this in our society and the details we&#39;ve found so far easily justifies a formal investigation of these people. It should also be noted that we should <em>increase</em> the intensity of investigations we have, formal or open sourced. The more we uncover, the more we see how deep this actually is. This is when we go full-steam-ahead.</p>

<p>I do not care what retribution justifies the behavior, I care about the everyday lifes of these victims. Did you watch the video of the 2 kids talking about being raped, abused and forced to <em>kill babies</em>. Imagine how it is to survive like a young child in these circles. Imagine how much you need to endure. I cannot fathom how a large portion of the media <em>defends</em> the story. I understand that they&#39;re paid but how cannot the journalists/audience see the truth? How? How is it not common knowledge to at least have a peek if what truth is behind the claims? Isn&#39;t it worth the investigation even if you don&#39;t support the theory. Wouldn&#39;t you want to have a investigation just to know <em>for sure</em>? I&#39;m sorry for the rant but I do not have another vent and it just happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest Reddit is becoming too high profile in the efforts to control information by the elites. This sub gets bombarded by useless crap, meme&#39;s and complete nonsense to dilute serious issues. Mod&#39;s don&#39;t stop simple crap like stupid thread titles, caps locked, clickbait BS. The same links get posted 10 times diluting the discussion. I&#39;ve no idea why mods let it go on in the name of free information flow. This stuff is simply another way to hide important issues. Another method of control.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you ask people to continue searching for the truth rather than saying stay here.</p>
