<li><p>The fact that &quot;Domino&#39;s Pizza&quot; has two of the Podesta codewords, could it be that the guy who chose the name did it on purpose and understands the same code? Could he be a child molester or somehow be connected to child molesters?</p></li>

<li><p>Cardinal Bevilacqua  was found by a grand jury to have excused and enabled the <strong>sexual abuse of dozens of priests on hundreds of children</strong> at the Philadelphia Archdiocese between 1987 and 2003.

Three priests and a parochial school teacher were arrested for the rape and assault of young children in their care. </p></li>

<hr/>

<p>Domino&#39;s Pizza founder, Tom Monaghan, founded Legatus — a Catholic rich business men&#39;s club, which claims &quot;To study, live and spread the Faith in [their] business, professional and personal lives.&quot; <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/legatus-cardinal-anthony-bevilacqua-december-03-2010.pdf">Shortly after founding Legatus</a>, Monaghan asked Cardinal Bevilacqua to become ecclesiastical advisor on the recommendation of the apostolic nuncio to Washington. “It is difficult to summarize the importance of one who has filled an invaluable role,” Monaghan said about his &quot;dear friend&quot; Cardinal Bevilacqua.</p>

<p>Who is Cardinal Bevilacqua? You guessed it.</p>

<p>Cardinal Bevilacqua is one of America&#39;s best known Roman Catholic Cardinals. He is also considered to be one of the most notorious protectors of dangerous sexual predators, in the history of the Catholic Church in America.</p>

<p>This &quot;prince of the Church&quot; served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1987-2003, after having served as Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh from 1983-1987.</p>

<p><a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cardinal-bevilacqua-former-auxiliary-bishop-diocese-of-brooklyn-selected-documents-the-case-of-father-romano-j-ferraro-now-serving-a-life-sentence1.pdf">Memos</a> reveal that during Bevilacqua&#39;s tenure as Auxiliary Bishop at the Diocese of Brooklyn, he <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cardinal-bevilacquas-role-with-pedophile-priest-in-diocese-of-brooklyn-feb-23-2011-the-philadelphia-inquirer-bevilacqua-role-with-pedophile-priest-bared.pdf">covered up</a> and transferred an extremely dangerous predator, Father Romano J. <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cardinal-anthony-bevilacqua-was-auxiliary-bishop-of-diocese-of-brooklyn-romano-j-ferraro-serving-a-life-sentence-record.pdf">Ferraro</a>, who is now serving a life sentence.</p>

<p>In a Final Grand Jury <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grand-jury-report-january-21-2011-archdiocese-of-philadelphia-clergyabuse2-finalreport1.pdf">Report</a> regarding the sexual abuse of children in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, The Grand Jury recommended that three priests and a parochial school teacher be charged with the rape and assault of young children in their care. This resulted in the arrest of 68 year old Fr. Edward Avery, 64 year old Fr. Charles Engelhardt, 47 year old Fr. James Brennan — and 48 year old Bernard Shero (the teacher). All were charged with rape, indecent sexual assault and other criminal charges.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury also voted to charge another priest, 60 year old Monsignor William Lynn, the former secretary to Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, with felony child endangerment. The Grand Jury report describes how Monsignor Lynn endangered children, including the victims in the most recent cases — &quot;by knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children.&quot;</p>

<p>This final Grand Jury report, dated January 21, 2011, is the culmination of the <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/first-grand-jury-report-sep-15-2005-cardinal-bevilacqua1.pdf">first Grand Jury Report</a> of 2005, which exposed the horrific history of sexual abuse of children in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>

<p><strong>The final Grand Jury report accuses Cardinal Bevilacqua of covering up many of these horrific crimes.</strong></p>

<p>INTRO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This report contains the findings of the Grand Jury: <strong>how dozens of priests sexually abused hundreds of children; how Philadelphia Archdiocese officials — including Cardinal Bevilacqua and Cardinal Krol — excused and enabled the abuse</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EXCERPT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even in 2002, Cardinal Bevilacqua continued to mislead the public and give false assurances. Cardinal Bevilacqua continued to try to hide all he knew about sexual abuse committed by his priests even in 2002, after the scandal in Boston drew attention to the problem nationally.&quot; (Page 53, Grand Jury Report, September 15, 2005)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 60, Final Grand Jury Report, January 21, 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 24, 2008, Ms. Hagner notified Ben that the Review Board could not substantiate his allegation. Less than a year later, Ben committed suicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We would like to hold Cardinal Bevilacqua accountable as well. The Grand Jurors have no doubt that his knowing and deliberate actions during his tenure as Archbishop also endangered thousands of children in the Philadelphia Archdiocese. Msgr. Lynn was carrying out the Cardinal&#39;s policies exactly as the Cardinal directed. In most of the cases we reviewed from the previous grand jury report, Cardinal Bevilacqua knew substantially everything that Msgr. Lynn knew about the danger posed by the accused priests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/first-grand-jury-report-sep-15-2005-cardinal-bevilacqua1.pdf">2005 Grand Jury report</a> mentioned Cardinal Bevilacqua&#39;s name 784 times. This final report mentions Cardinal Bevilacqua&#39;s name 102 times.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The horror story isn&#39;t over:</p>

<p>Father Thomas J. <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/legatus-father-thomas-euteneuer-scandal-exorcism-exorcist-human-life-international-pro-life-tom-monaghan.pdf">Euteneuer</a>. is an exorcist — and a favorite in Monaghan&#39;s Legatus circles. Fr. Euteneuer also took on the role of ambassador for the defense of the unborn at Human Life International (HLI) where he served as president, until he became involved in a <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-palm-beach-post-january-15-2011-father-thomas-euteneuer-leaves-the-public-spotlight-includes-you-tube-video-of-fox-news-sean-hannity-interview-on-you-tube-at-earlier-date.pdf">major scandal</a>. He <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/human-life-international-feb-02-2011-responds-to-father-thomas-euteneuers-statements-on-lifesite-news-scandal-exorcism-exorcist.pdf">stepped down</a> because of <a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/father-thomas-euteneuer-lifesite-news-feb-01-2011-statement-dated-january-31-2011-scandal-exorcism-exorcist-human-life-international2.pdf">&quot;a particularly complex situation&quot;</a> which &quot;clouded&quot; his judgment and led him to &quot; imprudent decisions with harmful consequences,&quot; the worst of which was <strong>violating the boundaries of chastity with an adult female who was under [his] spiritual care.</strong> &quot;</p>

<p>Here is the response from the parents of the victim: [&quot;Beyond the &#39;grave&#39;...&quot;](romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/renew-america-father-thomas-euteneuer-beyond-the-grave-a-fathers-and-mothers-statement-about-euteneuer-and-their-gravely-harmed-daughter-feb-21-2011.pdf)</p>

<p><strong>This &quot;particularly complex situation&quot; and &quot;imprudent&quot; decisions appear to have taken place during Euteneuer&#39;s practice of &quot;excorcism&quot; (ndlr hermetic/satanic ritual).</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/legatus-exorcism-and-the-church-militant-book-by-father-thomas-euteneuer-screen-caption-taken-on-february-21-2011.png">Here is a screen caption of his book on sale.</a></p>

<p>In the end, the Grand Jury &quot;Reluctantly&quot; Decides Not to Recommend Charges Against Cardinal Bevilacqua, stating :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cardinal Bevilacqua&#39;s health is also a consideration. William Sasso, his long-time lawyer, told the Grand Jury that the 87-year-old suffers from dementia. Mr. Sasso testified that Cardinal Bevilacqua requires &quot;24/7 nursing care&quot; and rarely leaves the seminary where he lives. He said the Cardinal has failed to recognize Mr. Sasso when he visits. The attorney testified that he has not seen the Cardinal at a public event for nearly three years — not even at the installation of Bishop Senior in July 2010.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In spite of Cardinal Bevilacqua&#39;s &quot;dementia,&quot; he is still &quot;publicly active&quot; as described on December 3 2010 by Tom Monaghan&#39;s Legatus Magazine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although still publicly active on the cusp of his tenth decade, His Eminence Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua, 87, has been retiring from official capacities in recent years — most notably in 2003 as Archbishop of Philadelphia, which he led as one of the most prominent voices of orthodoxy in the Church in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who chose the name Domino&#39;s Pizza? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino&#x27;s_Pizza">Wikipedia</a>, &quot;one day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino&#39;s. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino&#39;s Pizza, Inc. in 1965.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you know what Voltaire thought of the subject? Probably not, as his article &quot;Jews&quot; of the <em>Dictionnaire Philosophique</em> has been systematically removed from all modern editions, even in French. Actually, without the Internet, you&#39;d probably have a very hard time finding it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many “otherwise” great men hated jews! Wonder why that was…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the other people have committed crimes; the Jews are the only ones who have boasted about committing them. They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.</p>

<p>[Jews] are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blonde hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race. – <em>Letters de Memmius a Ciceron</em>, 1771</p>

<p>I know that there are some Jews in the English colonies. These marranos go wherever there is money to be made. But whether these circumcised who sell old clothes claim that they are of the tribe of Naphtali or Issachar is not of the slightest importance. They are, simply, the biggest scoundrels who have ever dirtied the face of the Earth. – <em>Correspondence 86:166, a letter to Jean-Baptiste Nicolas de Lisle de Sales</em>, December 15, 1773</p>

<p>You seem to me to be the maddest of the lot. The Kaffirs, the Hottentots, and the Negroes of Guinea are much more reasonable and more honest people than [their] ancestors, the Jews. You have surpassed all nations in barbarism. You deserve to be punished, for this is your destiny. – A letter to a jew, complaining about the following</p>

<p>Why are the Jews hated? It is the inevitable result of their laws; they either have to conquer everybody or be hated by the whole human race. The Jewish nation dares to display an irreconcilable hared toward all nations and revolts against all masters; always superstitious, always greedy for the well-being enjoyed by others, always barbarous–cringing in misfortune and insolent prosperity.</p>

<p>If we read the history of the Jews written by an author of another nation, we would have sorrow to believe that there were indeed fugitive people of Egypt which came by express order from God immoler seven or eight small nations that they didn’t know; to cut the throat without mercy of a woman, old men, and children with the udder, and to reserve only the small girls; that these holy people were punished of his God when it had been enough criminal to save only one man devoted to the anathema. We would not believe that so abominable people had been able to exist on the Earth. But as this nation itself brings back all its facts in its holy books to us, it should be believed. <strong>– Voltaire</strong>, <em>L’Essai sur les Mœurs</em>, Tome 1, pages 158-9</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Domino%27s%20Bane">Dominoes &quot;could&quot; also be referring to Fentanyl aka Dominos Bane: After killing model/bounty hunter Domino Harvey.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1k1ohd/what_original_euphemism_do_youyour_so_use_for/">User on reddit 3 years ago states &quot;playing dominoes&quot; is a euphemism for sex.</a> </p>

<p>While there might be some other shady shit going on, honestly I have no clue, make sure to research.</p>

<p>i can def see it as some code. the biggest domino you can have is 6-6. Could that mean someone whos of 12 years old? two 6 year olds? etc </p>

<p>Dominos Pizza logo could be representative of a 1 &amp; 2 year old performing pornographic activity?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not saying it was noted in the emails other than one time or so.</p>

<p>im just saying that i could easily see dominos being used as code in the way that i&#39;ve shown as example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting if more than few times. </p>

<p>i can 100% see dominos being used as a code...i guess it can&#39;t be used in emails to detail preference (e.g. 1 Y/O, 2Y/O or 3 &amp; 4 Y/O together etc) but just the mention of dominos can imply the proclivities of the person (unlike with pizza where u can add &quot;flavour&quot; / type etc). </p>

<p>not sure if im explaining myself properly ))</p>
