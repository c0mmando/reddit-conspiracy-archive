       Mossad ran 9/11 Arab "hijacker" terrorist operation
      </p>
      <p>
       By Wayne Paul Madsen
      </p>
      <p>
       British intelligence reported in February 2002 that the Israeli Mossad ran the Arab hijacker cells that were later blamed by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission for carrying out the aerial attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. WMR has received details of the British intelligence report which was suppressed by the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Mossad unit consisting of six Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jews infiltrated" Al Qaeda" cells in Hamburg (the Atta-Mamoun Darkanzali cell), south Florida, and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates in the months before 9/11. The Mossad not only infiltrated cells but began to run them and give them specific orders that would eventually culminate in their being on board four regularly-scheduled flights originating in Boston, Washington Dulles, and Newark, New Jersey on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the "Al Qaeda" cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad's Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to
Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.
The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the "Al Qaeda" cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli "art students," already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab "hijacker" cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.
      </p>
      <p>
       In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg "Al Qaeda" members to Boston. Logan International Airport's security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad â€” International Consultants on Targeted Security â€“ ICTS. ICTS's owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two Mossad teams sent regular coded reports on the progress of the 9/11 operation to Tel Aviv via the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. WMR has learned from a Pentagon source that leading Americans tied to the media effort to pin 9/11 on Arab hijackers, Osama Bin Laden, and the Taliban were present in the Israeli embassy on September 10, 2001, to coordinate their 
media blitz for the subsequent days and weeks following the attacks. It is more than likely that FBI counter-intelligence agents who conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy have proof on the presence of the Americans present at the embassy on September 10. Some of the Americans are well-known to U.S. cable news television audiences.
In mid-August, the Mossad team running the Hamburg cell in Boston reported to Tel Aviv that the final plans for 9/11 were set. The Florida-based Mossad cell reported that the documented "presence" of the Arab cell members at Florida flight schools had been established.
The two Mossad cells studiously avoided any mention of the World Trade Center or targets in Washington, DC in their coded messages to Tel Aviv. Halevy covered his tracks by reporting to the CIA of a "general threat" by an attack by Arab terrorists on a nuclear plant somewhere on the East Coast of the United States. CIA director George Tenet dismissed the Halevy warning as "too non-specific." The FBI, under soon-to-be-departed director Louis Freeh, 
received the "non-specific" warning about an attack on a nuclear power plant and sent out the information in its routine bulletins to field agents but no high alert was ordered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of a paper trail pointing to "Al Qaeda" as the masterminds on 9/11, which could then be linked to Al Qaeda's Mossad handlers, threw off the FBI. 
On April 19, 2002, FBI director Robert Mueller, in a speech to San 
Francisco's Commonwealth Club, stated: "In our investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper â€” either here in the United States, or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere â€” that mentioned any aspect of the September 11 plot."
      </p>
      <p>
       The two Mossad "Al Qaeda" infiltration and control teams had also helped set up safe houses for the quick exfiltration of Mossad agents from the United States. Last March, WMR reported: "WMR has learned from two El Al sources who worked for the Israeli airline at New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy airport that on 9/11, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all civilian domestic and international incoming and outgoing 
flights to and from the United States, a full El Al Boeing 747 took off from JFK bound for Tel Avivâ€™s Ben Gurion International Airport. The two El Al employee sources are not Israeli nationals but legal immigrants from Ecuador who were working in the United States for the airline. The flight departed JFK at 4:11 pm and its departure was, according to the El Al sources, authorized by the direct intervention of the U.S. Department of Defense. U.S.
military officials were on the scene at JFK and were personally involved with the airport and air traffic control authorities to clear the flight for take-off. According to the 9/11 Commission report, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all civilian flights to be grounded at 9:45 am on September 11." WMR has learned from British intelligence sources that the six-man Mossad team was listed on the El Al flight manifest as El Al employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       WMR previously reported that the Mossad cell operating in the Jersey City-Weehawken area of New Jersey through Urban Moving Systems was suspected by some in the FBI and CIA of being involved in moving explosives into the World Trade Center as well as staging "false flag" demonstrations at least two locations in north Jersey: Liberty State Park and an apartment complex in Jersey City as the first plane hit the World Trade Center's North Tower. One 
team of Urban Moving Systems Mossad agents was arrested later on September 11 and jailed for five months at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. 
Some of their names turned up in a joint CIA-FBI database as known Mossad agents, along with the owner of Urban Moving Systems, Dominik Suter, whose name also appeared on a "Law Enforcement Sensitive" FBI 9/11 suspects list, along with the names of key "hijackers," including Mohammed Atta and Hani
Hanjour, as well as the so-called "20th hijacker," Zacarias Moussaoui. Suter was allowed to escape the United States after the FBI made initial contact with him at the Urban Moving Systems warehouse in Weehawken, New Jersey, following the 9/11 attacks. Suter was later permitted to return to the United States where he was involved in the aircraft parts supply business in southern Florida, according to an informe3d source who contacted WMR. 
Suter later filed for bankruptcy in Florida for Urban Moving Systems and other businesses he operated: Suburban Moving &amp; Storage Inc.; Max Movers, Inc.; Invsupport; Woodflooring Warehouse Corp.; One Stop Cleaning LLC; and City Carpet Upholstery, Inc. At the time of the bankruptcy filing in Florida, Suter listed his address as 1867 Fox Court, Wellington, FL 33414, with a 
phone number of 561 204-2359.
From the list of creditors it can be determined that Suter had been 
operating in the United States since 1993, the year of the first attack on the World Trade Center. In 1993, Suter began racking up American Express credit card charges totaling $21,913.97. Suter also maintained credit card accounts with HSBC Bank and Orchard Bank c/o HSBC Card Services of Salinas, California, among other banks. Suter also did business with the Jewish Community Center of Greater Palm Beach in Florida and Ryder Trucks in Miami. 
Miami and southern Florida were major operating areas for cells of Israeli Mossad agents masquerading as "art students," who were living and working near some of the identified future Arab "hijackers" in the months preceding 9/11. ABC's 20/20 correspondent John Miller ensured that the Israeli connection to "Al Qaeda's" Arab hijackers was buried in an "investigation" of the movers' activities on 9/11. Anchor Barbara Walters helped Miller in putting a lid on 
the story about the movers and Suter aired on June 21, 2002. Miller then went on to become the FBI public affairs spokesman to ensure that Mueller and other FBI officials kept to the "Al Qaeda" script as determined by the Bush administration and the future 9/11 Commission. But former CIA chief of counter-terrorism Vince Cannistraro let slip to ABC an important clue to the operations of the Mossad movers in New Jersey when he stated that the Mossad 
agents "set up or exploited for the purpose of launching an intelligence operation against radical Islamists in the area, particularly in the New Jersey-New York area." The "intelligence operation" turned out to have been the actual 9/11 attacks. And it was no coincidence that it was ABC's John Miller who conducted a May 1998 rare interview of Osama Bin Laden at his camp 
in Afghanistan. Bin Laden played his part well for future scenes in the fictional "made-for-TV" drama known as 9/11.
WMR has also learned from Italian intelligence sources that Mossad's running of "Al Qaeda" operatives did not end with running the "hijacking" teams in the United States and Hamburg. Other Arab "Al Qaeda" operatives, run by Mossad, were infiltrated into Syria but arrested by Syrian intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria was unsuccessful in turning them to participate in intelligence 
operations in Lebanon. Detailed information on Bin Laden's support team was offered to the Bush administration, up to days prior to 9/11, by Gutbi al-Mahdi, the head of the Sudanese Mukhabarat intelligence service. The intelligence was rejected by the Biush White House. It was later reported that Sudanese members of "Al Qaeda's" support network were double agents for Mossad who had also established close contacts with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and operated in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Eritrea, as well as 
Sudan. The Mossad connection to Al Qaeda in Sudan was likely known by the Sudanese Mukhabarat, a reason for the rejection of its intelligence on "Al Qaeda" by the thoroughly-Mossad penetrated Bush White House. Yemen had also identified "Al Qaeda" members who were also Mossad agents. A former chief of Mossad revealed to this editor in 2002 that Yemeni-born Mossad "deep insertion" commandos spotted Bin Laden in the Hadhramaut region of eastern 
Yemen after his escape from Tora Bora in Afghanistan, following the U.S. invasion.French intelligence determined that other Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jewish Mossad agents were infiltrated into Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates as radical members of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, the "Muslim Brotherhood" 
agents actually were involved in providing covert Israeli funding for "Al Qaeda" activities. On February 21, 2006, WMR reported on the U.S. Treasury Secretary's firing by President Bush over information discovered on the shady "Al Qaeda" accounts in the United Arab Emirates: "Banking insiders in Dubai report that in March 2002, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Paul Oâ€™Neill visited Dubai and asked for documents on a $109,500 money transfer from Dubai to a 
joint account held by hijackers Mohammed Atta and Marwan al Shehhi at Sun Trust Bank in Florida. Oâ€™Neill also asked UAE authorities to close down accounts used by Al Qaeda . . . . The UAE complained about Oâ€™Neillâ€™s demands to the Bush administration. Oâ€™Neillâ€™s pressure on the UAE and 
Saudis contributed to Bush firing him as Treasury Secretary in December 2002 " O'Neill may have also stumbled on the "Muslim Brotherhood" Mossad operatives operating in the emirates who were directing funds to "Al Qaeda."
      </p>
      <p>
       After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Sharjah's ruler, Sultan bin Mohammed al-Qasimi, who survived a palace coup attempt in 1987, opened his potentate to Russian businessmen like Viktor Bout, as well as to financiers of radical Muslim groups, including the Taliban and "Al Qaeda."
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, this Israeli support for "Al Qaeda" was fully known to Saudi intelligence, which approved of it in order to avoid compromising Riyadh. The joint Israeli-Saudi support for "Al Qaeda" was well-known to the Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah-based aviation network of the now-imprisoned Russian, Viktor Bout, jailed in New York on terrorism charges. The presence of Bout in New 
York, a hotbed of Israeli intelligence control of U.S. federal prosecutors, judges, as well as the news media, is no accident: Bout knows enough about the Mossad activities in Sharjah in support of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, where Bout also had aviation and logistics contracts, to expose Mossad as the actual mastermind behind 9/11. Bout's aviation empire also extended to Miami and Dallas, two areas that were nexuses for the Mossad 
control operations for the "Al Qaeda" flight training operations of the Arab cell members in the months prior to 9/11.
Bout's path also crossed with "Al Qaeda's" support network at the same bank in Sharjah, HSBC. Mossad's phony Muslim Brotherhood members from Egypt and Yemen controlled financing for "Al Qaeda" through the HSBC accounts in Sharjah. Mossad's Dominik Suter also dealt with HSBC in the United States. 
The FBI's chief counter-terrorism agent investigating Al Qaeda, John O'Neill,became aware of the "unique" funding mechanisms for Al Qaeda. It was no mistake that O'Neill was given the job as director of security for the World Trade Center on the eve of the attack. O'Neill perished in the collapse of the complex.Mossad uses a number of Jews born in Arab countries to masquerade 
as Arabs. They often carry forged or stolen passports from Arab countries or nations in Europe that have large Arab immigrant populations, particularly Germany, France, Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Mossad, the successful 9/11 terrorist "false flag" operation was a success beyond expectations. The Bush administration, backed by the Blair government, attacked and occupied Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein, and turned up pressure on Israel's other adversaries, including Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Hamas, and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Israelis also saw the U.S., Britain, and the UN begin to crack down on the Lebanese Shi'a diamond business in 
Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa, and with it, the logistics support provided by Bout's aviation companies, which resulted in a free hand for Tel Aviv to move in on Lebanese diamond deals in central and west Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then-Israeli Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu commented on the 9/11 attacks on U.S. television shortly after they occurred. Netanyahu said: "It is very good!" It now appears that Netanyahu, in his zeal, blew Mossad's cover as the masterminds of 9/11.

       Great info and links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel, was, and is, the primary beneficiary of the 9/11 attacks - because the attacks whipped the US public into a vengeful jingoistic frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel's goal was to take down Saddam (first domino of many), the only problem was that Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, and there was nothing - NOTHING - to link Saddam Hussein to the attacks whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That problem was solved by LIES told by Dubya, Rummy, Colon POW and others whose statements INSINUATED that Saddam was involved - backed up by FALSE intelligence reports supplied by Israel and others, said intelligence known to be false at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who benefited from 9/11? Did Iraq or Afghanistan benefit? Hardly. Nations destroyed, peoples devastated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the US? Did "we" benefit? Only if you consider the loss of thousands of lives and a DEBT of over $2 TRILLION a "benefit" . . . (though there were certain individuals and corporations in the Military/Industrial Complex that reaped MASSIVE benefits from the illegal war)
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, who DID benefit from 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel, obviously. The subsequent destruction of Iraq - followed by the Arab Spring and the take-down of Gadaffi and the assault on Syria ALL greatly benefited the Zionist State, who, at this time, has virtually ZERO enemies in the region that can pose any credible threat to the Racist Zionist Regime.

       Sadly, this topic will receive little attention at the moment because of the "Pi22@g8" scandal... but are these issues necessarily unrelated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly Zionist factions have a bizarre STRANGLEHOLD on US politicians and other prominent personalities... far more than could be expected from bribery alone...

       Wayne Paul Madsen is a known contrarian geopolitical analyst. He's often featured on Infowars. He's been sharing his views for a long time. Of course his analysis is correct.

       That email probably just means that Stratfor address receives his reports because someone subscribed to it.

       Shit. The amount of time it takes to find "the truth" requires more than a simple Google search. To investigate the ethicacy of our Nike shoes, Apple cellphones, organic/free range/grass fed/free trade food, child/slave labor clothes, whether Clinton or Trump is lying, if Snoden is a hero or villain, how close climate change is to no return point, are we really going to lose 50% of our wildlife by 2050, etc., ad nauseam, is simply overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much fucking disinformation out there, as well as negligent reporting that to wade through the bile and trolls online is simply daunting. 
I deleted my Facebook account, I listen to NPR and read Google News and watch John Oliver. I consider myself to be informed, but realistically, with a negligible sphere of influence I just hope that someone else is doing the research because if I started digging...I'd probably be the one that you'd read about in the news; that guy in the bell tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply reading this one article is going to be daunting enough, and with the top comment having 14 upvotes...I don't think I'm alone here. I want to learn, I want to know the truth, but what good will it do me? What can I do? Fuck, we can't even get a fucking president in office that wins the popular vote. WTF is going on with this country? No wonder why Trumpkins won this election, they're so fucking pissed at political correctness and not dealing with fucking Saudi Arabia on a level they should be dealt with, which is "we're not doing business with you because you treat your women like fucking dogs". No. Our government, including Obama and the tree hugging democrats, continues to sell out ethics for oil.

       Yes. Yes it is. And so are so many other things and what do we fucking do?? The most powerful country in the world ....and we can't even do a "democratic" election right. If the US can't do shit right, what's the chances of me making on fucking bit of difference?

       No. No, I don't think so. Can you name one thing we all got behind and pushed forward? One thing that didn't have a fuck ton of endless arguing over? We know the hazards of smoking and eating poorly and the dangers of not exercising, yet we're among the unhealthiest nations on the planet. We pride education but we're stupid. We claim to be logical but our politicians believe in witches and satan. We claim to want to stop climate change...but we're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spending a ton of time figuring out what the truth is would simply outrage me more with an infinite amount of impotent rage. But I'll still read it, simply to educate myself.  I just wish there was someone I could trust who was smarter than me to tell me what the low down is.

       Hi, as for reputable you need to do your own evaluation!
       <del>
        I got them from wikileaks but
       </del>
       they come from various sources. Also, for me it doesn't really matter what the source is, what matters is being able to verify what is said, a lier can also say some truths, so we should never discard something because of the person who said it. Its always better to verify on your own and consider everything. Please share your findings if you do have some spare time to look into this. Unfortunately i dont have a lot of free time to go very deep. Any help would be great, team work people! We're all into this together!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Sorry o thought you were speaking about the post here. On the prosecution subject i did spend a lot of time. I followed the congress investigation since day 1 almost. Also, something that would be great to get our hand on is the congress reports. Recently 3 congressmen released their reports on the subject. 1 of them was Trey Gowdy which reported strictly on the facts. I wasn't able to find them but if you do please share. I saw a very recent interview were they said the released the reports and then Trey asked a reported to do her own homework and read it, that led me to assume its public. Please share it if you find it, i really want to read those reports.

Insomnia, chronic respiratory infections, general pain and discomfort, impotence, flatulence, and bowel complaints were all reported.

         67% of the affected patients were found to be infected with Mycoplasma, and suffered from symptoms similar to the Gulf War Syndrome or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome-like symptoms.

       El Al still stands above the law

       The book about the Bijlmer disaster may still not close. In response to recent theories have room again asked about the position of El Al at Schiphol. The separate status of Israeli aviation society is again under discussion. 
by Reindert Bandara
Following the Bijlmer disaster produced the economic control service, the (then) BVD and customs in 1995 an internal report, called Transit. It showed that a massive transit of arms to and from Israel. At the end of september came this Epistle on the basis of the freedom of information act in the group room of green left. Second mp Farah Karimi: «I have made public the report for a debate on arms transfer policy.» They suggested questions to assess the extent of American arms shipments to Israel via Netherlands have and to find out which third countries exporting to Israel via Schiphol. The United States as a friendly State have no licensing obligation on arms exports through Schiphol. Because Israel would violate the humanitarian and international law, advocates Karimi in her note to ensure transit the Jewish State to submit to an ad hoc licensing obligation in the area of strategic goods. A motion to that effect did not make it. However, D66 and PvdA, SP share the concerns about increasing arms exports via Schiphol Airport: they have insisted on a Dutch arms embargo against Israel (which would change nothing to the American shipments). Green Left immerses himself already in the privileges of the Israeli airline. It was Paul Rosenmöller that cleared mid-1990s together with his colleague Rob van Gijzel (PvdA) to the load paper of 1862 to get flight LY. And, more generally, they wanted to know: which goods imported from New York via Amsterdam by El Al to Tel Aviv? Happened though legal? In its final report a loaded flight, the Parliamentary Committee of Bijlmer air disaster that «where the special position of El Al is experienced in the workplace possible wider than in accordance with the instructions of the Government, the Government here must take corrective action where necessary». The fear is still that El Al its status aparte on Schiphol Airport abused. «The Committee of inquiry said that there exists no legal exemption for El Al», Karimi recalls. «But in reality is that there is no longer a problem!» In early september she introduced that questions to Minister. «The answers I find insufficient, summarily.» Donner left the room know that the Royal military police had no grounds for corrective action at cargo handling of El Al.
Van Gijzel and Rosenmöller remained after the Bijlmer disaster just as long by questions about the load of the disappeared Boeing, the cockpit voice recorder and the special status of El Al at Schiphol to Minister Jorritsma of Economic Affairs there almost crazy. They wanted to know if the Israeli airline the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Air Transport Association to her. According to Velez, the book could still not close. He told the Commission-Macdonald at the start of her work that she had to realize that there are «ever could exist between certain agreements Netherlands and Israel, and that the borders would be determined by what the Commission and could not». The Commission had to carry out the commands-Macdonald were: the load paper of the missing twenty tons of freight get above water, the functioning of the public authorities concerned in mapping and the relationship between health complaints and the disaster. Actually, she only in the second command succeeded. The entire load is never obsolete; There is uncertainty about the original freight documents (house airway bills). About this lye El Al-associate Richard Waldon under oath, as the Commission had to determine. Why no criminal offence no one knows. The Commission-Meijer, who had gone to work on sailing, I came in her quest for the truth indeed on the secret agreements between Netherlands and Israel on El Al flights. Prime Minister Wim Kok wrote in a note after the disaster: «for El Al planes are landing and other runways procedures applied. About this to the public, having regard to the related risks, no communications done.»
Old-Volkskrant-journalist Pierre Hahn writes in his voluminous book Doomsday flight: The concealed secrets of the Bijlmer disaster that El Al each route may choose who it wants to in emergency situations to be able to return to Schiphol. That might explain why his Boeing to the unfavorable course Commander Itzhak Fuks 27, the Buitenveldertbaan, sent, while the air traffic control him expressly recommended for 06, de Kaag Court, to choose. Because of possible terrorist attacks is El Al «unpredictable flight behaviour» allowed. 
The book of Hahn is Green Links do not fail to notice. The Group would like to know more about the fly behavior of El Al and has room questions to Minister De Boer of transport, public works and Water management. Farah Karimi: «In Doomsday flight shows that El Al special routes may fly. I want to know if there is indeed such agreements exist and whether those appointments reason have been the route of the disaster unit about inhabited the area.» Rob van Gijzel has reservations, however, as to whether this rule applies to the disaster: «then had Fuks yet much better for the Zwanenburg course (01) can choose: also an unpredictable route, but much safer.»
But that appointment is final. Hahn concludes in Doomsday flight that the Commission-Macdonald was able to carry out its actual task therefore never. «By the special position of El Al at Schiphol in the field of security and military-strategic area, the Commission itself took away the ability to penetrate to the heart of the matter, namely the fact that for this disaster special circumstances golden. And who had (...) everything to do with the special feature of El Al flights and El Al aircraft, even and perhaps especially in the case of an accident.»
Macdonald acknowledges that he actually had wanted to have more time for the completion of the research and writing of the report. However, the Chairman of the Committee still loaded that LY 1862 an ordinary «citizen flight». Hahn comes to another conclusion: «the freighters of El Al were de jure (official) civil aircraft; de facto (in practice) were the so-called State apparatus, which is not under the Chicago Convention in force for civil aircraft fell.»
State devices, such as military aircraft, apply bilateral agreements. That had consequences for the salvage operation. «Swept under the table that there are Israeli people (...) on the crash site were those there according to Dutch and international law were not allowed. Under table is not that swept in the Bijlmer the access rules applied to a civilian airplane, which the crashed Boeing was supposedly, but for a military plane, which Boeing actually was.»
Rob van Gijzel: «this doubt That El Al separate procedures, was known. Those procedures security measures are all the same, at burger flights, cargo flights. We know that military goods were on board: in that respect, it matters little if it's a civilian plane was or not.» All Israeli aircraft are guarded by El Al Security, tap to the Marechaussee. El Al can take its course. Hahn repeat it yet again: «there is nothing changed. It is not just El Al, also to the Dutch Government, which allows all.» The control is not strengthened, there is only random inspection. Incidentally wants to Green Left also the inspection in the port of Rotterdam. Of the State Secretary for Economic Affairs wants Farah Karimi know on what kind of weapons the x-ray machine scans, or exactly there also NBC weapons (nuclear, biological and chemical). «I want to know if that special position of El Al is used for illegal arms transit. What transporting them and report what they?» She has Donner and the farmer asked an overview of strategic goods and weapons that are found in the random checks at Schiphol and in Rotterdam. For clarity: there were indeed hazardous substances in the crashed El Al-Boeing: DMMP, hydrofluoric acid and isopropanol, the components for the deadly poison gas sarin. El Al handed the Dutch authorities initially freight documents on which the names of these substances were missing. In spite of the resulting reading later that that was based on a misunderstanding, Hahn in his book plausible that the nature of the cargo as far as the toxins concerned indeed had to be kept under the «pet». As El Al unregistered weaponry, it would be what Green Left concerns «actually no longer allowed to take off from Schiphol». And that would also PvdA, D66 and SP may say. Because official should not be used for military flights Schiphol. Which explains why the Dutch Government and El Al so stubbornly stick to the «civil status» of the Boeing paid down in the Bijlmer. The unchecked status of El Al at Schiphol is perhaps no shame for whom Israel at an impending American attack on Iraq cares about (Netherlands delivered in the Yom Kippur war of 1973 also clandestine weapons), but he does hold in that El Al still above the Dutch law. The Bijlmer disaster has shown that up to insecurity has led to heavy load, poor maintenance,: (possible) irresponsible flight path. The El Al plane did not meet the criteria that all other airlines must satisfy in order to be able to land and take off at Schiphol. The hóefde not need to meet.
