    <div class="md"><p>What issues do you take with what he said there? Is he a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; just because he doesn&#39;t believe that the Bush administration itself orchestrated the attacks?</p>

<p>Personally, I believe the Bush administration didn&#39;t blow up the buildings themselves, but possibly allowed it to happen because they knew they&#39;d be able to benefit from the aftermath. We know that certain segments of our intelligence community had information regarding the impending attacks, but they didn&#39;t do anything about it (either because they didn&#39;t realize the severity of the threat or they were being told to ignore it by higher-ups). None of us can know the truth, so we should all be open to reasonable theories and possible explanations rather than forming one opinion in our own minds and criticizing anyone who has a different opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, there was almost certainly some collusion between the hijackers and some members of the Saudi government...that&#39;s pretty much been confirmed. And we also know there&#39;s been collusion between members of the Saudi government and members of the US government. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that everyone within the US government was aware of what was unfolding. This type of stuff is generally compartmentalized so no one who is following orders knows the full extent of what is going on, or how high up it goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manufacturing Consent is just as relevant today as it was in 1988, if not more so. Chomsky is a largely discredited linguist, but he&#39;s definitely contributed a substantial bit to our understanding of politics and information and how the dissemination of both effects public perception. But, like everyone else, he&#39;s only human; a melange of some good ideas, some bad ideas, some astute observations, some naive ones. He shouldn&#39;t be put on a pedestal, he shouldn&#39;t be dismissed all together....read Manufacturing Consent and come to your own conclusion.</p>

<p>lol wut? You clearly know NOTHING about Chomsky. I&#39;m guessing you watched a 1-minute clip of one of his lectures on youtube, which was probably being taken out of context and used by someone else (like Alex Jones) trying to &quot;expose&quot; Chomsky as being part of the &quot;zionist conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>As someone who has actually read several of Chomsky&#39;s books, I can say he&#39;s actually a staunch opponent of Israel and US foreign policy. A lot of his writing is dedicated to criticizing the US government&#39;s hegemony/imperialism. He also criticizes the role of news media in its collusion with the ruling class in order to guide public opinion (manufacturing consent). I don&#39;t always agree with Chomsky, but he&#39;s certainly a very intelligent and well-researched individual that I recommend reading sometime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you see that&#39;s the thing about controlled opposition, disinfo agents and misdirection. They have to seem legitimate, and in order to do that they have to give you some truth to salt the lies. He does seem to be anti-status quo, but the key to seeing misdirection is in understanding the questions that aren&#39;t asked and the answers that aren&#39;t given. For example, his book on Manufacturing Consent -- he talks a lot about &quot;the media&quot; but never examines, for example, who own the media. </p>

<p>Anyway, here is [an important piece](mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf) talking about how disinformation/misdirection works and here is a piece <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/chom.pdf">outing Chomsky as a CIA asset/agent.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is basically a form of Jewish fundamentalism, but Jewish communists convinced/convince themselves that they are &quot;secular&quot;.</p>

<p>Jewish communists use utopian, universalist language to promote Jewish interests and domination.</p>

<p>Communism and the Jewish &quot;reformation&quot; happened around the same time, and the Jews who stepped back from orthodox Judaism started worshipping communism instead.</p>

<p>They cherry-picked one verse of the Talmud to pretend that Judaism is a universalist humanistic religion. &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; is the phrase they cherry-picked from the Talmud. &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; means &quot;repair the world&quot;.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean, &quot;blend in with the goyim&quot;, it means Jews should control the world so that they can &quot;repair&quot; it.</p>

<p>This is the alternate form of Jewish fundamentalism that guys like Chomsky and Bernie Sanders and even Norman Finkelstein live by.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all messianic, self-worshipping, Jewish saviors of mankind. </p>

<p>They all pretend to be critical of Zionism, while gatekeeping for maximum Jewish power in the US and everywhere.</p>

<p>The only thing they hate more than Zionist rule over the US is non-Jewish rule over the non-Jewish US, aka self-rule.</p>

<p>Basically they&#39;re all Jewish nationalists, with the only point of debate being where the capitol of the Jewish empire should be. &quot;Anti-zionist&quot; gatekeepers like Chomsky and Bernie and Jewish Voice for Peace believe the Jewish capitol should be NYC, while Zionists believe the capitol should be Israel.</p>

<p>Sorry, but almost every religion has a similar ideology. The whole premise of a heaven/hell doesn&#39;t work without believing you are the chosen one. </p>

<p>The only person cherry picking is you; making Jewish people seem driven by an archaic logic whilst failing to acknowledge the same presence in other cultures. </p>
