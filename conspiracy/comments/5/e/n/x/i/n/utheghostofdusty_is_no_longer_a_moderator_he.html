    <div class="md"><p>First off, lets act civilly. It&#39;s pretty easy to do, just imagine that you are talking to me face-to-face.</p>

<p>Good. Now, I&#39;m not lying and half quoting me doesn&#39;t support your rather rude attack. You cut off the &#39;to any great detail&#39; which is an important qualifier. Modlogs are pretty limited when trying to understand how mods think and what they argue about among themselves. That&#39;s my opinion and you can disagree but don&#39;t call me a liar. That&#39;s rude and unproveable...because it&#39;s an opinion.</p>

<p>I never &#39;insinuated&#39; there was no proof, I merely stated that a mod attack has been started with no proof...and I don&#39;t like that. That is true. You started the thread and put no proof in it. Don&#39;t be upset when someone tells you that YOUR thread has no proof.</p>

<p>I checked the links you provided and it shows some mod actions and interesting &#39;test&#39; of the rules. I don&#39;t see CTR. I do see mods not entirely agreeing on actions to be taken, something normal in a controversial sub like this.  I could link a million threads that show discussion of controversial topics was fully allowed.</p>

<p>I think we disagree fundamentally. Mods have a tough job and they don&#39;t always agree on how things should be run. Normal stuff for humans really. You need much more proof of a mod pushing one agenda to convince me this mod did something wrong. That&#39;s my personal opinion on how much proof I need for the claim...yours may be very different, and that is fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all load of bullshit, here&#39;s why he quit modding the sub:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, rule 11 is being actively disrespected and undermined by the majority of the mods. Think Lord of the Flies. Liars and trolls are secretly being given carte-blanche to operate here if the mods subjectively like what they are saying. There is no leadership among the team and a majority of them in modmail discussions are nakedly hostile toward some of the sub&#39;s years-old rules but also refuse to even consider changing the rules to eliminate the hypocrisy. Two-faced, cowardly and dishonest behavior IMO, and I hate it, especially in a sub ostensibly dedicated to exposing and shaming that exact kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Earlier this year these same insubordinate mods were responsible for the change of rule 6 to allow people to SCREAM in their titles, aka engage in sensationalism. They did this by actively modding directly against the rule which explicitly forbade all-caps in titles. This went on for months and I complained about their insubordination and all they did in response was insult and evade. Sabotage essentially, and they were rewarded for it rather than booted. Sad situation. </p>
