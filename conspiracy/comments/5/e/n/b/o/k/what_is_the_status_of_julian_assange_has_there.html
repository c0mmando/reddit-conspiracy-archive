    <div class="md"><p>From High Level Insider anon on a Question Session this week:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:<strong>What do you know about Assange&#39;s whereabouts?
Was he captured or killed? etc.</strong></p>

<p>A:<em>Wikileaks is in a holding pattern because there are extensive negotiations going on with respect to who and how many people will be prosecuted by Trump. Assange has always been a creature of the CIA and policy has shifted as a result of the election, so they have to cool it until the dust settles and decisions are made about where to push the public attention next.</em></p>

<p>Q:<strong>Is Assange dead or alive?
How big is pizzagate and is everyone involved?</strong></p>

<p>A:<em>Assange is alive.</em></p>

<p><em>Pedophile rings are very extensive. In excess of 80% of people at the level of Congress, important think tanks, executive positions, leadership of major corporations are on video engaging in pedophilia, gay sex, orgies, etc. Blackmail of this nature is by far the strongest glue holding the old order together.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: From what High Level Insider has talked about, because of the level of corruption of the regime over the many decades, this blackmail is necessary to keep people from turning on each other and holding base &quot;trust&quot;. So TPTB has degenerated a lot to get to this state. Some people probably do enjoy those type of activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because straight men wouldn&#39;t like videos of them having gay sex to be made public. I know techinically they wouldn&#39;t be completely straight after having gay sex but as far as public appearances and personal life goes they would be seen as straight, maybe with a wife and kids (as family is a vote getR). Some people are not gay gay, just into kinks and perverted shit. So publicly they would like to be seen as 100% straight even though they occassionally like bumming or being bummed (which they probably feel dirty about afterwards)</p>

<p>YEAH motherfucks. Some people really need therapy. So do I but for non sexual reasons.</p>

<p>Personally I have no problem with the gays. I just prefer they don&#39;t do gay shit around me because it wierds me out and makes me 100% cringe. Not lesbians though that shit is niceeeee...</p>

<p>That&#39;s understandable. HLIanon is in the same position as FBIanon. The thing I found about HLIanon, is that his claims do have validity to them.</p>

<p>The character Assange isn&#39;t one we should be worried about. This guy has worked with the intelligence community in his hacker days and called 9/11 a false conspiracy (huge red flag). While Wikileaks has certainly shown a lead, there is withheld information and disinfo documents. We should think of possible scenarios and not in a default state of thinking. </p>

<p>And yet we haven&#39;t seen any demands to improve the state of the US/other countries or seen TPTB be damaged in any way besides <em>looking bad</em>. I&#39;m not trying to be negative but the US has only deteriorated further in the time that Wikileaks has been up. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We know that the government IS REALLY POWERFUL. They have some form of control/operation in almost every single part of the world. Also, these guys have performed a mass manipulation of the population and kept them unaware of reality. Under their belt they have performed numerous things such as: Media manipulation, Psyops/MkUltra, Drug trade/Drug experimentation on regular people, Covert operations, 9/11, JFK, Wars, and more. </p>

<p>Do you really think TPTB would actually let something like Wikileaks exist unless they have control over it themselves? TPTB don&#39;t give attention to actual threats to them and they gave Wikileaks a lot of media coverage in its starting years. Why?</p>

<p>Bush &amp; Clintons are part of the CIA chain, who are ultimately of the British. I&#39;m not sure why exactly they Assange/Wikileaks was allowed to release the emails but we can make some sound conclusions: TPTB are pushing/fishing an agenda in terms of Media, some people in the regime didn&#39;t see that Hillary was a good pick and favor Trump (he is controlled opposition btw). Hillary isn&#39;t &quot;harmed&quot; in the way that we think she is from our perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he has been without internet since mid-October and the reason his internet was shut off was so he wouldn&#39;t interfere in the US election. He still has no access to internet and this is worrisome and I&#39;m sure isn&#39;t helping the case for him being alive and in the embassy. However there is a video with John Pilger, in which he claims it was the last week of the US election, here is a link to the interview <a href="https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4">https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4</a> </p>

<p>According to John Pilger&#39;s Twitter that interview took place on October 30th. Here&#39;s the link <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpilger/status/800093317782503424">https://twitter.com/johnpilger/status/800093317782503424</a> </p>

<p>If you trust John Pilger then this would be good evidence that Julian Assange was at least alive and in the Ecuadorian embassy on October 30th. The question that remains is why is his internet still cut-off and why was his lawyer not able to talk to him directly on November 15th at the embassy? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&amp;amp;t=9m55s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&amp;amp;t=9m55s</a>  </p>

<p>Something seems off with this whole picture and I won&#39;t stop asking questions until Assange can provide solid proof of life. I personally find it very hard to believe that no major media outlets have reached out surrounding the released material. However, it may also be pressure from the United States on Ecuador forcing their hand to avoid further politicizing the situation. It&#39;s hard to say for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. It&#39;s gotten to a point where if there is some elaborate cover-up then there are so many players involved, that the theory breaks down. On the other hand, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beyond the US government and people have every reason to be worried.  </p>

<p>I think that above all else; they have taken Julian Assange&#39;s voice away. They have silenced him and that we know for certain. We should really be questioning why his internet hasn&#39;t been restored yet, because there&#39;s a good argument for having it restored by now; the election is over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suspect the internet hasn&#39;t been restored because the transition of power in the US hasn&#39;t happened yet. Personally I&#39;d expect it to be restored after the election but I can see where Biden demanded it be cut until the new president takes power. Everyone fully expected Hillary to win so demanding this extra time makes sense. If Assange was allowed to keep pounding away at Clinton during the transition (and she was was the president elect) it might have affected peoples confidence in who they elected.</p>

<p>Happily Clinton never won and we don&#39;t have to face that doomsday situation.</p>

The LAST person I&#39;d want to visit me if I was hiding from a country, is one of their most popular celebrities.</p>

<p>Especially one famous for, imo, doing nothing considerable other than being a rag doll. 
For some reason that&#39;s the weirdest part to me, why her of all people?</p>

<p>All they would have to do is monitor the Cell towers closest to the embassy, then look for a device that is constantly connected, filter out known numbers of embassy staff and you will isolate the device / number</p>

<p>If you believe the theory of the counter coup (like from Jack P.)  Using the leaks to help Trump get elected, they always said it was the FBI that wanted Trump (whether they liked him a lot or they wanted him because he was not Hillary, they didn&#39;t say) and the CIA wanted Hillary.  </p>

<p>If that is the case, why would the CIA use Assange and wikileaks to release items that would harm Hillary? </p>

<p>no, people should ignore the post i replied to using a fucking anon as as a source and claiming that assange is alive with no proof</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s understandable. HLIanon is in the same position as FBIanon. The thing I found about HLIanon, is that his claims do have validity to them.</p>

<p>The character Assange isn&#39;t one we should be worried about. This guy has worked with the intelligence community in his hacker days and called 9/11 a false conspiracy (huge red flag). While Wikileaks has certainly shown a lead, there is withheld information and disinfo documents. We should think of possible scenarios and not in a default state of thinking. </p>
