       Since a huge number of shills always arrives when something is happening, we should be aware of them and downvote them when necessary, and most importantly know when to stop wasting your time on them. Their goals are to rile you up and hopefully waste more than your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here is a sample conversation. Note simple traits you can identify in a shill.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Derogative terminology or namecalling.
       </li>
       <li>
        Refusing to adhere to discussion contribution when asked.
       </li>
       <li>
        Trying to end the conversation fast with more namecalling.

Argue against the theory, not my account so it is useful.
I'm a long time lurker who makes new accounts and rarely posts. Obviously don't just believe the post, I don't 100% believe it. There is no proof at all for it, haha. Be skeptical of everything but don't just write it off either cause of my account.
This is r/conspiracy, come up with a more plausible counter theory. That's how you eventually find the truth together.

Your "theory" is nothing but unsubstantiated imagination. I could write up a "theory" just as plausible that completely refutes yours, but in the end would be no less real.
Sure, your "theory" may be correct, but there's no evidence to suggest it is.

The post is all circumstantial evidence, I believe is the term.

       It's been my impression there are certain words the most stupid of fuck heads use. I'm not saying you are one, but the use of the word 'shill.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only seen it on TD and only by the TD masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       People used it there for their circle jerking and it becomes imbedded in their vocabulary. And 'cucks.'
      </p>
      <p>
       TD people have developed a very specific set of vocabulary that oozes out of their cheeto Jesus worshipping.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, people agreed with you and you gained some self esteem by sounding like an idiot there. Go there and feel great about yourself again. Just don't spread your dumb shit everywhere else. You're not going to get the same reception.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people here fighting the bullshit Trump worshipping as much as they can but fuck these Trump bastards are persistent and annoying as shit.

      <p>
       R/conspiracy top posts now, this sub is done...

       Trump this, trump that, trump is god, u/spez sucks, pizzagate, bad media, anti-hillary... This is basically r/the_donald2.0.

       You have to he sensible and stand for what you believe in. Just ignore it. I've been sworn at, name called, every derogatory thing you can think of. What I remember everytime is they just have KEYBOARD COURAGE. Acting tough sitting behind a keyboard 1000 miles away. You also must be strong and remember that they are the masses and the masses are asses. Keep free thinking and let freedom of choice live on. Good holiday weekend to all.

       Shills are easy to spot, they change the topic, either way the fact reddit wants to ban "conspiracy" subgroup, is sad, I don't even believe the majority of conspiracies, some are interesting to read, and are creative, who knows if they're true, but I do believe this group has a right to be here though!

       My parameters for Shilling are far more lax than yours. I say that if they leave any comment that is pro-Demoncratic Party, a Party that essentially operates as a front for the legalization of pedophilia, they are most likely a shill. The vast, vast majority of Americans support Trump. If you go to any seemingly anti-Trump/pro social justice communities, most of them are Soros-funded shills and I don't consider any of them to be mentally competent enough to engage. They only deserve ridicule and insults.

       WHO IS PAYING YOU OFF? Is it Soros? It is Clinton herself? I'm onto you, seeing that the evidence is as clear as day. Do you even know what sub you're on?!?! This is r/conspiracy, not r/correct_the_record or r/EnoughTrumpSpam. I am NOT a pedophile. I am NOT projecting. That's my biggest criticism of the political right, as a matter of fact. But that doesn't justify the Demoncrats having a PEDOPHILE RING. The symbols were EXACTLY the FUCKING same, and yet it's not that you're willingly CHOOSING to ignore it, you are a PART OF IT.

       Jesus man, step outside of your safe space and interact with someone from the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you talk to people irl about pizzagate, do they all agree with you? If they happen to disagree are they "fucking shills?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you didn't have batshit insane theories that were unsubstantiated and constructed to fit alt-right viewpoints, people would still disagree with you. This isn't a sign of shilling, this is simply the real fucking world.

      <p>
       Yes I have a very low karma score, and I've been on reddit for many years. Could it just possibly be that I don't comment as much? Maybe I don't feel the need to participate in every thread? No....I'm a CTR shill and I've been paid to disagree with someone who lives in their infowars bubble. Ok, got you.

       Did I ever call you a shill you dumbass? Not everything is about you you know.

       Maybe you should get out and see the world once in a while. Listen to Eddie Bravo or something.

       But to answer your question, yes I have talked with millenials at a Trump party(during the victory) about #PizzaGate back when it was still SpiritCooking. Now millenials have found out about all this shit because of this election, because of wikileaks, because of Hilary. And they spread it on twitter, 4chan, whatever. But it has always been known for hundreds of years by the older folk who go to forums and read books and whatever old shit they do.

       Pedophelia, illuminati, shit has always been there. But now there's even more evidence. I admit, I thought illuminati was a ghetto weed terminology for dumbshit but it turns out it's more real than I ever imagined. I never bothered to look at it cause only hip hop fans talked about it.

       Look at you. You don't change. You don't want to even learn about any conspiracy before outright dismissing it. What will you do with your life?

       Oh yeah that. Spreading left wing disinfo conspiracies is a must for CTR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you offended that I called you CTR? Cause you are doing exactly what they do.

       Though the masses can be sinking with cognitive dissonance and a venerable obstruction to anything resembling "critical thinking", everyone I've talked to in real life is disturbed by the subject matter but they believe in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I've found that the more contact an individual has had with government in medium to higher levels, they believe even more.

       P.S. There's no
       <em>
        functional
       </em>
       difference between a shill and someone derailing a thread with shitting all over the post. You know what MOST normal people ACTUALLY do to a thread they think is dumb or uninteresting? They move on. They don't engage in a hostile, inflammatory 400 word post and spend the rest of the day arguing with others with responses as long also.
