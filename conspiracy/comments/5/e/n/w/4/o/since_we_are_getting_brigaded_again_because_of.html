<p><strong>Here is a sample conversation. Note simple traits you can identify in a shill.</strong></p>

<li>Derogative terminology or namecalling.</li>
<li>Refusing to adhere to discussion contribution when asked.</li>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for these tricks guys, seriously. OP is 2 months old with nothing posted until now.
Check yourself <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before you wreck yourself.</p>

Argue against the theory, not my account so it is useful.
I&#39;m a long time lurker who makes new accounts and rarely posts. Obviously don&#39;t just believe the post, I don&#39;t 100% believe it. There is no proof at all for it, haha. Be skeptical of everything but don&#39;t just write it off either cause of my account.
This is r/conspiracy, come up with a more plausible counter theory. That&#39;s how you eventually find the truth together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shilly account</strong>]
Your &quot;theory&quot; is nothing but unsubstantiated imagination. I could write up a &quot;theory&quot; just as plausible that completely refutes yours, but in the end would be no less real.
Sure, your &quot;theory&quot; may be correct, but there&#39;s no evidence to suggest it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Throwaway account</strong>
Do it, haha. It was fun and things ended up fitting well. Hypothesis forming is a key part of investigation.
The post is all circumstantial evidence, I believe is the term.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shilly account</strong>
I&#39;m not going to because I&#39;m not a fantasizer. I&#39;ve been a skeptic much longer than reddit even existed and understand the follies in such things.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s some more sample shill comments. From a pizzagate thread.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact this delusional bullshit was downvoted gives me hope for this sub.</p>

<p>Yeah, but see, stupid nonsense is ALSO dismissed by being called stupid and nonsense. That&#39;s not an argument at all.</p>

<p>This is not a documentary but a hit piece made by idiot nazis!</p>

<p>this is a joke. makes no sense, putting a bunch of nonsense together and trying to create a stupid conspiracy.</p>

<p>Seek help from a mental health professional.</p>

<p>None of this makes any sense unless you&#39;re insane</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only seen it on TD and only by the TD masses. </p>

<p>People used it there for their circle jerking and it becomes imbedded in their vocabulary. And &#39;cucks.&#39; </p>

<p>TD people have developed a very specific set of vocabulary that oozes out of their cheeto Jesus worshipping.</p>

<p>I get it, people agreed with you and you gained some self esteem by sounding like an idiot there. Go there and feel great about yourself again. Just don&#39;t spread your dumb shit everywhere else. You&#39;re not going to get the same reception. </p>

<p>There are people here fighting the bullshit Trump worshipping as much as they can but fuck these Trump bastards are persistent and annoying as shit. </p>

<p>R/conspiracy top posts now, this sub is done...</p>

<p>Trump this, trump that, trump is god, u/spez sucks, pizzagate, bad media, anti-hillary... This is basically r/the_donald2.0.</p>

<p>NO ONE WANTS TO SEE TRUMP SHIT EVERYWHERE! TAKE IT BACK TO THAT STUPID ASS SUB!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parameters for Shilling are far more lax than yours. I say that if they leave any comment that is pro-Demoncratic Party, a Party that essentially operates as a front for the legalization of pedophilia, they are most likely a shill. The vast, vast majority of Americans support Trump. If you go to any seemingly anti-Trump/pro social justice communities, most of them are Soros-funded shills and I don&#39;t consider any of them to be mentally competent enough to engage. They only deserve ridicule and insults. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus man, step outside of your safe space and interact with someone from the real world. </p>

<p>When you talk to people irl about pizzagate, do they all agree with you? If they happen to disagree are they &quot;fucking shills?&quot; </p>

<p>Even if you didn&#39;t have batshit insane theories that were unsubstantiated and constructed to fit alt-right viewpoints, people would still disagree with you. This isn&#39;t a sign of shilling, this is simply the real fucking world.</p>

<p>Yes I have a very low karma score, and I&#39;ve been on reddit for many years. Could it just possibly be that I don&#39;t comment as much? Maybe I don&#39;t feel the need to participate in every thread? No....I&#39;m a CTR shill and I&#39;ve been paid to disagree with someone who lives in their infowars bubble. Ok, got you.</p>

<p>Did I ever call you a shill you dumbass? Not everything is about you you know.</p>

<p>Maybe you should get out and see the world once in a while. Listen to Eddie Bravo or something.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, yes I have talked with millenials at a Trump party(during the victory) about #PizzaGate back when it was still SpiritCooking. Now millenials have found out about all this shit because of this election, because of wikileaks, because of Hilary. And they spread it on twitter, 4chan, whatever. But it has always been known for hundreds of years by the older folk who go to forums and read books and whatever old shit they do.</p>

<p>Pedophelia, illuminati, shit has always been there. But now there&#39;s even more evidence. I admit, I thought illuminati was a ghetto weed terminology for dumbshit but it turns out it&#39;s more real than I ever imagined. I never bothered to look at it cause only hip hop fans talked about it.</p>

<p>Look at you. You don&#39;t change. You don&#39;t want to even learn about any conspiracy before outright dismissing it. What will you do with your life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though the masses can be sinking with cognitive dissonance and a venerable obstruction to anything resembling &quot;critical thinking&quot;, everyone I&#39;ve talked to in real life is disturbed by the subject matter but they believe in some way.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve found that the more contact an individual has had with government in medium to higher levels, they believe even more.</p>

<p>P.S. There&#39;s no <em>functional</em> difference between a shill and someone derailing a thread with shitting all over the post. You know what MOST normal people ACTUALLY do to a thread they think is dumb or uninteresting? They move on. They don&#39;t engage in a hostile, inflammatory 400 word post and spend the rest of the day arguing with others with responses as long also.</p>
