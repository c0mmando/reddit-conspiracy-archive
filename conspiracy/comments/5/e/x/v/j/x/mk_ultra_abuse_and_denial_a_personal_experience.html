        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">154</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/polkadotgirl.html">polkadotgirl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tonight I am angry, and I&#39;m writing this as a healthy way to cope. </p>

<p>I was viewing art by an Mk Ultra victim, Kim Noble. For one, MK Ultra is a real, verified conspiracy. Second, the art is powerful, overwhelming, and quite frankly, disturbing:</p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-world-of-mind-control-through-the-eyes-of-an-artist-with-13-alter-personas/">http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-world-of-mind-control-through-the-eyes-of-an-artist-with-13-alter-personas/</a></p>

<p>For those of you who are new to all of this, MK Ultra is one of the &quot;conspiracies&quot; that led me down the &#39;rabbit hole.&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://listverse.com/2015/05/28/10-real-victims-of-the-cias-mkultra-program/">http://listverse.com/2015/05/28/10-real-victims-of-the-cias-mkultra-program/</a></p>

<p>As I was viewing the art, I started to think about pizzagate, and the fact that some people cannot fathom it. Then I thought about my own abuse. </p>

<p>I fell into an abusive relationship in my late teens/early 20s. After coming out as a survivor, it is actually difficult to find writers who will detail the abuse, and I completely understand that. Most writing I find is focused on the why and how of abuse, but it usually does not include the gory details. However, I feel tonight it is important to do so. Also, I have written all over Reddit on alternative accounts about how I fell into abuse. My childhood consisted of emotional abuse and neglect, and my therapist showed me how I fell into the relationship I did. I can link to that if anybody is interested, but I&#39;m not sure if that part of it all is relevant. </p>

<p>The first time he beat me up, I thought it was a mistake. He beat me with a broom. He slammed my head into a wall. He punched me. He strangled me. He put me in my place. I thought it was a mistake. Like most abusive relationships, he came to me like Prince Charming. How could somebody like him do that to me? It had to be a mistake.</p>

<p>Of course, though, it was not. </p>

<p>This experience still haunts me on cold November nights. After drinking a bottle of liquor, he drove me into the middle of nowhere on the Navajo reservation. He pulled over and told me to get out of the truck. I was shaking because I knew what was going to happen. One time I saw a sheep about to be butchered, and it was shaking uncontrollably - it knew. And I knew. He took out a stick and pushed me over. He hit me and he hit me, until there was a point I could not feel anymore. It did not even hurt anymore because I think I disassociated. </p>

<p>Kim Noble&#39;s art is all about disassociation. According to Dr. Kathleen Young, &quot;Most trauma survivors dissociate to some extent. Maybe you dissociate from your body or bodily sensations. Maybe you have no access to forbidden feelings like anger, sadness, fear. Maybe you are missing pieces of information about events from the past. Maybe during stress you feel like you are watching yourself from a distance. Maybe in situations that would evoke feelings in others you feel spacey or distracted. It may not be readily apparent and therefore it is important for therapists to learn how to recognize dissociation, which may include asking about it in therapy sessions. How can healing/learning take place if someone isn’t really present?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://drkathleenyoung.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/understanding-dissociation/">https://drkathleenyoung.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/understanding-dissociation/</a></p>

<p>If you get a chance, please look at Kim Noble&#39;s paintings because it is the best visual representation of dissociation I have ever seen. </p>

<p>I ultimately left him, and I am alive. The last time he physically abused me was on a vacation in Albuquerque. I was driving to a family event,  and he was in the passenger&#39;s seat. Out of nowhere, he started punching me as I was driving. I was on the highway, and I knew I had to get out of the car, or we were going to crash. I pulled over in a shopping plaza, and he started hitting me more aggressively. I tried to get out of the car, but he grabbed my shirt, and it ripped off of me. I got out of the car and he smashed the wind shield. Somebody came running out and asked if I wanted to call the cops. I said no (I was scared), and he ran off. I was naked and alone.</p>

<p>Later that night, I went back to our hotel room. That was not a good idea, but I had no where to go. He came pounding on the door with his mom and his aunt. I thought I was safe because they were there. I opened the door and he stormed in and punched me multiple times. His mom did nothing, but his aunt attacked him. I knew it was no longer a secret, and I had to get out.</p>

<p>He knew where to hit me, so that the bruises could be easily covered. He knew how to belittle me. He knew how to control me. He was abused himself, after all, and after I got out of the relationship, his mom murdered his dad. I am not joking.  </p>

<p>I can go on and on, but what I need you to understand is how trauma influences mind control. Through his abuse, he was able to control nearly every aspect of my life. Trauma affects every single aspect of your life. </p>

<p>When we see these links about pedophilia and ritualistic abuse, it is probably unthinkable to the general population. I never, ever thought that I would experience the things I had experienced. In fact, I started looking into conspiracies after I got out of the relationship because then I knew that evil was real. It was as if I needed to truly suffer in order to understand the world. </p>

<p>Now, it is never my intention to compare abuse, but the psychological trauma from what I experienced is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what others, specifically children, experience in pedophile rings. Unless you yourself have experienced it, it is really, probably almost unfathomable. I experienced physical abuse as an adult. I have no doubt the trauma would have intensified had any of this happened as a child.</p>

<p>At times, it would hurt even more because I would tell friends and family about the abuse, and it was often downplayed or disregarded. I remember a few weeks after I told my friend about it, she invited my abuser to dinner. I was devastated, but I know what happened to me. To this day, people downplay or undermine my experiences, and there is nothing I can do about that.</p>

<p>So, tonight, I was viewing those paintings, and anger came over me. I was arguing with somebody on Reddit about the profound evidence for pizzagate, but they did not want to believe it because to them, the evidence just was not enough. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what is enough, but I want to tell you all that there is evil beyond what you may be able to comprehend, and I think money, power, and elitisim can amplify that evil.  I believe many are so fortunate to not have encountered this evil or seen it - and I by no means think I saw the worst of it. Again, I feel I only experienced the tip of the iceberg when it comes to evil in this world.</p>

<p>I will never belittle anybody&#39;s suffering, but I really like Buddha&#39;s words:</p>

<p><em>“Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike; each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others too little.”</em></p>

<p>Many of us are comfortable, and unfortunately, my generation is by far less empathetic (there are many studies on this, but here is one):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201006/is-the-me-generation-less-empathetic">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201006/is-the-me-generation-less-empathetic</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also written about our empathy, technology, and our current generation here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/54are4/empathy_technology_and_our_future_is_it_too_much/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/54are4/empathy_technology_and_our_future_is_it_too_much/</a>?</p>

<p>To tie all this post together is that we need to recognize a few things. </p>

<p>•Power corrupts people. Anybody recall the Stanford Prison Experiment?</p>

<p><a href="http://pdf.prisonexp.org/powerevil.pdf">http://pdf.prisonexp.org/powerevil.pdf</a></p>

<p>•There is an undeniable link between socipathy and leadership positions:
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/04/25/the-disturbing-link-between-psychopathy-and-leadership/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/04/25/the-disturbing-link-between-psychopathy-and-leadership/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/</a></p>

<p>•Jimmy Saville is just one example of high-level, organized pedophilia:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile</a></p>

<p>•And some horrors may be too difficult for most to imagine. Look up pedophilia in Hollywood.</p>

<p>What I am asking, especially for conspiracy newcomers is to research, research, research. Hear the stories of victims. Try to put yourselves in their shoes. And don’t forget about desensitization. After my abuse, I can barely stand most popular TV shows and movies, but has our society become comfortably numb?</p>

<p><a href="http://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2005-2009/09BA.pdf">http://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2005-2009/09BA.pdf</a></p>

<p><em>Abstract: Two studies tested the hypothesis that exposure to violent media reduces aid offered to people in pain. In Study 1, participants played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. After game play, while completing a lengthy questionnaire, they heard a loud ﬁght, in which one person was injured, outside the lab. Participants who played violent games took longer to help the injured victim, rated the ﬁght as less serious, and were less likely to ‘‘hear’’ the ﬁght in comparison to participants who played nonviolent games. In Study 2, violent- and nonviolent movie attendees witnessed a young woman with an injured ankle struggle to pick up her crutches outside the theater either before or after the movie. Participants who had just watched a violent movie took longer to help than participants in the other three conditions. The ﬁndings from both studies suggest that violent media make people numb to the pain and suffering of others</em></p>

<p>There are thousands of studies on desensitization, but really ask yourself, are you affected anymore? Do you feel compassion for others? How does this statement make you feel, or does it make you feel?</p>

<p><em>In the most shocking instance, there is evidence of a conspiracy to abuse a yet unborn child.</em></p>

<p>What troubles me most is that it takes A LOT to shock people these days, and I am wondering if it will get to a point where even pedophilia becomes less and less shocking. If you feel my post isn’t enough for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> – I feel that I can validate this post here. I am not prude, but sexual deviancy has become more and more normalized. Did anybody see the latest New York Times post on pedophilia? Is the conspiracy to normalize sexual deviancy like bestiality and pedophilia?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>This is all connected, and I want to make sure I have not lost you
 For one, I used to not think “normal” people were capable of evil, but my experiences have shown me otherwise. Sometimes we view the elite as beyond us, but they are human (I think), and they are not beyond basic psychology or power, corruption, and sociopathy. In fact, we should be even more worried about those who rise to power and be extremely critical of them. As a teacher, I am critiqued constantly, and I think that is GOOD because I am in a position of power. There is no reason that our leaders should not be held to extreme standards of excellence. When the average citizen is monitored constantly, why is it so difficult to want to monitor our leaders’ activities? Finally, please do not forget that there are real victims who are gaslighted, shamed, and forgotten. After I came out about my abuse, people belittled me. While there are liars out there, there are some real, credible victims with some horrifying stories to share. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget pizzagate. If you do not believe it, then I&#39;m sorry - there&#39;s probably no evidence that will convince you. But for those of you who do know it&#39;s real, do not forget, and let&#39;s keep fighting for the children. </p>

<p>If you took the time to read this, thank you. Often these posts get downvoted because they are too personal. I just needed to vent tonight, and if nothing else comes of this, I feel a little bit better after writing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey just so you know MK-ULTRA is only one of many experiments named in a similar fashion i/e MK-ALPHA, MK-OMEGA, but the overall program that they belonged too was named something else of which we don&#39;t know due to all the records being shredded. MK most likely stood for mind control but K instead of C, and because of the kinds of goals that were wanted from them. The only reason we know anything about these programs was because someone was supposed to shred them but a few boxes were misplaced during a office move or something similar and they were forgotten about for a few decades until they were found and released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for this. The foundational book on the subect you seem interested in researching is called The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing, by Joost Meerloo. He was a psychiatrist who was involved in torture for the purpose of dissociative mind control during WW2. Best exposé of the psychological underpinnings of what has become a systemic practice by government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sorry to hear of the incredible trauma that you&#39;ve endured. Thank you for pushing through it: You are living evidence that great atrocities can be overcome. </p>

<p>Thank you for shining a light on something that would rather be kept in the dark. The lights have been off rather long enough, I should think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. It&#39;s weird when I was writing it, I kept saying in my mind, &quot;This probably isn&#39;t tragic enough for people to be impacted.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like I&#39;m still doing weird shit like that in my mind and it makes me mad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too... And not just the typical &quot;the abuser is controlling the victim&quot; but that the abuser is being controlled as a tool. Not to say they have no responsibility for their actions, but that some outside force has influence due to some percieved benefit or ulterior motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a popular opinion. I feel that if Sirhan Sirhan and others were used to assasinate prominent figures, why not be able to create an abuser? And then the victim suffers with the face of a loved one as the mask before the puppet master. The puppet suffers also, but is now the villian in the screenplay written by those who might write it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I am in and have been in significantly (there goes my mind questioning that word) abusive and traumatic situations. You motivate me to someday put to words what I went through. I came here due to trying to Google an article I&#39;m having trouble rediscovering. I feel certain my life is trauma based controlled by keeping my abuser addicted to hard drugs. When he speaks abusively or has been violent he appears possessed. I am certain he is being manipulated through drugs and other influences. It gets worse the more I attempt to research or expose various &quot;conspiracies&quot;. I have had dreams of telling the CIA to please leave us alone. My biological family is Sicilian mafia and Hell&#39;s Angels and military. I would like help. Thank you for your story.</p>
