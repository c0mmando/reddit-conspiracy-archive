       Somehow people are forgetting that a lot of evidence was found on Weiner's laptop implicating many of the top people in DC. Anyone talking about pizzagate should bring up this case as well.

       I meant forgotten by the public which should be crying out for the evidence to be brought to light. I suppose it could still be a matter of Obama's pardons getting in the way of that.

       I'd think of it this way. If theres any genuine people involved they made copies. If its all corrupt they'll make sure everything was destroyed. Or the wildcard, they're all dirty but someone made copies to use as blackmail. Or a second wildcard, other copies exist somewhere they aren't aware of and could potentially surface, like Huma's stuff syncing with AW laptop.

       I believe NYPD has copies. I have faith in people doing the right thing and I think cops are more or less decent average guys. I also don't have faith in secrets kept with overwhelming numbers of people involved. Unless they are people with a lot to lose.

       I think copies are out there. Even if they thought they destroyed them all I think theres copies hidden away somewhere that'll eventually surface. I also agree with the amount of people in the mix it would be impossible to keep everything secret.

       It's fine, I didn't expect one. And I wasn't being sarcastic either, if that's why I got downvotes.  I already believe in this day and age there's very little data anywhere that's safe from replication, especially if it's even slightly potentially valuable, it's safe to assume there's copies.

       The NYPD handed all the evidence over to the FBI, and then supposedly told the NYPD not to pursue any prosecutions. A few things that happened since a NYPD chief was threatening to make it public though- Julian Assange dissapeared, WikiLeaks strongly appears to be compromised, 2 veteran NYPD police officers were murdered, massive DDOS attack on the east coast DNS provider.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've theorized personally that it was all related. 1st, shut up Julian. 2nd, stop the deads mans switch. 3rd, take/destroy evidence in NYPD custody. DDOS May have been used as a cover to infiltrate NYPD HQ and delete evidence. 4th eliminate the 1 or 2 other NYPD officers who knew about the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think this theory is really reaching, but I don't understand why we haven't heard from the police chief who stated "What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,”. If he doesn't follow up with actions, his words are meaningless. Unless, he was in on the cover up, or he no longer has any evidence.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- Also, this theory could explain why alternate news stopped reporting on it. If the evidence disappeared and everyone with inside knowledge knew it. Then the alternate news sources got hit with possible libel/defamation if they continued covering it..

       My guess optimistic guess is that the case has been put on hold so as to avoid having to press charges while Obama is president as he could then put the charges before a court so as to pardon the involved parties.

      <p>
       My pessimistic guess is that the evidence was taken by the FBI and ''misplaced''.

       Likely the same people are implicated. The pizzagate evidence came by way of WikiLeaks, while the laptop contained far worse and came to the NYPD through the investigation into Weiner's sexting, IIRC. So pizzagate is not a distraction - it's the same thing.

       Sure, lots of things are unsubstantiated until someone is formally charged. IIRC, Roger Stone had a connection at the NYPD (a chief). The guy is pretty well connected as far as I know. Whether

       I don't, but he's not all crazy. He covered the Bohemian Grove goings-on more than a decade ago. The Spirit Cooking stuff is in the same vein, IMO. People at the top
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       these things. I don't think that can be denied. Whether it's just a crazy exercise for all of them is debatable. Why, even if for shits and giggles do the rituals have to involve sacrifice, children, blood?

       I didn't say he was crazy, and I agree with you. My point is, there is no substantial source material on what specifically was found on that laptop. I'm also saying that most of what involves pizzagate, while I'll admit is certainly bizarre, doesn't necessarily implicate criminal wrong doing. I'm not saying it isn't a possibility that this stuff holds weight, but there's also a very serious possibility that it's being severely exaggerated and taken way too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my personal opinion, this pizza gate stuff seems to be co-intel pro that can be used to discredit this "movement" and certainly the people at
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       . Seems like everyone is taking the bait also. It could also be the reason why Alex Jones isn't covering it as heavily as everyone here on reddit is. There are much more opportunities for us to make progress on issues that have credibility to them, in terms of defeating globalism, the oligarchs, and the new world order then pizzagate in my opinion. Pizzagate can be used (if false) to completely discredit everything. Just my opinion as someone who's been paying attention to this shit for half my life.

       The thing is that a lot of the evidence came to light through the WikiLeaks dumps. This is stuff that very likely wasn't meant to be accidentally made public, IMO. If you believe that the dumps weren't tampered with - and I do, then for it to be co-intel pro seems a stretch.

       I think copies are out there. Even if they thought they destroyed them all I think theres copies hidden away somewhere that'll eventually surface. I also agree with the amount of people in the mix it would be impossible to keep everything secret.
