    <div class="md"><p>This was posted just a few minutes ago and has already been downvoted heavily. There is very suspicious activity going on with all of the pizzagate posts. People receive massive amounts of upvotes when they call pizzagate crazy, but they don&#39;t provide any arguments against the evidence compiled in this investigation. </p>

<p>This is not how this sub usually works. Sure, there are always people who disagree on various theories, and arguing the evidence is what makes this sub so great. However, the recent actions of some posters here, many of whom I&#39;ve never seen before, makes me think there is a concerted effort to not only attack pizzagate, but also attack this community as a whole. It&#39;s starting to feel too much like r/politics and the manufactured opinions there</p>

<p>There is some weird shit going on here and trust me, if the pizzagate subreddit was still up I&#39;d be posting this stuff I say would make your jaw drop but we can&#39;t anymore on Reddit so we took to other avenues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just give up man. I had to unsubscribe from the sub because it seems over the last few months it&#39;s been co-opted by the_donald. Like, unless you absolutely concede that Hillary is a child raping cannibal you&#39;re obviously a fucking shill. A bunch of people talking about &#39;critical thinking&#39; and all that bullshit but then turn around and use a bunch of tangentially related threads and a whole lot of wild speculation to spin some anti-DNC narrative.</p>

<p>I mean 4 out of every 5 threads is some haphazard attempt to smear shit on the Dems.</p>

<p>Wheres any posts critical of the president elect and all the shady business deals he&#39;s involved in? Or any of his ties to Russia etc. Not a peep. Everyone&#39;s too busy smearing the candidate who <em>lost</em> rather than scrutinizing Trump.</p>

<p>And then they all cry &#39;shill&#39; or &#39;bias&#39; or &#39;CRT&#39;... my question is who&#39;s <em>really</em> shilling for who here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, your right. Unfortunately. As soon as anyone got wind of &quot;rigging&quot; and &quot;corruption&quot; they instantly came to conspiracy in mass. It&#39;s shitty, and I do wish we could split our time up more evenly because there&#39;s definitely plenty to say about Trump and is campaign people. Manafort has some pretty interesting ties to Russia that should really be investigated. It&#39;s almost like they set a super easy target in front of us knowing we&#39;d chase it to the point where the normal people don&#39;t care any more and ignore the other target in favor of chasing further. </p>

<p>But really though I may not get the people that call her a cannibal rapist pedophile, there&#39;s never gonna be solid evidence of that, but it&#39;s been solidly proven that her entire campaign is the definition of political corruption and there&#39;s a pretty compelling argument for the DNC being just as bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say it was impossible that the number and timing of down votes was massively exaggerated? No, it&#39;s entirely possible most of the brigade is imagined.

    <div class="md"><p>If you say it&#39;s hard to explain with anything other than shills and bots then what you&#39;re saying is that the most likely scenario is the downvotes coming from shills and bots.</p>

<p>But if it comes from shills and bots the downvotes should be more numerous due to how easy setting up a botnet and creating accounts on reddit is.</p>

<p>So when you say &quot;mass downvotes&quot; you&#39;re being disingenuous by implying (whether you intended to or not) that they are a substantial amount when in reality the amount of downvotes is so mall in the big scheme of things that it is unimportant, so the most likely scenario following that wouldn&#39;t be bots nor shills.</p>

<p>Like it or not, reddit starts hating anything that is popular for enough time, a conspiracy is not going to be an exception. Call them sheep or whatever you want but it changes nothing, fact is that seeing so many posts about pizzagate in r/all is making a ton of people that browse this website hate the conspiracy for no other reason than they&#39;re tired of seeing it on the frontpage.</p>

<p>So the most likely scenario? People with nothing to do browsing the new section of the sub or r/all and downvoting whatever pizzagate related because they&#39;re tired of it.</p>

<p>The same happens with any particular topic that gets popular enough to the point of flooding the front page and it&#39;s honestly embarrassing how people still don&#39;t realize this shit, it also happens in small subreddit, although in a smaller scale of course.</p>

<p>Actually, with so many people vocalizing their anger even in the pizzagate posts themselves one would think that the fact that the pizzagate posts are reaching the frontpage with thousands of upvotes would be a conspiracy on itself but nobody ever ponders that, I&#39;ve seen plenty of people easily entertaining the thought that those upvotes come from the silent majority that cares, explaining upvotes away as 100% fair with no doubt in their mind or care in their heart but when it comes to downvotes (dissent) even in small numbers the easiest explanation is shills and bots. But upvotes? Nah, those must be totally legit.</p>

<p>The lack of consistency in that mentality is what drives me insane about this community, when things go right for you it must surely mean everyone is playing fair but when things go south it becomes suddenly suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah. That&#39;s one position to hold I guess, but personally I would rather actually have substantial evidence before I start accusing people of running a pedo ring.</p>

<p>There is also precedent for people looking like idiots because they assume guilt when it turned out all the evidence was refutable and bunk. Hell, the USA has murdered innocent people because of our shitty standard for evidence in a lot of cases, so I would rather be on the skeptical side and wait before I grab my pitchfork.</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t call someone an idiot for dismissing something like this case for which there is little good evidence. As I&#39;ve stated before, if something was given to me that was substantial and irrefutable I would of course admit that I was wrong. At the present time, I have been given no such reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to wake dopes like you up. The only question is do you want to be woke? If at this point, you haven&#39;t looked at the evidence critically enough, you probably don&#39;t. If your &quot;woke trigger&quot; isn&#39;t triggered at all by the prospect of sexually abused/trafficked children, then you just are like a 10 on the self-absorbed scale and there&#39;s probably no hope for ever getting you out of that stupor.</p>

<p>But I can try. Anyone can come to appreciate just how terrible this stuff is. All they have to do is want to understand. To do that, it&#39;s simple: Find all the Jimmy Alefantis instagram pics that you can. look through them all and ask yourself what his motivations are - really question them. Then as you consider that, cross reference his name in the Podesta files and ask yourself why a creepy guy like this (and you will think he&#39;s very creepy is you go through his instagram) has such deep connection in DC.</p>

<p>Literally anyone can verify this stuff if they look into Jimmy Alefantis. The guy was a real dope and put it all out there on Instagram, showing you slices of his existence. Anyone who studies this guy has to ask questions about what the fuck is going on here.</p>

I also destroy old hard drives when I upgrade computers so as to keep old data from prying eyes, identity thieves etc. Is it somehow criminal for someone with more responsibilities to do less I do?

<p>Trump is much more than a mere jackass. Women have gone ON THE RECORD about the things he&#39;s done, plus the tape he brushed off as &quot;locker room&quot; talk. His business dealings frequently end up in court with him/his corporations as the defendant. His treatment of the various people who did not want to sell land to him for his various projects in Scotland reads like the script for &quot;Despicable Me&quot; with him in the title role</p>

JHenry im gonna go on a limb here and say your a guy. Lets be honest if you are a guy you can&#39;t say that you&#39;ve never rated a female by her body. If you say you haven&#39;t either your not into females or your a liar.
Hes a billionaire I imagine those woman threw themselves at him. Even if they didn&#39;t The Clinton Foundation has been kidnapping children from Haiti and bill Clinton has been accused 36 times. Hillary is a fucking hypocrite as well. She backs woman and homosexual rights and in the same breath backs Islamic rights and accepts money from middle eastern countries. THESE SAME MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES KILL GAYS AND WOMEN. She is a hypocrite.</p>

<p>10 years ago when I entered college I watched Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist 2 and The Obama Deception etc, all right up InfoWars.com alley (and Alex Jones) and it all turned out to be unsubstantiated crap. I wised up and stopped supporting shit based on shakey evidence, at best. I realized that conspiracies are humans trying to find patterns where there are none, and especially when those non patterns reinforce their bias. Pizzagate is garbage and the sooner people realize it the better.</p>

<p>See this right here is a big part of the problem, Reddit accounts aren&#39;t credible at all, regardless of age.

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying it&#39;s the case, but a week old account could be, ya know... someone who lurked and just made an account or someone new to Reddit all together. </p>

<p>Every account was a week old at one point, are you supposed to wait out some arbitrary time frame so your account&#39;s age looks more credible? Kinda dumb.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen someone shit on in /FantasyFootball for posting their opinion on a player, only to be told their voice doesn&#39;t matter because their account is only 12 days old. Or that you&#39;re a &quot;shill&quot; because you only started lurking /Gaming a few days ago.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are bots and people paid to post/spam/downvote, but to assume EVERYONE who disagrees with you falls into that category? It seems like a very immature way to end an argument when you can&#39;t defend yourself by any other means.</p>

<p>What happened to discussing legitimate information and facts? For the people using the blanket &quot;you must be a shill&quot; label against anyone who doesn&#39;t agree... you&#39;re doing more harm to the cause than good.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are bots or accounts paid for posting/downvoting... but to think EVERYONE in disagreement is a covert agent on a mission to squash legit info? Pretty immature.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a strawman to <strong>ask you if posting the pictures, logos, names and mention these guys are also pedophiles is the same as taking pictures of people in a park?</strong></p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what you guys are doing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s very different from posting random pictures. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also because of people like you guys we&#39;ll lose internet privacy and the privilege of anonymity. Sad.</p>

That coupled with the fact that the only evidence anyone really saw on r/all till this was just two emails about a handkerchief and a 4chan user with zero credibility telling his that pizza and hotdogs were code words for pedophiles. Along with that ever since r/pizzagate was closed this subreddit has become its new hub. It&#39;s on here every single day now.

You ever notice how some subs constantly have comments complaining about stale memes? Seeing the same thing over and over becomes irritating.

<p>Before you get pissed about the &quot;solid evidence&quot; comment most of what&#39;s been shown has just been possible links. We don&#39;t even know for sure yet that this ring even exists.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because some of us feel that individuals are being accused of being pedophiles and can relate to them if we&#39;d be in the same position. Assuming innocence, can you imagine the emotional torment the Comet guy is going through? I&#39;m sure most of the locals know about it now and are treating him like the plague. It would be real shitty if you showed up to work tomorrow and all of your co-workers/friends/family heard that you&#39;re accused of being a pedophile. Not only that, but also don&#39;t want anything to do with you because it brings them into the mess - including those who support your business. And it&#39;s likely going to follow him his entire life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to hear that. I was pointing out it was his Godchild as that means it&#39;s not just some random children he&#39;s posting. They&#39;re mostly all the same child. </p>

<p>Every picture of that kid is tagged with the same hashtag (#carisjames) - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/dkpNmv.jpg">here are a few</a>. The same instagram handle consistently likes it (@Scummimgs). One picture talks about going to Europe with @Scummimgs and is a picture of the child with the money. At one point, someone refers to him as &quot;Grandpa Jimmy&quot;. He calls himself the &quot;godfather&quot; in a video posted by someone protesting a few days ago.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that this child is someone close to him - possibly a friends kid (I&#39;d assume Scummimgs). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh it&#39;s gone beyond questioning at this point, though. </p>

<p>It all started with the Podesta emails about cheese, pasta, and dominos.</p>

<p>Then people started critiquing every aspect of Podesta&#39;s life and found an artist who painted in his house. Then people looked into that artist and found a few racy paintings.</p>

<p>Then people found Comet mentioned in the Podesta emails. Then they started digging through Jimmy&#39;s instagram and posting everything suggestive. Then they started digging through everyone who visited Comet&#39;s instagram and posted all of that, too. During that process, no one really gave a shit about fact-checking stuff like &quot;I Love L&#39;Enfant&quot; and when people tried to say &quot;Uhhh L&#39;Enfant is a part of DC&quot; they got called shills. </p>

<p>Then all of that info got jumbled up and people made some batshit crazy fan theory alternate reality narrative where nothing is fact-checkable or even presents alternatives. Realities where Podesta no longer the fan of the artist and they&#39;re instead paintings in Comet. Ones where everything on patrons instagrams were attributed to Jimmy. Ones where a &quot;German Baby&quot; is a real child and not a doll being sold in the store. Ones where someone replying with &quot;creepy&quot; isnt referring to the doll, but instead him.</p>

<p>IMO it&#39;s spun out of control and become more than people &quot;just questioning.&quot; Questioning things often results in answers to some of the questions being found and trying to solve the questions that remain. In this case, the answers have been completely ignored and people&#39;s lives are being harmed in the process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you please tell me how taping a child to a table and taking a picture of it is ok and socially acceptable? Why exactly is james alefantis on the list of the top 50 most powerful people in DC? How are podesta&#39;s paintings acceptable as well? Also have you read the wikileak emails yourself? They are definitely using code words throughout some emails. You&#39;re silly if you think there&#39;s no way that Podesta may be involved in some sketchy dealings with or without Jame&#39;s help. I am in no way advocating harassing the employee&#39;s/owners of comet ping pong but there should be a thorough investigation. There&#39;s a reason Julian Assange released these emails.. And its ironic he went missing not too long after. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Does the kid look upset/sad? She looks pretty damn happy to me. Her father even commented or liked the picture. You don&#39;t know the story as to how it happened and Jimmy has known the family the kids life and as far as I&#39;m concerned, don&#39;t tell other people how to raise their kids. Hell, you know what else people could be offended by? My brother has a picture of his kid with a brand new (unused of course) toilet seat as a necklace. If Jimmy had that picture on his Instagram, I&#39;m sure people would be going crazy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How are they not? <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/LivingInOblivion/6SynchronizedSwimming.jpg">Here</a> are <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/HotBed/4Moor.jpg">the</a> three <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fGbKqKL.png">that</a> Podesta has in his house. You do realize that <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/Work.html">the artist</a> isn&#39;t quite the &quot;PEDOPHILE ARTIST&quot; the internet made her out to be. Look through all of her work, very few are &quot;pedophilic&quot;. None of which that Podesta has on display. The majority of her work are adults, including <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/Oddity/7Invisible.jpg">these grandmothers</a>. </p>

<p>You know.. Maybe I&#39;m on to something. Podesta not only is part of a child solicitation network, but also a granny solicitation network. Has anyone creepily dug through dozens of people&#39;s Instagrams to see if there&#39;s a nursing home kidnapping story to be discussed? </p>

<p>Just looking at Podestas emails unveiled coded secrets</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One strategy, which I was going to persue if we got John: see if Rick Miller would host at his home on Jantzen Island. This may not be what you want to do - he is newly a democrat, so it a base guy - but he is close to Sen Wyden and I feel sure he&#39;d be eager to help. He owned a chain of 60 nursing homes, was a centrist R, and changed to Dem in anticipation of running for office...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>60 nursing home chain to kidnap the elderly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PS - John, you missed a large gathering of the Dukakis campaign in Greece last week - some of them even had Dukakis campaign t-shirts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Greece is known for the invention of anal sex. They are obviously anal raping the elderly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>important and difficult work that service sector workers do every day to take care of our children, elderly and the disabled. </p>

<p>Oh god they&#39;re kidnapping the disabled too?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being at the center of a pedophile cannibalistic solicitation ring and being unprofessional are two vastly different offenses. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though most of the pictures are shot inside comet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you not understand how tagging by location works? Most of the &quot;racy evidence&quot; isn&#39;t even a picture he took. It&#39;s patrons tagging themselves at the location. It&#39;d be like blaming Starbucks for someone taking a picture of a line of coke in a Starbucks and tagging it &quot;starbucks&quot;. Most of it wasn&#39;t &quot;official&quot;. They&#39;re people he might have never even met.</p>

<p>He did have a few <em>at most</em> questionable things on his instagram over 3 years, but hardly pedophilic. Don&#39;t tell me your friends and family don&#39;t have an occasionally questionable image on FB/Twitter/Instagram. Example: When my brother got a new toilet seat, he put it on his toddler as a necklace for a funny picture. If that same shit was on Jame&#39;s instagram, nuts would probably try to say &quot;it&#39;s obviously a child for sale for those with scat fetishes.&quot; Scotch tape picture is the same shit. The kid is smiling and laughing, it&#39;s obviously a fucking joke. The only reason it offends you is because you&#39;re being misled by a narrative and you made your conclusion that he&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; before even doing your own research.</p>

<p>You&#39;re digging into the social media of a dude who was just a normal dude with some small-business owner connections until a few weeks ago. Someone who never really thought his Instagram would be critiqued with a fine comb by the entire internet. Someone who makes crude jokes here and there. Do you know the Instagram of the owner of your local pizza/coffee shop? Probably not - because he&#39;s just a normal fucking guy who has served some people serving time in office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When those questionable images on his social media account are of a pedophiliac nature <em>and</em> he owns/operates an establishment by and large about children, he should at the very least be subject to public scrutiny and if his business falls because of it, then we have done a service to our fellow man by exposing it.</p>

<p>So, stop defending him as a normal person. He&#39;s clearly not normal, but if he is so normal, let&#39;s just make a brochure with some of those images and highlight his comments. Give the brochure to any would-be patrons of Comet and see if they decide to take their kids elsewhere for entertainment.</p>

<p>Everything else that&#39;s questionable is either (I think the nudity at a museum was a bit racy to have on instagram). </p>

<p>Most of the shit has only been pedophilic after some insane &quot;yellow necklace = analingus&quot; armchair discussion is had. Don&#39;t you understand that they&#39;re only pedophilic by nature if you&#39;re looking at them in a pedophilic context?</p>

<p>Scotch tape picture is a good example. You&#39;re the one associating sex with it. You&#39;re the one creating pedophilic visuals in your mind. You&#39;re the one accusing him of S&amp;M. You&#39;re the one of him selling the child for sex. Context says kid is laughing/smiling. </p>

<p>Comment says:</p>

<p>&quot;New seating procedure for your youngest guests? Hilar.&quot; </p>

<p>As I established, the same kid is in numerous images. Jimmy is obviously is close to the family. If they thought there was a problem with it, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d have expressed concern and had him delete it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claim &quot;I just have this ability to easily overlook mental programming&quot;. You claim to be an advocate of the truth. Yet you&#39;re refusing to share evidence you suggest is the truth to someone asking you to? You don&#39;t wish to share your run-down of what you believe is the &quot;most damning evidence&quot; and let someone else go over that evidence and see if they find any holes?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that what &quot;searching for the <em>truth</em> is?&quot; The act of providing you another perspective with the same pool of information to potentially create a superior understanding of what&#39;s at play? Thus enabling you to eliminate what&#39;s potentially misinformation so that when you present your argument in the future to other skeptics they wont pick at the 10% of bad info vs. the 90% good?</p>

<p>Think about the situation here. This is so deep in a tree of comments that I&#39;d bet it&#39;s highly unlikely anyone else will ever read it. Possibly just you and me. Yet, I&#39;m still asking you for information because I genuinely care about the situation we&#39;re discussing. If you want to share with me what you think is important I&#39;d love to hear it. You can give me a better understanding of what I have not addressed. Or, I can go over with you what I think is explainable/weak. If you&#39;re truly seeking truth, I hope you accept my request and share the time with me to disseminate information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not concerned with others reading this. I&#39;m not concerned with downvotes or upvotes. TBH, I&#39;m less and less concerned with reddit as a viable medium for thoughtful discussion and your initial posts speak volumes about why and how that regression is taking place. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite enlightening to see your tone change, but I&#39;m sorry. I treat commenters as people, not as most treat others here as a game with which they need to elicit strong points and make citations to back up their claims. In that light, first impressions are huge. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already told you where to look. It&#39;s quite wide-spread information at this point, and that&#39;s a direct result of my earlier efforts, not only on the pizzagate sub (which I was an early opponent of), but also on 4chan. I&#39;ve already done the research, watched it gain traction, watched others take the red pill, then watched it get silenced. </p>

<p>When I fire from the hip now to make the statement, it&#39;s more a release for me, not so much a prolific statement. Those statements were already made. If you really want to continue debunking or clarifying (as you&#39;ve changed to state now) the pizzagate connections, then you have no need of me. Go use your own research and then create your own post detailing your own thoughts. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s where my problem begins. Much of the information/discussion seems to mis-attribute the information to those associated. Either I&#39;m missing pieces of the puzzle or I&#39;m coming to a different conclusion. IE, my understanding is that the &quot;creepy paintings&quot; are Podestas, yet people seem to suggest they&#39;re in Comet Ping Pong. I&#39;ve asked time and time again for people to show me which paintings were in Comet Ping Pong that are racy, but have yet to receive anything but hostility. I&#39;ve searched myself and the best I can ever find is the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lu0Uf9.png">graffiti</a>. Yet people continue to insist that there are &quot;others.&quot; So I&#39;m trying to figure out if they&#39;re wrong or I just haven&#39;t found them yet.</p>

<p>The come creepy comments from Jimmy himself. I&#39;ve eliminated most of them under the conditions that either </p>

<p>A. A patron posted them tagged as being at Planet Ping Pong <a href="https://i.sli.mg/r1x646.jpg">IE this fellow - NSFW</a>. Meaning it&#39;s not Jimmy posting or endorsing the comment - but a guest at his business posting it. </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>B. They&#39;re of the child of a family friend who the family has allowed Jimmy to be alone around for the past 4 years</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>C. It&#39;s easily explained with a bit of research. Like &quot;La Boum Boum Room&quot; is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/10/14/with-la-boum-boum-room-d-c-just-got-a-lot-weirder/">a monthly event at a bar in L&#39;Enfant plaza</a>. I Love L&#39;Enfant is referring to L&#39;Enfant Plaza - a cultural center in DC. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for the D that isn&#39;t &quot;yellow necklace means analingus&quot; and &quot;the menu logo is similar to a pedophile symbol&quot;. Something that can&#39;t be explained. </p>

<p>The comes the Podesta side. From my understanding, it all started with the email discussing Dominos, Cheese, and Pasta. I&#39;ll admit: when I first read into pizzagate that was my starting point. I wanted to find something in the Podesta emails. That email seemed particularly suspicious because people said dominos/cheese/pasta were code for something. Kept following the story lightly for the next few weeks seeing new revelations and shit spiraling out of control. The first time I read the Comet Ping Pong I thought it was blatant as fuck - especially after seeing the german baby (didn&#39;t realize it was a doll), the baby with euros, and the scotch tape.</p>

<p>After reading the Podesta cheese/pasta email like 5 times on different occasions I realized &#39;holy shit!&#39; What if he&#39;s talking about a gift box/gift basket of cheese/pasta and thanking the Podestas for it.&#39; The date is around Christmas, so that made sense to me and far less out of place. After that, I tried to understand wtf domino was. Then I found <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15880">this email</a> and concluded they were talking about a game of dominos. </p>

<p>From there, I went and looked back at the Comet Ping Pong stuff. After looking at the images a few times I started realizing &quot;well.. Jimmy didn&#39;t post that&quot; and crossed a bunch of my evidence off. Then I realized the artwork was tied to Podesta - not Jimmy. Then I realized all of the stuff I had seen that he did post was tagged #carisjames. Looked into that a little and eventually realized it was the same kid. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s like everything dismantled and I&#39;m trying to find something to once again convince me something sinister is going on. I don&#39;t know if I am missing stuff that still would worth evaluating. </p>

<p>As for the HRC connections? Haven&#39;t really looked into that. I already pretty much accept she&#39;s scummy and have for a long time now. I believe the Haiti shit.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m mainly defending Jimmy because so far it seems like to me he just got tangled up in it. Podesta I don&#39;t care about as much if he gets shit on as he&#39;s a politician and his job is handling shitstorms. Jimmy on the other hand, in my mind, could just be a regular dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems quite convenient that Jimmy has all these connections and he&#39;s just a &quot;regular dude&quot;. So convenient, in fact, that I believe it&#39;s by design. </p>

<p>I can give you some other connections to investigate because I agree with many others on pizzagate that they became tunnel visioned on Comet and Jimmy and the good clues were saturated under double posts about the same thing, really. That was part of why I was an early opponent of the sub, but when I spoke out I was banned. </p>

<p>I wanted things to remain on 4chan because there&#39;s not so much scrutiny. While you may be thinking scrutiny is a good thing for a conspiracy theory, the by-product is much worse. It makes the investigators retrace their steps and get caught in a perpetual loop just blasting the same information out constantly when someone new comes to scrutinize. They never move past because scrutiny fuels insecurities. </p>

<p>As for the names which I selectively focused on due to the overabundance of information on Jimmy/Comet: Rachel Chandler, Walter Pearce, Brigid (lilgovernment) Nastasia, William Wegman.</p>

<p>Notice how the only examples there that are sinister are the ones used by Pizzagaters? All the others are referring to food.</p>

<p>And the guy you&#39;re accusing <em>works in the food industry</em>.</p>

<p>Just one of the many, many shitty leaps in logic and examples of reading <em>way</em> too much into things that defines this conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, if it was a picture of chicken then it wouldn&#39;t be unusual at all. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a picture of a man with a young child. And since the term chicken lover also denotes a man who has sex with boys, you can see how this would raise eyebrows. </p>

<p>This picture isn&#39;t altogether damning itself, but when part of a larger context, it is certainly unusual, to say the least. </p>

<p>He calls a baby a hotard, for example, which is well-known slang basically meaning &quot;dumb slut.&quot; Very inappropriate insult for a child.</p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2FyXrV.png">Hardly</a>. JoeWillis calls him a hotard and he responds back with #hotard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also uses the hashtag &quot;chicken lover&quot; on a post of a man with a young child. Chicken lover is a term popularized by NAMBLA meaning &quot;boy lover.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>chickenlover is a food hashtag. As a bullshitter myself, I could also see him politely calling his friend a cocklover. I don&#39;t buy the NAMBLA shit. Pretty sure you got memed by a someone referencing two Southpark episodes. </p>

<p>Not really, I could see friends posting similar shit. The alternative theory suggests that a yellow necklace means analingus, pizza means child, etc., </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you don&#39;t find anything unusual with his fascination with children, sadism, and sexually explicit material?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What sexually explicit material? The only inappropriate image that he posted was the nude one at a museum. Everything else was posted by patrons who tagged themselves at Comet Ping Pong. If you went there, you could tag anything you wanted. </p>

<p>What fascination with sadism? If you&#39;re suggesting the pictures by an artist who Podesta owns non-explicit paintings by the same artist - that&#39;s still Podesta not Jimmy. </p>

<p>What fascination with children? The only children that I&#39;m aware he had on his instagram is a family friend (#CarisJames), her brother, #chickenlover, and the beauty pageant pizza girl. Everything else are pictures people tagged of their OWN CHILDREN at his business</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about comet ping pong being family friendly? No shit. It&#39;s a pizza restaurant with pingpong tables. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of Reddit is suspicious recently. I would migrate to voat but the problem we face is systemic, not localized. Any sufficiently developed, anonymous, and populated forum will invariably be infiltrated by political/corporate shills, at which point the users who are more experienced will be able to tell that the heart and spirit of their community has been <em>shifted</em>, forcefully, leaving them with two options:</p>

<p><strong>1.) Insulation: disallow new</strong> users; grow paranoid; require more and more proof of realness; make taboo the mention of the things shills try to advocate for (think <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> with their ban on naming products: a fine rule, but a reaction, not a solution); generally become like ants or wasps: self-policing, using the natural, tried-and-true method of being an untrusting jerk. It&#39;s insurmountable, as a reaction. </p>

<p>The problem with this method is that you begin to die, as a community, as a spirit, the second you start to engage in it, because any system, community, or institution that values old blood and is fearful of new blood is doomed over time.  You can also become militant and angry; riddled with rules; rendered ineffective through your desire to regain your effect. I don&#39;t know that there are big example of this, but I think you can all see what I mean: in a phrase, distrust kills creativity.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Migration: move to</strong> Voat, or move from Digg to Reddit, with the idea being that things in forums work like apples: if someone keeps throwing rotten ones in your barrel, then you should find a new barrel. </p>

<p>The problem with this, metaphorically, is that the bad-apple-throwers are <em>well-funded</em>, to say the least, and there are institutions, whole agencies in fact, that can wrap their minds around their throwing of said apples being a good thing, in the same way a shepherd sees no wrong in putting up a shock-fence after his sheep figure a way around the barbed wire. To the sheep, freedom is in their grasp; they&#39;ve overcome the thing that has always been assumed to be all-powerful. To the shepherd, their product simply got some bad ideas in their head and they need to be reminded of the order of things. A good shepherd just adjusts his practices, and a bad one might, before changing, hang a few carcasses from his barbed wire, to try to show them he means business. In a way, they&#39;re right, and they&#39;re playing by The Rules (what can be done). They suck, and laws are supposed to stop The Rules, but sometimes a people have to work with them until such a time as law can be revived. I think we&#39;re living in one of those times. </p>

<hr/>

<p>What a burden, to feel as though each and every citizen <em>must</em> prove their suspicions in a court of law of which they have little access and less knowledge, when in fact a good system simply takes over and finishes the work that the people begin. Yet now, we are met with those who are either paid to repeat, or have internalized, a narrative of &quot;it is true for it has been written&quot; (by authority), and inversely &quot;it is untrue for it has not been written&quot; (by authority). They say &quot;yeah but has it been proven?&quot;, or &quot;show me <em>real</em> evidence&quot; (another way of asking for authoritative agreement), and not just to pizzagate, but to anything that counters an agenda. It places a huge burden on the people, and is the exact reason behind the growing sentiment that we have moved into a &quot;post-truth/fact&quot; society.</p>

<p>We cannot trust basic understandings any longer, because we are forced to have such an understanding, individually, of the events of any case in question so as to be indistinguishable from an actual, paid, careered investigator. It is a world in which probable suspicion does not lead to proper investigation, and so the people are left to try to create some workable intelligence community amongst themselves, <em>and all to save children</em>. It is heartening, to me, to see that we are all willing to undertake something so large and complicated. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not sheep, though, and we have to remember that: we&#39;ve simply been tamed and fenced in: The shepherds and the sheep in our metaphor are both human. If they install a shock-fence, we can look for the connection to the main line, sever it, and suddenly it&#39;s <em>easier</em> to escape than when the wire was sharp.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the spirit of our community- We can do this, Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sincerely doubt there are a lot of people being paid to downvote on this issue... its more likely that there&#39;s a handful of people &quot;in the know&quot; running multiple accounts... or are manually manipulating the vote tally from within Reddit.</p>

<p>Point is, with CTR they could hire a ton of low level contractors to do the work because there was a clear cut mission that was above-board (not illegal, not sketchy). They astroturfed an entire default subreddit and it wasn&#39;t just controlling what posts made it to the top - they turfed the entire comment section of every post - for months. That&#39;s not trivial. That took serious manpower.</p>

<p>With this, the pushback has been a lot smaller, but surgical in terms of strategy. </p>

<p>If there is a group seeking to push down this story, they&#39;re likely to be small so as to limit how many people know what they are up to. The last thing they&#39;d need is a single whistleblower to leak their agenda. The very existence of a group seeking to push back on this would break the case open if there was actual evidence of it happening. </p>

<p>This is all speculation of course. We still have no hard evidence that <em>any of this</em> is going on... but the circumstantial evidence is pretty compelling. </p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s just hard to say what&#39;s going on because this entire event (the election, the emails, the allegations, etc) has resulted in some massive migrations across the subs and the core users that used to form subs like this one are now being outnumbered by newcomers... which isn&#39;t bad or anything, it just thickens the fog around whatever might be going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think your speculation is valid tho, pizzagate posts have been reaching frontpage and ridiculously high numbers of upvotes since the very beginning, if your goal was to neutralize that you wouldn&#39;t settle for a small number of accounts to downvote this shit. </p>

<p>In fact it would be more suspicious and risky to do so, so say if the whole pizzagate thing is true then I don&#39;t believe those people that so meticulously hid their wrong doing would be stupid enough to take half measures on the very group that is seeking to uncover the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points are valid - the issue is obviously that this is almost all speculation. There isn&#39;t any statistical analysis to work from and we&#39;re all just sorta guessing in the dark at the shape of this event. Are we touching a huge hairy monster? Or a stuffed animal? </p>

<p>To your main argument on taking half-measures - I&#39;m of the opinion that this isn&#39;t the work of a huge organization... rather, we&#39;re likely dealing with a &quot;Jack the Ripper Machine&quot;, which is composed of single individuals planted in key spots of organizations involved with investigation and the justice system. Which isn&#39;t to say that the number of people involved isn&#39;t huge... just that the actual arm of pushback is small because that&#39;s all that was needed for centuries. This is likely the largest single leak in their history, and so this is uncharted territory. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also such a thing as a limited hangout - which, if that&#39;s the case here, would lead us to expect that a lot of &quot;juicy&quot; details would be allowed to leak, but the truly damaging leads would be put through the spoilage blender while they subtly encourage the community to pursue false leads to buy them time to prepare their defenses, vanish witnesses, issue bribes &amp; threats, produce a media smokescreen, and ultimately prepare to establish the entire thing as a &quot;public hysteria event&quot;. </p>

<p>But again, this is speculation that assumes that all of this is real... I&#39;m also a big believer in notion that these events can also be explained by much simpler phenomena involving a few fucked up individuals and a huge social taboo surrounding the crimes alleged (which makes the media avoid the issue - and their avoidance makes observers think that the issue is bigger than it is - and the nature of the allegations being so gross makes it oddly compelling to follow, which leads us to a situation like we have here). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I mean those single individuals still wouldn&#39;t think they can throw a handful of downvotes to a new post and bury it forever, that would be half measures and would never work, I don&#39;t care how new of a territory that is because I&#39;m a dumbass and I know that so they must surely know it too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious tho, how exactly would they manage to bury the truly damaging leads? There are thousands of people following this whole pizzagate story so unless they&#39;re manipulating the ones giving all the info I don&#39;t see how they would be able to achieve what you&#39;re speculating here.</p>

<p>If they can supposedly manipulate the important people following the conspiracy, then you&#39;ll be running in circles forever with no hopes of ever uncovering anything. You already lost if your speculation is true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough of them will go past the post title, if there was anything there worthy of this whole ruckus it would&#39;ve been exploding by now, but it isn&#39;t, it is barely a single match and hundreds of people fighting with tooth and nail to keep it from vanishing. </p>

<p>The well put dissent in this post clearly comes from legit users, there&#39;s nothing indicating otherwise and had they been full of disingenuous or misconstrued info, it would be easy for the side with the truth to put them down with a single link to the appropriate truth.</p>

<p>None of that is happening, the dissent is being meet with cries of shilling because there is no other answer, the people in this conspiracy know they have nothing but a hunch and get frustrated when people don&#39;t give them the privilege of believing in them. Defending your points is easiest when the truth is on your side, when it is not you can only deflect which is what I&#39;m seeing as a response to any and all dissent with this conspiracy. </p>

<p>So there are no bots, but apparently the major dissent must be astroturfing. I&#39;ll believe that when the conspiracy guys stop crying about it and do something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got called crazy a day or two ago. That is part of the shill playbook. </p>

<p>This is the most posted conspiracy this side of 9/11 and JFK in the history of Reddit. More than Sandy Hook considering how long it has been out there.</p>

<p>If this Pizzagate stuff breaks wide open, it would blow the entire global power structure up even more than if 9/11 was proven to be an inside job. They will do what they can to suppress this, but don&#39;t think for a minute we are alone on this one. There is a very strong aspect of the government that wants this information out. This isn&#39;t just coming out by chance.</p>

<p>Still, be careful. I have no idea what the perpetrators have done or would do to conceal their crimes. I can only guess they would start World War III if that meant they could avoid exposure. Let alone hurt or kill any single person or group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering that too. I think its odd that there is a desperate attempt of shielding and/or squashing this. To them, it is worth shielding like you say, but they could have said nothing. It would have garnered some attention but not enough exposure. </p>

<p>By starting the whole &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot; trend, it&#39;s going to make more people curious, especially people who use the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a great theory over at infinite chan that the modus operandi with respect to Assange is this: If he&#39;s dead, he&#39;s a martyr, and alive he&#39;s a threat. The best way to keep him is somewhere in between, sort of like schroedinger&#39;s cat.</p>

<p>This causes the community to turn against itself as Proofers continue to demand proof. The problem is, it may not be safe for assange to provide proof. For all we know, the good guys cut his power, raided the embassy and flew him out of harm&#39;s way under the cover of a chemical event at Heathrow.</p>

<p>What&#39;s this got to do with pizzagate? Not much, other than to serve as an example of the high level of statecraft operations currently underway. Odds are we are dealing with more than low level CTR shills here. This has gone from an InfoWar to full blown Aquino-esque MindWar. What&#39;s MindWar? Google is your friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dojo Pizza Joint combined Karate with Pizza and helping runaway kids. The Pastor who ran the operation was accused of human trafficking. The details are bit sketchy because witnesses say they saw 3 men climb into the building, then the place was raided. The Pastor maintained his innocence. But later the authorities said he had dozens of pics of cheese pizza. Not sure if the photos are of the kids who stayed at Dojo Pizza. I can&#39;t recall. Recently they struck down an order to take pics of his gonads to compare to the photos. It could be a massive setup by the state to frame him and to get those kids into the state authority foster homes. Or he could legitimately be a predator. </p>

<p>What&#39;s it got to do with PizzaGate?  The similarity in how the owner responded: Deny, maintains innocence, paints self as victim. </p>

<p>The whole drama was tipped off by some caller who had a complaint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is insane ramblings. There&#39;s actually nothing suspicious except the artwork which is just art. People looking for meaning where there is none. Take any evidence they try to bombard you with and ask yourself: How does it really relate to the rest of the conspiracy, is it verifiable or is it just random claims, is there a simpler context which explains it, what was omitted to make it look suspicious.  </p>

<p>When you start to ask these questions there&#39;s seriously nothing left that links the pizzeria and codewords to satanic pedophilia except art interpretations, done by people who would claim real art is paintings of fruit. If you look at the art and you feel like there&#39;s something weird going on, try to read an article about the pieces written by someone who actually likes art and understands it in the context of modern art.</p>

<p>Look at this post which presents many examples of how the theory is weak at best:<br/>
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/5esztz/skeptical_analysis_of_pizzagate/">https://np.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/5esztz/skeptical_analysis_of_pizzagate/</a>  </p>

<p>The conspiracy bubble does not want to find the truth, if they did they would be dissecting the evidence spoonfed to them by dishonest youtubers and bloggers, but you won&#39;t find anyone doing that here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>people here are linking mainstream media articles to &quot;disprove&quot; pizza gate with the words &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot; in the title and dozens of times in the body and i am being downvoted for pointing out that this is typical propaganda and in no way disproves pizza gate at all.  This is the point where i usually confront them to demand they try to explain ATLEAST one of the spooky facets of pizza gate, it&#39;s at this point they mysteriously fuck off.</p>

<p>But their comment is at +45 (WTF?!) im at like -3, for calling out MSM on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... something is definitely fucky here.</p>

<p>FFS in the same conversation someone was upvoted for argueing that MSM uses &quot;trusted verifiable and non-fake sources&quot; like jesus fuck.</p>

I think he has a good point that there&#39;s no link between pizzagate and this Hawaii thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I may play devil&#39;s advocate, I think there&#39;s a reason people react negatively to this particular conspiracy theory. Unlike, say, 9/11 theories, pizzagate is leveling unthinkably horrific accusations at specific, possibly completely innocent people. Combine that with the perception that these accusations are deeply politically motivated, and your average person is going to find the fervent confidence with which pizzagaters accuse people of the most horrible crimes to be unconscionable.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because a lot of it is crazy and far reaching. A creepy place in the middle of nowhere that doubles as a meth/moonshine manufacturer is far more likely than say a pizza parlor in the downtown D.C area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On all of those threads the top posters usually give very specific evidence why they believe pizzagate is misleading, or totally discredited.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not clued in on the details so I can&#39;t say one way or another, but I can absolutely say from being a regular reddit user that your claim they never provide counter evidence is factually incorrect. </p>

<p>One thing about these threads that always strikes me super unlikely:</p>

<p>The people most motivated with this stuff always just happen to randomly stumble on these big finds. What are the odds that someone heavily invested in this conspiracy just happens to live above an underground facility directly connected to it? I mean, come on guys. From my brief look into this stuff, it appears &quot;there is a there, there&quot;, but the conclusion jumps that immediately follow are so huge that it&#39;s hard to take anything I read here seriously. </p>

<p>And like it or not, but the influence of /the_donald shitposters and meme spouters does little to help the credibility of any finds. </p>

<p>For example, from OP&#39;s original post about the wifi signals:</p>

<p>&quot;Also, i noticed a truck making multiple late night trips for many days removing lots of busted up new looking concrete from the neighbors city trash bins. The property i lived on and that neighbors property are lease holds held by the same person (not my old boss).
Ive also recently connected my old boss to ebay accounts selling &quot;faulty hard drives&quot; and &quot;faulty&quot; electronics for strange prices. The buyer feedback is very bizarrely enthusiastic and there are lots of disturbing mentions of &quot;very happy kids&quot; and &quot;no fakes&quot;
I think i stumbled on a possible human trafficking and child p*** ring.&quot;</p>

<p>Really? I mean fucking really? I know you guys want to believe this stuff, and maybe there is something there, but if this is the level of evidence you are willing to go all in on, you have no hope. </p>

<p>Just read this: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>You can see with cold hard evidence that much of the initial &quot;evidence&quot; used to start this thing was flat out manufactured. Again, maybe, just maybe there is something here. But when your entire investigation is prompted from <em>undeniably</em> manufactured evidence, why should anyone who is neutral trust you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can debate any agenda, but the specific evidence outlined in the article is concrete. It shows how things were taken totally out of context, or just flat out manufactured, and used to bolster the conspiracy in it&#39;s early stages.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your post you mention that you&#39;re not clued into details and then go on to reference that snopes article as proof that all evidence in pizzagate is &quot;undeniably&quot; manufactured.</p>

<p>That snopes article barely even begins to address evidence presented in pizzagate...</p>

<p>So maybe you should do some more research an educate yourself further on pizzagate before you decide all the evidence manufactured?</p>

<p>You also quote a small snippet of evidence from the OP&#39;s original post about the wifi signals and respond, &quot;Really? I mean fucking really? I know you guys want to believe this stuff, and maybe there is something there, but if this is the level of evidence you are willing to go all in on, you have no hope.&quot;</p>

<p>But if you read the entire post from the OP, there is much much more evidence that lends to his credibility. And then you call me dishonest?</p>

<p>The original post from that person predates pizzagate, if you follow the link from OP, they originally posted about the wifi signals and possible pedophilia 7 months ago.  </p>

<p>EDIT: So I read the snopes article about pizzagate and it really doesn&#39;t do anything to exonerate the accused. I&#39;m not standing on either side of the isle, but if you really read the snopes article its only evidence is a NYT article that flat out says that &quot;It isn&#39;t true&quot;, taking the owner at his own word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I could see their point of view. They argue that our investigation into pizzagate is harmful to the ones implicated in the leaked emails. I have discussed with a few and their point is this: What if these people are innocent?(Which we always have to be open to that thought. Could be that this I&#39;d just one huge coincident, however, IMO I don&#39;t think it is) If these people that are being blamed IE Podesta and that other guy, the name is slipping away from me ATM, are in fact innocent, this can and is harmful to not only their businesses but their personal image. </p>

<p>However, my rebuttal to these claims is how come the emails that have been leaked, and are actual evidence, not enough to hurt the ones implicated in this pizzagate scandal. I think it&#39;s hilarious how close minded some people can be to the thought that there could be a global pizza ring going on and their reaction to the ones that want to find the truth is, &quot;You guys are crazy and or insane. You have nothing to prove you theories and should just drop everything and go on with your lives.&quot; The ignorance of people is outstanding. </p>

<p>However, going deeper into your point, it could be possible that fake accounts are made to discourage the investigation on the premise that we have no golden ticket that proves our claims. There are too many variables here and it is just to easy to catfish this very terrifying claim. The internet is truly a mind fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you&#39;re right, I had a real brain fart. I just really thought at first it was larp and forgot about it immediately. I&#39;m not sure I can think of a solid reason to have people work on a distillery for months and somehow still not have it work. I can imagine a personal project or something you do on your off time, but have a team on it and fail? If anything it just raises more questions personally, mostly that aren&#39;t related directly to the sketchiness of the place depending on the answers. I&#39;m sorry I feel like I&#39;m being equally as unproductive as the cheesybay post :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t put pics on 4chan. 4chan&#39;s image host doesn&#39;t strip the exif data, meaning that it can be used to determine your location. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scary how it&#39;s like that, the casual loss of privacy. If you post a pic to Google Photos, and use it as an image host, it uses WiFi and GPS data to put your location on google maps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>What with the date?</strong></p>

<p>If you understand your proofs, you should be able to simply TLDR or show the quotes that specifically link Jackson&#39;s email alias to the distillery.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s absolute no proof so far:</p>

<p>*1 - the email is real
*2 - the names on the emails are really the people you think it is. Their names are pretty common
*3 - that they have a real connection beside 1 email. I get emails everyday from random people asking for work. It&#39;s not far fetched to me that a business owner would get these too.</p>

<p>And you guys are cherry picking what looks like reliable info and reject what totally look like BS, some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While developing technologies to accelerate the maturation of distilled spirits for Generic vodka company in Honolulu, OPâs innate senses that something wasnât right...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I miss something? The guy who wrote that is the OP but talks about himself at the third person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bucket after I spilled all the goo inside. Can see brain in the lower inside and gross stuff on sides (<a href="https://imgur.com/bPeMnbw">https://imgur.com/bPeMnbw</a>)</p>

<p>What do you fit in a small bucket like that? Oh right, a baby and his brain is the last thing that dissolved............... Come on.</p>

<p>Exactly, if it was a sensor network then you would only really need one network (SSID) and your sensors would report across that via a standard network interface. Of course I can&#39;t think of much of a need for that many illicit signals either. It&#39;s very odd if true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some guy forgot his bread on the picture. Not really an unused spot.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really a commercial distillery either and there&#39;s people who have them at home you know. Same as there&#39;s people who have their basement full of weed. </p>

<p>Being an outdoor person, I find it hard to believe, especially in a tropical environment, that someone would leave that kind of equipment outside in a cheap tent for 9 months and it would look like in the picture. No cobwebs, no dust, no bird s*** on the roof, etc. It&#39;s clean enough to let food there.</p>

<p>And the guy took ONE SINGLE picture? Hmm k.</p>

<hr/>

<p>How did you guys come again to accusing a guy who could be simply a vodka distiller to be a pedophile?</p>

<p>Obscure cheese references on a facebook with a potato that happens to be on his website and 2.5 millions other websites as well? </p>

<p>&quot;Weird guy&quot;? </p>

<p>&quot;Weird building&quot;? </p>

<p>Did the OP said it was his last boss? Have you considered it doesn&#39;t make much sense he would know so much about this company but give you so little details, letting you figuring it all out? Doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>It would make more sense this ex-employee (real original-OP) has a vendetta on that business owner. Could even be a competitor. Just saying.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The hot-dog email with the added bondage guy for effect</strong>:</p>

<p>The email --&gt; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231</a></p>

<p>It was sent FROM &quot;Stern, Todd D&quot; to JOHN PODESTA. There&#39;s other emails with the 2 of them.</p>

<p>Does John has a hot dog stand in Hawaii now? Is that the idea? Or &quot;hot-dog = little boy&quot; so that must be a little-boy stand in Hawaii owned by podesta, right? And that makes Todd another pedophile on your list? </p>

<p>Is Todd an alias of Jackson or what? He looks like a real guy and it&#39;s a state.gov email address, not an alias or gmail. (The guy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Stern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Stern</a>)</p>

<p>What&#39;s the link there? &quot;Hawaii&quot;?</p>

<p>A person who works 40-60hr a week does dream of flipping burgers &amp; hot-dogs on an Hawaiian beach once in a while. That&#39;s a very VERY common thing to say for busy people.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like the only link between the &#39;evil&#39; pizzeria and this Hawaii story is Anita Lord &quot;hacked email&quot; and 3 potato man pictures.</strong></p>

<p>This is an hacked email not really of the Wikileaks level of credibility, let&#39;s be honest. That R. Windsor guy could really be a R. Windsor. What&#39;s the proofs this is a real email? What is the proof that email was really sent to the same email as Jackson&#39;s alias? None besides a name. Not even the email address. Nothing anyone can verify and use as evidence.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a quite popular Windsor and it would make PERFECT SENSE why a woman such as Sacha (supposing it&#39;s Sasha/Anita and that you got this one right at least) who works as a performer in music and dance would contact that dude, also in the same area of business.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Horrible how you guys just share blindly names and business info of people you &quot;think&quot; are pedophile or flesh eater because you found a freaking small bucket on a property.</strong></p>

<p>Online reputation &quot;cleaner&quot; will have a LOT of business this year with your &quot;investigations&quot;. Oh god... SMH</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Also, the kid claimed he drilled the slab, poured water into &quot;suspicious hole&quot; (with a metal pole of the same size right next to it), used some whatever-tool to calculate his weird wifi reading, walked around the property, emptied the &quot;blue bucket like the hydroxide one in breaking bad and may contain brain substance&quot;, took 5-6 pictures, went behind an alembic, and did all this while being scared to death. </p>

<p>He took about 5-6 pictures, no different angles, and irrelevant subjects. Never took pictures of his readings.</p>

<p>Then he had to flee for his life and his GF even dropped him. He even had the equivalent of Men in Black after him. So he thought: &quot;I&#39;ll post on the most monitored conspiracy forums and on 4 chan.  People need to see my blue bucket picture.&quot; Seems perfectly rational. Still, there&#39;s NO CRIME&#39; NO VICTIMS&#39; NO TRANSACTIONS.</p>

<p>Now I guess someone will say &quot;that was not done in the same day&quot; --&gt; then why no more evidences and pictures? </p>

<p>The truth is the whole thing is most likely posted by the kid of an upset neighbor, a way to coerce the guy to sell his land parcel (go google map), someone not happy with his business, etc. Don&#39;t look only at his friends but his enemies too. The wifi reading can also be explained.</p>

<p>All they have is the fact Jackson had an alias with the name &quot;windsor&quot;.</p>

<p>They connect the probably (single) unreliable &quot;hacked&quot; email to Sasha Lord (supposely aka Anita) who has to be the same Anita Lord on that fake email writing to Jackson under the alias Windsor! And Sasha is a DJ at Comet Pizza... It&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate stuff bothers me.  This is going to be one of those things that will either be impossible to prove or will shatter.  If Hillary is involved, tragic accidents will abound.  I&#39;m surprised Podesta has made it this long.  When you look at what happened with the Russian doctor who committed &#39;suicide&#39; by stabbing himself to death for identifying the radioactive poison used on the old spy, who knows what is going to happen next.</p>

<p>With that said, I know I am going to get downvoted to hell, but let me say a couple of things I do know. , the picture isn&#39;t a distillery.  That&#39;s barely even something you&#39;d make moonshine with.  That looks like someones backyard setup.  Now yes, facade is everything in the game, so simple is something like that you&#39;d look over and make the scene more realistic to an outside viewer.</p>

<p>Second, if he was picking up 30+ wifi from underground, they&#39;d have to be putting out a lot of juice or it would have to be a fairly large complex.  If your security is good, you wouldn&#39;t even broadcast an SSID, you would hand that out on a case by case basis.  A good admin can also limit the broadcast range so that it wouldn&#39;t go beyond a certain distance.  A lot of companies won&#39;t let their broadcast go beyond the walls of a building.</p>

<p>Now these are people who fell for phishing scams and let the SOS run an email server offsite, so anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few counter points.  1) op said the 30 SSIDs were changing often, I think he said every 5 minutes.  I can&#39;t think of any real world need to do that.  As you said, for security sake the SSID broadcast could have been turned off and left unseen.  2)OP mentioned they were broadcast at very low power from a central spot.  It was unclear to me if they were broadcasting at low voltage or if the signal was degrading from the concrete slab.  3) it wouldn&#39;t take much voltage to broadcast 30 SSIDs if all were coming from one AP.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but WHY broadcast 30 ssid let alone rotate them every 5 minutes.  Unless you&#39;ve got 30 people all wandering around with their phones broadcasting as WIFI hotspots (though now that I think about it, that might make sense).  When I said a lot of power, I meant you&#39;ve have to turn the signal up to make it to the outside.  For something of this level, you wouldn&#39;t just have something directly below a slab.  Rebar and concrete make it difficult to clearly get signals through.  With something on this level why even use Wifi?  Cat5/6/7 room to room would be a hell of a lot more secure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, one idea to have 30 SSIDs rotating out every 5 minutes would be to obscure something else.  Security through obscurity?  So if you want to protect a real AP, you could setup some weird AP honeypot to let you know if anything is trying to scan networks.  Weird layer and idea but best I can come up with.</p>

<p>This is it, this is the time in history where the elite will exposed and conquered.</p>

<p>It had to happen at some point. It&#39;s getting to a boiling point. The corruption in the U.S- Soros inciting riots, 90% of major news outlets are shills and people know it. Thus Trump victory.</p>

<p>Europe is ripe for a civil war with the Islamic invasion. An invasion orchestrated by the same elites trying behind the corruption in the U.S</p>

<p>Shit is going to get crazy.</p>

<p>What a time</p>

He recorded the specific tufts of branches and leaves in which each code-named individual preferred to roost in drawings of their night-time habitats. He used his skills that he developed building and customizing AR-platform sporting rifles to zero a 22-caliber nitro piston pellet rifle with variable 3-9x and multi-range focus optic to ensure that he could cull these individuals without broadcasting unnecessary reports to the highly protective Pferder. He researched the anatomy of the rooster to discover that at the ft-lbs of impact force and projectile velocity that his pellet rifle was capable of transmitting, only the region between the top of the eye and the transverse line between the lower comb and back of neck would generate a one-shot kill. He also improvised a body retrieval system from 550-cord and a scrap piece of 12 foot long tube steel that was on the property to prevent Mr. Pferder from knowing who was taking his beloved birds.</p>

<p>Wtf, the OP guy killed this guy&#39;s roosters?</p>

<p>Honestly think this guy needs some help.</p>

The problem with searches like this is there&#39;s no accurate form of error-checking so we can drag a person&#39;s name through the mud really well before there&#39;s even any non-circumstantial evidence (this is why real investigators don&#39;t name suspects until they have good reason to).</p>

<p>As someone else said this isn&#39;t really a conspiracy to me at this point as much as it&#39;s honestly like an ARG (which is why I think people are finding it so intriguing).  All there is are weird connections/activity, smoke and mirrors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points are valid - the issue is obviously that this is almost all speculation. There isn&#39;t any statistical analysis to work from and we&#39;re all just sorta guessing in the dark at the shape of this event. Are we touching a huge hairy monster? Or a stuffed animal? </p>

<p>To your main argument on taking half-measures - I&#39;m of the opinion that this isn&#39;t the work of a huge organization... rather, we&#39;re likely dealing with a &quot;Jack the Ripper Machine&quot;, which is composed of single individuals planted in key spots of organizations involved with investigation and the justice system. Which isn&#39;t to say that the number of people involved isn&#39;t huge... just that the actual arm of pushback is small because that&#39;s all that was needed for centuries. This is likely the largest single leak in their history, and so this is uncharted territory. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also such a thing as a limited hangout - which, if that&#39;s the case here, would lead us to expect that a lot of &quot;juicy&quot; details would be allowed to leak, but the truly damaging leads would be put through the spoilage blender while they subtly encourage the community to pursue false leads to buy them time to prepare their defenses, vanish witnesses, issue bribes &amp; threats, produce a media smokescreen, and ultimately prepare to establish the entire thing as a &quot;public hysteria event&quot;. </p>

<p>But again, this is speculation that assumes that all of this is real... I&#39;m also a big believer in notion that these events can also be explained by much simpler phenomena involving a few fucked up individuals and a huge social taboo surrounding the crimes alleged (which makes the media avoid the issue - and their avoidance makes observers think that the issue is bigger than it is - and the nature of the allegations being so gross makes it oddly compelling to follow, which leads us to a situation like we have here). </p>
