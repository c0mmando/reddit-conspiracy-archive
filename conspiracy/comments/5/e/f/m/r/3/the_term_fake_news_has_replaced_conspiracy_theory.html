    <div class="md"><p>The lying, complicit, and criminal accomplice media are attempting to raise on a busted flush to regain lost credibility. It will fail, because even Trump called them in for a face-to-face meeting and basically called them all worthless liars.</p>

<p>So, if even the new President recognises that they&#39;re full of shit collaborators and purveyors of state-sponsored corporate propaganda, then I think other people can see it too which is why their ratings are shit and plummeting further. </p>

<p>The only way they can try and turn it around is by promoting the horseshit of &quot;Fake News&quot; which is ironic considering they&#39;ve been manufacturing fake news to manipulate people&#39;s perceptions for decades now. Bottom line is that this is only part of a new PSYOP campaign to denigrate on-line alternative media and begin to try and twist people to attacking or ridiculing it. Once this gains enough traction, the second wave of the attack will commence which will be the imposition of licensing for anyone reporting the news along with drafting laws banning or restricting websites who are not state approved. Think no-fly list for blogs and websites that deliver real news that doesn&#39;t fit the state directed narrative.</p>

<p>Happy to say that all of this will not work to their favour ultimately as the masses who have woken up will not go back into the coma they&#39;ve just awoken from. Instead, this will steel their resolve that their country has degenerated into a fascist empire with complete disregard for truth, freedom and will readily violate any law or pull any stunt to advance its aims and protect itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess im hopeful it will work but just at my job or anywhere else, people eat their breakfast while watching the news and thats pretty much what they talk about for the rest of the day. Maybe in the future when people get information on internet aside from BuzzFeed-like sources things may go forward.</p>

<p>For now im waiting to see what will happen when Trump is in office and doing my own research.</p>

<p>Edit : im hopeful it WONT work </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Worse&quot; is subjective. It&#39;s more blatant, but that only betrays their fragile and diminishing grasp on controlling the narrative.</p>

<p>They are losing control, getting desperate, and have everything to lose. Of course they are going to go all out with this nonsense.</p>

<p>To me that is a very positive sign.</p>
