    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely it will work because of timing. Trump won&#39;t move with anything while Obama has the power to pardon (if he moves at all) and the pizzagate investigation have stalled, not because the people are confirmation biased, but because we&#39;ve already dug up everything to raise plenty of suspicion. The only place to go from that point is with legal recourse. An average citizen can&#39;t legally conduct a property search or subpoena bank records.</p>

<p>Without the hard evidence that can <em>only</em> be acquired through a legal investigation by law enforcement, the citizen investigation stalled.</p>

<p>Now, with 30+ days until pardon power is lost, they will fire back at the internet as being fake news and without hard evidence collected by law enforcement or even an official notice by law enforcement to investigate, the public will buy it.</p>

<p>I tried to warn pizzagate about the timing, but the heartfelt post I made was coined a shill and I was quickly banned. I was able to remove the ban, once the mods saw that my intentions were true, but they made it very clear that they were moving forward.</p>

<p>Something like this needs to stay on 4chan because involving the public isn&#39;t helping. Hardly anything constructive has been dug up in pizzagate that wasn&#39;t already dug up on 4chan and there&#39;s confirmation that law enforcement watches 4chan, so spreading the pizzagate stuff to the public was a detriment. Let alone the fact that it gave the perpetrators plenty of time to liquidate any current &quot;assets&quot;, establish alibis, and prepare for questioning.</p>

<p>Bravo, pizzagate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say the people who pizzagate reached are really aware of it. Rather they&#39;re aware that a new &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; has come out of all this. Many still have that conditioning to dismiss &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people commented on pizzagate threads trying to poke holes in the connections because they were not able to accept conspiracy theories due to their conditioning. Replace that mental conditioning (brain washing) with the system in the above quote. All those debates on the threads of pizzagate would just solidify the existing conditioning of someone who&#39;s already conditioned to dismiss conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>So, I disagree that it was useful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s still not evidence and the FBI already knew about all these deep connections, so in fact exposing these connections is doing nothing more than giving them the chance to cover it up.

<p>Great job in sounding the alarm for them, pizzagate. Well done. Now they know what needs to go and how to answer questions to drive away suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true though that many &quot;alternative media&quot; websites intentionally mislead and sometimes publish outright false articles to boost clicks, and subsequently ad revenue. Some websites I can list off the top of my head that do this are NaturalNews, HumansAreFree, LastAmericanVagabond, and somethingsomethingPundit, which are not coincidentally some of the most sourced websites on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That being said, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a good thing that Google is trying to censor them by cutting off ad revenue, but it&#39;s well known that these fake or sensationalist news sites did have an impact on the election by having their articles go viral.</p>
