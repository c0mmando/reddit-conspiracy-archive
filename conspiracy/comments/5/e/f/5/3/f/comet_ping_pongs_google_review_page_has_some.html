        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I get it, the idea of a pedophilia ring in Washington DC involving the powerful and elite tends to rile people up. People are trying to gather evidence in an attempt to put these people behind bars. However, planting false &quot;evidence&quot; is not the way to go. Reading some of these Google reviews, many of which were submitted recently in the past few weeks, it&#39;s painfully obvious that these reviews are most likely fake. Some excerpts include: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw several of the famous people being ushered off into separate rooms in long corridor style hallways, most likely to discuss pizza and politics.  The most disturbing part was the cries of children that didn&#39;t seem to be coming from upstairs but echoed to sound like they were coming from the rooms.</p>

<p>Had some pizza, blacked out and woke up in an island run by someone called Epstein, they did horrible things.</p>

<p>Was greeted and served by the manager on my visit. Unfortunately he gave me some pretty bad vibes. Asked for a medium cheese pizza, and he just stared at me grinning, and insisted he shake my hand. Did this weird hand shake where he pressed down on my ring finger knuckle, whilst winking at me. I responded in kind. Showed me to my &quot;table&quot; in the basement, which turned out to be a bare concrete room with a small child chained to the wall. Turned around and left. Wouldn&#39;t recomment.</p>

<p>I came in asking to make an order, and the guy asked me &#39;do you want to play dominos on cheese or on pasta?&#39;. I wasn&#39;t really sure what he meant but he kept winking at me. He said I could leave my map anywhere I wanted if I came back once they closed. I don&#39;t even have a map! hahaha. Not really sure what he meant but my slice of pepperoni pizza was alright. The workers are oddballs but the pizza is good!</p>

<p>Gathering evidence to build a case is one thing, but planting fake reviews and circlejerking on Google reviews is another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bunch of reviews on different sites have some combination of &quot;tasty pizza&quot; and &quot;great service&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, the pizza and service may be good, I just think its weird that 10 reviews ive seen use the words tasty and great to describe the pizza and service respectively. People know more adjectives than that</p>
