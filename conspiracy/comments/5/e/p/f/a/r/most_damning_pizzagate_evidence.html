So I was wondering what do you individually feel is the most damning bit of this puzzle?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping  up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to  the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo). I am ccing Trudy to repeat the invite, and sending pining  wishes-you-could-come to Rima, John P, and Laurie &amp; Chris.</p>

<p>It appears both have John and Tony have Grey hair and have had grey hair for some time. </p>

<p>And clearly there were two men, not one, in the sketches so &quot;the man&quot; must be referencing somebody besides who appears in the sketches.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen evidence they were in Portugal; will post here if I run across it again.</p>

A second accomplice is never mentioned and in no way is it implied that two or more men were involved, strictly concerning the Smith Sighting.

    <div class="md"><p>One of the e-fits looks much more like her own father. That&#39;s a whole weird rabbit hole. There&#39;s a lot of info on the internet about Maddy Mccann. I reckon it&#39;s a bit of a red herring. It fits but there is a range of other evidence suggesting otherwise. I&#39;m yet to be convinced of the Podesta Mccann link. Especially as there is so much info about the case that is fishy as hell. Try a a bit of the &#39;truth of the lie&#39; by Amaral the detective on the case for some real weird stuff. Podesta out the Mccanns themselves in.</p>
