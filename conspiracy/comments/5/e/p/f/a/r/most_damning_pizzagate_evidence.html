       So I have been following this story since the start and while I have seen a lot of interesting bits of discussion, but it's hard to keep track of it all and much gets lost in the waves of even newer info. So I was wondering what do you individually feel is the most damning bit of this puzzle?

       I assume the kids in mention were the biological children of the women in question? Is there any proof otherwise? Has anyone looked into that? Kids like pools? Seems like a reasonable way to keep some kids entertained.

       I thought of that first, but it was worded insanely weird.  The emailer said that the kids would be "delivered" via an uber service for "your entertainment".  Have to look up the sender and see if he/she actually has children

       <p>
        With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping  up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to  the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo). I am ccing Trudy to repeat the invite, and sending pining  wishes-you-could-come to Rima, John P, and Laurie &amp; Chris.

       And clearly there were two men, not one, in the sketches so "the man" must be referencing somebody besides who appears in the sketches.

       Upon further investigation, it appears the e-fit image in question is two separate e-fit renderings of the same man. A second accomplice is never mentioned and in no way is it implied that two or more men were involved, strictly concerning the Smith Sighting. That could explain why they look so similar and take on a sort of brotherly appearance.

       One of the e-fits looks much more like her own father. That's a whole weird rabbit hole. There's a lot of info on the internet about Maddy Mccann. I reckon it's a bit of a red herring. It fits but there is a range of other evidence suggesting otherwise. I'm yet to be convinced of the Podesta Mccann link. Especially as there is so much info about the case that is fishy as hell. Try a a bit of the 'truth of the lie' by Amaral the detective on the case for some real weird stuff. Podesta out the Mccanns themselves in.

       Why put it up there in the first place?  I'm just saying it makes them look more guilty by removing it after it was pointed out that it was straight up pedo.  They should have released a statement if they were unaware, saying just that.

       Ok, if you were running a business and unbeknownst to you your logo contained pedophile symbols, would you not alter it after finding out?

       Yes I would and like I said issue some kind of statement saying why I changed a logo that is used on all their adverts etc.  I tend to think it was intentional since SO MANY of the bands etc that played there had the same type of thing going on.

       I'm 100% certain you didn't know until recently this was a so called pedophile symbol.
      </p>

       It's a freaking pizza slice logo, get used to it you'll see tons of them and they won't all be pedophiles.

       Indeed... They were harassed and got bad reputation because their logo that looked like a triangle pizza slice also looked like a triangle "pedo symbol".
      </p>
      <p>
       People were even calling them... I would have changed my logo too, guilty or not!

       The truth is hidden in the connections of those people on instagram with the Comet Pizza owner. it's a creepy ring of young adults constantly taking pictures of themselves with different children with reference to pizza or chicken
One of them talks about stealing babies and tons of references to children, Pizza and suffering.
