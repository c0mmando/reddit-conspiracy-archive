       Has he got anything else going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is, is there any other reason that he could have been put on the 50 Most Powerful list?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who made that list and where was it found?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I'm asking is because there are lists and then there are lists. If you find someone in the Forbes 500, that says a lot about who they are. I could go ahead and put out my own list and put whoever I liked on there... but it just wouldn't carry as much weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a "Forbes 500" type list, I'd be interested to know the reasons for Alefantis being on it. But what if this is someone's backhanded way of saying that he makes great pizza and lots of powerful people are customers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone tell me about this list?

Restaurateur and Bon Vivant

       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bon vivant is french and means "good living"... but in this context it means someone who enjoys partying/socializing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to my original question about who came up with the list, this is GQ magazine. I kind of suspect they have a different idea of who makes it onto their top 50 list. More of an emphasis on socializing than hard political influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I went back and looked to see who else makes that list. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Svetlana Legetic, Jayne Sandman, Barbara Martin... Party planners
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Stephen Strasburg... Pitcher, Washington Nationals
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          José Andrés... Restaurateur (not pizza)
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Some of the people on the list are genuine heavyweights and some of them are there because hip/cool.

       I think I heard he was dating John Podesta at one point? Or maybe they're just close friends? Not that dating a lobbyist should give you top 50 in DC power or anything, even if that lobbyist is super tight with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the Clinton cabal.

       Where there's smoke there's usually fire and they wanted/want that fire out badly enough to launch a coordinated media campaign to kill the credibility of pizzagate. Then go on to vilify the believers and begin an orchestrated attack on truth websites by tar-brushing them with the intel manufactured branding "Fake News" to drive off the interested masses. What you are looking at is a government directed, media propagated counter-offensive in the information war against the public at large. However instead of challenging the blatant and mounting evidence of a running paedophile network in their "news stories", they instead launch salvoes of innuendo that point to nothing but vague generalities. They localise the circumference of the pizzagate investigations and then paint the perpetrator as poor, misunderstood victim, chosen at random by a wild, digital lynch mob.

       Remember Alefantis is just ONE of many fronts for an organised, network of paedophiles who run high up the political predator chain. Twittergate corroborates this exposure as Twitter did nothing to the
       <strong>
        23,000
       </strong>
       Twitter user accounts of paedos trafficking child porn for months, but instead suspended the user account of Molly, the woman brave enough to report it all. She has stated that she has reported her findings to the FBI and law enforcement, but they have done nothing with it, much to her dismay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is MSM needs the public to believe the shit they are propagating in this coordinated offensive so they can diffuse the situation and lull the masses back to sleep. That way their paymasters and overlords can keep on committing their crimes of murder, trafficking and sexual assault unfettered by public exposure.

       Umm no, that's not how it works actually. Even if you 100% believe the conspiracy, can you not understand that someone who might NOT believe the conspiracy could see it as being harmful towards the potentially innocent people who work at this establishment? And maybe THAT is why they're trying to put this to rest?

       Except the NYT article didn't address the evidence and basically said "go back to sleep". And also, since when has reddit admins cared about which hunts actively enough to shut down multiple subreddits? It's clear both NYT and reddit got a signal to censor this story and get people to shut up, at about the same time. To me, it implies a coordinated event, rather than an organic reaction by each to prevent a witchhunt. But you could be right too, I don't dismiss it.

       As opposed to what else might be happening which is much worse. It's pretty lose/lose, but I'd rather an investigation happen. Doxxing isn't cool, but neither is potentially guilty people getting off free without actual scrutiny

       Yep, hopefully everyone is aware that the msm protects their owners and share holders and suppresses investigations and pushes narratives All.the. time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not aware it's time to realise this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are allowed to push propaganda on the citizens. Never forget that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when the admin changes the users in the comments it's meant to make it look like the users are crazy and attacking each other. Doing that, to make a point to do that and to work that into a Washington Post narrative is to make us look crazy, like they always try to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy conspiracy theorists all going nuts and witch hunting and fake fake fake, don't forget it's fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Reddit admin is participating in An Actual Conspiracy along with The Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy to defame a group of people investigating pedophile cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that definitely shows me that the investigation is trying to be suppressed.

       Are those the actual sketches? If they are the ones I am thinking of, they look like somebody took the photos of Podesta and his friend and placed it on a police sketch. The subreddit The Donald is being lured to go on a witch hunt, get caught doing that witchhunt, be made an example of what happens if you listen to fake news. Conspiracy is taking The bait as well.The Pizza store has been brought to the attention of many. Reddit needs to let it go. Let professionals with reason and rationality handle the investigation if one is warranted.

       those weren't real sketches. Those were shopped. or it was one of those face swap things that are popular with kids these days.  just because the story resonates within you doesn't mean it is based in reality.

       This is bait. They are setting Trumps base up. They are going to incite more vitriol and hateful rhetoric towards the poor rural people and anybody that likes Trump. They can't go after Trump for the time being. But they can go after his base. And they will. Remember they don't have to present facts, they simply have to be the first to say something. They have the megaphone and they still have the trust of many despite what just happened. And because like many overreacting to the pizzagate, the media's base can overreact as well, and they start accusing people of being things they are not. And then they feel justified in attacking or harassing others.

       I really like the alternative viewpoints that some bring into these subreddits. I really don't want them to be censored or removed. People need to take a step back and get some alternative perspective.

       edit: to your point on wikipedia. Wikipedia gets edited all the time. The same issues that reddit has with mod manipulation actually occurs in wikipedia daily.

       Thank you for vindicating me against what amounts to willful ignorance or flat out lying / shilling.  The number of sources out there from years upon years ago number well into the 100+ range.  It takes 5 minutes to find a handful of sources.  People are either avoiding the answer they don't want, or trying to dissuade other readers from doing so.  Pretty evident in this case which is which.

       People don't want to see the truth. It's horrifying that the media is covering this up. I didn't sign up for this shit but it's stronger than myself to at least use legal sources to point people to the truth.

       They look shopped. But it could be a software that Brits use. If this is legit then pointing out the the eery similarities between the sketches and what Podesta and His friend look like should be uncensored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiwever, I just can't shake the feeling that this is a lure. Something isn't right about the story. It's been presented on a silver platter. Wiki leaks was shut down. Assange is silent. Massive DDoS occurred in the summer and affected websites like Reddit.

       This is because you don't want it to be true. I'm from Europe and we had a similar story in my country. Nobody wanted to believe it, the press tried to suppress it, the investigators were harassed but it eventually all came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen the video? It's an ABC news video from 2013 where the pictures are shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a definite conspiracy going on. If you want to defend the Podesta's you could say that Scotland Yard was trying to fool ABC news to damage the Podesta's in 2013. This sounds pretty tinfoil to me TBH, but it's a possibility.

       it's not that I cannot or won't believe something like that could happen. I know it does. The man in the sketches is middle aged. Podesta would have been 60, which is considered an older man. he had wrinkles on his face and if the police had such details, if it was Podesta, the faces would have some wrinkles on them.

       You should read your own posts and check the mental gymnastics you're trying to make.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are those the actual sketches? If they are the ones I am thinking of, they look like somebody took the photos of Podesta and his friend and placed it on a police sketch.
       </p>
       <p>
        those weren't real sketches. Those were shopped. or it was one of those face swap things that are popular with kids these days. just because the story resonates within you doesn't mean it is based in reality.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I hope you understand that you're trying to indeliberately muddy the waters on an investigation to potentially save innocent children. The sketches aren't even the most terrifying part in this investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your time and read everything you can about this investigation. There is a lot of false information out there on both sides (spreading false information is the perfect strategy to marginalize this).

       it's not mental gymnastics. It's going over things with a critical eye. They do not look like typical police sketches and in fact I thought they shopped Podesta's face onto one of them. That is until, I decided to critically compare the faces, this happened as I posted.

       Reddit is under a legal obligation to not have these accusations get out of hand or else it will get sued for libel/slander. You can't just go on a witch hunt because you think someone looks like a suspect. Most of you have little experience. You cannot harass a shop (like what happened at a day care years ago) because you believe it to be a ring for pedophilia. It's dangerous.

       It's not. This is all public information. The Scotland Yard guy was really clear in his instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides John Podesta should be happy. If you haven't done anything wrong you have nothing to hide/fear the government always told us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he is innocent he should be happy that people are trying to reveal the truth. Shilling and mainstream media bias is going to give a monopoly to right-wing echochambers which is only going to make this worse.

       The court of public opinion is very different than the court of law. It is not limited like the court of law. Speculation and conjecture and heresy are allowed in n the court of public opinion. Sometimes that leads ti riots (see: Trayvon Martin media vs court transcripts, see: Brown, media vs Offical investigation, see: Rodney King, media vs court transcript.) The court of public opinion also tends to go into hysterics and have events such as witch trials. You can seriously destroy and individual's life or company's life if you simply accuse them of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have looked at what is available and to be honest, it is all speculation. No real evidence. The only thing that could remotely be seen as reasonable are  the face sketches. It would be seen as reasonable to focus on Madeline's kidnapping instead of the alleged ring. You want to be seen as reasonable or whatever research anybody does in this matter will be outright dismissed. People confuse truth with credibility. People will believe who is credible, not necessarily who has the truth.

       The nose is not the same as Podesta's and neither are the ears. Neither sketch match.  Podesta would have been 60 years old at the time of the kidnapping. old enough to be described as an older man and he looked it. Those sketches do not represent that. Those sketches resemble middle aged men.

       My post was super vague, but I totally agree with you.  I was trying to point out the claim that the sketches match the Podesta brothers, when the people purporting this conspiracy can't even get the basic fact that there was only one person seen with Maddy correct.

       Fun fact: Apparently
       <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/377597/number-of-pizza-restaurants-us/">
        there are over 74,000 pizza restaurants
       </a>
       in the US! And
       <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/us-total-restaurant-count-increases-by-4442-units-over-last-year-reports-npd/">
        over 600,000 restaurants in general
       </a>
       in the country! How amazing it is of the NYT to defend this one in particular. I mean the chances are so slim, they must be really really really special.

       If god doesn't speak to you, does it mean he's mad at you? Or could it be because he's not there?

       If god does speak to you, does it mean god is speaking to you, or could it mean you're schizophrenic?

       If something is bullshit, calling it bullshit is pretty appropriate. And I have yet to see new or convincing evidence of a real conspiracy. You have a couple idiots and a couple creeps. All are tangentially related because wonder of wonders, all this shit came from the same source.

       If you pulled a dump of my emails and found some to a boss I worked for six years ago, and an amazon order I placed to day, it doesn't mean that shit's interconnected.

       It doesn't mean the parks service is in cahoots with the text book industry to drive up lumber sales by artificially inflating the cost of text books and motivating Big Paper to rape our forests at top dollar. Doesn't mean they aren't either, but evidence and facts are more important than paranoid implication.

       The oligarchs' media swept Pizzagate under the rug, just like the Presidio Daycare Abuse Scandal and the Franklin Scandal. The media in Western countries pretty much denies that satanic ritual abuse or human sacrifices even exist, and this alone is some of the most powerful evidence that Satan is the eye at the top of the occult pyramid. Like all Christians, I await the return of God's only son, Jesus Christ, to truly "drain the swamp" when he defeats the New World Order before setting up his 1000 year kingdom on Earth. Ezekiel 7:4-6 "And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come." Matthew 18:6 "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
