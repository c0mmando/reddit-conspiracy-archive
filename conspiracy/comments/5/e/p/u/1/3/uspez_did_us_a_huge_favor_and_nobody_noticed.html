        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am shocked nobody realized this already. Perhaps I do because Spez and I are a bit from the same world. I am one hundred percent positive about what I&#39;m about to write.</p>

<p>Food for thought:</p>

<p>1) There was absolutely no chance in hell edits such as his would go unnoticed. Difficult to imagine a more flagrant, blatant and gross tampering of content. There is equally no chance he didn&#39;t know this.</p>

<p>2) There was absolutely no reason for him to admit doing it, especially publicly. There are dozens of people inside the organization that could be responsible - admins, system (infrastructure) administrators, database administrators, privileged third-party vendors or consultants, etc. It could have been a hacker. It could have been a bug. It could have been a rogue plugin, bookmarklet or other javascript in the tampered users&#39; browsers (or malware on their computer). Stretching it a bit, it could have been a mirroring/backup/synchronization malfunction. Or whatever. They could have basically said anything, blamed anyone, however improbable, all but a few would have ever questioned it, and u/spez wouldn&#39;t have lost face. He would not have been busted (he&#39;s root on all platforms, knows the code like his back pocket, and nobody would&#39;ve questioned the CEO himself). Reddit could have ignored it or outright denied it ever happened, say the people forged the screenshots, say the tampered users lied or dreamt, it would have become an improvable conspiracy theory, quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>3) Reddit suits certainly did not approve of his admission, as per the point above. For investors and the general public alike this is a huge blow to the company&#39;s reputation, especially because it&#39;s the CEO that&#39;s involved. The company had strictly nothing to gain by admitting it happened, let alone that the CEO was responsible. You can be sure he took a great deal of heat, mostly because of the admission, not the edits. That&#39;s also why he admitted it as a comment on Reddit, not in an official manner (which would have to go through the suits).</p>

<p>4) Spez is not an idiot. He&#39;s the founder. He was brought back to the company in order to save it. More importantly he&#39;s an elite coder, he&#39;s a hacker. Autists like this don&#39;t go on random infantile rampages; they boil silently, then they plot, and finally they cover their tracks. </p>

<p>5) In his admission he told us the &quot;pizzagate stuff&quot; (i.e. banning) caused him to have a &quot;long week&quot; (on Wednesday). Indeed if I translate his admission it reads &quot;this pizzagate stuff was such an ordeal that I had a nervous breakdown and started editing away trivial and inconsequential stuff on The_Donald, too distraught to realize that would be obvious and counter-productive&quot;.</p>

<p>6) This happened on the r/The_Donald thread where they were discussing the banning of r/Pizzagate right after it happened. </p>

<p>7) In the week before the ban moderators had gotten the sub under control. There was no more doxing. Any violating post or comment was being promptly deleted (indeed subscribers even heavily complained about it). This can be proven with the archive. The decision was clearly based on ideology/politics rather than rules. </p>

<p>8) Before Reddit banned the sub, Spez must have looked at it at least once. And if he did, <a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">this is what he would have read first</a>. This post had garnered 3000+ votes in less than 24 hours in a 20k community, and was on top at the time of the ban. It was perfectly synchronized with the Pizzagate propaganda blitz that happened at the same time (NYT, Snopes, etc.). Indeed anyone investigating Pizzagate during the blitz would have seen it at once. It is likely thousands of journalists world wide read it. It is likely Spez read it too.</p>

<p>As far as users are concerned, the consequences of his actions were the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nothing you ever write or have ever written on Reddit can ever again be held against you in a court of law. It is now common knowledge that employees can/do tamper with the database without leaving any trace. Anyone technologically inclined would have already known of this possibility of course (there is no way a big-data NoSQL DB can log and sign every single transaction it carries out, for reasons of performance and storage/cost, and it is self-evident there are roots that can edit the database as with any database). Now, everyone knows it. Think about it; a timestamped Tweet of FB post can be held against you and put you in jail. It is deemed &quot;trusted&quot; (although there is no cryptographic proof whatsoever and admins there can tamper in the exact same way); as of today that&#39;s not true for a Reddit comment or post anymore. Indeed Reddit just lost its de-facto non-repudiability.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly everyone now knows Reddit can in general easily tamper with anything inside its DB - not just comments. It&#39;s just a matter of logging in, of having the right credentials. Reddit is no inviolable sanctuary. Posts can be made to have high votes and artificially circulate. Passwords can be changed and accounts/mods taken over without anyone knowing (yes you&#39;d have a lone new user somewhat complaining somewhere). Such capability could empower advertisers, be used by executives to broadcast their pet idea, or leveraged by the government. That was always true, but now everyone knows.</p></li>
<li><p>Through his admission Spez just advertised Pizzagate (and its ban, therefore its interest) in a massive way. Everyone commiserates now with The_Donald people who were being outraged at the Pizzagate ban. He literally said &quot;fuck spez&quot;, i.e. &quot;the people talking about Pizzagate at The_Donald were/are right&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any negative consequences of his actions for us, users? Think about it. If you&#39;re not an investor or employee, there are none whatsoever. We already knew a database could be tampered with. We already knew the risk/opportunity ratio of doing it would mean it was certainly a common practice. We knew there were arbitrary shadow-banning and censorship. Spez just showed everyone, and that&#39;s a great thing. And there is no doubt it has cost him dearly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what you may not know: there are precedents for this. </p>

<p>Example 1, Lavabit.</p>

<p>Lavabit was Snowden&#39;s encrypted email provider. Everyone knows the story, so I&#39;ll make it short. In August 2013 the Owner changed the web page with a single message, saying the service was discontinued, not explaining why. He concluded : &quot;without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would <em>strongly</em> recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.&quot;). There was much speculation. Later we learned he had been asked in a &quot;national security letter&quot; to backdoor his service and was under &quot;at least two dozen subpoenas&quot; threatening him if he said anything. Federal prosecutors had sent his lawyer an email stating he could be arrested for closing the site instead of complying.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit</a></p>

<p>Example 2, Truecrypt. </p>

<p>These elite developers had this amazing open source (non-GPL) software to encrypt one&#39;s computer (or files on a computer). Beautiful Windows kernel programming to support full-disk encryption. Amazing features like hidden archives (gun-to-your-head scenario, you give a fake password and have perfect plausible deniability). Large variety of encryption algorithms. It was used by millions and saved many lives. The developers were revered. And then one day they posted this (paraphrasing): &quot;Our product is unsafe, we are discontinuing it, please rely on Microsoft or Apple for encryption&quot;. </p>

<p>At first they were abundantly insulted. &quot;Traitor!&quot; &quot;Shills!” And then people remembered Lavabit, and figured out what must have happened. The consensus now is that they were under similar duress and did the right thing by discontinuing the development rather than conspiring with the security apparatus.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<p>A - Spez did not have a nervous breakdown. His act was one of great sabotage. Benevolent sabotage, Howard Roark or Tyler Durden style. And great courage.</p>

<p>B - He most certainly has been served with a gag order he can&#39;t talk about. It could only have been related to Pizzagate, as that&#39;s the context of his sabotage and subsequent admission. Perhaps he was fine banning the sub, but wanted to say the request was coming from the government. Perhaps he wanted to keep the sub open. We don’t know. What&#39;s clear is he didn&#39;t like what he was forced to do.</p>

<p>C - At the very least he wanted to resign and his board wouldn&#39;t let him (per his contract), so he did this to get fired.</p>

<p>D - It is more likely he did this to let people know they couldn&#39;t trust Reddit as a sanctuary free of interference; people should have already known that, but he made sure they heard it loud and clear.</p>

<p>E - What he did was the absolute perfect way to sabotage Reddit. The message is clear - something is wrong with Reddit, don&#39;t trust it like you used to, I can&#39;t tell you what happened. Service providers shut down their website. Developers discontinue their software and recommend Microsoft. Message board CEOs go on an editing rampage and say &quot;fuck me&quot; to the very people they&#39;re defending.</p>

<p>F - Let&#39;s hope his plausible deniability holds. It will as long as people hate him for what he did. </p>

<p><a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> if you&#39;re reading this. Thank you. You did this at a huge personal cost. Know your courage didn&#39;t go unnoticed. Courage is contagious. You are truly 31337. Aaron would be proud.</p>

<p>There you go <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, for once we have indication of someone conspiring for the Good.</p>

<p>You went around making hard claims (sans any evidence) that Snowden was a malicious actor, misrepresenting your opinion as fact over and over again with multiple accounts, and even went as far as to use those alts to reply to and agree <em>with yourself</em>, trying to trick the readers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> into thinking that there was a false sense of consensus. That&#39;s the same kind of shit that the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mods did at the time. </p>

<p>While doing all of this you spammed links to your sub in nearly every single thread here, whether it related to Snowden/spying or not. I think you are responsible in large part for gullible people being misled into thinking that Snowden <em>and</em> Greenwald and Poitras aren&#39;t to be trusted, when in fact there is zero evidence to support that assertion. That&#39;s defamation, and I hate defamation regardless of if the defamer has good intentions or not. </p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5evxuk/a_certain_ceo_is_trying_to_cripple_our_domreddit/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5evxuk/a_certain_ceo_is_trying_to_cripple_our_domreddit/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>There is little doubt in my mind that this was an intentional and carefully orchestrated act rather than &quot;oops I had a hard day and lost control&quot;. </p>

<p>Could be he was trying to help and draw attention to pizzagate or undermine Reddit credibility due to it no longer being a bastion of free speech. </p>

<p>Or, he was trying to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Trigger additional harassment from &quot;the_donald&quot; users (including potential use of provocateurs)</li>
<li>Foster distrust of content on &quot;the_donald&quot; making average users question the validity of posts, raise paranoia</li>
<li>Create dissent between users (divide and conquer), witchhunts of mods, accusations of shilling etc</li>
<li>funnel pizzagate users to &quot;the_donald&quot; to get them to post PII</li>
<li>encourage a heightened focus on, and distribution of, pizzagate content on our domreddit because <em>he believes</em> it&#39;s stupid and crazy (and/or that it will be perceived as such by the general public) and wants us to burn our energy and/or discredit us</li>
<li>provoke additional calls for banning or quarantining us from other admins, mods, redditors (&quot;well you went this far, might as well ban them.. You can&#39;t handle a few days of harassment?! imagine how we feel&quot;)</li>
<li>increase likelihood that enraged centipedes move to voat, discord, etc (divide and conquer)</li>
</ul>

<p>He admittedly edited his algorithm to hurt us (not likely if he cares about free expression or draining the swamp). He&#39;s on record now begging people to point out when our users leak PII so he&#39;d have an excuse to shut us down. A bug at the height of campaign season indicated that it&#39;s highly likely that they have selected us for &quot;special treatment&quot; of some kind.</p>

<p>It is absolutely possible that he was trying to help advance the pizzagate inquest or was trying to warn redditors of some kind of corruption. But I fucking doubt it. </p>

<p>And I refuse to let him force us out on his terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember, the people who said the US government:   </p>

<p>1) Had license plate readers all around the country since the 70s<br/>
2) Was monitoring US citizen&#39;s phone calls and could could tap any person&#39;s phone<br/>
3) Was collecting metadata from everyone&#39;s phones<br/>
4) Conspired against Lavabit<br/>
5) Conspired against TrueCrypt<br/>
6) Was arming right-wing terrorists in Nicaragua<br/>
7) Was targeting blacks with Nixon&#39;s War on Drugs policy<br/>
8) Was illegally influencing US media corporations (Operation Mockingbird, and whatever else is yet to be proven)<br/>
9) Lead in consumer products was mass-poisoning the US population (later proven, and lead to new regulations)<br/>
10) CIA Drug Running to fund terrorism (Gary Webb won a Pulitzer for this)    </p>

<p>Were all crazy, lunatic, crackpot conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Look how far we&#39;ve come. Now the US government just publicly conspires to force Apple to break all its encryption, and to a lot of people that just seems normal.</p>

<p>This is another illustration of how far we&#39;ve fallen into 1984:       </p>

<p>In the X-Files Season 1, Episode 17, &quot;E.B.E.&quot; the creator Christ Carter introduced the &quot;The Lone Gunmen conspiracy theorists. <strong>The characters, who were used to help Mulder appear more credible</strong>&quot;<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>From the episode:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>SCULLY: Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met. I don’t know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible. </p>

<p>SCULLY: Did you see the way they answered the telephone? They probably think that every call that they get is monitored and they’re followed wherever they go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government monitoring all of your phone calls used to be thought of as so unbelievable that it was used to make alien abduction seem credible. That&#39;s how far we&#39;ve come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If he wanted to tamper in a non-obvious manner he could have easily done it. He could have subtly manipulated the whole narrative, e.g. create a throw-away account and give it huge karma (or take over any such existing account), post an article/propaganda of his choosing, give it 10000 votes, whatever. There are no limits to what you can do if you can read/write the db. Especially for a smart guy like him. This childish rampage of his has no other rational explanation IMO, especially given the numerous precedents.</p>

<p>How likely is it the government served Reddit with a formal request to shut the sub + gag order not to talk about it? Very likely IMO, they do it all the times on a variety of issues. This gov is completely un-inhibited when it comes to its war on truth. And sometimes tech founders don&#39;t like that, so they turn against their company. Most often they don&#39;t and the platform gets utterly compromised without anyone knowing (think twitter, fb, ig, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a software engineer, and I&#39;ve never heard of standard coding being referred to as hacking. Hacking is the term used for gaining access to data that should not be accessible, that&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hacking has two defenitions </p>

<ol>
<li>To gain access to (a computer file or network) illegally or without authorization: hacked the firm&#39;s personnel database.</li>
<li>To alter (a computer program): hacked her text editor to read HTML.</li>
</ol>

<p>And then there is hack together</p>

<ol>
<li>to hack, with the result being something quickly and sloppily created, or modified to solve a particular problem. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now in this case i think u/beeeeeeefcake is referring to the second definition of the first one. where u would be referring to the first one of the first definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Primarily it means just programming, possibly in a clever way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I write a small program that adds two numbers together, in a fancy way, then I&#39;m hacking according to the OP, which is incorrect. Sorry to be pedantic, but I&#39;m getting sick of the term &quot;hacker&quot; being overused and misused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird rabbit hole as well, because you can yourself look at the Podesta emails etc, and even &#39;do your own research&#39; a little.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no direct proof, but there <em>is</em> a preponderance of implication and circumstantial evidence. By law, that actually is enough to make a conviction, so in this case...</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;ve seen too many links and hints and weird stuff to not believe there&#39;s some truth behind it all.</p>

<p>But it would really take a number of kids to come forward with first-hand corroborative accounts to get the MSM involved. Otherwise it&#39;s just a lot of hand-waving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a great theory - there would be better ways of accomplishing what OP believes were Spez&#39;s intentions.  Your evidence supports that.  Also, why did Spez continuously ask for evidence of T_D leaking in the admin chat that followed?  If he was in the middle of a grand scheme to save T_D &amp; Pizzagate, I don&#39; think that&#39;d be his concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn I like your theory! I know nothing about u/spez, but its obvious he didn&#39;t just have a mental breakdown and throw a tantrum. I&#39;ve always considered him an arm of TPTB, but I like how you&#39;ve flipped the script on him - we can&#39;t dismiss any possibility.</p>

<p>I was thinking he did it as an easy way to be the fall guy for all the corruption that&#39;s been so obvious on Reddit and usher in a new &quot;unbiased&quot; puppet admin that would seem more credible in the public eye so people are more receptive to propaganda. Essentially trying to hit the reset button on this arm of propaganda.</p>

<p>I never thought of him actually being a good person trying to send a message. Very creative I like it</p>

<p>One thing I completely overlooked is where he did it - that post on r/the_Donald. There is definitely a reason for this and I think it gives your theory credibility</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that this thread should be taken from multiple angles and that with all conspiracy you should understand where the person comes from and their logic with their opinions. So with that let me begin telling you why I think you&#39;re so wrong that it honestly insulted me:</p>

<ul>
<li>1)If he really planned on helping out the pizzagate agenda and the censorship agenda by staging a false flag then why would he surround himself with like minded ultra left liberals who wanted to take down pizzagate and caved into this new concept of censoring &quot;fake news&quot;</li>
<li><p>2) Every martyr that you mentioned ended up completely shutting down their service, all Spez did was send a half ass apology saying that r/the_donald got what they had coming for them. This goes with the agenda that he doesn&#39;t feel any sort of regret, even in the logs he talks very cynically about taking out the_donald and even tries to get his loyal followers to help conjure up ideas to help silence the_donald</p></li>
<li><p>3) He is a cofounder, the board is consistent of like 2 other people and they&#39;re practically also cofounders so if they do replace him it&#39;ll be another DNC case where they cut off the head of the snake and sow on another snakes head to continue the same nonsense we are tired of.</p></li>
<li><p>4) He suppresses the_donald votes to r/all (because of alleged bots), but acknowledges that CTR is running amuck for the liberal agenda with the Clintons</p></li>
<li><p>5) He did sabotage reddits integrity, but it all points in the direction that he really wasn&#39;t using his head (possible drunl trolling and didn&#39;t think of the consequences). I also have no idea how you think he saw one post on r/pizzagate (during his process of shutting down pizzagate) and thought he had some great awakening. I mean you really are day dreaming or being very very very optimistic that he isn&#39;t a complete scumbag.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>He isn&#39;t courageous, and everything you listed are things that have yet to have any merit and are complete stretches even in fictional movie terms. Nobody allows CTR to openly run amuck, discuss sabotaging a president elects reddit page, takes down a reddit page on the possibility of nationwide/worldwide pedophilia and does that for a courageous reason. If he wanted to bring light to Pizzagate he wouldn&#39;t have done it in the way that fed into the medias agenda of shutting down fake news.. I&#39;m sorry if I came off as offensive, but you stretched way too far to connect things that would only make sense to someone who wanted to save Spez&#39;s skin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems you are right; I thought they used exclusively Cassandra already but after verification it looks like they&#39;re only slowly moving from Postgres. You are also right about the event log, although by default it&#39;s disabled, and I doubt they could&#39;ve enabled a full event log with such volume. The event log entries to my knowledge however are never signed. And even if they were of course that signing could also be tampered with since the private key would be accessible by the db software (and thus by a hacker/root on the db platform) and because all software can always be tampered with i.e. no software can absolutely vouch for its own integrity (even when running on &quot;root of trust&quot; secure hardware). So the points holds: admins can (and do) tamper with databases. Thank you for allowing these clarifications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course, the last version (7.1a) is still safe to use, and can be found in many different places. For example <a href="https://truecrypt.ch/downloads/">here</a>. The only thing is the full-disk-encryption on Windows versions &gt; 7 (or with safeboot/UEFI) will not work.</p>

<p>There have been several forks, like VeraCrypt. I still use the version 7.1a though, as I have LUKS under Linux for full partition encryption and I use TC only for the secure containers under Windows.</p>

<p>He did this for the exact opposite reason (the more likely reason.) The spotlight was too close for comfort so he purged the validity of the entire community to protect him and his creep friends. </p>

<p>Anyone discussing child porn or trafficking, even blatantly, could claim their words were edited.</p>

<p>He can claim anything he said in the past was wrongfully edited by a deranged admin.</p>

<p>He&#39;s trying hard not to be @jack in the event the pizzagate bomb drops. Don&#39;t trust these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And another thought, making this a big deal in the press now will cause a domino effect of database hysteria, which will put every social network and email server in question. If there&#39;s even a slim chance that an admin could edit an email or a tweet, the entire case goes out the window.</p>

<p>Biggest coverup of all time, and super easy to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. That&#39;s great news. Anything written on social media may henceforth have been tampered with by the admins. Of course that has always been the case. But know it&#39;s common knowledge. I can only be grateful for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You understand the gravity of the massive fireball you just put out there, correct? You have lost the trust of (at least) thousands of users of this website. You have literally, in that petty act, destroyed the credibility of Reddit. Any article that quotes a user post, uncredible. For all people know here, we are all now in danger of the admins throwing child porn into one of our histories, and endangering us. This was a massive mistake. This is your career, and you put your emotions into making this massive mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no fortunately the whole sub was archived and the work is continuing on voat as we speak. The only thing it did is massive publicity (zerohedge, rt, many others) and made us more determined and more resilient. See my posting on <a href="/r/AskAnAdmin">/r/AskAnAdmin</a> right after the ban if u really think what u said about me <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAnAdmin/comments/5eefax/i_have_a_lifeanddeath_question_for_reddit_admins/">https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAnAdmin/comments/5eefax/i_have_a_lifeanddeath_question_for_reddit_admins/</a></p>

<p>i like to believe he was maybe behind the mysterious benefactor who arrived on the sub 1 hour before ban, said he&#39;d run his bot for us, and shortly after delivered it in full on voat. i had myself been trying to run prawn, but i had no previously setup oath2, got there too late, so couldn&#39;t do it in time. if it&#39;s not him it&#39;s maybe another employee/admin (not because of my post) because he didn&#39;t seem concerned by the throttle in reddit&#39;s api (he downloaded the whole thing extremely fast)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP is trying to say u/spez is just one cog (a little one albeit) in a massive amount of cogs and connections. What u/spez did might not have been a choice at all but only a guarantee of safety for him or his family/friends. If he tried to resist, r/pizzagate would have still been banned.</p>

<p>He could have never mention how he was the one who edited that users comment and could have blamed it on malware or mirroring/backup/synchronization malfunction or anything else and the sheep would have ate it up but he didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>There is more to this and fuck is it confusing trying to figure out...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are right. with gag order &amp; national security letter he could not even have said he received a letter/visit from the government, even without mentionning the reason. that&#39;s exactly what they did with lavabit. you have to cooperate and do what we say or we&#39;ll put you in jail, and you can&#39;t say we spoke to you or we&#39;ll put you in jail. no exaggeration. spez would have burned the whole thing down if he could, that was the best he could do to say reddit is henceforth compromised, without risking too much.</p>
