       The Truth IS coming to light. Too many people know about pizzagate. Too many people know names of many of the people involved. There is absolutely no stopping this landslide of TRUTH being revealed. The more they try to do to hide it, the more attention they get. This is a beautiful thing. Comet Pizza and affiliates got way too cocky and exposed their sick satantic obsessions. They fucked up. Whether or not they get prosecuted, the secret is out. The system is on their side but its the system vs the people, and we have way more numbers on our side. This isn't just about Comet Pizza and Pizzagate. This is about the WHOLE SYSTEM and its roots of corruption. Pizzagate is only the beginning. Take a moment to be thankful that TRUTH is prevailing. I am grateful for all of you.

       Do not lose faith, everyone. Keep working, keep chipping away, keep searching for truth. There are far more of us than there are of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not stop. Keep on introducing the sleeping users of Reddit to the truth. They might be able to edit our posts, but at least for now, it is selective and only after the fact.

       Indeed, the MSM is running a directed, coordinated counter-offensive to protect this network and their paedo operations as well as perpetrators higher up in this network. They are trying to drive off the masses, isolate the investigators and curtail support with sophomoric invectives such as "Fake News", the irony and gall of which is unreal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the time for people to remain steadfast to justice, honour to the victims and outrage at these sick, protected crimes and criminals. Dig in hard and push the truth out with all you've've got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, if they have to resort to tactics such as transparent propaganda, Reddit bans and admin sabotage to achieve their ends it exposes only that they are desperate and losing.

       Kek, the Egyptian god of chaos, was known as the "bringer in of light".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a god of the night, Kek was also related to the day - he was called the "bringer-in of the light". This seems to mean that he was responsible for the time of night that came just before sunrise. The god of the hours before day dawned over the land of Egypt. This was the twilight which gave birth to the sun.

       And for the love of god, don't allow the manipulative power of the media to divide us by race, religion, politics, or any other divisive tool they attempt to have you define yourself by. Don't allow them to convince you that the biggest issues are caused by blacks, whites, leftists, right-wingers, Muslims, Jews, or any single group. The people united will never be defeated.

       There's something wrong with a lot of people inside all religions, including atheism. "Jews" are currently governed by extreme rightwing zionists with barely a parliamentary majority, which they obtained through a full-on terrormongering campaign.

      <p>
       They are no different than any western nation right now, we're all in deep shit with crap governments and the reason for it is that we let shit politicians divide us with buzzwords like "sjw" and "jew".
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop falling for divisive issues and start crowdsourcing your brains into finding solutions to real problems such as corruption in politics.

       The whole "antisemitism" notion is a psyop. Well it might have been a honest notion at some point, but it no longer is. It is now used as a brainwashing weapon for power and "domestication" of unsuspecting people.

       Keep spreading the information elsewhere. Youtube. Facebook. Other forums. everywhere. The internet is an amazing tool. The more they try to censor the truth the more attention they bring to themselves. What are they gonna do, shut down the internet? The more people affected by their censorship the bigger a hole they dig for themselves as far as I'm concerned.

       That is actually possible. It has been attempted a few times in the past month, hacking attacks being more and more precise with no other objective than testing limits and learning about reaction times/style.

       Its not that I'm doubting it would ever be done. But it just draws more attention and affects more people, so I believe, if they want things to go as unnoticed as possible it would not be done out of the blue over an issue like this. If anything it would be gradually worked into. IMO

       I've been following "conspiracy theories" for about 15 years. This year has been unlike anything I've ever seen. It is growing. People are really starting to see through this shit.

      <p>
       Wikileaks has done us a tremendous service. Now that they appear to have been co-opted it's our turn. And we can't do it on Reddit or other commercial sites - free speech is bad for business.

       Unity among the masses DOES scare the shit out of the Elitist  Oligarchs.
      </p>

       They know that power lies in unity of purpose - that is how they accomplish THEIR objectives... and sowing discord and DISunity among the masses is their primary method for keeping us under their control.

       Their intent is to plant seeds of distrust and disharmony among us. If they succeed, they control. THAT is what they want.

       have you ever learned a new word, or fact and then in the coming days, it feels like you start to see it everywhere? because previously you just never noticed it. That is what is going to start happening. Now that people have these ideas in their head, it will be easier to put seemingly innocuous facts together

       That's what I'm leanin towards. Probably will try to make him look crazy... except he just disavowed the alt-right in an attempt to appear more sane and normal. That's going to make it a lot harder to pull an Erdogan on him. We'll see what happens.

       People like them are addicted to power, and get a thrill out of using it. I'd you look throughout history, long term atrocities are so out in the open its insane. Look at Bathory, she was only stopped because she killed a child of the elite. If she stuck to peasants and orphans she'd have gotten away with it.

       Think about the power of the forces that are marshalled right now to try to manage ''the truth''  --forces with worldwide tentacles, that are able to pressure governments, suppress/ demolish Assange and W/L, get the whole of the MSM to parrot their talking points ''alt right'', ''fake news'' etc, and who mysteriously put the force of their will to defend a mere ''pizza shop owner'' entailing suppressing free speech all over...how obvious it is that pay dirt was close at hand that they would go to such trouble.

       The PizzaGate thing seems like a distraction from systemic corruption to me.  Does PizzaGate affect Republicans?  The systemic corruption is the bribery and money incentives that have steered the government so very far from the will of the people.  People talk about PizzaGate and then how they hope Trump drains the swamp and I feel sick because "drain the swamp" for me wasn't supposed to be about pedophilia.

       Nope. Not everyone who believes in pizzagate believes in Trump. The general consensus seems to be that we'd prefer our politicians to not be trafficking children and don't really care what party they're affiliated with. Pizzagate is real. These people are pedophiles and they need to hang for it. Arguably this ties in with systemic corruption because I'm pretty sure the Clinton Foundation is a front for trafficking children internationally to not only United States politicians but to other country's politicians as well, which plays into the hand of bribery.

       I don't think Trump will do any prosecution of Clinton.  I think their animosity was an act.  They're old chums.  Furthermore, no agency to my knowledge has opened an investigation regarding anything related to pizzagate.  I also have trouble believing that Hillary herself, whatever her involvement with them might be, is actually a pedophile.

       I'm not American so I'm probably not as well informed on the AG position. As for evidence, just look at his cabinet and prospectives and people he's surrounding himself. Neocons. Bush-era fuckups. Rich cunts. Crazy cunts. It doesn't look good. I've yet to see a single coherent defence for these, although the Bannon stuff is flagrant propaganda to discredit and brush away conspiracies as "fake news", since I don't think Bannon has ever made any comments that would make him a white supremacist. They extrapolated the comment section onto him. Who the fuck does that? YouTube is a cesspool but it doesn't affect the content.

      <p>
       The most recent research suggests that at least one third of pedophiles are female.   In any case Hillary Clinton wouldn't herself need to be a pedophile to be involved in child trafficking and pedo rings.   She would just need to be a sociopath who wanted power at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that these scandals keep breaking at the highest levels over and over again suggests a very disturbing possibility: pedophiles are
       <em>
        intentionally
       </em>
       being placed into positions of power so they will remain obedient to the real masters behind scenes.   It actually makes a chilling sort of sense.

       I was hopeful for trump and hoped for the best, but his incredibly quick u-turn on going after clinton is leaving me unhappy. Of all campaign promises he could back pedal on, this is the most damaging to his credibility and trustability to me, but only time will tell what he does in the driver seat

       The thing is, 'Trump didn't change his mind' about Hillary ... some people who came and spoke to him
       <em>
        after he was elected
       </em>
       did
      </p>
      <p>
       They (the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       PTB) had their people "make him an offer he couldn't refuse" ... and he didn't. I think he's beginning to realize he's bitten off a bit more than he can chew!
      </p>
      <p>
       I still wish him the best with his "make America happy again" statements ,, anyway, can you imagine what Hillary would be like Now If she'd won? eep!

       Nah, you guys pulled a Black Dahlia on this one. All evidence is hidden by now, all connections silenced. Some of you insisting that this was THE issue of our time refused to seriously investigate or interview people associated or hired by Comet Ping Pong. Now they're on the defensive, and you're still just going to jerk off and invent wild speculative stories and wild code-word searches. The conspiracy community really fucked this up. Hopefully someone with integrity can save this before it's too late, it would actually be even better now that the media fielded defense for James Alefantis as a part of their fake news propaganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now though, it's looking like another endless conspiracy theory for the ages.

       Unity among the masses DOES scare the shit out of the Elitist  Oligarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that power lies in unity of purpose - that is how they accomplish THEIR objectives... and sowing discord and DISunity among the masses is their primary method for keeping us under their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their intent is to plant seeds of distrust and disharmony among us. If they succeed, they control. THAT is what they want.

       The thing is, 'Trump didn't change his mind' about Hillary ... some people who came and spoke to him
       <em>
        after he was elected
       </em>
       did
      </p>
      <p>
       They (the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       PTB) had their people "make him an offer he couldn't refuse" ... and he didn't. I think he's beginning to realize he's bitten off a bit more than he can chew!
      </p>
      <p>
       I still wish him the best with his "make America happy again" statements ,, anyway, can you imagine what Hillary would be like Now If she'd won? eep!

       That's what I'm leanin towards. Probably will try to make him look crazy... except he just disavowed the alt-right in an attempt to appear more sane and normal. That's going to make it a lot harder to pull an Erdogan on him. We'll see what happens.
