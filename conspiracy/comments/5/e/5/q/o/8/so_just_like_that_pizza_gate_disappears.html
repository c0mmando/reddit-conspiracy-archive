I can recall a Wiener laptop that had similar effect when pizzagate first started up. Wasn&#39;t the NYPD gonna drop a smoking gun with that laptop? Our chains are being pulled from all angles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One user said he cracked into WeThePizza&#39;s server, and got 2GB worth of CP from there, alongside with an encrypted client list and a &quot;pricing menu&quot;. Said user then posted a zip-file on tinyupload as evidence, which had ten pictures(?) of CP in it. Some users downloaded them alongside with one of the moderators of r/pizzagate. Didn&#39;t download them myself, but judging by the reactions i&#39;d say they were for real.</p>

<p>Same user said that they would upload the pricing menu and the client-list as well later on. Other user with a similar name ended up uploading the client-list, which is quite useless as its encrypted, and a pic of the menu. No idea whats really going on, but you can judge for yourself by reading the threads. (First thread&#39;s text is deleted, but the rest are there. Missing the links for any downloads though)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Seems a really insane way to troll though. No idea what they were trying to pull off.</p>

<p>Also, the original thread-message was on Voat still:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hi, I am quickly posting this from a random open wifi so I will only will be available for questions about how to PROPERLY LEAK THIS only for 30 minutes for OPSEC reasons.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make it quick with the questions, long story short: I cracked into a suspicious &quot;pizza/family center&quot; and their netsec was shit. I made off with an encrypted list of their clients, and 2GB of unencrypted videos, which after glancing at the site&#39;s source code, there was a hidden login that allowed you to view &quot;actives, services, and pricing&quot; after logging in, the videos/photos were under the &quot;activities&quot; and &quot;services&quot; page. Not sure if they are aware of my intrusion, so not listing the site yet.</p>

<p>So here is what I have, and how should I leak it?:</p>

<p>2GB of brutal videos and photos of little boys and girls being raped. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING TO WATCH!!!!!</p>

<p>An unencrypted spreadsheet of the pricing for each act (rape $10,000, minor torture $35,000, severe torture $100,000 and murder $250,000). Prices were different based on if the victim was a boy, girl, white, black, and age etc.</p>

<p>And I have an encrypted list of all their clients.</p>

<p>Okay guys, how should I leak this? Should I just post the child porn? Is that even fucking legal? I feel I should submit this to the FBI but I DO NOT TRUST THEM and I have a strong feeling wikileaks is compromised as well. And if I don&#39;t login within 24hours tell my family I loved them.</p>

<p>FBI/CIA/NSA/LE/YOU EVIL MOTHERFUCKERS: I HAVE A DEADMAN SWITCH SETUP, IF I DON&#39;T RESET MY SWITCH ONCE EVERY 12 HOURS IT ALL GETS RELEASED ON AN .ONION AND .I2P AND ALL THE LINKS GETS POSTED TO OVER 100 SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND I THINK SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS FACES ARE IN THE VIDEOS, SO DON&#39;T TRY ANYTHING STUPID. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t pizza related (at least no connection made yet) it was thousands of accounts with cp, many of them Arabic.  0hour reported them to twitter as well as authorities, got banned.  4chan is not allowing discussion on it, threads are 404&#39;ing without getting archived.  I&#39;m not even gonna bother on 8chan I think I&#39;m taking an Internet break this shit is too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about that, and then I noticed a couple things sorta unrelated but maybe not... We should compile a list of companies with the &quot;code shapes&quot; in them. For example:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/IqkzrYm">http://imgur.com/IqkzrYm</a>
<a href="http://imgur.com/toZXVVL">http://imgur.com/toZXVVL</a></p>

<p>Not saying they are related but it would be interesting to see how many we could find. </p>
