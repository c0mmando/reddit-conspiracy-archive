        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about the implications of the fact that the US gov has the most sophisticated, most invasive, mass surveillance program in HUMAN HISTORY. Stronger surveillance than Orwell dreamed of. People within the intelligence community know ALL ABOUT rampant child abuse. But they use that info to get political leverage through blackmail, which is why they are not outing these people and getting them prosecuted. I am praying that we reach a tipping point where the masses become so aware of this dark truth that the media has to report and something can be done to hold TPTB accountable. Keep up the great work fellas</p>

She claims that a condo where Dennis was having liaisons with young boys was wired by the FBI and CIA. Nothing was done, because, according to the FBI,the evidence wasn&#39;t obtained legally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, what details are you interested in. I made numerous phone calls: ICE, NCMEC, FBI.</p>

<p>Filed an anonymous report with NCMEC. Provided as much information as was publicly available, including the archived 4chan thread with the twitter pedo user list. I provided them with several Twitter handles that were suspect. They seemed concerned, but the process was time consuming, and <strong>one of the agents put me on the defensive; asking where and when I viewed the CP.</strong></p>

<p>I gave as much detailed information as possible to the various agencies, although it seems somewhat like a waste of time. I am hopeful if more people file reports, they will be forced to investigate.</p>

<p>I am hopeful the call to the SF FBI office will generate at least a phone call by the FBI to Twitter HQ in SF.</p>

<p>The people that take these initial reports are not that computer/social media savvy. Finding someone in Law Enforcement who knows about reddit, twitter, 4/8chan is somewhat challenging to this point. Explaining the elements to the story, the threads, the various locations, the overall picture was difficult, given their lack of knowledge about these platforms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is not the NSA&#39;s job. They don&#39;t care. Maybe some department there would pass it to the FBI or cops, but I highly doubt that. Most of what they collect is not going to be admissible in court, or at least would not be allowed to be brought to court, so essentially it is garbage like anything else that doesn&#39;t constitute a national security threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH I dont believe it&#39;s ever going to get out. Im not saying I believe in 9/11 being an inside job but I certainly believe some sort of massive civil disobedience or something could be constructed if this ever gets close to getting out.  Every reporter worth shit knows all about it by now. MSNBC was talking about EPSTEIN on air 2 months ago after Trump won the Rep spot. </p>

<p>Its truly disgusting how big the coverups are going. They are in enough fear that they wont even speak about it on tv yet. It&#39;s a long ways beyond when that happens (if ever) that any real people see bracelets. </p>

<p>The only thing I can see speeding anything up is if actual video of actual elites surfaces. Even if it does then there&#39;s still the chance it&#39;s somehow swept off the Internet. </p>

I&#39;ve kind of worries about it for a while but I guess I never really considered the whole political leverage thing. If they know of some ultra fucked up stuff like CP and pedo activity and are using it as black mail, personally I think that&#39;s just as criminal as the people conducting the heinous acts. Just my two cents. </p>

I really do not give a shit. Unless you&#39;re a fucking terrorist or some freak ped or running scams i dont think you should have anything to worry about lol people dont realize they are insignificant and not on the nsa radar. In all reality they are really just trying to keep the public safe...but if something happens people will be lining up to call it a false flag. I think we should all be a little less paranoid/cynical and just live our goddamn lives 😃</p>
