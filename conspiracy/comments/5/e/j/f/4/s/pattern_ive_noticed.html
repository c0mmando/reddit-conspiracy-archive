    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been pointing this out for a long time, as have many others. The only thing I can think of that makes their efforts pointless is to hijack the top comments in the thread with real info so you can at least pull together a decent conversation while everyone is watching.</p>

<p>Example: Person posts pic of unverifiable (probably hoax) &quot;malfunctioned bot,&quot; there is obvious skepticism in the comments, I hijack the top comments with real info on astroturfing bots: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cpcpb/ctr_bot_hil4prez_caught_malfunctioning_on/d9yhh9l/?st=ivvetcbb&amp;amp;sh=c43d6d95">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cpcpb/ctr_bot_hil4prez_caught_malfunctioning_on/d9yhh9l/?st=ivvetcbb&amp;amp;sh=c43d6d95</a> </p>

<p>Sometimes, after I do this, I notice that a bunch of people will start packing the comments above mine with low-effort stuff in what seems like an attempt to &quot;push down&quot; my comment from being seen by most people. This is a well-known tactic known as &quot;forum sliding.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re on to something. </p>

<p>I was turned off by pizzagate due to some of the ridiculous speculative posts that SCREAMED disinfo. I think we hit the nail on the head by singling out those particular Podesta emails, but I think a lot of the Comet and Besta pizza rape dungeon talk was planted to make the whole movement look like a retarded witch hunt. </p>

<p>Something is going on here. The &quot;fake news&quot; narrative timing confirms it. I still think we don&#39;t really know WHAT the crux of this issue is.</p>

<p>Also, the name &quot;pizzagate&quot; just sounds  so silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely a pattern I&#39;ve noticed. I brought this up yesterday in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eeo5j/pizza_gate_getting_banned_on_facebook_twitter/dac95g8/">another thread here</a> about the &quot;friendship bracelet&quot; Obama had that people were claiming had a piece of pizza. This is how I concluded that comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put it this way: if I were trying to discredit the PizzaGate investigation, the first thing I&#39;d do is try to get a lot of false claims about it coming out. Put blame on innocent people, see connections where none exist, etc. Then discredit these false claims, and by proxy, the entire investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely can be frustrating.</p>

<p>I posted a compilation of known pedos in DC, where they frequented to access young girls, etc... and it got a handful of upvotes and someone complaining that I didn&#39;t use sources (it was a condensation of a podcast, where respected researchers discussed their work). I&#39;m hoping Voat is a little more serious. I haven&#39;t spent much time there because the servers keep crashing and it&#39;s very hard to use.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind that some of the fluffier stuff gets upvoted to the top because it&#39;s good for people who don&#39;t accept the base narrative of pedophilia being rampant yet. It reminds me of when my conspiracy days started by looking at logos of corporations and tying them to illuminati symbolism. Years later I find that stuff kinda dumb and low-hanging fruit, but it&#39;s a great start for people who are just diving in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! I&#39;ve been thinking this too for a while. Obviously shills trying to lump us all into the &quot;tin foil hat conspiracy theorist&quot; type by manipuating reddit. I get the resulting sentiment from sheeple who think just because I believe in conspiracies that I believe every outlandish theory ever thought of and mock me accordingly. Unfortunately most of the pitiful people that make up this world  cant think critically and are resultantly subjected to this elementary manipulation technique. 99% of people won&#39;t even research shit and if it contradicts their presumptions they dismiss it thoughtlessly</p>
