<p>KUBRICK&#39;S Eyes Wide Shut, CUT for the first time, played at same time  -----&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnh3Olv8IBU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnh3Olv8IBU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>It is a thousand times better if you see it for yourself and so easy ! 
This is Kubrick&#39;s Eyes Wide Shut Slow Speed (start two you tube pages, open up two versions of this link, start one version @ 0:00 and start the other version @ 1:30:00. The scenes are stitched together and are meant to be viewed as a whole. Easily the greatest artistic achievement is the history of all art. -----&gt;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuUU5y9vX3E&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuUU5y9vX3E&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>******<strong><em>Find links at bottom of articles for more on Kubrick&#39;s Kube  *</em></strong>******
**<strong><em>What is Kubrick&#39;s Kube ?</em></strong>**** We are seeing Kubrick for the very first time ever and he is revealing through coding a paradigm change in history, ethics, religion, and society. *<strong><em>Kubrick secretly hid an instruction for us to RE CUT his film Eyes Wide Shut, and when you do and you play both movies at the same time, he tells us what it was he could not reveal by words alone</em></strong>**... about the existence of everything that we are now learning about in PizzaGate and more, Kubrick was revealing through a very coy code which has never been used before in the history of meaning transference: he actually edited the film so that when they are viewed together they offer to each the spliced scenes, stitched like no other, the complete understanding that he was trying to convey. Actors appear next to the characters whose masks they don in similar scenes, their actions and spirit becomes recognizable. The story unfolds and reveals the nature of SATANISM in the world. The very heart of darkness indeed. </p>

<hr/>

<p>**<strong><em>UPDATE: WE FOUND THE FILM LINK. ITS can be found above. Most of this link is original. The story is unfolding in further articles, which together form an expose I am referring to as Kubrick&#39;s Kube</em></strong>*********</p>

<p>IN SHORT KUBRICK TELLS IN A SECRET LANGUAGE TO CUT THE FILM, AND THROUGH THIS CUTTING REVEALS THE TRUE STORY OF EYES WIDE SHUT. </p>

<p>And do you really remember the very beginning of the Shining when they are in the yellow beetle together and just out of the blue Jack Nicholson asks Danny if he ever heard of the Donner party. He proceeded to tell Danny that they ate people to stay alive. That&#39;s right, Kubrick is telling about Cannibalism for a reason. Just hold on to that, you&#39;ll need that later. </p>

<p>This mimics what we might have heard from the sex slave story in Australia earlier this year where the girl was made to eat part of a severed head in order that the festivities &quot;read the roman purge&quot;, which happened a week before Christmas, precisely at the time of this story. What is Kubrick saying by this admission? Is Kubrick trying to tell us something? I think so. The purge was real, it started on December 17 and ended on Christmas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia</a> 
Christmas was a day of sacrifice after all the mayhem rape and good fun loving torture is through. What else is Kubrick trying to tell us? </p>

<p>Perhaps that we are in the very first stages of a mass holocaust, a &quot;purge&quot; which was incidentally set in 2017. Coincidence ? Maybe Kubrick was trying to tell us that they were going to slaughter on a more grand scale, applying the microcosm to the macrocosm. Perhaps that&#39;s just conjecture and can wait for now. </p>

<p>(And some people are saying that the 3:15 version is just a slowed down version however I argue that the cut at this time happens exactly at 1:30:00 for a reason. Because this is the true speed, the true understanding of Eyes Wide Shut).</p>

<p>UPDATE: here is video of cut, watch for 1:30:00: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuUU5y9vX3E&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuUU5y9vX3E&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to say this, but I watched the original Eyes Wide Shut. I watched the Stanley Kubrick version. Many years have passed since first I saw Eyes Wide Shut. Because of PizzaGate, somehow I got interested in Kubrick again. I don&#39;t know how to say this, but I know a secret.</p>

<p>Not even 10 days ago I looked on youtube and watched a version 3 hours and 15 minutes long. I also found a single article in reddit where a guy claims he made the greatest discovery about Eyes Wide Shut. Apparently, nobody followed up. I thought it was strange what he was suggesting, so I tried it. Many others in the chatroom had a difficulty with what he said in finding corroborating evidence. Either that or they were just shills paid to protect the truth.</p>

<p>Either way, I tried to ascertain if what this guy said was true. Here is a link to the original article.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/305ks1/i_think_i_have_made_the_greatest_discovery_about/">https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/305ks1/i_think_i_have_made_the_greatest_discovery_about/</a></p>

<p>His thesis aligns itself with what we know of Kubrick&#39;s Shining, remember, &quot;the Shining&quot; meant the ability to say something without actually saying it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a refresher very worth watching, the very meaning of the shining. Talking without saying what it is you are saying.<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZup24gsS8M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZup24gsS8M</a></p>

<p>There are two parts in the movie where Kubrick made it clear how it was that he would transmit the information that he had to give us before they killed him for it. The Rainbow is a mirror of sorts. Under the Rainbow is the other side of this mirror. Things are opposite in the mirror, thus Kidmans Eyes wide open in the shot looking into the mirror, the opposite of the title. Look, Cruise tears up a hundred dollar bill and hands it to the taxi driver. This happened on the version I watched @ 1:30:00. The length of the film I saw was about 3 hours and 15 minutes. </p>

<p>At about 3:00:00 on the version I watched last week on youtube, (the version was subsequently taken down), Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack exchange a ripped piece of newspaper. This happened almost exactly doubling the number of when the dollar was ripped and handed to the taxi driver. I thought that this was a serious indication that this man was right, mathematically speaking, I found it more than a coincidence that these two incidences happened at the exact same time. The passing of the torn item was telling us to re-cut the film at the locations he was telling us to.</p>

<p>************ If you find corroborating evidence, just put it in a comment and if its good I will edit it in. There are no clips  showing both movies at this time. Maybe by tomorrow someone will have one. Post it here. *** ***********</p>

<p>You see, the two parties in Eyes Wide Shut were set up so that they revealed things which Kubrick could not say. Yes we know he was talking about satanic human sacrifice, but what else was he saying? Well, who was behind it ? Kidman asks &#39;who were those two girls?&quot; Well we know one as a Windsor and the other related to Rockefeller somehow. They are in the house of Rothschild while these Satanic happenings are occurring. Clear references to the Star of Ishtar (pronounced &quot;Easter&quot;), and Christmas trees throughout, yet when the movie begins we can see Cruise passing a banner reading &quot;Happy holidays&quot;. </p>

<p>The h in holidays was purposely made small. The reason for this is clear. In Christian versions of these &quot;Holidays&quot; God is smelled God with a capital G. Only the pagan version of &quot;god&quot; is smelled with a lower case g. Thus Kubrick is trying to tell us that these are the pagan versions of the holiday. Pagan versions of this holiday featured that these symbols were part of a Saturnian theme of human sacrifice. The Christmas tree and Easter are both seen as representing fertility and human sacrifice.</p>

<p>So I set up two versions of the movie and played them side by side, and I cannot remember everything and cannot refer to my notes because I decided to watch it once over without taking any notes. But here is what I remember and what I thought in my mind proved that this was exactly the &quot;Shining&quot; that Kubrick was trying to avail to us. There were about 6 or 7 of these occurrences which said that blatantly this is exactly what he intended to do. I can only remember 2 out of these occurrences so I will leave them here with you all. But needless to say, these instances convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<ol>
<li>The scenes of Kidman in black in white being seduced by the Navy guy she was fantasizing about came on and played at the same exact time. It gave me chills.</li>
<li>Nuala Windsor is the same exact girl in the mask which can be seen in the edited version at 1:20:00 minutes. She was literally looking at Cruise in the same exact way at the same exact time as Nuala Windsor was looking at Cruise in the movie. Kubrick was trying to tell us that Windsor, the English Royalty is behind these Satanic Cults, along with Rothschild and Rockefeller. By using a real man and wife as the couple, he is telling us that this is real life, not a movie.</li>
</ol>

<p>I apologize for not being smart enough to make a copy, I was not aware I was watching the actual Kubrick version. It&#39;s out there people. The real one. I watched it. They took the video down because of what it was, authentic and meaning revealing.</p>

<p>Who are those people and what are they doing ? Kubrick is SHINING us the truth.</p>

<p>p.s. The Shining is about faking the Apollo 11 moon landing. Once you understand this you will understand some of the methods Kubrick uses to Shine us the truth.</p>

<p>***THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE TO START TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SHINING IS ABOUT THE APPOLLO 11 MISSION:
I highly advise you to watch this now:

<p>Here is an hour long treatise on the Shining De-Coding : 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBaAfl4SuI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBaAfl4SuI4</a></p>

<p>Here is yet another film on a sub plot Kubrick had. At the end of the Shining it appears it is Woodrow Wilson family who surrounds Jack Nicholson, who is giving the sign of Baphomet at the end of the Shining. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoWZEwedPkc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoWZEwedPkc</a></p>

<p>Here is a real interesting analysis of Kubrick use of metaphors suggesting gang rape an murder in Full Metal Jacket. Must see: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk4rPnfOdHA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk4rPnfOdHA</a></p>

<p>Yet another good one on Being There: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxLRJsmuB8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxLRJsmuB8</a></p>

<p>Here is an interesting take on Being There, where Kubrick is trying to tell us that it was he who directed this movie that does not go by his name. It actually parallels Christopher Marlowe using the words of Shakespeare&#39;s character to tell us that he never died as history would hold, but that he faked his own death to escape persecution from the church. The book on this subject which I highly advise is Calvin Hoffman&#39;s &quot;The Murder of the Man who was Shakespeare&quot;. </p>

<p>p.s.s. Children of the Corn is a similar mirror written by Stephen King in 1984, where Children are ritualistically giving up their parents to &quot;Malachi&quot;. Malachi is the God Moloch. If you switch this around, like when &quot;No Gas&quot; is written in the window backwards one could see the word &quot;Sagon&quot;, another word for the Devil. What was King trying to tell us ? Wasn&#39;t he really trying to tell us that it is parents who are giving up their children to Moloch in a form of Satanic Worship ? I think so. Once you understand how Kubrick shines, the movies take on a life and story that can only be revealed by using a code to trying to understand what it is exactly that Kubrick is Shining.
here is a video on Moloch, pizzagate sacrificing chickens to Moloch ?!? Whats a chicken in pizza-code, a small child perhaps ??? That would be my guess. </p>

<p>The rainbow represents a covenant with God as it did in the old testament. &quot;Where the rainbow ends&quot; is the silence one must keep as part of a covenant with the Devil. Where the rainbow ends is a covenant with Satan. Thus, when Cruise knows whats really going on and he sees a Christmas Tree in his home, he shuts the lights off. The rainbow, represented as all the colors on the tree, representing the covenant with God has ended, and the covenant with god/Satan has begun.</p>

<p>Also of interest. There is a specific place that was located in the movie, &quot;Back Fence&quot;.  It used to be located @155 Bleeker Street, NY NY. As we see, nearly everything that happens in the movie happens on this street , as is revealed by the very images of the mirrors/windows of the Rainbow Rentals reveals. Bleeker St means roughly &quot;being beyond hope&quot;. Without any hope. It is a real place, because it is reality.</p>

<p>Further, Sonata Cafe means &quot;its not a cafe&quot;. You have to say it fast to get the meaning. You can also see the implicitness of this in the fact by the juxtaposition of &quot;Gillespie Cafe&quot; and &quot;Sonata Cafe&quot;. At the Sonata we have Jazz, where at Gillespie&#39;s you see actual cafeteria setting. Gillespie&#39;s is named after one of the greatest Jazz musicians Dizzy Gillespie, and yet they are playing Jazz not at Gillespie&#39;s but at the Sonata. &quot;It&#39;s not a cafe&quot;. He is telling us. So what is it ? Look into the mirror again at Rainbow Rentals and you will see that it is a &quot;Diner&quot;. That is, people are dying and they are being eaten. Satanic Cannibalism. &quot;Its not a cafe, its a diner&quot;. </p>

<p>Further, once you see that almost everything is happening on Bleeker St, you will realize that there was no reason for Cruise to take the trip in the taxi other than for Kubrick to show us to cut the movie, just as he tore up the 100 dollar bill. I&#39;ll give you half now and half later we are told. In the Shining, he crashed the red beetle with the semi for one reason, he was not telling Stephen King&#39;s version of the story, he had a different story to tell us entirely. </p>

<p>Kubrick Shines as the Greatest Director and Story teller of all time. Period. </p>

<p>Sonata Cafe, (it&#39;s not a cafe) its a &quot;Die ner&quot;. </p>

<p>Its not Easter, its Ishtar.<br/>
 <a href="http://mystery-babylon.org/easter.html">http://mystery-babylon.org/easter.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/12/the-occult-origin-of-christmas.html">http://humansarefree.com/2014/12/the-occult-origin-of-christmas.html</a>
The eight pointed star is that of Ishtar. </p>

<p>This is an interesting link which has Satanic Calendar dates for &quot;holidays&quot;, translation &quot;someone is about to be sacrificed. 
<a href="http://www.7-star-admiral.com/0095_satanism_exposed.html">http://www.7-star-admiral.com/0095_satanism_exposed.html</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s the true meaning of these pagan holidays of ours. Beneath the lies and deceit, they are butchering our brethren for their lord Satan. Christmas, Easter, Groundhog day. These people need for some body to die. They like blood. Marina Abromovich paints in the stuff in her spirit cooking. Ted Gunderson has stated flat out, there are in his estimates 4 million Satanists in our own country. He was right about the Satanists, he was right about the child sex trafficking. What is it that few care to know or see yet, Ted Gunderson revealed that we have 30,000 guillotines in our own country. Who do you think that them are for? Listen to Gunderson here:
<a href="https://geopolitics.co/2015/01/17/ted-gunderson-fbi-whistleblower-vs-satanists/">https://geopolitics.co/2015/01/17/ted-gunderson-fbi-whistleblower-vs-satanists/</a></p>

<p>Again try to understand what is going on in the mind of a psychopath satanic pedophile through the use of numbers. Watch this video and know that a rainbow can only be seen at 42 degrees. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By9ksvUv6yg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By9ksvUv6yg</a>
This kind of explains the whole Hitchhiker at the End of the Galaxy&#39;s answer of 42. Again Danny wears 42 in his shirt as he is brushing his teeth. This video is interesting because it goes over the complexity of numbers in occult practice. </p>

<p>Numbers pervade. Top right of Pescado Ristorante, Kubrick has written a number with the Christmas lights themselves. 77. Another clue that Satanism is all around us. The the coven of Satanism is our flood. We are deluged and delusional at the same time. Very perhaps they have the same etymological root for a reason. Delusion is it&#39;s own delugian. Verbum in Verbero. &quot;The words in War&quot;. Same root because the words of war are ever a war of words. </p>

<p>Its not Christmas, and Santa isn&#39;t Santa.<br/>
<a href="https://thetruthandlight.wordpress.com/2008/12/25/saturnalia-the-real-roots-of-christmas/">https://thetruthandlight.wordpress.com/2008/12/25/saturnalia-the-real-roots-of-christmas/</a></p>

<p>happy Holidays on Bleeker Street indeed !</p>

<p>translation: its a slaughter. Our leaders are Satanists and they are so disturbed, that they may actually be executing us for the love of Satan. And eating us as a delicacy. If you remember, there have been various movies that have replicated the characterilogical trajectory of Gilles de Rais. Most notably Silence of The Lambs Hannibal Lehcter and Children of the Corn. Also interesting to note, a theory now believable, that Jack the Ripper was really a paid assassin to execute prostitutes that may have been thought &quot;dangerous&quot; by the crown. </p>

<p>UPDATED LINK FOUND. 3:15 THIS IS THE TRUE VERSION OF EYES WIDE SHUT. courtesy of RoyalWithCheese22 here : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6HNrTNO5pk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6HNrTNO5pk</a>
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</p>

<p>Start one version normally, then play the other starting AT EXACTLY 1:30:00 in this version, or when Kubrick handed the cut to the taxi driver, (he was handing it to us). You should have about 15 minute at the end of the second one to wrap up the movie. Pay keen attention to Nuala Windsor and look at who she is standing next to (her father) before approaching Cruise in the mask. </p>

<p>Look at it this way. One film is Over the Rainbow. The second revealing version is Under the Rainbow, or Where the Rainbow ends. Its the antigen to the Wizard of OZ (OSIRIS). </p>

<p>And do you really remember the very beginning of the Shining whe
Now we can begin to analyze this movie. This is only the tip of the iceberg. </p>

<p>I would also like to say that I spent years of my life analyzing Star Wars. I wrote Cipher Dios. This was relatively easy to get. The key is understanding that Apollo 11 is really what the Shining is about. Once you understand this than you will see how Kubrick is in fact speaking to us. </p>

It&#39;s slowed down to defeat Youtube&#39;s content matching. Look for yourself. When you view it at 1.25x speed it plays normal. You can also see that the uploader uses some algorithm to move the picture around, again to defeat the content matching. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6HNrTNO5pk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6HNrTNO5pk</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pilsner, you appear to be not so good at reading or understanding things. Whats in the 3:15 version is an exact split. The split was intended to reveal certain parts which were concealed. As I have stated above, the movie that you are familiar with, if you are not a shill, is not at all the movie that you think that it is. </p>

<p>The movie speaks like the Shining, it reveals what can not be said by use of symbolic language. As I said above 
&quot;Nuala Windsor is the same exact girl in the mask which can be seen in the edited version at 1:20:00 minutes. She was literally looking at Cruise in the same exact way at the same exact time as Nuala Windsor was looking at Cruise in the movie. Kubrick was trying to tell us that Windsor, the English Royalty is behind these Satanic Cults, along with Rothschild and Rockefeller. By using a real man and wife as the couple, he is telling us that this is real life, not a movie.&quot;</p>

<p>Windsor is behind the Satanism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t resort to stupid &quot;shill&quot; accusations. Now if I understand you correctly, what you are saying is very different from what it sounded like you were saying, which is that there is a version of the film with shots we haven&#39;t seen before. Instead, it sounds like you are saying someone uploaded a 3 hour 15 minute video which is itself a split and edited version of the standard length film.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you to clarify which you mean so that there is no room for misunderstanding, especially since there have long been claims that there is about half an hour of missing footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of Pilsner you have to do your own homework. Its hard explaining to you what is already in English. You really do have a problem reading. For your illiteracy I will repeat myself, but believe me, I have nothing to prove to you. </p>

<p>A split occurs when you understand where to split the movie. The movie is split first when Cruise tears the hundred dollar bill and gives it to the taxi driver. In the version I watched this happened @ 1:29:29, scroll up, its there in English. The second time happens when a torn newspaper is handed to pollack, and subsequently handed back. </p>

<p>By playing both versions at the same time, what was found was that they were synchronously designed. That is, you can see behind the masks that Kubrick used to hide the truths that he delivered to us. </p>

<p>The very existence of everything that we are learning about in pizzagate is revealed in this film. And subsequently in movies like Children of the Corn, and Britney Spears &quot;Slumber Party&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. It&#39;s a double edged sword. The greatest confirmation bias is public opinion, and the essence of conspiracy theory is analyzing what&#39;s beneath all of it and, hopefully, revealing new things that show public opinion for the lie that it usually is.</p>

<p>The nature of the truth lies more in what isn&#39;t known. What the user above you is advocating in his own misguided way is to trust what you&#39;re told by whatever authority applies and not to think for yourself.</p>

<p>If a body is dissolved in acid, there&#39;s no use in pondering if the person was murdered because there&#39;s no evidence. Well, the disappearance is evidence. So, it becomes piecing together the interests that may have resulted in the disappearance.</p>

<p>People coming to a conspiracy theory demanding truth (or indisputable evidence) are fools because the forces that don&#39;t want you to know have covered the evidence and can dispense misinformation at will. </p>

<p>In the modern age misinformation is far more potent than real information (look at 9/11). The official story is the misinformation, and those who don&#39;t accept it are the kooks of society. Really, the kooks are the majority who accept the official narrative. But, as always, the majority control the flow.</p>

<p>For some reason this was really good to hear. I&#39;m sure that you know how frustrating it can be at times to see things for what they are - at least what I truly think they are - (9/11, U.S. in Libya etc.) and feel like nobody is on your side about it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing the resources we have to distribute information, and yet the bad guys can still win. Whoever was in charge of the &quot;discredit the internet in public opinion&quot; project probably earned a medal. And not only can they win, they win through deception. The older I&#39;ve gotten the more I&#39;ve come to realize; the thing I hate more than anything in life is deception. It&#39;s hard to find truth in day to day life.. Wake up, what kind of chemicals am I brushing my teeth with? what kind of chemicals did they spray on the wheat in the cereal I&#39;m eating? What is my kid learning in school? What kind of things have to happen for me to get gas at $2/gal ? who the fuck owns this company I work for? Why is it wrong to not want fat girls? Why is low morality in our society&#39;s women &quot;cool&quot;? </p>

<p>I could go on and on but hopefully you get it. It eventually all starts to all seem part of some grand design. And maybe it is. I will always work the edges of it. The (sometimes barely) loose ends that leave hints of the lie. I guess that&#39;s the only way I know how to combat it - by forwarding the investigations and ideas of fellow truth-seekers (a cliche expression but I don&#39;t know how else to put it). I need to go camping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, no doubt.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell where the malicious design ends and simple ineptitude begins.</p>

<p>One thing that should be kept in mind is that these ... &quot;architects&quot; are not infallible. They DO and WILL fuck up. It just seems futile because we don&#39;t hold them accountable, because we want to feel &quot;intellectual&quot; or &quot;progressive.&quot; And that creates a division.</p>

<p>Think about it. We can pretty much unanimously agree that our government is a shitshow. We can pretty much unanimously agree that banks are bad news and that the Federal Reserve is an entity that needs to be demolished. But what we can&#39;t agree on is if it&#39;s the &quot;Right&#39;s&quot; fault or the &quot;Left&#39;s&quot; fault. We hate politics but Obama is great. Then we say that presidents really don&#39;t have any power when one needs to be excused, but we fear Trump as the next Hitler. But then we watch vicious campaign cycles every 4 years but say they&#39;re just scripted shows.</p>

<p>We are so misinformed and conditioned by thought control that critical thought is eradicated. No consensus can be reached.</p>

<p>But if we would just fall back to The Constitution, it gives us a neutral template about how to deal with these issues. Yet, we can&#39;t apply that because there are people who don&#39;t like it (shouldn&#39;t matter, but it does) and want it changed and don&#39;t understand the importance of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the average person is worried about their job, car payment, house, mortgage, spouse, children, parents, siblings and are just trying to make it through another year. These people are consuming little flashing burbs about life on earth and thinking as reasonable people might that we all have these problems and we just want to make it. They don&#39;t realize that there is a controlling class who wants to extract all their energy and resources from them.</p>

<p>While this is going on their jobs are being shipped overseas or being outsourced, hours are cut along with benefits, the liberal agenda is infecting otherwise functional and healthy workplaces designed to make everyone feel like a victim or villain and wages are being dropped and we&#39;re all miserable and just want hope.</p>

<p>We want to believe in good things, but good things aren&#39;t happening. And we&#39;re being conditioned to simply want to survive. Eventually that will expire.</p>

<p>Sorry for the giant rambling mess to nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Giant rambling messes come with the territory. I think a couple rambling messes are necessary groundwork for a great post or great thought in the future! :p</p>

<p>I agree so much of what they do is incompetence. I think at the end of the day they are people with the mentality of &quot;eh, as long as boss says &#39;good enough&#39; it&#39;s good enough&quot; like a lot of normal people are. I think they are mostly high-level lawyers in position to improve their own station rather than the nations&#39;. And the whole system is tilted so the same turds keep rolling downhill. Jerrymandering and the whole system is all set up to keep the Good Boys and Good Girls in power. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m glad you mentioned it, because in some sense it&#39;s all a big show that is a smokescreen blocking the view of the fed. I bet 85% of people&#39;s issues around the country are tied to the fed.  And ultimately they end up being the ones dictating policy via proxy/puppet that&#39;s not even related to fiscal or monetary policy simply because the people who control other policy answer to them!</p>

<p>But the people are busy with the realest of all reality shows. The election, the riots. The &#39;racist&#39; trump supporters. The immigrants and the police shootings. Because that stuff is a rush. It&#39;s better than COPS, or any reality TV show. The same aspect - the realism -that draws people to that type of TV is probably the same thing that gives the insane dog and pony show of our news cycles the ability to gain the attention they do.</p>

<p>Unfortunately at the very very core of many of the problems I see is a laziness. A laziness in everyday people who do NOT WANT TO KNOW the truth. Like you said, literally everyone agrees our political system is junk. JUNK. But most people don&#39;t even want to dig into or learn the illegal shit that could bury these people. Instead they watch tv.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude.  This is bullshit,  I think this whole post is a troll.  I tried to give you (meaning OP) the BoTD and decipher your rambling tidbits and theories strewn about,  but this lame time stretched version confirms the troll. </p>

<p>There is NO NEW material here,  but oh yeah you&#39;ve seen the real uncut version,  it&#39;s just been taken down and only you&#39;ve seen it,  and conveniently didn&#39;t save it nor can find it again,  and I can bet that you won&#39;t because if it was on the net at any point,  it would spread like wildfire. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to look into the split comparison,  as it seems the only semi logical  thing you&#39;ve presented,  and it&#39;s at least a unique approach to analyzing EWS </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no real version of the film. Kubrick delivered the cut he intended to and this was verified by many close to him and in his family. The movie doesn&#39;t need OPs psychobabble to be able to get the point across. Also, Satanism is a buzz word these days. This shit, human ritual sacrifice and sex magik predates satanism. Not a satanist but all it seems to try and do is discredit folks that really don&#39;t have anything to do with this horrid shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am intrigued and I do think Eyes Wide Shut was a bit of a glimpse into the darker underbelly of Hollywood and this is why it was heavily edited to the point of hardly making any sense. I also believe Kubrick helped fake the moon landings, there are some obvious clues in the Shining. So I want to hear about the unedited version, but your explanation here is a bit hard to follow. You should use specific examples of what is in the uncut version, for starters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do an image search on Bing.com to see actual photos of a Rothschild mansion party from the 1960&#39;s the masks they wear are identical to what Kubrick had in EWS he went to those illuminati parties in England all the time in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s he was a member of the illuminati they loved him he was rich and famous and after 2001 in 1968 Stanley was the toast of high society in England. Then he made Clockwork Orange and he was even more esteemed by the illuminati. What you saw in Eyes Wide Shut are Stanley&#39;s personal memories of going to those Rothschild parties. That&#39;s why they killed him he exposed them and he was murdered for it. His death just four days after EWS opened was 100% a Rothschild assassination. They were furious at him for divulging their secret rituals. He paid for it with his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would he be assassinated after the movie came out and not during or even before production? It takes a long time for a movie to get made and they obviously would have known about it, why wait for your secrets to be exposed?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! When a movie with Kidman and Cruise gets made everyone on the planet knows about it. No way Stanley gets off&#39;d cause he made the movie.  The script would have been vetted over and over by TPTB and approved. Kubrick was very connected and knew the limits he was allowed to work in.</p>

<p>A much better theory is TPTB wanted this information on what they do to be put out there. Like advertising. See what we can give you! Just do as we tell you and the party continues...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm... You say yourself that the part where the ripped paper is handed it is &quot;almost exactly&quot; double the time where the ripped bill is handed.  Why would &quot;almost exactly&quot; indicate anything?  If there was some hidden message he would do it EXACTLY at the time intended.  You aren&#39;t going to take the time to hide a message in a movie but not line it up perfectly to get your message across.  What would be the point in that?  </p>

<p>As you may know, Stanley Kubrick liked to edit his movies at the last minute, sometimes after they had hit theatres, and destroyed old versions. However, Kubrick died before this movie hit theatres, so that is now possible here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s how people upload movies without them being struck down for copyright as easily. Youtube has an algorithm that detects material like that, but if you upload it slowed down, it won&#39;t detect it.</p>

<p>People simply have to change the speed to 1.25 to get the movie to play normally.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Kubrick&#39;s intended version or part of some secret conspiracy, it&#39;s just how pirates keep their movies from being blocked. You read way too much into things.</p>

&quot;Nowhere in all this did you explain what was in the 3 hour &quot;Kubrick version&quot; that isn&#39;t in the standard release. I think if you want any credibility here you should remember a good deal of it. Watch the standard release and think of what it&#39;s missing, then tell us.&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly, this doesn&#39;t seem to make much sense, seeing as how he missed the entire point of the article. Did he even read the article or any of the links ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface this by saying that I am not in disbelief. I just have some questions.</p>

<p>Everything I know about Kubrick suggests that if there IS a conspiracy theory around the man, it is that he was part of the system you suppose he is trying to uncover.</p>

<p>You are asking us to believe in two opposing facts:</p>

<p>1.) That there is an unseen group that employed Kubrick, orchestrated the moon landings along with a large proportion of history AND popular culture over the last half-century, and</p>

<p>2.) Kubrick decided late in life to expose this group, who somehow then became incompetent enough to allow his betrayal to go unnoticed until days after the film&#39;s release?</p>

<p>I am not asking you to hold my hand. I am asking you to clarify your motivations. Why did you refer to this as a job? Doing your job? For whom? To promote yourself? Or to spread disinformation? Or to enlighten a small group of people (subreddit subscribers) who are likely to be primed to believe anything that presupposes the illegitimacy of the primary narrative?</p>

<p>Given that you advertise your other works, refer to this as a &quot;job&quot;, and repeatedly demonstrate signs of an unbalanced personality... we are to believe you why, exactly?</p>

<p>I know that someone&#39;s personality and their arguments are not the same, but they play a part. This is part of humanity, something you cannot simply continue to deny.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even calling bullshit on you, I&#39;m just - from one unbalanced but intelligent personality to another - asking you to explain yourself further.</p>
