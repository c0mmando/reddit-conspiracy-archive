<p>How un-fucking-believable that P1zzaG8 is banned but not pedofriends. They say it&#39;s a sub for &quot;non-practicing&quot; pedos, but linking to <a href="/r/Pedochat">/r/Pedochat</a> is similar to an AA group having an open bar at their meeting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for pedophiles hanging out with other pedophiles, allowed here on Reddit. It&#39;s not a private sub or password protect, it&#39;s out in the public.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a Salon Article trying to normalize this behavior:</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even screen people who &#39;re around kids all day to see if they are pedophiles. Wonder why that is. </p>

<p>They screen me for drugs and I run a commercial landscape crew.. Yet, tons of people who work with kids are not screened for pedophilia and end up getting caught doing something with the children under their care. </p>

<p>Almost every few days in the local news it happens. Dunno how much it is happening though. That&#39;s just what is on the news.</p>

<p>But these kind of regulations come from the top. Yet at the top they don&#39;t give these regulations to the masses. Yet they have countless other control measures and laws.</p>

<p>They wait for it to happen and do nothing to prevent it, I wonder why?</p>

<p>-And know what else, who would refuse to have a screening for pedophilia? </p>

<p>Are we this ignorant we don&#39;t do this to protect our children? I don&#39;t even have kids!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is r/conspiracy, where we piece together patterns of improbable consequences based on circumstantial evidence. And by evidence, I mean an available body of facts that support the relative probabilities of one proposition being true or false. We aren&#39;t going to find OJ&#39;s glove here. </p>

<p>Everyone is looking for a smoking gun, but the body of evidence is in the art, the interpersonal connections, known FBI pedo symbolism, the innuendo, and possible code words. </p>

<p>Pizzagate <em>is</em> the news. Usually where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. If there is anything going on, these fucks have had some ample feedback from the broader society that their shit is unacceptable.</p>

It is not unreasonable for people to fear that pedophiles will act on their urges when so many already do and many of us have been abused.

<p>I never called anything &quot;rape&quot; however, any sex with a child IS rape.  A child cannot consent as there is an indisputable power imbalance.  Some pedophiles will delude themselves with the idea a child can consent, but they are absolutely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and just because you say you will not act on your urge does not mean we can trust that.  The sexual urge is strong and many, many pedophiles do act on that urge.  Many convince themselves it is not rape when they act on it too.  You should understand why no one wants you to have access to children, ever.   So long as you do not accept and understand this fundamental fact, then there is less reason to trust you around children.    </p>

<p>It is simple risk assessment.  Risk is  =  consequence of the event x the likelihood of occurrence.  Even it you are truly unlikely to act on the urge, the consequence is very high, if you do.  Thus the risk value is high and it is something that should be mitigated.  Preventing access is a very important part of the risk mitigation.</p>

<p>The consequence of your acting on it is just too high to merit the risk of exposure.  </p>

<p>Stay away from children and respect the concern people will have regarding your access to children.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you don&#39;t care about the risk of a pedophile commiting child abuse? Is anything above 0% enough to get worried? If so I have to inform you that ~50% of cases of child sexual abuse are commited by non-pedophiles. I think you can tell where that logic leads to.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well following that logic, you yourself have a low risk of murdering someone, but the consequence of murdering someone is extreme. We should lock you up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you trying to argue that the negative consequence to the child is not high and only perceived to be high due to &quot;the media&quot;? or are you just forgetting the consequences to the child?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not, I have readmountains of research on this and over 50% of victims of child abuse have some form of permanent damage that lasts throughout their life. The consequences are horrible.</p>

<p>I am trying to argue that the amount of pedophiles who commit child abuse is extremely low compared to the image created by media. To some people, the word child molester and pedophile mean the same thing, and that&#39;s insane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is something I have noticed in discussion with pedophiles. They often tend to think only in terms of the adult - rather than think in terms of the lifelong consequences to the child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t even discussing the consequences to the child, I thought we both agree that they are too severe to be acceptable. Apparently you didn&#39;t think so, so let me assure you that I believe that child abuse should absolutely be prevented anywhere it can. Just because we disagree on the way of preventing it doesn&#39;t mean we disgree on the ultimate goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I care about the risk to the child.  That is the entire discussion.  Are you just being deliberately obtuse?  I not only care, I showed you how to quantify the risk and one important step to mitigate the risk.  The less you understand that, the less I trust you around children.  Why would you insist on allowing pedophiles access to children if you wanted to minimize the risk of harm to children?  The fact that you ask:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you don&#39;t care about the risk of a pedophile committing child abuse? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I show you this, I trust you less:</p>

<p>Risk = L multiplied by C</p>

<p>Risk = likelihood x consequence</p>

<p>Likelihood = a measure of how likely it is for sexual abuse of a child to occur (you assume the likelihood is low, and I even will allow that)</p>

<p>Consequence = what happens to the child, if the event occurs. </p>

<p>Even if likelihood is low, the consequence is high, thus the overall risk is high.</p>

<p>You are the one insisting the risk from a pedophile is low, not me.  I am simply accepting your estimate and showing you that even if that is true, then the risk estimate is still high.  Due to the strength of the sexual drive, I do not think that the risk of a pedophile acting on their urges is truly low.</p>

<p>So yes, I am indeed very concerned with the risk of a pedophile committing abuse.  That is why I keep saying pedophiles should not have access to children.  As I said before, in reality, the sex drive is strong and that makes &quot;likelihood&quot; high, in reality.  Yes, pedophiles are not the only people who abuse children.  That makes no difference at all.  The risk equation above includes all of the people who want to abuse children.  None of them should have access to children.</p>

<p>And yes, if I have urges to murder people, then yes, I should be prevented from having access to people.</p>

<p>So we agree, the consequences to the child are too high to allow children exposure to the risk.  Pedophiles should not have access to children.  No one who wants to sexually abuse a child should have access to children.  If pedophiles truly want to protect children, then they should respect this and not insist on having access to children.  The more you insist on having access to children, the less I trust your ability to resist your urges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lost cause trying to be rational on r/conspiracy man, cut your losses. Those of us who have more than a 5-year-old&#39;s understanding of psychology and mental illness are sympathetic. People don&#39;t want to admit the fact that their emotion-guided thinking is literally causing more harm to children by driving pedophiles underground trying to deal with their problems on their own, which just causes a feedback loop of getting more emotional and causing more problems. Being rational, understanding, and supportive requires more effort and empathy, which is too much to ask for some people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deal with the same issue, but I do suffer from mental illness, so I understand how much of a curse it can be. Good luck to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ddlg</p>

<p>Daddy Dom / Little Girl. DDLG, or dd/lg, is a relationship in which one person is the caregiver or &quot;daddy&quot; and the other is childlike. It is NOT a relationship between an actual father and daughter or any minor. This is a type of BDSM relationship that may or may not involve sex, but often involves play with child-like things, such as <strong>stuffed animals</strong>, bed-time stories, and spankings. The lg part of the relationship is often called the &quot;little.&quot;</p>

<p>Yup. Scroll down on that Twitter page until you get to &quot;art&quot; by Alex Podesta. Yup. That&#39;s adults dressed as stuffed animals, playing with stuffed animals, rope and blindfolds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on, please keep your mind open for discussion&#39;s sake. I made a comment earlier regarding a Chris Hansen video about the biological nature of pedophilia. Context here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/53f5gw/chris_hansen_is_back_at_it_catching_predators/d7ss34i/">https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/53f5gw/chris_hansen_is_back_at_it_catching_predators/d7ss34i/</a></p>

<p>With regards to the pizzagate topic and searching for the truth, I believe that it&#39;s not reasonable to generalise all paedophiles as &quot;evil.&quot; As with most blanket statements, there is an error in reason. The individuals that act out on paedophilic tendencies are different from those in that subreddit.</p>

<p>What we can say from the current evidence is that they&#39;re wired differently. The paedophiles are wired differently in that they are more intelligent on average than the general populace. Take a look at that subreddit and their past discussions - IMO well-written and effective discussions. They also have a greater ability to turn on and off empathy; greater risk of sociopathy. They have similar psychiatric profiles as big company CEO&#39;s. That being said, seeing a disproportionate amount of paedophiles be in positions of power and abusing it fits the psychiatric profile, IMO. </p>

<p>Also be aware that some of them choose not to act on the tendency because they know that it is ethically wrong to do so.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for pedophiles hanging out with other pedophiles, allowed here on Reddit. It&#39;s not a private sub or password protect, it&#39;s out in the public.</p>

<p>So you figure that everyone on that sub is an active pedo looking to hookup and score some new victims?</p>

<p>Did anyone stop to wonder how many of the subscribers are actually cops?</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet half of them are LE hanging around waiting for some Jared Fogle wannabe&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if someone told you they had strong urges to slash your throat but knew it was wrong, so don&#39;t worry, they will not slash your throat.</p>

<p>Would you feel comfortable and trusting around them?</p>

<p>Further, imagine if someone like you already did slash your throat.  How easy would it be for you to trust someone who had strong urges to slash throats?</p>

<p>It bothers me that you trivialize peoples distrust and concern as if it were unreasonable.  It is not unreasonable for people to fear that pedophiles will act on their urges when so many already do and many of us have been abused.  Many of the adults you meet were once children who were abused, their fear of pedophiles and their desire to ensure other children do not suffer abuse is not unreasonable.  </p>

<p>I would do anything to ensure you had absolutely no access to children.</p>
