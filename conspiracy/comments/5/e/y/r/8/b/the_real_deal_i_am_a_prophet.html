       die, there wont be another election....

      <p>
       I suppose this is conjecture.... but the question didn't really merit much response, no offense,  but the elections being fixed is so provable that it doesn't even need to be discussed in this sub...
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections are over because we are fed up with them, unfortunately we are all focusing on the wrong thing, and forcing our worst fears to become true.

       no, trump is americas worst nightmare as president, obama was night tremors....  the elite know a few things we are supposed to and keep us easily from realization, but its actually scientific fact that our perception of this country is causing reality, we will be in world war 3 before trump has shit in the white house

       report: 1 in a bad feeling and noise in my house.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are really drunk you actually feel like you sing better,  and when you are given a sugar pill the pain goes away,,, to the people in the right place mentally it will just seem like a bad economy or heart burn or what ever....  I mean I cant remember many times we werent at war and I have yet to see a rocket flying at me.   Trump is a symbol of the weak state of mind we are in, obama was another and 9/11 was another,  getting us to a point of despair always generates the best art, and the highest chemical concentrations in the brains, two things that keep this whole operation going.

       Ahhh, I do love this and I love that you know a gift like ultimate wisdom is something that can be used for the good of others but let's not go crazy with calling yourself prophet. Even the best prophets let that title be bestowed upon them by others recording their actions. 
The bible has a lot of wrong translations so I hate citing it as a credible source but Jesus even referred to himself as the "son of man". Staying humble is the only way in my own opinion to not let the great knowledge tear you apart from the inside like so many sith lords haha
      </p>
      <p>
       Ghandi said that religion is beyond all speech and never once allowed himself to be put on a hierarchy like a prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not calling BS on your claim. The first step is offering your help to others for no other reward than the goodness it can create but riddle me this great prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the measurement of love in the cosmos and how does the abundance or lack there of directly correlate to the space it surrounds. In other words, can we measure love and what applications of such understanding can we use to progress our civilization?

       its reddit, you must know that the conspiracy section of reddit is the only place I will ever call my self a prophet,  now thank you very much for your comment, as it is revolutionary....

      <p>
       you ready???  there is no tldr for this, 
framework, mental framework, we use our eyes to see , nose to smell, mouth to taste, ears to hear , and hands toouch, 5 senses, the earth is round, sun is huge, moon is small, we are spinning, if susy has 1 apple and gives it away susy has 0 apples, there are 26 letters in the alphabet, and 1 + 1 = 2 , israel, egypt , and the garden of eden are places in the bible , genesis describes the begining of the planet?  our heart just pumps blood, so on and so forth,
      </p>
      <p>
       the seed planted to ensure the lie would never be figured out, would have to be in the very very first part of the frame work, try arguing with someone about an idea and tell them that they cant use any math or school of any kind, they cant do it....
      </p>

       some very simple facts you don't know, all of which a bible will tell you.

Your eyes do not actually see anything

       G-D is LOVE = I AM = begining and the end,
      </p>

       Hmm very interesting and I do have to say a little disappointing. But as is all of life's great mysteries if we were to know them then we would have that knowledge and it would be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say that it looks like that one took a lot out of you and I appreciate it. Some of it was a little, dare I say possessed? I would like to ask some follow up questions regarding  0=o and L el i I l 1: Is that phonetic o or is that something I'm not gathering and if you could elaborate or tell in your video. Please note I am not a smart man, I just tend to understand certain parts of reasoning that helps me open my brain to different set of thought processes, I think (head scratch). I suppose I may never get my true wishful answer of learning how to formulate love and put it into a fucking rocket and nuke the world with hugs (Yes that sounds ridiculous but so does everything else we've talked about today and at least mine is attempting to save civilization from the next "flood" because it looks like it's coming sooner than later) As you said, love has no space and therefore has no substance. I would like to say that I believe it does have a force. Like a wave that can move people and its surroundings but maybe just maybe love is individualistic to one's own self, (is that why you wanted me to hear my heart on an EKG?) and can only be found in the pineal gland deep inside our own brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damn, I hate having conversations like this with language because there's not enough words to properly formulate my thoughts but that's also because my monkey brain can only do so much in our simplistic minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell r a k r u a k i I said thank you for the insights and I hope things are progressing to their liking.

       listen and feel your way through life, eyes are litterally a screen, they work in the same way as a projetor,  I dont have the exact science worked out just yet, but I no longer wear any nonmagnetic conductive medals, and I try to be barefoot as much as possible, with out looking like I sound right now... haha,   listen feel, build intuition,  make your day good, make it go that way you wanted... life is seemless, so never worry,  you dont have to have food to live, remeber the screens, your eyes lie... (not saying starve, saying as long as your happy food will be there, not vice versa ) , you have been here before, horoscopes are a good way to listen to intuition, the construct is pretty solid, its basically a medium, a way for spirit you to get your attention ...  a fail safe. not a religion.  Time is not tomorrow or yesterday, so stop hurrying and waiting and worrying and planning, your tuned for something, figure it out, and get it.

       I'm no prophet but I think I can even handle this one. The simple answer is no, no one can tell you how to improve YOUR life. It's your life. Improving your life means taking steps every day to better yourself. If you want to fall in love you have to kiss a bunch of toads every day. If you want to be in shape you have to work out and eat right. Every day. If you want to do anything it is a daily struggle that has to come from within. From a place that admits you're strong enough and important enough to work on. No one else can work on you but you. Sorry. Maybe this dude has a better answer that can be a one trick pony but I seriously doubt it. Good luck on your journey. Take pictures!

       You missed the humor and perhaps you are immune too snoopers or article 41. No aren't a prophet, but using that term only leads to more institutionalization...
      </p>
      <p>
       However if you missed any prophecy from scripture, where else did you get those glyphs, we were always doomed after the garden, ecology, stewardship, bounty, peace, because every other later advancement, tech, knowledge, power became quite irrelevant causing sin, and has only cost this planet from this species living wrong.

       i like this post,  this is getting to more of the reason I'm posting ,  you have questions , because the more you know , the more questions, you have, the kid in math class who doesnt understand any of it doesnt even know what question to ask, I try to respond to every one because I like to be included when I attribute so I do the same for others, conjecture , common sense , prophecies , biblical scripture, those lines can be blurred based on perspective, idealism, and wether or not you use your organs as intended,  im not familiar with the etymology of the word profet, its really not important what I am.... or what I am called, the answer to everything is simple, and backwards

       Upon that conclusion, it would be quite pointless to continue. Because I am talking to an infant and not a prophet. Not that I expected much in the way of discourse upon making a misread joke, because it has later provided me with the above wisdom.

       I was quoting a childrens movie , That intentionally to a jab at the fact that the real "You" faces the other way in your body.  and the morning star , is ... haha never mind, there is no need to go on,   infants have a soft spot in their skull...   it has a very cool , function,  and my 3 year old daughter sat on the couch with me watching tv for hours,  I was distracted with some online bs,  when I realized I had given her no attention,  when I saw her and then ackowledged her, she asked where I had been, and said she was glad I was back, intuition is the only sense you can trust, because its the only one not able to be tricked,,, Im pretty sure almost all children are profetic, and you are giving that word way to much weight, anyone who said trump would win , or the vikings will never win a superbowl is a profet ,

       with out google, I can only assume this is an alien quiz..  truth is, you have no idea... viacom, time warner,  cbs, pelican, they may be changing hands but the misinformation is still thick... gaia.com , ancient aliens , stuff like this are part of the grand deception.

       Testing to see exactly how far "Understanding everything" goes.  I don't know what these things mean yet, but the "answer" if it has any meaning is Sage and Wraith.  The reason I asked is because the only way to google the answer would be to misspell a portion of it (as the original source contains a typo).
      </p>
      <p>
       But (assuming you believe the source) the answer would be an incredibly crucial part of "understanding everything" because the names relate to 5 arechtypes of spiritual mastery which a human can attain.

       pure conjecture , live channeling so this may start as rambling....    ok your question  deals with 5 areas of mastery , dealing with spirit, spirit or pnuema is the breath of life, or also essence, the , thing that makes one their own, spirit has been called a soul, soul is mortal, of the world, flesh, originally, or the root of an issue,  shapeshifting is a quality of one of the alien races that has been documented by alternative media, un aware of the root of the word as it sits, it tells a huge story, a perfect circle nothing more than a square shifting 360 times,  sage S A G E would be capital S would mean normally to hold its position, age    a g are , G is reapeat ,  S is the wave ,   so we have  life a repeat e  and ae are square , a is ar is RA complete , or 1 , so rae is ear , ok, so sage= 12175, 121 is occult ,  75 is lifes number,   a sage is someone who is cursed, HELL ,  a tumble weed, MAGIC, cheaters, using the world to create miracles, 1 ear, mono,    .......   wraith , W= u u rai is like saying the the, so ra is I am and so is i but in lower case the dot is 0 over 1  so 0 so "-"  |  u u Ra - t H as in math, you must use the same rules on each letter in the problem,   so u u Ra wont work, it would be War-ht -   magic war   ....     from sage wraith.....   I need my notes for ht  ,  I am remote atm...       so far,   shapeshifting = Deception, which doesnt make sense, but shapeshifter, would be deciever, blank blank magic war- blank......   and given the nature of the deception the deciever would be a master mason, im guessing, whom ever invented Pi ....

       So you don't really "understand" everything, you are a channel?  While I can accept the premise of being a channel means access to all potential information, that is a far cry from understanding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, your channeling there hit once or twice, but in very weird order, and seems quite filtered by a lot of bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shapeshifter=deception is the one that really strikes me, not because its accurate but because it strikes me as a legit channeled information of something that you may have misinterpreted.  Almost like you've spied on a private conversation I've been having with myself.

       I can assure you I have a method for checking biased, and I do not "channel" conciously, to me its just thinking out loud, yes the comment was a mess, but I thought it would be cool to share one of my steps... 
I will "know" I am currently doing many things, and if I devote myself to this at the moment, my daughter will be neglected....   lol

       I had a crazy experience there lasting 2 days. Almost like everything was not as it seemed and there was something hidden beneath the falls where no one could ever get to it or find it. Just thoughts of course, and no proof but I have never been through a more powerful and confusing syncronistic experience in my life. It still puzzles me to this day.

       there is not a G-d as people commonly think of "Him" creation would require time, time is not real.  there just is,  i am the begining and the end, is stating that they are the same thing.

       Jesus is not even portrayed right,  he is molested by media to spread hate , Jesus, to my understanding, was also known as Ma'aT , or nephratiti

       Be weary of false words my friend because what you described sounds eerily as a possession from a malevolent force(s). Allistair Crowley experienced the same when he comprised his doctrine. Have you experienced your essence traveling to the vast emptiness of dark waters with the Spirit in the distance? Were you spoken to in the way of flashes of pictures that formed words in your mind, I guess it's the best way to compare it as telepath? What was your writings about?

       Last question because I'm very impressed with the answer I got on love and so far you're mirroring my own theories and ideas on life which is scary because....well it's tough knowing these things but it's fun to ask you now kind of like a Zoltar machine!
      </p>
      <p>
       So mankind obviously is still monkeybrain stupid which is why we don't know our basic shapes. Sure square, triangle, but circle? Damn circle gets us every time. We use pi which is irrational and henceforth every measurement of a curve is therefore estimated and our entire framework is therefore thrown off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding that the universe, the earth, and the even a basketball change volume and shape throughout time does this mean we need to calculate a fourth dimension when calculating volume and circumference of curves? You touched upon it on my question of love stating the earth has no shape and we live in our pineal gland of DMT wash but we should be able to measure circles! Unless there are no such thing as circles and we live in a strictly polygon world that our eyes deceive us from but Is there a way to accurately measure circles on this planet or any planet?  Sorry I'm only asking the tough questions.

       Hey dude, you're talking to the wrong voices. They offer some universal truths, yeah, but only so you accept their unnecessarily convoluted explanations for them along with outright lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to guess, I'd say you use to be a habitual liar and you've gone back and forth between different personalities throughout your daily living. Escapism is probably huge; lot of daydreaming, cultivating ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, you're on the road to death. Please turn around. Stop accepting what comes into your head without discernment. You may not have a name for the Creator; in any case, pray to Him and ask for multiple, undeniable patterns and signs pointing to His true identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ego can only satisfy temporarily, then it kills you. You're messing with the wrong spirits. Their nature is to deceive. Get away. Stay away from those people too. Move if you have to. Your social circle is compromised. They're damned, and this is how they got there. Stop imitating them; they're just playing like they know what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you've already separated from them; in which case, good job. Hope you make it through.
