       Shit has just been weird since the elections eh?
You can feel there is movements in the background, planning, conspiring. I think more and more people are waking up, which is backing a lot of others into a corner. The news seems to be getting just further and further from the truth; it's like they aren't even trying to hide it anymore. What do you think?

       Esteemed Anonymous Reddit Admins
I expect my question to be truly one of conscience for anyone reading this (and who is root on this platform).
As you are aware, the sub
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       just got banned. Whether you think the people in there were paranoid conspirationists or not, you must admit their intention was (is) honorable and generous. Regardless of the avowed rules breach.
Please take 5 minutes to read what this (alleged) journalist wrote on that sub yesterday. It garnered 3000 votes in 24 hours (on a 20k subscribers' sub). His contribution sums up well the moral and factual grounds on which this work rests. I cannot link it on reddit obviously but it was last archived here:
       <a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">
        http://archive.is/MrsGu
       </a>
       As far as I'm aware, nobody was able to run a bot/crawler to backup the material. We have not been given enough time. I was shocked to discover even one's own postings have become inaccessible (even though a permanently banned user still has read access to his old posts). This may not come as a shock to this site's old-timers but I was dumbstruck by it.
You see, there is a possibility the investigation on this sub WAS founded. After all, it is commonly admitted there is a child abuse problem in Hollywood.
Why not in Washington DC then? There certainly seems to be some clues (although no definitive proof yet).
Reddit failed to mark history today, but that's beside the point. Obviously this crowd-sourced investigation will move elsewhere. But we need the archive. We need your help. Root, you know who you are.
Risk is occurrence probability multiplied by occurrence impact. Your opinion on the former doesn't concern me. But the latter, the impact in case the systemic child abuse does indeed exist, is the most significant short of actual genocide.
So, please, help us recover the archive. You would likely be saving actual lives doing so. If you can do it openly, I am grateful to Aaron Swartz' spirit guiding your company. If you can't, please understand what is at stake here. And remember, courage is contagious.

       Edit2: if someone thinks this is relevant in the whole spezgate/pizzagate context please make a post about it. I won't because I'm the one who asked that question in
       <a href="/r/AskAnAdmin">
        /r/AskAnAdmin

       that got deleted.

       Edit3: it seems it didn't get deleted after all. I can still see it when connecting through a non-logged in browser. Oh well. I still hope he read it and it had something to do with something :)

       I was thinking exactly that earlier today, if we could control and hold the media liable for bending the truth, lying, withholding of information. The world would actually have a chance. I hear people at work saying the most retarded things, they eat the propaganda right up.

       Be at peace, it's the same here in Germany and it's even in regular shows too. On every network misinformation and lies, but the percentage of ppl here reading alternate media is probably even lower than in the US.

       One would think our Germanic brothers and sisters would have wisened up to state sponsored media due to the country's history. We are all human though, and suppression of information on a large scale seems a lot easier than it should be. Should be suspicious even to those still asleep at this point. No doubt though, the propaganda and obfuscation have both noticeably gotten worse lately, across the board. Like you said friend, we need to remain calm and keep our heads up. TPTB are weakened and slipping, keep pushing fam.

       It is like they MSM is hoping Trump is a Nazi and they want him to be as evil as they pretended he was...meanwhile they are covering up the evil shit that might be going on, lending it credence.    Maybe this was so unexpected different limbs are flailing and no longer coordinated.  Might be a power struggle behind the scenes and conflicting orders going out.  All I know is they are becoming less subtle and their less than true messages easier to identify.

       Reddit is privately owned and run in order to make a profit for some shareholders somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine what happens when something comes up that might lead to a lawsuit. This whole pizzagate thing is a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy claims to be threatened because of a story that has little or no incriminating evidence. Yes, there is some
       <em>
        circumstantial
       </em>
       evidence. But nowhere near enough to warrant in investigation, let alone lay charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it turns out, reddit is heavily implicated. They guy who got threatened might decide that reddit is largely responsible for his mental anguish and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes a lawsuit a very real possibility. Now the thing about lawsuits is, even if the person taking you to court doesn't win, you still get stuck with some serious legal expenses. Lose the case and you could be on the hook for many millions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would eat into the shareholders dividends big time. So the admins, being employees of reddit's corporate ownership, quickly decide that a little damage control is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say goodbye to r/pizzagate

       There also popped up at the time a 'Stonetear2016', a somebody who had a four day old account with impossible comment and post karma for the visible age of the new account. They seemed to be playing the defensive character of the original 'stonetear'
      </p>
      <p>
       and 'Afrobean' named in one of 'Stonetear's posts, a (year plus) dormant account that suddenly acquired a new post history and reactivated to comment in relevant threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit admins were playing zombie account games on behave of the DNC, nobody else could have done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       (changing names of existing accounts to match new and dormant accounts that needed current activity and/or history)
      </p>
      <p>
       Very odd for Reddit admins to play this game of 'obstruction of justice', they must have been under the impressiont hat HRC could not lose and thus Reddit was free to play any game it liked with no fear of RICO.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reddit inc did this in full public view.
       </strong>

      <p>
       But now Donald Trump is President elect and thus all the DNC inspired Reddit shenanigans are documented and available for future RICO usage.

       He was stupid in the way he asked. If he had asked on how the files were encoded, he could have done the remaining reverse-engineering work by himself and nobody would know what he tried to do. Unless it's protected with some hash or the like, it's definitely possible to temper with the file.

       Bad guys with guns come to spez and tell him, "you better make your friends stop blabbing their mouths."  Spez doesn't want to get shot, so they ban pizzagate.  But spez agreed that pizzagate was investigating something really important and felt it was wrong that it was being silenced.  How can he bring more attention to the issue without outright saying pizzagate is a legitimate concern?  He creates a minor, yet controversial scandal that makes direct mention of pizzagate so that it gets more people aware of it while simultaneously concealing his intentions with plausible deniability.  The more people are paying attention to him, the less likely the bad guys are to shoot him.

       idk how much I believe it.  I think it's more of a liability/shareholders issue as was mentioned.  But it's certainly interesting.

       My theory is that he's on the aspie-side of the spectrum, publicly regrets selling too early (way back in 2006), is bitter in general and was annoyed at all of the insults and made a clever little script without thinking through the trust and legal implications.

       Your "theory" is nothing but unsubstantiated imagination. I could write up a "theory" just as plausible that completely refutes yours, but in the end would be no less real.

       There is a horrible implicit fallacy here. At least one admin actively edits Reddit data, and yet you cite the lifetime of an account as a source of its credibility? If the account were 10 years old, it may actually be only 10 minutes old and just had the timestamp edited.

       Actually, you know what, let's not care about the truth here. Because regardless if u/spez being the mastermind of this riot or not, our pitchforks are still heading to a right direction: backfire the censoring right the fuck back at those upper management's faces.

       Honestly, they could disable the posting privileges for a 5 year old account and then just come in and then impersonate them. Or they could just create an account and artificially change the start date. Or they could disable all the powers for all the mods in a community and start posting on their behalf as a way to erode trust.

Oh shit it was a reverse spy vs spy Streisand?

       I was thinking the same. The follow up too "i was just trolling the trolls" is utterly unnecessary if he was just trying to send a secret message.

       I think that he probably was cool with abusing his power when he thought he was on the side of good. He got in bed with the Clinton's, 100% convinced that they were what was best for this country. Naturally the_d was a pain in his ass and became an enemy of sorts. The pizzagate thing though, he gave them a ton of time to archive and relocate....in my opinion he fucked up on purpose.

       This really ceases to be an amazing revelation when you acknowledge that all corporations have an aversion to bad publicity. Reddit bans any subreddit that incites moral panic in the news, such as fatpeoplehate or the early jailbait subreddits. This is a for profit website that allows astroturfing and stealth advertising accounts to go unchallenged.

       He edited the posts because at this point Reddit is openly corrupt and no-one seems to care or feel willing to move on. Watch, no-one from the_donald will leave Reddit as a result of this.

       Good theory, although it's time for us to stop having to be scared and silenced, having to communicate through hidden meaning. This theory however sounds eerily similar to the Assange / Wikileaks hypothesis: The sub was killed quickly after gaining momentum, and that usually means it was too hot (accurate).
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;em&gt;Aligning theory: Assange sacrificed a trusted courier to reveal that he is fine and hold off on the switch (8chan post fake) while also revealing that Wikileaks is compromised.&lt;/em&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       It is time for the good people of the world to stop being divided by fake news, and finally unite and take control of our destiny, our markets, and our collective resources (and rid the world of systematic abuse, collusion and corruption). The world does not need to be hungry and suffering. The number of good people outweigh the evil - and the sleeping giant masses will soon be awakened by the scary truth - pizzagate is just one door to the puzzle and shows how their entire facade can crumble once people realize the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone eats pizza, and everyone knows that trafficking, abusing, torturing or killing children is evil. It is simple. It is scary. It can unite the world. When this leg falls the beast will be wounded, showing the path to its global weakness. Everything follows the same pattern of secret insider control. We are slaves of all colors, and it is time for slavery, racism, sexism, and all isms to be Trumped by the fight of Good versus Evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to take control of the information before they further separate those who know from those who don't, and as of today information and communication is the most valuable asset. We need to feed the world the truth, and then we can actually feed the world, and finally, feed the world a real future where good prevails. We need the good members of the military and law enforcement to stand together and step forward to show each other they are not alone and to show the citizens they are not alone, so that the communities know they will not be all be slaughtered for sharing the truth as too many others before us have. This is why so many military leaders have been replaced by corrupt yes-men.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot trust Trump until he earns our trust and follows the true will of the people to rid our world of evil, starting with the evil in America at all levels. Trump and Kanye are a fitting pair, and both need to earn our trust as they may have been compromised in the past, but it is possible that they are both now beginning to awake and are willing to face their demons to change the world, fight against evil, and keep others from becoming victims and slaves to the evil elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let fake news divide, pick a side:
GOOD SIDE.

       Maybe not to cover up anything in the subreddit, but to show that admins have the possibility to edit comments without evidence, and somehow hurt Reddit. I believe he is too smart to do that just for the sake of it, knowing that the PR implications can be devastating.

       This is spot on. It feels RIGHT. We have to be very aware that there are people in top level positions that are like us. They know something is going the fuck on. They literally fear for their lives yet despise the fucked up system of corruption we live in. They have no option but to go along as sheep. Their lives, their family, their friends, they are all in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even what spez did will put him in danger. I guarantee it. It was his safe way to rebel against a bought and now corrupted Reddit. One day if he doesn't get assassinated he may even come forward and admit he did this to sink his corrupted ship. Hoping it would make us all realize how fucked Reddit is and abandon ship.

       I like your theory. Ive always assumed he was a piece of shit and theorized based on this. Who knows what his intentions are. All we know is Reddit is compromised. I also think it seems very odd that a CEO would make such a childish mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be a loss of temper, but I was thinking of something different. What if u/spez came to the realization that people already know Reddit is censored to shit. I mean any competent person who regularly visits this site saw how r/politics was 100% propaganda. This huge hit to Reddit's integrity coupled with the drive to follow the MSM story of "squashing fake news" is what I think may of led him to "accidentally" lose his temper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it looks awful the CEO did this, but remember people - The New York Times admitted to not being journalists and pushing propaganda - They did essentially the SAME THING. Why would 2 HUGE MSM media outlets do this within a few weeks of each other? When you get caught lying enough people know you're full of shit. You have to apologize to the people you lied to if you ever want them to believe you again. TPTB were shocked that enough people called out MSM on their BS by electing Trump and need to reestablish the legitimacy of their most important control mechanism, MSM. I expect an announcement from u/spez and/or mods apologizing again and making a promise to squash all the "fake news" that made HRC lose the election just like Google and Facebook. Wouldn't surprise me if their plan is to let u/spez be forced to resign by the community and then insert a more believable puppet. Its all a charade designed to gain integrity in the long run
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Its also a lot easier to go edit a few r/the_Donald comments and admit to that than admit to CTR and all the biggest subs being pure propaganda bought and paid for by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: This just really sticks out to me because TPTB aren't a bunch of idiots. They have meticulously calculated strategies that are behind every single move they make. To think that they would let something this big fall through the cracks unscathed seems very naive to me. Maybe their move is to let u/spez resign and then put in another puppet that seems legit on the surface. Kinda like hitting the reset button for them

       Part of me thinks that this is all part of a plan to undermine credibility in Reddit in general. TPTB have recognized it as an effective way for the masses to organize and are now trying to discourage users. Did entire idea of Reddit just get false flagged?

       I'm glad someone else had this thought.
One of my first opinions on this event was that spez had sold out reddit to help Correct the Record. He probably felt honored to be working with Hillary Clinton and Erik Schmidt. And then he was being asked to censor pizzagate and I am betting he felt a pang of conscience. It didn't sit well with him that he was being asked to provide cover for politically connected pedophiles. He probably hated that his site had been co-opted in such a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was his "burn the motherfucker down" act. This was his way of drawing attention to issues that he may not legally be able to bring to light or is scared to directly call out.

       This is what I think. Reddit board of directors ultimately makes the choices about how the site should be run. It's spezs job to implement the policy that is decided on by the board. My guess is that they axed pizzagate and this is spezes response to let us know. There is no way he thought it would go unnoticed and no way he didn't think about the ramifications of editing posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'll add that he confounded Reddit and it's becoming something that he probably never intended it to become. This wasn't to bring attention to pizzagate it was done to bring attention to reddits practices of censorship. That or he's a man child that can't Handel being insulted.

       A more plausible theory is an investor is possibly implicated and they threatened to pull their contract.

       While this is a great theory, something tells me it was kneejerk reaction and he didn't realize the implications. People do this all the time on Twitter and end up stepping down / getting fired from their CEO position. Gotta stick with Occam on this one. He dun fucked up.

       All this shit started happening after Monica Petersen's death.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what brought down the hammer on this sub and the Italian sub, as well as mainstream media attacking the Pizza all of a sudden and the big push on the Fake News narrative. Monica Petersen is the key to all this. Hillary Clinton also gave that press conference without make-up last Wednesday hours after the Monica story broke. It's all fucking connected.
It was all fun and games until am American girl investigating the Clintons in Haiti hit the jackpot and paid with her life. When that was exposed - OPERATION PIZZA CLEANSE was initiated on all fronts - Reddit, Twitter, FB, NYTIMES, you name it.

       Pure hallucinations. Think of it this way, what kind of a grade would a college professor (not teaching a creative writing or related class) give you on a persuasive essay that depends on the kinds of "sources" Pizzagate has been using to promote itself? You know there can only be one serious answer to this question, as far as the real world is concerned.

       Those are liberal schmucks just trying to be artsy, that's all. You really have no clue! Child traffickers do not behave like that, including maintaining such relatively high public profiles. Child trafficking is a murderous business, this group of people you've been obsessing over are clearly not murderers nor are they the associates of such, unless you count any associations/connections they might have with the military.

       Jimmy Savile was not a trafficker, just a pedophile. Same with the group in Norway, they were perverts exchanging cp, not child traffickers. The latter belong to established mafias with the logistical abilities to move (and, if need be, dispose of) hundreds to thousands (over time) of people around large distances clandestinely. Child trafficking is human trafficking, the two are effectively indistinguishable. when you accuse the Comet Ping Pong group of child trafficking you perforce accuse them of human trafficking (with the necessary concomitant links to national and international mafias). Black market economics require that the two go hand in hand otherwise it wouldn't pay off, and of course it must, because ultimately it's all about money.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Unless you are able to prove a connection between the Comet Ping Pong group and known mafia groups/enterprises, then you have nothing--if what you are alleging is that they are established/successful child traffickers.

       You're missing the point of this thread. Whether or not they are child traffickers or child diddlers, is a semantical dichotomy you're presenting to distinguish between people who hurt children.

      <p>
       Whereas what we're discussing here is the fact Reddit is clearly practicing censorship ...and perhaps even false-flags.

       He has no problem censoring and manipulating Reddit, so I'm going to guess he's just mad that his team is making him come out and admit what he did.

       One would think our Germanic brothers and sisters would have wisened up to state sponsored media due to the country's history. We are all human though, and suppression of information on a large scale seems a lot easier than it should be. Should be suspicious even to those still asleep at this point. No doubt though, the propaganda and obfuscation have both noticeably gotten worse lately, across the board. Like you said friend, we need to remain calm and keep our heads up. TPTB are weakened and slipping, keep pushing fam.

       Just yesterday a norwegian pedo ring was busted which included prominent elected officials, teachers and lawyers, etc.  There are also many documentaries, such as Conspiracy of Silence, which show many high public profile figures doing nefarious things, not to mention very famous UK personality such as ...
