       It seems every person in Washington DC can be bought.  Money, sex, drugs, power - usually one of these will do the trick.  However, blackmailing someone with video evidence that will strip a person of his/her family, job, career, status and a 30 year prison sentence.  Do you know what happens to paedophiles in prison?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it... Is it really that far fetched?  Jeffrey Epstein's private island?  Pizzagate?

       There are no "good" people in politics. The powers at be would never allow it. If they see a rising incumbent, they will just have the national party pour funds into their opponent's campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people that get elected are the people who play ball, and lack a moral compass. And with those type of people, everyone has some sort of dirt on them, or skeleton in the closet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians or coalitions of politicians probably have an army of investigators whose jobs are to dig up dirt on people to be used as ammunition, or to create fake dirt that would work just as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Power is about control. No better way to control someone tham through blackmail.
      </p>

       I think you are pretty on the money.

       Oldest trick in the book.  Get some dirt on someone.  Apply leverage.  But I think their hubris became too big.  Now TPTB are in severe damage control mode.   Propaganda, censorship, false flagging the citizenry.  Something has to break or more monkey wrenches need to be thrown into the machine to make it break.

       Just imagine: Epstein's island is outfitted with numerous recording equipment and he sells the evidence to Hillary and any other elite who is willing to pay for it. This could also be going on at Bohemian Grove...

       Hell, Epstein may have even had snuff rooms like the movie Hostel and sells those videos to whomever will pay.

       Hillary doesn't have shit, she's the one taking orders because of the videos they have of her and Bill. The people in possession of the blackmail are almost certainly shadow players and have names most of us have never heard of.

       It's quite possible, but in your scenario, I would believe the main players paid Epstein with a regular paycheck to provide them with these videos and he made copies of certain ones to sell to others who wanted them, too. He could've even been commissioned by people to purposefully place someone in a particular situation on video, too. I really don't doubt anything at this point. It's one hell of a damned dark rabbit hole...

       Do you even need to ask? No one ever questions
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       Epstein is a billionaire, it's just apparently accepted that he's a pedophile Jew-illionaire. Money isn't free and the easiest way to make a lot is probably to abduct some teens and sell their bodies to politicians. Film the politicians doing it without their knowledge and all of a sudden you have a lot more "free" money and favors.

       Interestingly enough, the original pre-scandal Variety Fair article repeatedly expresses puzzlement over how he was able to "earn" so much money.   Other Wall Street bigwhigs said the same thing.

       He was set up by the guy who runs Victoria's Secret (I guess we know what her secret is now) and his partner in crime was the daughter of a Mossad agent named Robert Maxwell.   It's the most obvious honey pot I've ever seen.

       The show trials to come will be more sensational than OJ times a thousand. The shared disgust and outrage will reveal a fabric of corruption so deep it will change "western" society for hundreds of years. Think on this: the muslim world, for sure Saudi Arabia has been "marrying" children as young as 3years old and the Talmud authorizes Jews to rape "Goyim" children, your child, at 3 1/2 years old. No wonder Epstein always has that shit eating grin. He doesn't think he's doing anything wrong!

       You'll have to dig into history to read about Roy Cohn and his role at the FBI.

       TLDR: Roy Cohn used underage boys as honeypots to get blackmail dirt on politicians suspected of being Commies. Trump hired him to help get shit done in New York. If Trump isn't implicated in this, at the very least he is well aware of the modus operandi.

        Do you know what happens to paedophiles in prison?

      <p>
       Its getting them a prison sentence thats the hard part. Also in the UK prisons they are seperated from everyone else and kept together. So basically they probably just fuck each other like the demented fucks they are and they all probably love it.

       OH my God, it is so MUCH easier than that, just keep paying them.  Corporations don't look for such nefarious and surreptitious means, when good old cash works easier.  Not that they wouldn't LOVE to have that kind of leverage, but seriously, they just use cash.
