        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNaiZcUZXus">this</a> video hit the main page of r/whereisassange I noticed something new, I wasn&#39;t aware of - Pamela Anderson who is the last person to see Assange attended a Spirit Cooking event in 2011. The photo from the video is this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Pamela+Anderson+2011+MOCA+Gala+Artist+Life+5Zq_Nhzwt6zl.jpg">Pamela Anderson 2011 MOCA Gala hosted by Marina Abramovic</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only photo from that event, here are a few more:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marieclaire.it/var/marieclaire/storage/images/attualita/pamela-anderson-taormina-foto/il-metodo-marina-abramovic/17938873-1-ita-IT/Il-metodo-Marina-Abramovic_image_ini_620x465_downonly.jpg">Here is Pamela with Marina Abramovic</a></p>

<p><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lunuo6lFOK1qiu9iz.jpg">Here she is again with the body on the table</a></p>

<p>So obviously Pamela has taken part in &#39;ritualistic&#39; SpiritCooking dinners, knowingly or not. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItF3Hcj_F38">Here is the official video from the event</a></p>

<p>So then I wanted to learn more about Marina Abramovic i found some interesting quotes from her:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be a performance artist, you have to hate theatre. Theatre is fake… The knife is not real, the blood is not real, and the emotions are not real. Performance is just the opposite: the knife is real, the blood is real, and the emotions are real.</p>

<p>I estimate I have 10 years to establish my institute, to create my legacy and do all these things I want to do before I get too old to move.</p>

<p>Performance is about the true reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taken this at face value and somewhat out of context. She says her performances are true reality... which makes her &#39;performances&#39; a bit frightening.</p>

<p>So then I thought, lets check out her website (look at her family crest):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marinaabramovic.com/">http://www.marinaabramovic.com/</a></p>

<p>Or you can see it more clearly on this <a href="https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2016/3/16/1/b/d/1bd608db-39fb-4fe7-bdf9-d3b85658c329.jpg">dinner plate</a> . Her logo consists of a black raven on top of a knights helmet with a wolf and a sheep below it (her words not my interpretation). 
The black raven in many cultures is a symbol and meaning connected with death and underworld. Raven consumes the remains of other creatures, giving this bird the additional symbolic value of &#39;cleansing&#39;.  Raven is also representative of a teacher, guide and a partner for magical studies and efforts. <a href="https://whatismyspiritanimal.com/spirit-totem-power-animal-meanings/birds/raven-symbolism-meaning/#RavenSymbolism">read more here</a>. Second is a wolf and a lamb. Wolves represents an animal that is a pack animal - they fiercely protect their own and hunt together. That in this case pray on the weak - the sheep <a href="http://untitled-magazine.com/lips-stars-and-warrior-crests-marina-abramovics-misfits-for-the-table/">more info here</a>. She is clearly a follower of symbolism as that is the core to her art form. Put them all together the message again is quite frightening. This however entirely depends on the interpretation you project on to the animals and the symbols.</p>

<p>In the above article she says the star represents communism from her European days, however communism uses a five point star. Her crest uses a six point star - a hexagram, which is significantly different and has its foundation in Hanfism, Jewdaism, Hinduism and Occultism. So the message sent from her crescent/shield says something different. There are a lot of interpretations of the symbolism and I have to say a lot of contradictory information from websites. It just so happens to be the same two symbols (black moon and star) used four times in the logo outside Comet Ping Pong (granted they use a pentagram not hexagram, but the same combination). </p>

<p>Comets just happens to have a lot of symbolism and meaning as well - read <a href="http://www.hinduwebsite.com/symbolism/symbols/comet.asp">here</a> and more <a href="http://www.astro.com/astrology/aa_article141030_e.htm">here</a> - let me quickly summarize. Comets are associated with both good and evil, but historically it has been associated with death, riots, wars and slaughter. In Hindu mythology, it is associated with two demons Rahu and Kethu. Vishnu cut off the head of an asura - the head without body became Ketu and the body without head became Rahu. </p>

<p>This is only what i dug up in a few hours hunt. It is clear these guys are obsessed with symbolism - as shown by their art work, their logos, the art on their walls and their instagram accounts. Just interesting to see that all 3 have a lose connection to each other. Whether that means something more sinister, I cannot say. I do however believe the symbolism they use has an importance.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pamela was the last one to see Assange and she partook in a Spirit Cooking dinner whether knowingly or unknowingly</p></li>
<li><p>Marina Abramovic the creator of SpiritCooking uses lots of symbolism and has a very strange family crest</p></li>
<li><p>Comet Ping Pong uses similar symbolism as Marina Abramovic family crest on their billboard and has been heavily involved with Podesta, Hillary and Obama for fundraisers, cooking with Podesta, politics and events. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=comet&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6">20 e-mails</a> in total regarding Comet Pizza. See some of the correspondence between Podesta and the owner of Comet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It gets creepier, but there is no definitive proof of any connection between the three.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not halal pizza. Podesta and Abramovic engaged in &quot;spirit cooking&quot; and if you look at the &quot;performances&quot; done at the Comet Ping Pong you start to see a lot more than symbolism. The Sasha (Anita) Lord performances include Abramovic. I&#39;m looking into Abramovic, I don&#39;t think it was a pure coincidence that children attended her spirit cooking satanic rituals. I don&#39;t think she &quot;only&quot; used pig&#39;s blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting and should be getting more attention- i always thought Pamela Anderson showing up to see Assange was weird. 
But I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a pig, not a sheep, on the crest, which are traditionally and symbolically a slaughter animal. Made me think of this-<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/long-pig">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/long-pig</a> 
Searching it led me to <a href="http://gawker.com/the-chilling-case-of-fat-longpig-the-cannibal-with-a-493196615">this</a> and <a href="http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1258202/">this</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>She says it is a sheep in this <a href="http://www.thegroundmag.com/marina-abramovic-an-interview-with/">interview</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just discovered lately that my family has a 17th century crest. It’s not an aristocratic crest, but a warrior’s crest, and it’s really something interesting for me. The <em>crest shows a wolf eating a sheep</em>, and it’s a kind of balance between strength, a very strong physicality, and fragility: This really represents my soul! I come from a family with an abundance of national heroes; this fact determinates quite a lot my identity as a warrior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you might be right that she has misinterpreted her own crest as she did with the stars and &#39;claiming&#39; it represented communism. However her crest, the star she cut into her belly (naval was the center - symbolic) and her own house is built as a six pointed star, not five pointed as in Islam and Communism. </p>

<p>The interviewer says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m intrigued by the fact that you live in a house that’s a six-pointed star. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her response to the star at first is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The star represented Communism, a part of my past which I didn’t like. When I traced the star with a razor blade on the top of my navel, it became both a pentagram and an upward-facing star; I basically experienced the idea of this symbol, what it meant to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are this deep into symbolism, you don&#39;t accidentally carve a six pointed star into you belly with the naval being the center piece. You certainly would not also live in a six pointed star house by accident... and you wouldn&#39;t also have a six pointed star on your family crest. No one that deep into performance art and symbolism makes that sort of mistake. As she responds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I drove up here, I couldn’t believe that the house was a six-pointed star! So it took me 30 seconds to decide: This is the house I want. It’s a six-pointed star, not a five-pointed one. So I’m making progress. Though I’m not Jewish, I find the six-pointed star is very harmonic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She goes on to say in response to symbolism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MA: Well, I use snakes, I’m using scorpions, I use a horse, I use animal; I use everything. Every artist uses symbols; just my symbols emerge from different experiences. I use a knife, I use a skeleton, and I made it myself...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She just &#39;happens&#39; to pick everything extreme and dark in symbolism.</p>

<p>Another really interesting thing... Remember how Hillary wore red, white and blue pant suits to all of her debates? And people interpreted it as she is patriotic. Well she did not wear it in that order. </p>

<p>Debate #1: Red</p>

<p>Debate #2: Blue</p>

<p>Debate #3: White</p>

<p>You do not mess up the order of Red, White and Blue.</p>

<p>Guess who else did the same thing? Marina Abramovic and she talks about it in that same interview towards the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RH: Last question: Your performance “The artist is present” at the MOMA (2010) was amazing: You gave so much energy to so many people for such a long time, the reaction to it was very moving, and the people really interacted with you. I noticed that you wore beautiful dresses, in just three colours – blue, white, red.</p>

<p>MA: I was very strict about these colours; I wore blue the first month, in order to concentrate. In the second month I wore red, to save energy. And the last month I wore white for pureness and clarity. I made the dresses myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton with an entire wardrobe staff, PR folks etc.. do not mess up the color sequence of red, white and blue. She also just happened to be very sick when she wore red. Trump and Hillary campaigns negotiated every aspect of the debate and a lot of folks noticed that it was weird Hillary was wearing the republican red to the first debate as seen <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/2966214/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-swap-party-colours-at-presidential-debate/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also the above quote goes to show that Marina Abramovic do not accidentally mistake a five star with a six star. If Abramovic plans her colored clothing months in advance and even goes through the process of making the clothes themselves, she would not make a mistake on the star symbolism. </p>

<p>Hillary, Podesta et al. are all involved with Marina Abramovic and Spirit Cooking on more than one occasion. Color me crazy, but I don&#39;t think this is a coincidence. </p>
