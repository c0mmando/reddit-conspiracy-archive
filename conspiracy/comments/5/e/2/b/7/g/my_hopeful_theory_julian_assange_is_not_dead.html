         Glenn Greenwald has said "He is safe."  (In on it?! If so... fuck that guy - I will have lost all respect, which is already on shaky ground given his total dismissal of 9/11 Truth.)

       Fwit - this thought keeps crossing my mind too. It could also account for the large amount of bitcoin funds WL moved. And, it could all be wishful thinking on our parts. As for Pam Anderson: I always figured she was a CIA monarch asset. How that would figure in if true...I don't know.

       JA is kill.  But that won't be confirmed for a long time (to prevent public outrage and to control the story.  MSM seem to have no curiosity about it, waiting to get the official script.)  Shame the DMS didn't work.  Phase 3, the real damning evidence of the corruption of the Clinton Foundation, was never released.  Wikileaks twitter is now compromised.  Pam is a weird sideshow--along with the cat with collar and tie--designed to mess with your head.  Accept and move on.

       It'll end on the pretence that Assange escaped the embassy with the help of his missing legal team, and disappeared off the face of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there will be public trials regarding the incompetence of police surveillance, where the British government squabble over how such a thing could happen, then a few days later the MSM will "pick up" a story about a girl who tells of
       <sup>
        fabricated
       </sup>
       rape accusations, thus in turn evoking anti-Assange sentiments among the sheep who'll believe.

       there is no reason why assange would NEVER voluntarily show his face again.  that's absurd, and counter productive to the wikileaks movement.

       I completely agree, not only is it out of character, it's absurd that Wikileaks twitter quizzed us in the beginning as to how we want proof of life, think about how idiotic such a proposition is.
It was nothing more than a stalling tactic, to ensure anyone holding a deadman's key(that hadn't already been caught) would've been put at ease until all intel could be captured.
