<p>I have no sources to reference.  However:</p>

<li><p>If they were trying to silence him, why did they &quot;allow&quot; the Dartmonth interview to air ?</p></li>

<li><p>Glenn Greenwald has said &quot;He is safe.&quot;  (In on it?! If so... fuck that guy - I will have lost all respect, which is already on shaky ground given his total dismissal of 9/11 Truth.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>/I remain hopeful, but... FUCK! ...it&#39;s looking bleak. :|...</p>

<p>NOTE:  Downvote me all you want (because that&#39;s what TPTB would do).  But hopefully this will lead to some insightful counterpoints, at the very least.  </p>

<p><strong>Cheers and prayers to Julian Assange.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>JA is kill.  But that won&#39;t be confirmed for a long time (to prevent public outrage and to control the story.  MSM seem to have no curiosity about it, waiting to get the official script.)  Shame the DMS didn&#39;t work.  Phase 3, the real damning evidence of the corruption of the Clinton Foundation, was never released.  Wikileaks twitter is now compromised.  Pam is a weird sideshow--along with the cat with collar and tie--designed to mess with your head.  Accept and move on.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;ll end on the pretence that Assange escaped the embassy with the help of his missing legal team, and disappeared off the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>Sure there will be public trials regarding the incompetence of police surveillance, where the British government squabble over how such a thing could happen, then a few days later the MSM will &quot;pick up&quot; a story about a girl who tells of <sup>fabricated</sup> rape accusations, thus in turn evoking anti-Assange sentiments among the sheep who&#39;ll believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no reason why assange would NEVER voluntarily show his face again.  that&#39;s absurd, and counter productive to the wikileaks movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree, not only is it out of character, it&#39;s absurd that Wikileaks twitter quizzed us in the beginning as to how we want proof of life, think about how idiotic such a proposition is.
It was nothing more than a stalling tactic, to ensure anyone holding a deadman&#39;s key(that hadn&#39;t already been caught) would&#39;ve been put at ease until all intel could be captured.</p>
