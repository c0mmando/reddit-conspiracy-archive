       Just look into the history books. They have a bloody and influential history.

       I am not into the flat earth theories but the jesuit part is a decent summary:

       I admit to being a little vague on the details, but the general gist seems to be that Ratzinger was doing as much as he could to defend the paedophile priests who are or were apparently being prosecuted in numerous places.  Eventually it got to the point where they couldn't keep a lid on the fact that he was doing that, so politically the public was offered his head.  They gave him exile inside the Vatican itself, however, because kicking him off the property would mean that the authorities would get him, potentially along with information that others in the church did not want said authorities to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ratzinger is a liability to them, and has been pretty much ever since he became Pope.  It was an insane idea to elect the guy in the first place.  He held the ancient title of Grand Inquisitor, and got where he did due to being John Paul's chief theological attack dog.  It was the worst possible PR screwup that the Church could have made; the guy is almost literally identical to Emperor Palpatine.

       Do you have actual evidence for your beliefs outside the public narration during that time? We all know by now how that is artificially created for a purpose.

       Whatever you might think about the catholic church/vatican this guy was highly educated and intelligent if you ever saw a longer interview/discussion with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       His basic philosophy was that the catholic church needed a stable identity than adapt to whatever floats around. He was a conservative force for intellectual reasons.

       You might all think these dogmas are stupid from a personal perspective and your own beliefs(I may agree) but that's surely not the whole picture as the world works differently.

       Now google for "Pope Benedict banking crisis" and consider how Europe changed after he got replaced. I don't believe in such coincidences. This guy was forced to step down because some people decided he was in the way of their strategic goals.

       The current goal seems to be a new religion/one world church/destruction of the catholic church or install islam as a new religious dogma. I'm not actually sure if the people who organized this even care for the consequences anymore.

       The goal is to get rid of anything whatsoever which could be remotely conducive to real individual empowerment, so as to enforce total dependence on a centralised global collective.  Islam is simply being used to smash things, in furtherance of that goal.  The atheists will claim that paedophilia and child sexual abuse is their motivation for attacking Catholicism, but the goal is really to destroy theism in general.  They're doing the same thing to Hinduism.  To an extent Buddhism is faring a bit better, because they are very good at secular integration in order to avoid persecution; but the Chinese still turned Tibet into a meat grinder, and chased out most of the few they didn't kill.

       Catholicism is the old false church.  Secular humanism is the new one.

       There is a book, the first in a series of 4, that suggests that Benedict resigned in order to partially fulfill the prophecy of Martin Malachy. This current Pope is called Petrus Romanus (Peter the Roman). The book titled
       <em>
        Petrus Romanus
       </em>
       by Tom Horn predicted the exact month of Benedict's resignation, and many suggest that Pope Francis/Petrus Romanus is the final Pope and a likely candidate for the "False Prophet" from biblical eschatology. Tom Horn has many videos on YouTube for those curious. His book Zenith 2016 is very interesting regardless of one's religious worldview.
