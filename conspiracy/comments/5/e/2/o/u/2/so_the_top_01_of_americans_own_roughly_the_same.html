<p>On average, for every 1000 people, 1 person has as much as 900 people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this is not anything new but an imbalance like this is what has brought our economy to its knees and has to be addressed eventually. It&#39;s better if we fix this now before we jump into another painful recession. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you do some research, as I have, you will notice the tax percentage for the wealthy was far higher before the 1970&#39;s.  When Ronnie Ray Gun got into office, and especially after Bush family friend Hinckley tried to kill him, that tax rate dropped tremendously.  This is a big reason why you see the inequality growing so much and it has gained momentum the longer it has been ignored.  </p>

<p>This, paired with the globalist anti-labor stance, has lead to increasingly diminished returns for the labor market; thus pushing those at the middle and bottom down further and further as their wealth of the rich has skyrocketed.</p>

<li><p>This part mad me laugh out loud. </p></li>
<li><p>No offence my good man, but you are sadly misguided and ignorant, in these matters. The US electoral system was build to facilitate a few 2 million settlers, not 326 million people, solidified into a dysfunctional two party system. It is neither fair nor working as intended, if the intend was anything even remotely related to the phenomenon know as &quot;democracy&quot;.</p></li>

<p>It is in effect a two party dictatorship, controlled by a very small elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America isnt and will never be a &quot;democracy&quot; thats where you are confused. America is a Republic and it only works when people give a shit. People like you crack me up with this stuff when you say &quot;it was only meant&quot; whenever or back then. No it was meant to last forever and they even said so but it will fail if the people dont pay attention and thats exactly what happened. The people stopped paying attention and whats worse is the &quot;educated liberals&quot; want more govt intervention, they want dependency not freedom. Don&#39;t confuse your lack of knowledge to my &quot;ignorance&quot;. Yes its controlled by a small elite but again thats OUR fault. Trump winning against the wall street/media backed/establishment nominee in Hillary Clinton proved when the people are pissed off enough we can still have what we want. Thats what Trump winning the election showed me.</p>

<li><p>Trump is the result of a string of failed economic policies, negatively effecting the middle class and the poor (the dumb people), who hasn&#39;t had a single pay raise in 35 years, or seen justice to the criminality on Wall Street and Washington DC. </p></li>

<p>I am not a Trump supporter, never was and never will be, for as long as I live. Clinton is crony, corrupt and criminal - And I am only using these words because I am being very very polite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the majority of Americans dumb or ignorant/ look at what Iceland did when their bankers came after them...now look at how we handled it. Thats my problem</p>

<p>Is wall street and dc corrupt? Absolutely but they have been doing it for decades...the only difference is in the past we put a stop to it. They just rebrand stuff and come back at us.</p>

<p>How do you figure i am hysterical and blind? I am not angry so wrong again i am actually in a really good mood.</p>

<p>Also never said you were a Trump supporter</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t assume so much we could probably have a decent conversation </p>

<p>Being poor sucks trust me i know because i came from a poor inner city family. We have obese poor people...think about that for a minute...our poor have brand new iphones and internet.</p>

<p>Our poor and middle class have it alot better than the majority of the world. They would have it better if they would aim their hate where it belongs as opposed to middle class white people and cops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit &quot;out there&quot; with my solution only because of a spiritual awakening I had this year. I now understand money to be a Pandora&#39;s box that has brought oceans of turmoil into our lives and so my solution would be to generate wealth without using money or trade. Basically, I found a model that matches what I imagined and it&#39;s called Sacred Economics.</p>

<p>Right now money acts like a mental beam that forces people to do all kinds of things and this beam is controlled by the elite who hold all of that money. The access to money has been denied for the most part outside of bare bone necessities so that people can at least eat. </p>

<p>The problem is the money is way to easy to manipulate. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect anyone to understand this, but I have lost faith in the application of dollar bills. I just don&#39;t think it will ever work outside of the short run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple answer is bitcoin. Since bitcoin is limited by pure energy it will always be in limited supply. And since their are no real benefits of scale given the needed input their producrion can be decentralised.</p>

<p>In this way bitcoins act as pure condensed energy. </p>

<p>If you imagine everyone having solar on their roof you might see where im going with this.</p>

<p>Then the rent becomes the same as the increase of value in bitcoin over time which comes directly down to the cost of solar energy at that time as well as the demand for money. If demand for money falls the rent will rise till all needs for money are met.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In many other historic countries this has been solved by weakening the might of &quot;legal&quot; persons to improve the rights of the real persons instead. This can be achieved legally in many countries but in other countries violent uprising might be the only recourse.</p>

<p>The laws that would need to be changed are often related to land ownership, inheritance and taxation as these are the foundational basis of all wealth in a nation.</p>

<p>The legal persons are normally the military/state, the church, or large estates. A new example is the imperial of such legal person is the charter company.</p>

<p>In the western tradition the classic examples of solutions have been are violent revolt against the instituitions that these legal persons represent. </p>

<p>The traditional enemies of these revolts have always been The roman church, the royal houses of europe, the estates of the aristocracy.</p>

<p>In the colonies these revolts where often over foreign charter companies owned by these instituitions. </p>

<p>So in essence. Corporations are not people, and neither are churches, or foundations. </p>

<p>Because if we treat these illusionary beings as real, they will capture the hearts and minds of people in order to amass more wealth.</p>

<p>Yeah they used to, and even then it was questionable given the number of military brats that turned out to be rockstars and successful businesspeople.  I used to buy that idea that anyone can make it in America too, but you are being sold snake oil.  You do not understand how the people at the top have spent decades squashing the little guy, creating laws to stifle competition and generally working together to ensure you don&#39;t get to the top with them.  </p>

<p>You are an abject fool if you do not understand that.  I won&#39;t even write my books because I know some NSA stooge will steal it and hand it to someone else.  Don&#39;t believe me?
