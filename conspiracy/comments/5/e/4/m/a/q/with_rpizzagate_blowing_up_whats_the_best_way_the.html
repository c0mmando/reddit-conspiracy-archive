<p>Another way to get the news out.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) Create a PROFESSIONAL press release (or pay $5 for someone to do it for you)</p>

<p>2) Submit the release to prbuzz or any other distribution network.</p>

<p>3) Hundreds of legacy news sites will automatically post the press releases.</p>

<p>4) Reporters often check press releases for interesting news, if your release is good they might write a story about it.</p>

<p>Easiest way to get this all done is to go on Fiverr.com and pay $5 for someone in India to write and distribute the press release for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jeff Gannon story is mostly about the fact that he was a beltway insider who moonlighted as a gay prostitute.  The conjecture that he&#39;s actually an abducted child is speculation without a whole lot of evidence backing it up (not saying it isn&#39;t true, but I don&#39;t buy it).</p>

<p>The rest of those are pretty good comparisons (though foley and hastert weren&#39;t caught for actual pedophilia- but preying on teenagers from a position of power.  Closer to what you see on To Catch a Predator, but with the added problem that these were teenagers they were somewhat responsible for.)  </p>

<p>I think where it gets tricky and you venture into unproven territory, is where you start talking about rituals and human trafficking.  That stuff still seems very difficult to prove, though I AM convinced it exists, even if pizzagate is still questionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, it depends.  In Haiti, child slavery is very real.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restavek">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restavek</a></p>

<p>So if the &quot;human trafficking&quot; is removing the children from that system for BETTER lives, maybe it&#39;s a good thing.  But the evidence is that because the child slaves are not even registered with the government (no birth certificates), they can be trafficked very easily for whatever reason.  We&#39;re assuming bad intentions on behalf of the Clintons, when it&#39;s also possible that they&#39;re trying to help one of the poorest and most corrupt countries on earth, as they claim to be.</p>

<p>see- that&#39;s where you&#39;re distorting the definition of &quot;child trafficking&quot; (but they might be, too).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always see people misunderstanding this phrase- it basically means that intention without action is just masturbation.  it&#39;s different the the machevellian &quot;ends justifies the means&quot;, which is what I suspect you meant here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re referring to the AFSA, which makes it easier for the federal government to support foster children and adoption.  But you&#39;re saying that at the same time, it sets up a system in which parental rights can be terminated without proper oversite- and you&#39;d probably argue that this supports an abusive foster care system.</p>

<p>I agree that there&#39;s a issue there, but when you are juxtaposing that kind of &quot;child trafficking&quot; with slavery and sex-trafficking, it distorts the reality by dumbing it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but then you&#39;re comparing corruption and abuse in the foster system to organized crime which trafficks sex slaves.  And I&#39;m not saying that doesn&#39;t exist WITHIN the foster system, I&#39;d suspect it does.  But claiming that the foster system exists in order to support child abuse is a really extreme claim that would require some really extreme evidence.  And I don&#39;t think making extreme claims like that does any justice when it comes to changing the foster system or addressing the issue of human trafficking.</p>
