       Immediately when I try to get people to look at this they blow it off as some stupid conspiracy theory because it's not being talked about on mainstream, corporate ran, media. What are your best solutions to getting people to really understand the reality?

       Maybe it's a good thing that pizzagate  is considered a conspiracy theory - it'll wake people up to the possibility that other conspiracy theories are true, and help break down the stigma attached to conspiracy theories.

       Another way to get the news out.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1) Create a PROFESSIONAL press release (or pay $5 for someone to do it for you)
       </p>
       <p>
        2) Submit the release to prbuzz or any other distribution network.
       </p>
       <p>
        3) Hundreds of legacy news sites will automatically post the press releases.
       </p>
       <p>
        4) Reporters often check press releases for interesting news, if your release is good they might write a story about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Easiest way to get this all done is to go on Fiverr.com and pay $5 for someone in India to write and distribute the press release for you.

       Package it with the known realities of Penn State cover up, Catholic Church, Dennis Hastert, Jimmy Savile, Mark Foley, Jeff Gannon who've all already been in the mainstream media.  Just another in a long line of disclosures.

       The Jeff Gannon story is mostly about the fact that he was a beltway insider who moonlighted as a gay prostitute.  The conjecture that he's actually an abducted child is speculation without a whole lot of evidence backing it up (not saying it isn't true, but I don't buy it).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of those are pretty good comparisons (though foley and hastert weren't caught for actual pedophilia- but preying on teenagers from a position of power.  Closer to what you see on To Catch a Predator, but with the added problem that these were teenagers they were somewhat responsible for.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think where it gets tricky and you venture into unproven territory, is where you start talking about rituals and human trafficking.  That stuff still seems very difficult to prove, though I AM convinced it exists, even if pizzagate is still questionable.

       So if the "human trafficking" is removing the children from that system for BETTER lives, maybe it's a good thing.  But the evidence is that because the child slaves are not even registered with the government (no birth certificates), they can be trafficked very easily for whatever reason.  We're assuming bad intentions on behalf of the Clintons, when it's also possible that they're trying to help one of the poorest and most corrupt countries on earth, as they claim to be.

       I always see people misunderstanding this phrase- it basically means that intention without action is just masturbation.  it's different the the machevellian "ends justifies the means", which is what I suspect you meant here.

       You're referring to the AFSA, which makes it easier for the federal government to support foster children and adoption.  But you're saying that at the same time, it sets up a system in which parental rights can be terminated without proper oversite- and you'd probably argue that this supports an abusive foster care system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there's a issue there, but when you are juxtaposing that kind of "child trafficking" with slavery and sex-trafficking, it distorts the reality by dumbing it down.

       but then you're comparing corruption and abuse in the foster system to organized crime which trafficks sex slaves.  And I'm not saying that doesn't exist WITHIN the foster system, I'd suspect it does.  But claiming that the foster system exists in order to support child abuse is a really extreme claim that would require some really extreme evidence.  And I don't think making extreme claims like that does any justice when it comes to changing the foster system or addressing the issue of human trafficking.

       I'm simply trying to get people to see a pattern, and act accordingly. Also, there's money exchanged and children are forcefully removed and placed with abusers, how is that not child trafficking?

       I just ask people if they have heard of it, or how some particular politician will react to the news. For example, I would LOVE to hear Bernie's reaction. Will he still be supportive of Hillary?

       I think the most compelling part of the evidence is the artwork depicting chidlren that is hanging in pizza place and podesta's house. I think that should be presented first.

       That three places right next to each other have pedo symbols in their logos.

       Most of the food references in the emails are crap, ambiguous at best. Leave it all except one or two of the best ones, at the end of the presentation of evidence. The photo of the little girl with her arms masking-taped to a table is worthless crap.

       I don't like it, but provocative art and people pushing the boundaries  are the easy excuses. It didn't seem like many people cared about spirit cooking, despite what I may think of it.

       I think it's fucked up as well. You asked, "How can you explain why anyone would do that to a child?" and I explained why I think anyone would do that, I didn't say it was right, I hate it myself. Now I understand that your question was most likely rhetorical but there was no reason to downvote and attack me for answering a question.
