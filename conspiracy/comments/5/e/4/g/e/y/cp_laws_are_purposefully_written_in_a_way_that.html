    <div class="md"><p>Basically, all &#39;non-violent&#39; crime or crime that does not involve the removal of objects is just FBI / NSA bullshit pressure crime, unprovable, Indefensible, and punishable for 35 years.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz - Accused of copying data (legally) with the INTENT to distribute for a profit (Unprovable, Indefensible, 35 year sentence) - There is no way for Aaron to prove he wasn&#39;t going to make a profit, aside the fact he took no actions to do so and it was completely made up, inferred by the FBI.</p>

<p>Julian Assange - &#39;He raped me&#39;. Can&#39;t prove he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>In the &#39;old days&#39; we said there was a Body Required to be charged with a crime. This is because without that requirement, a government can charge anyone with a crime of, essentially, slander or Victim-less crime. The colonies saw it being done to them.</p>

<p>Today the primary abuses are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>False Rape accusations</p></li>
<li><p>False Child Porn accusations</p></li>
<li><p>False &#39;Data Theft / Hacking&#39; accusations</p></li>
<li><p>False Drug Accusations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What you&#39;ll notice about each of these is that there is generally no witness to testify against you, other than the government. Thus the government can essentially charge you with any crime it wants, and it is normal for there to not have a victim, beyond the government itself.</p>

<p>Another crime dealt with similarly to child porn is animal abuse. Anyone who takes photos of abused animals is instantly guilty of (essentially) &#39;animal abuse porn&#39; and thus can not use them in court, unless delivered anonymously, in which case they can be thrown out (potentially).</p>

<p>A lot of investigative reporters have been jailed for Animal Abuse for taking photos of animal abuse, while the companies and people who abused the animals are not charged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a slight problem with D.C becoming a state... Article 1 sec 8 (17) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>17: To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on your interpretation...you can read it has it can or may happen or you can read it as an edict that this must happen that there must be a district that is &#39;the seat of the government&#39;. </p>

<p>In essence you can see that this portion of the constitution was set up to create a national district (later becoming Washington DC) for the sole use of the federal government, also you can interpret that the seat of the federal government may not reside inside any particular state (relevant reasoning), that the federal government&#39;s seat is outside of the states...so there is that.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean that it would be impossible for congress to write legislation that would make DC governance as close to a state as possible, they can choose to delegate their authority in &quot;all cases whatsoever&quot; to another body as they did with the FED and many of it monetary functions. However full blown statehood may be something far more challenging, as that would mean the nation&#39;s capitol lies within a state which is constitutionally...IMHO... has uncertainty if allowable. </p>

<p>On the other hand you can interpret this as simply another power congress has which it can choose to use or not or anything in between. </p>

<p>Or...which I see as the least likely in the near future the congress could move the seat of the federal government (with such mechanism has it created D.C.)</p>

<p>In any event, it is clear that Congress, not the populous of DC, has constitutional authority over the issue. Unless the several states make amendments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me make a controversial inquire. Please don&#39;t bury me under a rock... Hold on your gag reflex and make your reply reasonably.</p>

<p>While people that get off by seeing child pornography are seriously fucked up, If:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They don&#39;t enact it upon a child.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t support people that produce such content.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I see such people only doing harm to themselves.</p>

<p>Of course people here are probably concerned about child predators. But pedophilia abuse from family relatives probably don&#39;t have much to do with child pornography but opportunity or do they?
I do not know much about these cases, so let me know what&#39;s the consensus about people in these realities.</p>

<p>I mean, just like someone that watches porn on tube sites is not feeding that industry or going after people to rape them and tape it (they are just feeding a fantasy and killing their own soul in the process) I at times wonder if it&#39;s legit to treat some of these people like the worst criminals when they aren&#39;t actually violating the non-aggression principle and are sick.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t see how the possession of child pornography could be &quot;normalized&quot;, but I admit I&#39;m confused by the broad use of &quot;pedophile&quot;, when in my head there&#39;s a difference between someone that has a sick fetish, someone that supports people that practice it, someone that practices it and someone that profits from it.</p>

<p>I guess there are some facets that don&#39;t add up, morally, legally, etc, but what has been said about this distinction?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have considered this before. Thing is, they DO support people that produce said content. How do you think they gain access to child porn?</p>

<p>1.There is free viewing of CP in certain seedy places of the web, however to gain &quot;full access&quot; to said places, one needs to supply one&#39;s own produced CP. Meaning they need to actually actively participation in the predation of children.</p>

<p>2.There is CP that is paid for.</p>

<p>~Supply/Demand. By creating a demand for kiddie porn, they ensure there will be those who will supply it.</p>

<p>People who do watch regular porn online ARE contributing to the industry because even free porn generates revenue for porn sites ala advertising, and whatever percentage choose to upgrade from free to &quot;premium&quot; membership. I won&#39;t pretend to know the intricacies of how CP websites operate having never been to one myself, but I did read an FBI report about it so those two examples I gave are valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I guess because access to copyrighted materials, or being able to buy restricted things became so common through the Internet, it kind of skews the view and moral compass on things. I had forgotten about the ads. Though I would guess that ad revenue goes into servers and not into making more porn, since those people don&#39;t produce it, just distribute something they didn&#39;t produce for free.</p>

<p>I had no idea about Number 1), fuck... Not that is much worse than 2) in itself, but it actually pushes you to predate on a kid and tape it to be accepted, fuck... Had no idea about that one...</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. Something I have considered was maybe CGI child porn for those with the predilection? I think that could be... eh, a better alternative for pedos. But I wonder if that wouldn&#39;t encourage something within them, and if it wouldn&#39;t be better to try and resolve the fetish instead of catering to it. </p>

<p>Definitely a moral grey area.</p>
