       Basically, all 'non-violent' crime or crime that does not involve the removal of objects is just FBI / NSA bullshit pressure crime, unprovable, Indefensible, and punishable for 35 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Swartz - Accused of copying data (legally) with the INTENT to distribute for a profit (Unprovable, Indefensible, 35 year sentence) - There is no way for Aaron to prove he wasn't going to make a profit, aside the fact he took no actions to do so and it was completely made up, inferred by the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Assange - 'He raped me'. Can't prove he didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 'old days' we said there was a Body Required to be charged with a crime. This is because without that requirement, a government can charge anyone with a crime of, essentially, slander or Victim-less crime. The colonies saw it being done to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the primary abuses are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         False Rape accusations
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         False Child Porn accusations
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         False 'Data Theft / Hacking' accusations
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         False Drug Accusations.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What you'll notice about each of these is that there is generally no witness to testify against you, other than the government. Thus the government can essentially charge you with any crime it wants, and it is normal for there to not have a victim, beyond the government itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another crime dealt with similarly to child porn is animal abuse. Anyone who takes photos of abused animals is instantly guilty of (essentially) 'animal abuse porn' and thus can not use them in court, unless delivered anonymously, in which case they can be thrown out (potentially).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of investigative reporters have been jailed for Animal Abuse for taking photos of animal abuse, while the companies and people who abused the animals are not charged.

       Omg I loved MJ for all of my childhood. So did my family, but one day I decided to take a trip down the

       and see what was out there to put this question to rest. The page which continues to sit with me today was from

       Not to mention D.C. isn't beholden to normal United States law in the first place. They have Vatican laws there with their own cops and everything. It was set up to purposely allow what is normally international crime. They knew what they were doing.

       They let people vote for legal weed, it of course passed. Congress freaked out and said no dispensaries! Now weed is legal to possess there, as long as you buy it from criminals lol. There are some poor areas of DC that they could use that tax revenue to help, but nah.

       There is a slight problem with D.C becoming a state... Article 1 sec 8 (17)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        17: To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Depending on your interpretation...you can read it has it can or may happen or you can read it as an edict that this must happen that there must be a district that is 'the seat of the government'.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence you can see that this portion of the constitution was set up to create a national district (later becoming Washington DC) for the sole use of the federal government, also you can interpret that the seat of the federal government may not reside inside any particular state (relevant reasoning), that the federal government's seat is outside of the states...so there is that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean that it would be impossible for congress to write legislation that would make DC governance as close to a state as possible, they can choose to delegate their authority in "all cases whatsoever" to another body as they did with the FED and many of it monetary functions. However full blown statehood may be something far more challenging, as that would mean the nation's capitol lies within a state which is constitutionally...IMHO... has uncertainty if allowable.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand you can interpret this as simply another power congress has which it can choose to use or not or anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...which I see as the least likely in the near future the congress could move the seat of the federal government (with such mechanism has it created D.C.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, it is clear that Congress, not the populous of DC, has constitutional authority over the issue. Unless the several states make amendments.

       What do you mean by "Vatican laws" and what do you mean by "normal United States law"? What laws apply to e.g. Virginia or California that do not apply to DC?  DC has its own laws because it's its own thing, just like every state has its own laws.

       I mean D.C. is property of the Vatican. D.C. isn't run like a normal state. It's run as an extension of the Vatican. It's a toss up whether or not a politician committing a federal crime will be held accountable for it if they're doing it in D.C. whereas if they did it in say, Texas, they would probably be in trouble.

       DC residents absolutely 100% can vote. They can vote in presidential and local elections. What you're probably thinking of is that DC doesn't have a voting congressperson; they have one representative who can't actually vote on bills. And if you want to know why that's the case, ask our founding fathers.

       Yep and i wouldnt be surprised if only 3% of the world even knew about it. Its something that should be interesting too know why those 3 states are not part of their motherland. I never heard anything about it ever, if it wasnt for me being curious and reading alot of stupid shit on the internet i would never know. Just search on it on google, its only a few webpages that talks about it and its pretty much only blogs. Really fckin wierd!

       That's not true. If you're searching for porn and you find child pornography, you get off the site and report that shit. Now if you start "investigating" and such, then, well... Yeah, that's on you. But do report that shit.

       That would create the following scenario for our noble and trustworthy justice system:. Go after a internet ring, which is
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       , or after some shmuck who they have proof accessed it, which would be
       <em>
        easy
       </em>
       .  An easy pedo arrest, an easy pedo prosecution (will never go to trial because you'd be scared into taking a plea)... I mean they can try to go after the site too, but they only stand to gain by going after you.

       Let me make a controversial inquire. Please don't bury me under a rock... Hold on your gag reflex and make your reply reasonably.
      </p>
      <p>
       While people that get off by seeing child pornography are seriously fucked up, If:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They don't enact it upon a child.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't support people that produce such content.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I see such people only doing harm to themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course people here are probably concerned about child predators. But pedophilia abuse from family relatives probably don't have much to do with child pornography but opportunity or do they?
I do not know much about these cases, so let me know what's the consensus about people in these realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, just like someone that watches porn on tube sites is not feeding that industry or going after people to rape them and tape it (they are just feeding a fantasy and killing their own soul in the process) I at times wonder if it's legit to treat some of these people like the worst criminals when they aren't actually violating the non-aggression principle and are sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I don't see how the possession of child pornography could be "normalized", but I admit I'm confused by the broad use of "pedophile", when in my head there's a difference between someone that has a sick fetish, someone that supports people that practice it, someone that practices it and someone that profits from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess there are some facets that don't add up, morally, legally, etc, but what has been said about this distinction?

      <p>
       I have considered this before. Thing is, they DO support people that produce said content. How do you think they gain access to child porn?
      </p>
      <p>
       1.There is free viewing of CP in certain seedy places of the web, however to gain "full access" to said places, one needs to supply one's own produced CP. Meaning they need to actually actively participation in the predation of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.There is CP that is paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Supply/Demand. By creating a demand for kiddie porn, they ensure there will be those who will supply it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who do watch regular porn online ARE contributing to the industry because even free porn generates revenue for porn sites ala advertising, and whatever percentage choose to upgrade from free to "premium" membership. I won't pretend to know the intricacies of how CP websites operate having never been to one myself, but I did read an FBI report about it so those two examples I gave are valid.

       Yeah I guess because access to copyrighted materials, or being able to buy restricted things became so common through the Internet, it kind of skews the view and moral compass on things. I had forgotten about the ads. Though I would guess that ad revenue goes into servers and not into making more porn, since those people don't produce it, just distribute something they didn't produce for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had no idea about Number 1), fuck... Not that is much worse than 2) in itself, but it actually pushes you to predate on a kid and tape it to be accepted, fuck... Had no idea about that one...

       You're welcome. Something I have considered was maybe CGI child porn for those with the predilection? I think that could be... eh, a better alternative for pedos. But I wonder if that wouldn't encourage something within them, and if it wouldn't be better to try and resolve the fetish instead of catering to it.

       Definitely a moral grey area.
