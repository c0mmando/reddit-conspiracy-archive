        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I just got done reading through a post on voat a user made:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/1433499">https://voat.co/v/whatever/1433499</a>  Which seems to have compelling evidence that trump really isn&#39;t too keen on keeping his word on draining the swamp.  If real, this is very disappointing as it slashes any hope that Trump may bring change which could finally improve quality of life for the majority of us.  I&#39;d like to get your guy&#39;s opinion on this as well.  Personally, I really bought into the whole MAGA mindset HARD (check my post history if you don&#39;t believe me) But once Trump became president I kinda thought to myself..&quot;ok well, how could he become the most powerful man on the planet if the powers that be didn&#39;t want him in the first place?&quot;  Then I started thinking about media manipulation and how they spun their Pro Clinton narrative so hard.  Was this reverse psychology?  Did we get played by the media?  Has this always been the goal?  Anyways I hope this leads to some thought provoking conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s great that you&#39;re coming around. Welcome. </p>

<p>To some of us, it was obvious all along that Trump is controlled opposition. A billionaire New York guy (and close friend of the Clintons) who built his fortune on goodwill from the Jewish money power, obviously isn&#39;t &quot;anti establishment&quot;. The disrespected MSM ran a reverse psychology campaign to get him elected.</p>

<p>Had he truly been anti establishment and wanted to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;, the MSM would&#39;ve treated him like they treated Ron Paul. They would&#39;ve ignored him. </p>

<p>Yeah.  And that’s my point.  You erred big time in ever having given him the benefit of the doubt and buying in to any of his shit.  Yes - I’m glad Cunton didn’t get in, but people need to stop kidding themselves thinking that Trump’ll be any type of real change in America.  He won’t be.  By far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I would like to build bridges here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds good, my man.  Don’t let me stop you.  No sarcasm there, by the way.  I really mean that.  Building bridges is good.  We should work together to bring the entire planet and all the species in it (human and non human) up.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You mean you hear the conspiracy minded getting mocked, don’t you?  It’s the conspiracy minded that get mocked in this society - not the <em>non</em>-conspiracy minded.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely…but realize that there <del>is an</del> are absolutely GLOBALLY powerful syndicate[s] (plural) working together to make sure and keep the human population (the 99% anyway) enslaved and ignorant.</p>

<p>So yes.  Unraveling the shit is indeed about breaking through the lies and obfuscation…but the lies and obfuscation have been to a great extent put there on purpose by powers that work hard to <em>keep</em> us mindless, dumb, and confused…so it’s by no means easy to break through the muck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not mocking someone for believing a lie they were told and believed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  If you’re referring to <em>me</em> here, then I’m really and truly sorry.  I shouldn’t have done or said that.  I shouldn’t have attempted to mock in my above statement.  I apologize.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wish I could give you more than just one upvote for expressing this statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This comment isn&#39;t completely directed at you, but rather aimed at the general attitude I see and hear all too often in the conspiracy oriented communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if it was completely directed at me, however, it’s okay.  You’re right in what you said here.</p>

<p>We should all work together.</p>

<p>Here’s what I have to say to you then, in a sincere attempt to help you - my fellow truth-seeker - understand things a big better on this planet:</p>

<p>The government and the politicians are for the most part NOT there to help you/us.  Obama, Trump, Clinton…you should look at <em>none</em> of them as any sort of “hope” to better things.</p>

<p>Hell, even Bernie Sanders.  Don’t look at him like that <em>either</em>.  The man, after all, is a Zionist Khazar who was the <em>sole</em> figure responsible for making sure that The Federal Reserve was <em>not</em> audited.</p>

<p>He’s protecting his masters.</p>

<p>The point here is that the only real front that can change things is not any lone politician.  It’s you.  It’s me.  It’s all of us coming together as one united citizenry and moving against the corruption <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>We just need to really wake up and stop thinking that any politician can ever do anything like that.  They never have before, and they won’t now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have written here, an absolutely beautiful and eloquent response to my own.  Thank you for that.  This is what I&#39;m all about.  There are many people on this planet, and ultimately I would like the truth (no matter what it may be) to be there for everyone.  I find that fact that everyone has their own different interpretation of reality to be kind of disconcerting.  We should all be on the same page here.  But we aren&#39;t and we&#39;re far from it.  I see it, you see it, most every one if not consciously, unconsciously recognizes that something isn&#39;t right here.   I&#39;m so sick of having to try and go through my own tedious methods of finding just what the truth is.  And even then, falling prey again to another tactic, another manipulation, or another well crafted story.    It is unbelievable  the lengths those in power seem to go to in order to keep us all &quot;happy&quot; and non questioning.  I&#39;m so fucking sick of it.  We need change.  I&#39;m thinking crowd sourced investigation.  I mean we already have a whole sub dedicated to it, but its disorganized...What if we all actually made a concerted effort to bring all of this to light.  Perhaps in a way similar to pizzagate.  I mean, look at the subscriber amount.  Over 400,000 people here.  imagine if we could get a quarter of those people working towards one common goal, how powerful of an investigation force that would be.  You say real change comes from all of us, not the ones on top, so lets try and find a way to actually make it happen...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Very good.  This is the exact same philosophy I have as well.  “Truth at any cost.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find that fact that everyone has their own different interpretation of reality to be kind of disconcerting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it also means that reality is an incredibly expansive, amalgamated, holographically-connected paradigm that includes all perspectives across the cosmos.  Yes, that can get <em>very</em> confusing, but it also means that there is almost no limit to how much we can connect and express and experience if we tap into that cosmic all-encompassing perspective.  There are as many different ways of looking at things as there are beings doing the perceiving.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should all be on the same page here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we on Earth can be on similar pages even while having different perspectives.  If we <em>can’t</em> be on the same general page, however?  Well, while that can be very frustrating, I think the optimal thing to do is to at least make sure that <em>you</em> are doing things as correctly as you possibly can regardless of what anyone else is doing one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m so sick of having to try and go through my own tedious methods of finding just what the truth is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah…well…It seems that on this plane of existence, we will continue to have to struggle and push to find the truth of any one thing.  I’m not certain that part of our job on this planet isn’t to struggle through an educational process of sorts designed to enrich our identities.</p>

<p>It seems that this process does not evolve without a struggle through the often frustrating path of learning.</p>

<p>That can often seem tedious indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And even then, falling prey again to another tactic, another manipulation, or another well crafted story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Much of what we do in this life involves a “work in progress” type of process as we struggle through difficulties and frustrations on our way from ignorance to more knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is unbelievable the lengths those in power seem to go to in order to keep us all &quot;happy&quot; and non questioning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that’s the case because they are in the business of convincing us that we need them and that they have power over us…and that takes a LOT of chicanery and deceit because this thing that they’ve gotten so many of us convinced is the truth…is actually the furthest thing from it, and we are in fact <em>much</em> more powerful than we have been made to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m so fucking sick of it. We need change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m pretty sick of it as well, and we do need change, but that change has to be internal and not external.  It has to come from <em>us</em> - and it seems too many of us are still far too convinced that we need to be guided and told what to do and how to think by powers who’ve convinced many of us that they are “above” us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m thinking crowd sourced investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that would be a great idea.  I actually listened to a talk James Corbett of the Corbett Report had about this very thing just yesterday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean we already have a whole sub dedicated to it, but its disorganized...What if we all actually made a concerted effort to bring all of this to light. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Better organization would benefit things.  Isn’t there a dedicated pizzagate sub that would…Oh…wait a minute.  Didn’t that get shut down by shit mods?  Sheesh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over 400,000 people here. imagine if we could get a quarter of those people working towards one common goal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well…we certainly can’t do that here on Reddit since we all know that if it gets too much traction it’ll get shut down - as has already happened.  We have to find another place.  There are a few alternatives that have been talked about as of late.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>imagine if we could get a quarter of those people working towards one common goal, how powerful of an investigation force that would be. You say real change comes from all of us, not the ones on top, so lets try and find a way to actually make it happen...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not at my place right now, but I know that - as I just said above here - there are various sites that seem to be getting more traction now that reddit is taking a nose dive.  I already have an account at a few of them.  Go over there and toss some of these ideas over there as well and see what happens.</p>

If you actually believe in their left-right theater then you are a perfect example of a divided and ruled sheep. They don&#39;t give a fuck about you. They tell you what you want to hear/push your emotional buttons. Been going on since civilization started. Better get the lube out because big daddy Trump is going to fuck you same as they all have. Divided and ruled. Played like kindergarten kids. So obvious, but y&#39;all Americans keep falling for it every four years. 4 years ago all the conservative faithful had Romney signs on their lawns. Romney spent a career gutting American companies and jobs and made millions, but y&#39;all cheered him on as the saviour. Why? Because he wore the team jersey and told you what you wanted to hear, same as Hillary and Bill and George and Ronald. Big shit sandwiches and y&#39;all keep eating them.</p>

<p>Very frustrating, but our presidents are not in control, nor is our Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  This is divide and conquer tactic being pushed by the left.</p>

<p>Trump cannot prosecute Hillary because he is not a prosecutor.  That would be up to his AG Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>Betsy DeVos is not pro Common Core.  <a href="https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVos/status/801505785742290945">https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVos/status/801505785742290945</a></p>

<p>The rest is just speculation about who Trump may choose for his cabinet, and butthurt about Trump not hating Jews.</p>

<p>They have been pushing this stuff all over conservative social media and the MSM for the past week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was shocked at how many bought into the Trump brand of &quot;opposition&quot; in the conspiracy community. It&#39;s honestly kind of shattered how i think of the whole movement. Now i realize that many people into this kind of thing aren&#39;t thinking nearly as independently as they thought they were.</p>

<p>Glad you&#39;re coming around, but in the future, you have to realize the people running the show will always have tricks like Trump up their sleeve.</p>

<p>I have a really bad feeling that we&#39;re looking at a major war in the near future (especially considering Trump&#39;s cabinet choices), and i honestly wonder how all the people that bought into trump&#39;s &quot;non-interventionist&quot; campaign promises are going to react.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s been a part of the establishment his entire life.</p>

<p>I fell for it, too, in 2008. Why? I was fed up with the way things were going. Bush&#39;s illegal wars. Probability of 9/11 conspiracy. McCain was obviously no alternative. And Clinton seemed an even worse candidate. Obama ignited hope in a lot of people that he would end the wars and prosecute their perpetrators, though he never actually said those things. I noticed right away that this smooth talker was more of the same, in a more &quot;progressive&quot; package. </p>

<p>I learned from my mistake, and I hope that many people will come to see this Trump fella for what he is. How many more phony populists can the American people fall for. You have to believe that the veil is falling away from bourgeois democracy (capitalism), and its rotten core is more and more exposed every day.</p>

<p>&quot;ok well, how could he become the most powerful man on the planet if the powers that be didn&#39;t want him in the first place?&quot; Then I started thinking about media manipulation and how they spun their Pro Clinton narrative so hard. Was this reverse psychology? Did we get played by the media? Has this always been the goal? </p>

<p>You&#39;re just being paranoid now. How on earth would a Donald Trump presidency benefit them? Hillary literally represents everything they stand for. Her not becoming president was a huuuuge loss for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have written here, an absolutely beautiful and eloquent response to my own.  Thank you for that.  This is what I&#39;m all about.  There are many people on this planet, and ultimately I would like the truth (no matter what it may be) to be there for everyone.  I find that fact that everyone has their own different interpretation of reality to be kind of disconcerting.  We should all be on the same page here.  But we aren&#39;t and we&#39;re far from it.  I see it, you see it, most every one if not consciously, unconsciously recognizes that something isn&#39;t right here.   I&#39;m so sick of having to try and go through my own tedious methods of finding just what the truth is.  And even then, falling prey again to another tactic, another manipulation, or another well crafted story.    It is unbelievable  the lengths those in power seem to go to in order to keep us all &quot;happy&quot; and non questioning.  I&#39;m so fucking sick of it.  We need change.  I&#39;m thinking crowd sourced investigation.  I mean we already have a whole sub dedicated to it, but its disorganized...What if we all actually made a concerted effort to bring all of this to light.  Perhaps in a way similar to pizzagate.  I mean, look at the subscriber amount.  Over 400,000 people here.  imagine if we could get a quarter of those people working towards one common goal, how powerful of an investigation force that would be.  You say real change comes from all of us, not the ones on top, so lets try and find a way to actually make it happen...</p>
