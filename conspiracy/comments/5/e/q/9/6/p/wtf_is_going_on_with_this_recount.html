       But there's no voter ID laws in California, anyone with a utility bill can register to vote, I'm not sure how you prove they are illegals other than auditing each name against a citizen database.

       And due to the illegals therein. We’ve proven 3 million illegals voted all across the country. A forced recount in any given state will start to out them. If Minnesota is recounted, for example, Trump may even win that. Half a million illegal somalis live there.

       Bad wording I suppose, she never came out in support of trump, but she was made a statement that sounded like she was slightly more in favor of trump winning then Hillary. In that she mentioned her fears on both but specifically called out Hillary on her foreign policy and the risk of them causing a war with Russia.

       She has to audit and prove the fuckery within just a couple of days in order to flip the still non-certified and closest races in Michigan and Wisconsin, although I believe it's already too late in Pennsylvania, which she absolutely has to flip along with the other 2 in order to prevail. In other words, this door has effectively already closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the best and cheapest shot at fuckery from here forward would seem the Electoral College on December 19th. 29 states, including MI and WI, have laws against
       <em>
        faithless electors
       </em>
       switching pledged votes (typically a misdemeanor and / or small fine, say $500). However, in MI the vote is vacated and the Elector replaced, so it won't really matter then if all of PA and WI Electors flip because Clinton still won't have enough votes to change the overall result. But if an Elector here and an Elector there starts flipping in more than PA, MI &amp; WI, most especially in
       <strong>
        the 21 states that have no law against faithless electors
       </strong>
       , well, then there's a path to fuckery.

       what is the end game for these people? the clock is ticking until inauguration day. If Clinton sues for a recount in the coming weeks. that will take more weeks to re-count, plus the court cases. Are they trying to cancel the inauguration? They will then be laughable hypocrites for trying to shame Trump with his comments about concession

       They for sure bought here off.  She needed 2+ million dollars and she got it all with in 24hrs?  I didn't even hear about the story till the end of the day.  More than likely the liberal elites funneled money into her to make it look grass roots and to make hillary not look like a sore loser?

        of its sense of self-preservation, or is its sense of self-preservation alive and well?

        Does this mean they have an agenda to

        Did all of these Jews just

        to reach these positions by their individual competencies, or is there a self-perpetuating Jewish culture at the upper echelons of America?

        Could the Jews

        Does it

       How the fuck can you even ask that question? Hypothetical (not a claim about jews): “Yeah, the elite bankers

        subscribe to an ideology whereby they are commanded to purposefully hyperinflate all currencies and destroy the value thereof, regardless of the benefit to the people
       </strong>
       , but so what?” is the same question that you have asked here. THE BELIEFS OF A PEOPLE–PARTICULARLY WHEN SAID GROUP IS WHOLLY IN CHARGE OF A THING (media, finance, politics, etc.)–MATTER IN REGARD TO THE ACTIONS SAID PEOPLE WILL TAKE THEREON. This needs to be said?! This
       <em>
        isn’t
       </em>
       just something that is so beneath common sense that it itself, unspoken, forms the foundation of thoughts?!

       We aren't wrapped up in it, we've been over-run with multiple forum-sliding campaigns, the other of which is the odious pedo spam. Someone somewhere dumped a freight train full of money on some PR agencies to infiltrate this sub, and neutralize it with bullshit. Where are the mods; off counting their money perhaps?

       My theory is that votes were siphoned off from her in those states to Hillary in an attempt to close the gap and take those states, but it wasn't enough. She wants her rightful vote count and her party to get the recognition for exposing the voter fraud.

       Bad wording I suppose, she never came out in support of trump, but she was made a statement that sounded like she was slightly more in favor of trump winning then Hillary. In that she mentioned her fears on both but specifically called out Hillary on her foreign policy and the risk of them causing a war with Russia.
