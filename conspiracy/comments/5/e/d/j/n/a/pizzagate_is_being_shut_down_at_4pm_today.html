<p>EDIT:
Pizzagate back up on Voat: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate</a>
There is <a href="/r/Operation_Berenstain">/r/Operation_Berenstain</a> , but I don&#39;t know the status of that sub and its moderators atm. </p>

<p>EDIT #2 A quick TLDR on Pizzagate: Wikileaks leaked Podestas emails. He&#39;s related to the Clinton foundation. In his emails, anons found a code that could be related to a child sex ring. Gross oversimplification, but that&#39;s the gist of it. There was also other forms of corruption shown in the emails, but Pizzagate revolved around the pedo ring. </p>

<p>When these mods come down on a subreddit, is a mod ID&#39;d by name? Is this the govt. squashing independent research? Might they try something similar here on r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>Obviously the global pedophile crowd has infiltrated almost everywhere. But there are still far far fewer of them than people who think they are fucking sick. More people are learning of this by the day. Truth tsunami will prove hard to stop, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it infers we should all sit back and let &quot;the authorities&quot; handle things. Or sit back and wait for another institution to protect us. It infers we should passively accept another body to tell us the conclusions of an investigation, or trust that &quot;if it was a big deal, our government would be doing something about it.&quot;</p>

<p>When in actuality, our authorities aren&#39;t going to do shit about stopping pedophilia at the highest levels. They gain more from perpetuating things like child trafficking for the sake of having useful blackmail. </p>

<p>Frankly, what happened during the Boston Bombing was the most ridiculous overstep of the executive branch that I&#39;d seen in a long time. They declared Marshal Law and shut down an entire city like a fascist government, all to pursue two dipshits who made crude explosives that anyone could make if they owned a copy of the Anarchist&#39;s Cookbook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re shutting this down because Comet Ping Pong made RL reports to the FBI and police about harassment and death threats to its owner and employees from members of communities like this one. I don&#39;t know what else you expect in this scenario.</p>

<p>I suggest taking whatever evidence has been assembled to a reputable independent media outlet, like Propublica (nonprofit, funded by donations, focuses totally on investigative journalism). They&#39;ll tell you whether there&#39;s actually a case worth investigating further, or whether you are engaging in wild speculation. And they have the expertise to actually investigate properly.</p>

<p>This subreddit and others like it are historically not much good at putting together coherent arguments that aren&#39;t based on wild speculation, though, which is the main problem with trying to do that (admittedly, that&#39;s the tradition and intent of &#39;conspiracy&#39; communities - problems arise when wild speculation is taken to be equivalent to fact, though).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given probable cause, they&#39;d hopefully open an investigation. They would not reveal this investigation publicly until conclusions have been reached (this is standard FBI policy).</p>

<p>Unsubstantiated anonymous tips are not probable cause (even if there are 5000 of them - 5000 unsubstantiated anonymous internet tips are not much different from one of them) - however, some of the circumstantial evidence here might be enough to convince officials of probable cause. That&#39;s up to them, really. If they are investigating anything, we won&#39;t know about it until there&#39;s a conclusion.</p>

<p>Death threats and harassment to employees are immediately demonstrable and, in sufficient numbers and severity, demand an immediate response from law enforcement. Which is what you&#39;re seeing here. (Though, to be sure, Comet Ping Pong is probably gaining some substantial advantage in law enforcement attention because of the owner&#39;s apparent connectedness and influence in DC, and that&#39;s not especially fair.)</p>

<p>If you&#39;re concerned about possible burying of a crime by law enforcement and government, then going through reputable independent media [like Propublica, as I mentioned above] may be your next-best-bet for drawing wider mainstream attention to the issue.</p>

For example, convicted pedo Dennis Hastert: CIA knew about his dealings since ever, and the chief of the CIA actually bugged the town home that he lent him rent-free.

<p>The CIA/FBI&#39;s holding onto pedo acts of politician is like hoarding cash for a rainy day. And with that mentality, why would they let the public loot their bank account?</p>

<p>Percent of rapes in America per 100k 25-30%

<p>Don&#39;t you dare try to act like France, England, Australia, US or any western country isn&#39;t a 1000 times more atrocious than pretty much every other nation on the planet. Assassinations, false flags, drug trafficking, child trafficking, ridiculous amounts of pedophilia, murder of millions and millions of people, brainwashing and experimentation on its own citizens and you&#39;re sitting here talking about Arabs being savages? Arabs who aren&#39;t able to advance with the rest of society because they&#39;re too busy getting bombed to the stone age over their resources? Wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it a generalization?</p>

<p>When I was reading up on Saddam&#39;s blood Quran, there was a huge amount of dislike evident - not all of it angry, a lot simply saying they would never trust anyone who would commission something like that.</p>

<p>Magic, even without blood is haram. That carries weight with every fundamentalist Muslim I&#39;ve ever spoken with.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a generalization to say that there are a lot of fundamentalist Muslim Arabs, then I really don&#39;t know what to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say I believe in magic - but it exists as practice and undertaking that practice (whether or not it has any effect) can alter the opinion of a minority of people, more in fundamentally religious circles.</p>

<p>I replied to a conversation about ways for &#39;deep politics&#39; entities to control politicians through proof of pedophilia that would destroy their reputation if revealed. Someone had expressed that some people might be able to rationalize the pedophilia. I pointed out that sizable factions of the population who may be able to rationalize the pedophilia with fundamentalism would have more trouble doing so with the inclusion of blood magic rituals in the equation.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to assume the beliefs of people and use those as a reason to adopt a smug and intellectually superior attitude, but I guess it&#39;s a free world. I&#39;ve got to ask, though - what&#39;s the point in commenting at all if you&#39;re not actually interested in the conversation? Is it the sense of superiority?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, call it a sense of superiority over people that believe the 0.0000001% chance that something in the realm of &quot;magic&quot; exists. I&#39;m superior over the mathematically illiterate I suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To repeat, because you&#39;re clearly dense:</p>

<p>Magic as in a supernatural force people can control, a la Harry Potter is not real.</p>

<p>Magic as a set of rites and rituals which have historically been performed in an attempt to invoke supernatural forces does exist, even though it has no effect.</p>

<p>There are a significant amount of people who view performing those rites and rituals as a reason to mistrust someone.</p>

<p>So yes, I do think it&#39;s a sense of superiority, and only earned by ascribing beliefs to me which I don&#39;t have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I brought up the concern for TOR&#39;s security in r/theonion or whatever TOR&#39;s subreddit is. I got ridiculed by almost everyone, all saying pretty much saying the EXACT same thing as <a href="/u/in_the_airoplane">/u/in_the_airoplane</a>. Honestly, I noped out of there real quick. To not recognize TOR&#39;s security vulnerabilities with an open mind on the TOR subreddits tells me one of two things, and my mind jumped to the worst of the two.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I deleted the post... But since that day I haven&#39;t used TOR. It was my first personal experience with (what I saw to be) invested interests pushing a narrative rather than organic discussion.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not saying anything anything bad about <a href="/u/in_the_airoplane">/u/in_the_airoplane</a> btw. I don&#39;t mean for my post to come off that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh hey, no offense taken.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a tech person in the slightest, and I remember thinking to myself, &quot;maybe I should start learning how to browse the dark web with Tor,&quot; just to learn more about a community everybody talks about. I thought I&#39;d check out the Silk Road even though I don&#39;t do drugs and have no intentions of doing so. It&#39;d just be a field trip.</p>

<p>But then I thought, &quot;ten bucks says that I&#39;ll end up in some FBI honeypot, accidentally click on CP through a wrong turn, and then end up on some list. Besides, if they&#39;re going to invest resources in probing specific users, it&#39;s probably those who know how to use Tor.&quot; So, I decided against it.</p>

<p>Then I learned about two months later I heard about the Fed&#39;s bust of the Silk Road.</p>

<p>I also later heard something about losing anonymity if you accidentally leave Javascript running. This added to my concern that unless you really know what the hell you&#39;re doing, you should probably stay away. </p>

<p>So, even though I&#39;m not distrustful of Tor for the sole reason that it came from the military, I absolutely think one shouldn&#39;t go in there pretending they can buy whatever or browse whatever and be okay.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TAILS OS is recommended even by Wikileaks. Supposed to be used in conjunction with TOR, digital currency like BitCoin, and especially using a VPN proxy chain. The last item is key. Don&#39;t forget to use search engines that aren&#39;t compromised. Duck Duck Go used to be good but ever since Yahoo flipped DDG isn&#39;t as reliable for true anonymity. Not because DDG flipped but because Yahoo could create backdoors as well plus it already let the govt send in surveillance web bots to scour yahoo emails. Which reminds me: avoid using outlook, yahoo, gmail, and AOL. There&#39;s more email client options than those four thankfully and always remember if you can&#39;t find something your looking for on line then aim for creating your own. Creation is the only freedom in the 21st century. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. I just started looking around for new ones myself after discovering Yahoo rolled over to illegal search and seizure. You know companies really don&#39;t have to stick their neck out. All Yahoo had to do was take a survey and ask their users if they would be okay with web bots ruffling through their email from the government. If the users say no then they can report back to USG and tell em sorry my users say they don&#39;t consent. It&#39;s in the articles of our constitution that government is made by the consent of the government. Anything less than that is tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you think it&#39;s only NSA? China&#39;s been doing the same thing for much much longer which is easy for them because they produce just about every single electronic which they infect with malware, backdoors, root kits, bot netted, etc... all as a present for us customers which then they use to launch large attacks against our internet in gigantic DDOS strikes. I mean people always complain about the US government but really it&#39;s ALL the governments but at least most of them won&#39;t do half the shit China does to it&#39;s people or the world. Seems like their job is to destroy as much of it as possible while seemingly killing all the ocean as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather install by running it on Linux on my tablet/phone, it looks a less complicated setup. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible on iPad/iphones. And also being p2p means lots of battery and data.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a webpage that acts as a front end. If that&#39;s secure enough, it could be an easier way for phones/tablets. Or apps could connect directly to a server like this running it</p>

<p>Anyway it looks promising but it must get much easier and mobile friendly to recommend it to non IT people: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fc1P-AEaEp8">https://youtu.be/Fc1P-AEaEp8</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment is so far beyond stupid that it will take the light from &quot;stupid&quot; several decades to get there.</p>

<p>If there are very troubling allegations being made, based upon a pile of circumstantial evidence, the solution is to ask more questions and seek more information, not to shut the whole discussion down.</p>

<p>If someone is presenting things as being factual when in reality they are not, the solution is to <em>prove them wrong</em>, using facts, not to shut the whole discussion down.</p>

<p>The fact that people of power and influence would choose to simply shut down any discussion of a controversial matter rather than exposing it to the light of day, examining it thoroughly, and demonstrating--using facts, not simply the bare assertion &quot;nuh uh, not true, because we said so&quot;--why the allegations being made are false, suggests that they do really have something to hide.</p>

<p>&quot;The remedy for bad speech is <em>more speech</em>, not enforced silence.&quot;<br/>

<p>&quot;The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.&quot;</p>

I mean that&#39;s pretty much as witch hunty as it can get, which absolutely violates Reddit terms. This shouldn&#39;t be remotely surprising that it got removed for violating one of Reddits only big rules</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to hear a voice of reason. I was a little disappointed that people actually went so far and called the comet ping pong guy and yelled into the phone they want to kill him. If the NYT was right about that. I guess it&#39;s been some kids, but still the hate, while understandable, clouded a lot of peoples judgement.</p>

<p>All things considered, clearly reddit got leaned on and caved. They need to protect the shareholders investment blah blah blah.</p>

<p>I mean the ping pong guy has sex with high officials, cooks for Hillary or at her fundraiser, and owns a cheap pizza place outside town where the Podesta Bros go for lunch. lol so absurd
clearly he makes a call and his friend help, right?</p>

<p>So there is something onto that story, clearly. Very chilling. 
Well glad I witnessed it all first hand, got lost in the rabbit hole a couple times, got sick from watching all the pedo documentaries, while the belief seeped in that indeed pedos are everywhere, next door, in politics, in the church and of course it goes to the very top.
Question is, does it get more likely to be a pedo, or getting a full blown pedo once you gain power? Or does the urge for power go along with the urge to fuck children?</p>

<p>Oh well, I start blabbering. Depressing days lately, let&#39;s go out and try to think about something nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious how anything about what happened with Twitter is related to pizzagate though. I mean, everyone knows there are tons of pedos out there that use the internet to spread cp, but how is it at all related to the specific pizzagate investigation? Just because you find some pedos while also trying to prove other people are pedos doesn&#39;t mean that they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been wanting to call bullshit on the pic with the J&#39;Adore L&#39;Enfant shirt for a long time. DC has a restaurant called Cafe L&#39;Enfant, which is named after the architect who designed Washington DC, Pierre L&#39;Enfant. Pretty sure the man wearing the shirt is the owner or one of the investors in that restaurant. In French, I love children would be &quot;J&#39;adore Les Enfants&quot; which is the correct plural form. J&#39;Adore L&#39;Enfant singular is clearly referring to the restaurant named after a DC hero and if you spent any time in DC you would know that. Theres also L&#39;Enfant Plaza and guess what its not a square for holding child slave auctions.</p>

<p>Based on the picture he looks gay? Well DC has a pretty strong gay community which is a good thing. Its pretty irresponsible to jump to the pedo conclusion without doing even a little bit of real research into other possibilities. Feels a bit like knee jerk homophobia leading you to a false conclusion.</p>

<p>To clarify: I&#39;m not saying pedophilia among the elite doesnt exist. Just want to call bullshit where I see it because allowing poorly researched circumstantial crap to stand delegitimizes all your findings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna step in here, and say that isn&#39;t exactly true. </p>

<p><em>They</em> weren&#39;t sharing CP. There was a troll on the sub, had a story about him getting his hands on two gigs of CP from a Pizza Place&#39;s computers he and a buddy of his got into. </p>

<p>As a way to prove this was the case, the troll posted ten pictures in his post. This didn&#39;t prove anything, naturally, and in the end the user backed away and was, indeed, a troll. </p>

<p>There&#39;ve been user on r/pizzagate that proposed that the guy was fully aware about the effect him posting CP on the sub could have with the sub being banned, as it had happened before or something along those lines. </p>

<p>This, I cannot confirm, but it certainly seems a possibility. </p>

<p>In the end, there was a <em>single</em> guy &#39;spreading CP&#39; in the entire sub. That&#39;s just how it is. There&#39;s no <em>they</em>, here. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not the same &#39;they&#39; you were referring to in your past remarks. &#39;They&#39; was used in the context of people spreading CP, which is simply untrue. It was a single guy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m fucking livid.  I watched that whole thing unfold, and I wish I had been more vocal in telling people to shut that shit down immediately.  There was a brief window in which they could have saved themselves, but they blew it.  </p>

<p>I liked that sub.  I spent a lot of time there.  I felt like I was watching something unfold.  I don&#39;t know what yet, I don&#39;t know if it was good or bad or what the fuck.  But it was something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ever actually read any of the pizzagate stuff?</p>

<p>It was complete tinfoil hat garbage that proved absolutely nothing.  People were obsessed with finding &quot;codewords,&quot; like speculating that the word pizza meant children and because the word pizza showed up in some emails, that, somehow, meant that there was a child kidnapping and molestation conspiracy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the biggest load of horseshit I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>And it ignored the important stuff in the emails.  The DNC colluded with major media networks.  How come no one is outraged by that?</p>

<p>I wonder if all the pizzagate stuff is a countertroll to make Trump supporters look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preemptive pardons are a thing, though. That kind of tosses a lot of that theory out of the window.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1866, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Ex parte Garland</em> that the pardon power &quot;extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.&quot; (In that case, a former Confederate senator successfully petitioned the court to uphold a pardon that prevented him from being disbarred.) Generally speaking, once an act has been committed, the president can issue a pardon at any time—regardless of whether charges have even been filed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and before someone says &gt;Slate this was written by Ken Gormley of Duquesne Law School, Harold Krent of the Chicago-Kent School of Law, and P.S. Ruckman Jr. of Rock Valley College and PardonPower.com</p>

<p>Then it turned into a list of thousands of names. The person who found all this was tweeting the FBI while doing it.</p>

<p>They got banned and deleted from twitter while other brace soils went back and confirmed the offending accounts were still there.</p>

<p>Then they changed the list to include Howard Stern employees.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard a single piece of evidence about a single trafficking ring in a single country from a single government. And neither have you. You&#39;re either part of the government propaganda to create a new domestic enemy to fight, or you&#39;re a fucking moron. </p>

<p>What makes you say this?</p>

<p>Their budgets are determined by the threats that they claim to be fighting. There are no legitimate threats in America, because crime veritably evaporated over the last thirty years. THEREFORE, they have invented the delusion of sex trafficking to justify their budget. They can&#39;t make money without an enemy to fight, so they invented one. And the only way to invent one in America, is to invent a bunch of sex traffickers. Because sex traffickers aren&#39;t humans, they&#39;re devils or something. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be suspected of it before this is all over, because it&#39;s really about killing all the poor people. If you think you&#39;re gonna stick it to the man, you have it exactly backwards.</p>

<p>None of the pedophilia rings were ever uncovered by the government. Sooo doesn&#39;t make sense to say they used those scandals to promote a cause they never did or claimed to do. In every case, Dutroux, UK Parliament, Franklin Nebraska, we have concrete proof of the government interfering in the case.</p>

<p>But, yes, I suppose if you really wanted to get a sub taken down you could use a bot or get a bunch of people to do it. I&#39;m not sure what resources the mods/admins have.  The alternative is just letting people post personal information.</p>

<p>Couple of things never sat right with me when I heard about it, and in context they&#39;re starting to make more sense:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Where the fuck did CTR get child porn from? Not like it&#39;s exactly easy to come by ... unless your boss hangs out with people who run a sex-trafficking ring dealing in children.</p></li>
<li><p>How the fuck was no one prosecuted for one of the worst crimes it&#39;s possible to commit? Like, people have been thrown in prison for inadvertent, unknowing possession of CP; how the fuck were they able to post the shit publicly and not get even a slap on the wrist?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Well, if your organization is run by people so powerful that they make the garden-variety elites look like fucking ants, I guess it&#39;s not very hard to get law enforcement to look the other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, there are big flaws with the &quot;investigation&quot; into Pizzagate. As Snopes said, &quot;we are unable to locate any substantive aspect of the claims that could be fact-checked or otherwise held up to the light to determine their veracity.&quot; That, however, doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t very real and disturbing things occurring here. The volume of information is overwhelming, and though there isn&#39;t much in the way of hard evidence, it&#39;s hard to dismiss the volume of circumstantial evidence. </p>

<p>Ultimately, this isn&#39;t narrowly about the Podestas and a pizza place in D.C. It&#39;s about exposing an underlying epidemic of child trafficking and pedophilia that seemingly exists across the globe. At this point, I wouldn&#39;t know precisely which information to point you at, but I would suggest <a href="http://pedocrats.com/mountain/">reading this for context</a> to understanding the larger issue. It is perhaps a little long, but it&#39;s well researched, and there are links to mainstream news stories about the cases within. As the writer points out, and I truly believe this at this point, &quot;we are sitting on our very own modern holocaust.&quot; I think part of the reason that people have gone so deep with pizzagate is because law enforcement across the globe seem to be, at best, unwilling to pursue or prosecute any of the parties involved. </p>

Im saving all the docs, links, images, infos and translating all to brazilian-portuguese. It&#39;s a hell of a job but it worth it.</p>

<p>This PizzaGate is in the beginning to call attention of the brazilians and my website is the first and only one to do this job. Thanks for this community.</p>

<p>Guys, any suggestions? Where do i begin and what is the best way to do this job?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah a truthful suggestion: Do things privately and with the utmost security. Looking and browsing, sharing a little on social media will let you fly under the radar,.get lost in the noise. Translating and transcribing the entire text is intelligence departmemt type stuff, and it could have a much larger impact so you are more likely to be targeted. With the sensitivity of the information and potential illegal videos you could untentionally get yourself in big trouble.</p>

<p>Other than that, Truth is important. Truth stands up to vigorous testing. So I say lets find out  the truth is and move on from there. We need a societal reconciliation and moving forward. Truth and reconciliation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> people really need to see a psychiatrist or a mental health professional. I am honestly pretty worried. How can anyone believe shit like this? You all are literally insane. Insane people think everyone is crazy but themselves. </p>

<p>You know, if you replaced a noun that appears a lot in the letter with child porn, a verb with raped, you can get alerming results. Also obvious code? If I talked about how much I liked a model train and you interpreted train as child porn, it would seem alarming right?  It&#39;s because sentences are always formed with subject-verb-object. For your own sake see a psychiatrist if you don&#39;t see the ocaam&#39;s razor+the absurdity of all of this. </p>

<p>If you really looked at everything available with open eyes, I think you would at least be kinda creeped out at all the connections. I&#39;m not talking about the kid taped to the table, which was kinda stupid, I&#39;m talking about the way people talked in these emails, it was obviously code. 
Then Assange getting offed (probably)
Then that wethepizza.com hoax with the website shutting down (Coming soon!)
There&#39;s a lot more than that, but I really think you should check it out before calling us all crazy.</p>

<p>If there was stricter Mods quickly taking <strong>all</strong> that stuff down, it would have been alright. </p>

<p>It&#39;s bad enough that people were giving full names and workplaces, without any actual evidence of crimes committed. But on more than one occasion, there was a link to the WRONG person that just had the same name. Not to mention posting proof that they are privately messaging (harassing?) some of these people on Facebook, etc</p>

<p>I also think that if they were just referring to the &quot;big names&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t have been as much of an issue. But dragging anyone that potentially worked for these people into it is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no inconsistency. Just because a certain section of a site does stupid shit doesn&#39;t mean the whole site does. r/fatpeoplehate hated fat people. So that means all of Reddit hates fat people? No? Exactly. </p>

<p>Also, places where people can talk freely without censorship does not ALWAYS mean crimes are being committed. No one is considering actually burning Comet Ping Pong to the ground or beating pedophiles in the streets. </p>

<p>I get being skeptical of those sites, but just because some people do stupid things on it doesn&#39;t mean every single user does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called free speech, we are in America. the last time I checked, we may not have the speed of north Korean internet but we are still just a wee bit more open to speech. What does it matter if people use derogatory or racist language on pol? For these teens in real life its the forbidden fruit. Something they can&#39;t do with out the anonymity of the chans. Sure some are serious but I think most just go along to get along, how do you live your life so offended by everything? Who fucking cares what anybody says? Is the information relevant? Does the source seem credible? This is all that matters. Proper punctuation, correct pronoun usage and political correctness have nothing to do with the content or its credibility. There is a Russian adage that came to mind. &quot;Don&#39;t confuse charisma with scrambled eggs&quot;. Basically it doesn&#39;t translate well but it means you are comparing apples to oranges.    </p>

<p>Today &quot;gates&quot; is a colloquial additive thrown into to things centered in a scandal that normally aren&#39;t seen as so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. Today, &quot;gate&quot; is a lazy suffix that tabloid journalists add to a name in order to sensationalise a topic. It&#39;s a kind a political <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics">dog-whistle</a> aimed at fringe groups and conspiracy theorists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To dismiss things without knowledge of what your dismissing is a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I paid attention to every &quot;-gate&quot; scandal, I&#39;d be doing nothing but reading about celebrity gossip and storms in teacups. Adding &quot;gate&quot; to a topic is how you label something as insignificant. Seriously, no real or consequential scandal has ever been labelled &quot;-gate&quot;, ever.</p>

Everyone has a full data backup of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> and a brand new message board with no doxxing rules. I don&#39;t understand why everyone is over here being so pissy about it. Continue the investigation unabated... you&#39;d be surprised how much progress you can make when your hands aren&#39;t tied by the strict rules of reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember... reddit is the whole reason this &quot;pizzagate&quot; story is all over the news feeds. Even if they are dismissing the allegations... they are still talking about it and getting people thinking. Maybe someone will come forward about past abuses they witnessed if they feel like someone out there has their back... that there is hope of it being stopped. There is no such thing as bad press... and pizzagate being shut down makes an search for &quot;reddit&quot; on google news lead to fresh stories and links to voat. </p>

<p>The shutdown turns a one off news story into something a little more substantial... another day in the headlines. Exposure is good... all it takes is one real witness to come forward to the cops when they realize the story about being locked in a cage in the basement of a pizza place won&#39;t make them sound insane. MSM no matter how biased could lead to big developments. </p>

<p>ISn&#39;t it POSSIBLE PizzaGate is bullshit? Maybe cooked up and the r/conspiracy pot stirred even?  Coincidence&#39;s occur (see Lilly, RAWilson).
But for a suspicious looking sign this whole narrative weakens considerably for example.  Add some tendentious reasoning and leaps of &#39;logic&#39;...Voila --&quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

Sorry to be rude, and I hate to call everyone who questions Pizzagate a shill, but if you&#39;ve actually looked at a lot of the emails and surrounding evidence and don&#39;t believe it, I don&#39;t really know what else to say.

    <div class="md"><p>So whenever someone uses the word cheese pizza, it means pedophilia. Also remember politicians are basically all normal people who lived lifes like normal people, got a pol sci, degree and rose the ranks. Why would this type of person be well educated in pedo terms? And there are probably multiple terms that can be code word for cp and also if cheese pizza is as common as you think it is why would they use that word? Also one of your &quot;picture evidences&quot; is literally a mom being reunited with her child after being captured by North Koreans. I don&#39;t know why mental health is so stigmatized but you should really see a psychiatrist or something if you can&#39;t see the flaws in your argument and the obvious ocaam&#39;s razor.</p>

The last item is key. Don&#39;t forget to use search engines that aren&#39;t compromised. Duck Duck Go used to be good but ever since Yahoo flipped DDG isn&#39;t as reliable for true anonymity. Not because DDG flipped but because Yahoo could create backdoors as well plus it already let the govt send in surveillance web bots to scour yahoo emails. Which reminds me: avoid using outlook, yahoo, gmail, and AOL. There&#39;s more email client options than those four thankfully and always remember if you can&#39;t find something your looking for on line then aim for creating your own.
