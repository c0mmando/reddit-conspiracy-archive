        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is from an article about the NYT fact-checking Pizzagate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, at his restaurant in Washington, D.C. <strong>Fake news websites have called it the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and John D. Podesta.</strong></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Days before the presidential election, James Alefantis, owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong, noticed an unusual spike in the number of his Instagram followers.
Within hours, menacing messages like “we’re on to you” began appearing in his Instagram feed. In the ensuing days, hundreds of death threats — one read “I will kill you personally” — started arriving via texts, Facebook and Twitter. All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis’s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here&#39;s the scenario. The emails were bait. They got dangled in front of a bunch of alt news websites knowing that some of them would take the bait. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t use just any story either. They used one that would drive people nuts and generate max emotional reaction. The more emotional people get, the less rational they become. It&#39;s a predictable reaction.</p>

<p>Problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<p>Problem? The rise of Alt News to challenge the official narrative.</p>

<p>How to get people to see Alt News as the problem? First: Use the MSM to label them as &quot;fake news&quot;. Then sucker punch them with the perfect setup.</p>

<p>That would be a fake story that goads thousands of people into making threats and behaving badly. Enter Pizzagate. </p>

<p>The story goes viral because, seriously, who could resist? They even get a celebrity to chip in and help generate even more attention (thanks Kanye)</p>

<p>Now a (possibly) innocent pizzeria owner gets subjected to harassment and online death threats because of a story carried exclusively by alt news sources. Quite possibly a story that has almost no incriminating facts or evidence of any kind.</p>

<p>Reaction: Alt News aka Fake News is a real problem that needs to be dealt with.</p>

<p>Solution: We&#39;ll see. But I&#39;m guessing the MSM will go full steam ahead and spin up a narrative that uses Pizzagate as the perfect example of &quot;Fakes News is a Problem&quot;. </p>

<p>The solution will be offered in short order. I predict that steps will be taken to marginalize alt news, cut off their cash flow and see some sort of restrictions placed on content. They might even be forced to run disclaimers stating &quot;The story you are about to read is not coming from reliable or approved sources&quot;... or something like that.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m wrong. But I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p>except we don&#39;t have proof any of the language is code. Yes, I know &quot;we want to believe&quot;. and some shit sounds weird, but that doesn&#39;t make it a fact that codes were used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suspicious is perfect. This is why this angle was chosen. I guarantee I could look through your posting history, or emails and propose a code you were using to do something illegal which could make sense if someone already distrusted you completely, as we distrust podesta and clinton.</p>

<p>edit: and I have taken the most suspicious of those emails and proposed a way they could be benign. A handkerchief could literally be a handkerchief with a map printed on it, etc... dominos was a game that guy played with the podestas, which in another email he says he lost, so he hopes the cheese gift sent to him on Dec 24th by Podesta will result in a better game. We can say &quot;oh that is too simple&quot;, but that is exactly what is written, we are trying to make more out of it than there is on the email. And yes, maybe it is all true, I can&#39;t deny that is possible, I just don&#39;t think it would fall in our lap so easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read it in sequence, you see Podesta&#39;s friend is the Rosetta Stone of two coded languages. </p>

<p>First, Podesta and his friend go out with the &quot;agent&quot; and pick a vacation rental. This shopping involves a luxury property, stocked with the product that&#39;s being pimped.  </p>

<p>The agent then follows up and contacts Podesta&#39;s friend, and says &quot;I have a handkerchief with white and black&quot; - that&#39;s the classic coded speech. </p>

<p>Podesta&#39;s friend turns around and says &quot;Do you want this handkerchief; it has a map that&#39;s pizza related?&quot;</p>

<p>So she translated &quot;handkerchief with black and white&quot; into &quot;handkerchief with map that&#39;s pizza related&quot;.  Therefore we know exactly what that means in his DC coded vernacular. </p>

<p>Furthermore we know it&#39;s a translation, because we see in the original email, the agent said nothing about pizza or a map.</p>

<p>Maybe a &quot;map&quot; is a direction to an address with an arranged interlude? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way. Those emails were from a long time ago and were released by wikileaks. For your angle to be true, assange and wikileaks would have to be in on it.

    <div class="md"><p>OK these are some valid points. But that might not stop the MSM from using this to their own advantage?</p>

<p>One thought, the emails from wikileaks are a starting point, but not conclusive. It sounds like code language for <em>something</em>. But there&#39;s nothing there that rules out all other possibilities. If it&#39;s something sexual, they could very well be talking about regular prostitutes.</p>

<p>Another thought. If I&#39;m right, we&#39;re under attack by a disinfo campaign. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, and the main aspects of the story are genuine, we&#39;ve got a bunch of sexual deviants in positions of power.</p>

<p>Either way, kind of sucks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started wondering about this a couple of days ago. Election is over... now what are we gonna do. </p>

<p>All of a sudden, it seems like 40% of new submissions are pedo related. So at first I&#39;m thinking this is what you expect when a big new story breaks.</p>

<p>But then nothing new came up. It was all speculation, exaggeration and hysterics. </p>

<p>Then I read that NYT piece less than 30 mins ago and something just clicked. You know that old saying that &quot;it&#39;s easier to fool someone than it is to convince them they&#39;ve been fooled&quot;.</p>

<p>Well I&#39;m one of those people who&#39;s always ready to admit the possibility that I&#39;ve been fooled. Goes along with being a conspiracy theorist I guess. </p>

<p>So I wrote things up as quick as I could and posted it because damage control. Maybe I&#39;m wrong. But if I&#39;m right, expect the MSM to use this to set up a fake news = serious problem narrative.</p>

They needed to plant the seed in 4chan, encourage it, encourage reddit to pick it up. Get the material to the right shit disturbers. Write a narrative that was convincing enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still mulling this over... but at this moment, I don&#39;t think that the emails were &quot;baits&quot;, given the time span that they covered, the number of correspondents involved, and the frequency of the so-called &quot;code words&quot; that seemed strangely out of context WRT the overall topics of the messages.</p>

<p>Personally, I am convinced that there are massive pedo rings operating across the globe, and that some of the wealthiest, most powerful and influential personalities among us are entwined in these rings. See Jimmy Saville, Dennis Hastert, Clement Freud, and others... </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cyamj/roy_cohn_trumps_mentor_told_nypd_det_james/da0nsee/">As noted elsewhere</a>, I have pondered whether the apparent pedo phenomenon among the elites goes beyond the realms of <em>&quot;sick, twisted perversion of bored, rich fucks&quot;</em>, and is actually used as an unimaginable and inescapable tool to BLACKMAIL prominent political, business and celebrity figures into cooperating with the aims of the Shadow Government.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is worth noting that <strong>every MSM story</strong> I have seen referencing Comet Ping Pong has flatly stated that allegations of the restaurant being a PEDO-HUB are <strong>UNTRUE</strong> - though NONE of these sources back their statements with any PRETENSE of any relative investigation - whether internal or external - to qualify that statement.</p>

<p>FAKE NEWS, ANYONE?</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t these sweeping, categorical DENIALS raise red flags in and of themselves? If these accused were Catholic Priests, for example, would the media remain silent? Write exculpatory articles that effectively attack the investigators? Would they authoritatively announce that all allegations are <strong>UNTRUE</strong> without citing any investigation whatsoever?</p>

<p>This shit smells like fish - ROTTEN fish.</p>

<p>The evidence I have seen regarding the Podesta brothers (and their chums&#39;) implicit involvement with pedos is more than enough to raise an eyebrow, and the fact that the MSM has formed a harmonious chorus offhandedly dismissing these allegations is indicative of journalistic negligence at best - and quite possibly, coordinated collusion to downplay allegations, and to paint those implicated as &quot;victims&quot; of the elusive and enigmatic &quot;alt right&quot;.</p>

<p>You were saying...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem? The rise of Alt News to challenge the official narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is THE primary problem. FORCE is not a &quot;problem&quot; as long as it can be predictably controlled. However, when FORCE (of any kind) is uncontrollable and unpredictable, it becomes a THREAT. Unfettered communication through Social Media and &quot;Alt News&quot; has manifested itself AS A THREAT to those who hold and wish to maintain CONTROL. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How to get people to see Alt News as the problem? First: Use the MSM to label them as &quot;fake news&quot;. Then sucker punch them with the perfect setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throw in a vicious attack by some &quot;crazy Alt Right&quot; dude and you&#39;re good to go! (Blood and guts sells - <em>&quot;if it bleeds, it leads.&quot;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be a fake story that goads thousands of people into making threats and behaving badly. Enter Pizzagate.****</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, who are the people that are making the &quot;threats&quot;? Are they genuine PISSED OFF ASSHOLES, or are they recently unemployed CTR assholes who have been reassigned to a different mission?</p>

<p>The primary goal has not changed: Deceive and delude the masses. Whether it be to &quot;Vote For Hillary&quot; or to &quot;Ignore those Men Behind the Curtain&quot; is but a minor adjustment. </p>

<p>IN CLOSING, I am inclined, at the moment, to entertain the idea that there IS at least SOME substantive value to the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; allegations, and that this has opened a can of worms that, left unattended, might pose a SERIOUS THREAT to personalities who play essential roles in the construction of American &quot;democracy&quot;. The offhanded / unsubstantiated statements by the MSM that all allegations are <strong>UNTRUE</strong> should provide a clue.</p>

<p>Is there a coordinated and premeditated assault against &quot;Alt Media&quot;? </p>

<p>Damn right there is. The lockstep MSM response is TOO MUCH to be coincidental... <strong>A can of worms has been opened that threatens the VERY CORE of the metastatic corruption</strong>, and those that stand to lose can be expected to fight like the cornered animals that they are.</p>
