    <div class="md"><p>This may SEEM off-topic but may I please add that for those of us who are experiencing ME the changes in the arts are sly, covert statements.  The Thinker by Rodin now looks like a man who is in a passive reverie - not actively thinking.  Mona Lisa&#39;s mouth is a smirk.  It feels like they are rubbing it in.  The end of We Are the Champions, in case you&#39;ve never heard it, is one of rock and roll&#39;s money shots and people are compelled to finish the song by singing it themselves.  I&#39;m not sure of the meaning or intention in that one.  I know this isn&#39;t the ME sub but you guys are thinkers and have the ability to look at the big picture - so maybe just keep what I&#39;ve noticed in the back of your minds, even if you don&#39;t believe the ME is real.  It&#39;s twisted and vicious, too.  And I&#39;m going to check out McGowan&#39;s books after Thanksgiving.  I don&#39;t know about you guys but reading through all the material on the pizza sub has left me in a crazy headspace and I need to put it away for a couple of days. </p>

But there are some landmark cultural things that ARE different and I think those things are meaningful.  I just can&#39;t determine the meaning by myself. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quantum physics, like parallel universes, or some mind/memory experiments - but significant numbers of people remember things in the same, specific ways - ways that are not real now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing.  I&#39;ve seen this Laurel Canyon theory mentioned on here but never had a link or the time to dig in to it.</p>

<p>It actually fits nicely with and explains to myself a personal theory I&#39;ve held for a long time...and that is that the Grateful Dead sound guy Owsley Stanley (who had no chemistry experience) allegedly synthesized most of the 1960&#39;s LSD from his apartment bathroom (in the beginning at least).  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always suspected he must have been a distribution front for the CIA, and the Laurel Canyon theory which hypothesizes that the &quot;hippie&quot; movement was grafted onto the anti-war movement as controlled opposition gives credence to my theory </p>

<p>wait... lemme guess:  suicide ?? ;)</p>

<p>edit:  <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/David_McGowan">an unusually aggressive form of lung cancer</a></p>

<p>...no surprise as he wrote <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2015/05/23/mcgowan-battles-cancer/">&quot;9/11 WAS A LIE -- ON 9/12&quot;</a></p>

<p>/apparently, the truth causes cancer :&lt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok I have no problem with that, I know his brother, never heard about his sister much. So, why is she issuing takedown notices on non-published articles? Dave certainly never did that. I kind of doubt that is how he&#39;d want his legacy used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Non-published articles?  I would like to see the existence of those.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the unauthorized publishing of McGowan&#39;s newsletters, here&#39;s one example (if you really claim not to &quot;get it&quot;) of why she should issue takedown notices:</p>

<p>A specific (and current) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Redditor put up a slick, glossy website of McGowan&#39;s writings including all his newsletters.</p>

<p>That website URL was written as <strong>&quot;futile.work&quot;</strong>.  Teee hee hee said the Sunstein JTRIG pigs.  Clever psy-op in the name.</p>

<p>Further, the website did not present Dave&#39;s newsletters in numerical order as he published them.  Teee hee haw haw LOL, see how we can omit the numbers so the reader doesn&#39;t realize there&#39;s one missing?  Gosh, his daughter is so mean.</p>

<p>Finally, the essays were not transcribed <em>as Dave wrote them</em>.  Paragraph breaks were turned into walls-of-text.  <em>Key words, sentences &amp; phrases were missing or moved.</em></p>

<p>But golly, what a mean angry daughter Dave bequeathed his life&#39;s work to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uh you are really going too far with your characterization of what I said. But ok, as long as she keeps them up somewhere (non-published meaning no money is being lost by them being reposted). I think it should just be open sourced and preserved properly, but who am I to say. I&#39;ll tell you this, that website and the actions associated are about as far from what I know of Dave as possible. I guess either way we lost the magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First found Dave&#39;s website in 2004 when I decided to see if Peak Oil was bullshit.  My life would never be the same.  </p>

<p>And I remember clearly that morning in 2005 when a David McGowan murdered his family and then himself, or so it was alleged. </p>

<p>At first I thought it was him and that They had done him for all that he&#39;d written.  It wasn&#39;t until a few weeks went by that our Dave resurfaced.  Needless to say I was seriously shook up until that point.  </p>

<p>I also clearly remember on that morning how the official police spokesman first said the brother of that McGowan was the killer but then later reports said nothing about.  </p>

<p>For a while after Dave resurfaced I wondered if They were sending him a message by killing an innocent family.  </p>

<p>Ultimately it turned out the victim was a LEO and, what do you know, the whole story was actually about corrupt cops killing an honest cop.</p>

<p>Peace to Dave, the greatest American writer, ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What tripped me out the most about the Laurel Canyon series was Jim Morrison.  The poster boy for the anti war/ free love movement had a father who was the General in charge of The Gulf of Tonkin incident, a major false flag used as an excuse to pull the USA into the Vietnam War.  Typical Illuminati formula of thesis/ antithesis/ synthesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the conversation he imagines in response to the common thing pro-Apollo nutters say: &quot;Russia can&#39;t go to the moon because it&#39;s expensive&quot; or something. And he makes this fake little conversation between two Russians:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boris: Comrade Ivan, there is terrible news today: the Yankee imperialists have beaten us to the Moon. What should we do?</p>

<p>Ivan: Let&#39;s just shit-can our entire space program.</p>

<p>Boris: But comrade, we are so close to success! And we have so much invested in the effort!</p>

<p>Ivan: Fuck it! If we can&#39;t be first, we aren&#39;t going at all.</p>

<p>Boris: But I beg of you comrade! The moon has so much to teach us, and the Americans will surely not share with us the knowledge they have gained.</p>

<p>Ivan: Nyet!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really is crazy to think we ever went. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave was brilliant and brave.  He knew that 9/11 was a lie the day it happened and had published an article about it by 9/12/01.  That can be read <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2015/05/23/mcgowan-battles-cancer/">here</a>. </p>

<p>His daughter has posted much of his work here:  <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/">http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/</a></p>

<p>I recommend that newcomers begin with <em>Wagging the Moondoggie</em>.  Especially if you still believe that we put men on the moon in the 1960s.  </p>
