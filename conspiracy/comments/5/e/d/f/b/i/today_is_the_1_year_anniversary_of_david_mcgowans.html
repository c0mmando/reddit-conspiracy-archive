       He was a truth-seeker, a hero to me and many others. I personally believe he was murdered through weaponized cancer for delving too deeply into the darker facets of our world.

       If you have the opportunity, please check out his phenomonal books including Programmed to Kill (Serial killers being used as cover for covert hits) and Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon (the dark origin of the hippie movement).

       This may SEEM off-topic but may I please add that for those of us who are experiencing ME the changes in the arts are sly, covert statements.  The Thinker by Rodin now looks like a man who is in a passive reverie - not actively thinking.  Mona Lisa's mouth is a smirk.  It feels like they are rubbing it in.  The end of We Are the Champions, in case you've never heard it, is one of rock and roll's money shots and people are compelled to finish the song by singing it themselves.  I'm not sure of the meaning or intention in that one.  I know this isn't the ME sub but you guys are thinkers and have the ability to look at the big picture - so maybe just keep what I've noticed in the back of your minds, even if you don't believe the ME is real.  It's twisted and vicious, too.  And I'm going to check out McGowan's books after Thanksgiving.  I don't know about you guys but reading through all the material on the pizza sub has left me in a crazy headspace and I need to put it away for a couple of days.

       Sorry. Mandela Effect. Where the world is different. You get people on that thread discussing little things that may or may not be different, like corporate logos and such. But there are some landmark cultural things that ARE different and I think those things are meaningful.  I just can't determine the meaning by myself. I don't know if it's quantum physics, like parallel universes, or some mind/memory experiments - but significant numbers of people remember things in the same, specific ways - ways that are not real now.

       <em>
        fuck me

       did it ever add an amazing amount of context to it all. Really quite an amazing work. Would love to read the book and see what (if anything) is different from his original essays

       Thanks for sharing.  I've seen this Laurel Canyon theory mentioned on here but never had a link or the time to dig in to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually fits nicely with and explains to myself a personal theory I've held for a long time...and that is that the Grateful Dead sound guy Owsley Stanley (who had no chemistry experience) allegedly synthesized most of the 1960's LSD from his apartment bathroom (in the beginning at least).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always suspected he must have been a distribution front for the CIA, and the Laurel Canyon theory which hypothesizes that the "hippie" movement was grafted onto the anti-war movement as controlled opposition gives credence to my theory

       Great man, phenomenal mind and talent. Truly missed by all who shared in his wisdom, wit and tenacity. To honour a man of this magnitude is to carry on his work and take it to the next level. I think it can be safely said that Dave selflessly served humanity and was dedicated singly to seeking justice, rooting out evil and standing up for the common man.

       His daughter Alissa was given control of his work and I do admit she has revamped the site a great deal, but there's some concern that she wasn't the right choice to continue his legacy. We'll see how things play out.

       ok I have no problem with that, I know his brother, never heard about his sister much. So, why is she issuing takedown notices on non-published articles? Dave certainly never did that. I kind of doubt that is how he'd want his legacy used.

       Non-published articles?  I would like to see the existence of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking about the unauthorized publishing of McGowan's newsletters, here's one example (if you really claim not to "get it") of why she should issue takedown notices:
      </p>
      <p>
       A specific (and current)
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       Redditor put up a slick, glossy website of McGowan's writings including all his newsletters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That website URL was written as
       <strong>
        "futile.work"
       </strong>
       .  Teee hee hee said the Sunstein JTRIG pigs.  Clever psy-op in the name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the website did not present Dave's newsletters in numerical order as he published them.  Teee hee haw haw LOL, see how we can omit the numbers so the reader doesn't realize there's one missing?  Gosh, his daughter is so mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the essays were not transcribed
       <em>
        as Dave wrote them
       </em>
       .  Paragraph breaks were turned into walls-of-text.
       <em>
        Key words, sentences &amp; phrases were missing or moved.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But golly, what a mean angry daughter Dave bequeathed his life's work to.

       uh you are really going too far with your characterization of what I said. But ok, as long as she keeps them up somewhere (non-published meaning no money is being lost by them being reposted). I think it should just be open sourced and preserved properly, but who am I to say. I'll tell you this, that website and the actions associated are about as far from what I know of Dave as possible. I guess either way we lost the magic.

       First found Dave's website in 2004 when I decided to see if Peak Oil was bullshit.  My life would never be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I remember clearly that morning in 2005 when a David McGowan murdered his family and then himself, or so it was alleged.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I thought it was him and that They had done him for all that he'd written.  It wasn't until a few weeks went by that our Dave resurfaced.  Needless to say I was seriously shook up until that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also clearly remember on that morning how the official police spokesman first said the brother of that McGowan was the killer but then later reports said nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a while after Dave resurfaced I wondered if They were sending him a message by killing an innocent family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately it turned out the victim was a LEO and, what do you know, the whole story was actually about corrupt cops killing an honest cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace to Dave, the greatest American writer, ever.

       What tripped me out the most about the Laurel Canyon series was Jim Morrison.  The poster boy for the anti war/ free love movement had a father who was the General in charge of The Gulf of Tonkin incident, a major false flag used as an excuse to pull the USA into the Vietnam War.  Typical Illuminati formula of thesis/ antithesis/ synthesis.

       His series "wagging the moondoggie" made me see through the false moon landings. When you lay out all the details the way he did, it starts to look like it's crazy to believe we actually did go to the moon.

       I love the conversation he imagines in response to the common thing pro-Apollo nutters say: "Russia can't go to the moon because it's expensive" or something. And he makes this fake little conversation between two Russians:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Boris: Comrade Ivan, there is terrible news today: the Yankee imperialists have beaten us to the Moon. What should we do?
       </p>
       <p>
        Ivan: Let's just shit-can our entire space program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boris: But comrade, we are so close to success! And we have so much invested in the effort!
       </p>
       <p>
        Ivan: Fuck it! If we can't be first, we aren't going at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boris: But I beg of you comrade! The moon has so much to teach us, and the Americans will surely not share with us the knowledge they have gained.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ivan: Nyet!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It really is crazy to think we ever went.

       Dave was brilliant and brave.  He knew that 9/11 was a lie the day it happened and had published an article about it by 9/12/01.  That can be read

       I recommend that newcomers begin with
       <em>
        Wagging the Moondoggie
       </em>
       .  Especially if you still believe that we put men on the moon in the 1960s.

       would seem to be a good place to post about the emerging pedogate scandals, since people are in the midst of discovering that we live in one. I only signed up for redddit because of pizzagate.

       Thanks for posting this.   I've never heard of this man but have spent the last 2 days reading his articles and,  just wow.  My head and heart both hurt now but reading about the pedophocracy sure was enlightening.  And I am pissed!
