<p>I&#39;m on mobile, but wasn&#39;t there a law passed (or revoked, can&#39;t remember) that essentially now allows the US government to shape the news to their liking, i.e. propaganda?</p>

<p>The journalist who died in the electric car accident a few years back had been investigating it, if I remember correctly, can&#39;t recall the guy&#39;s name.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As <a href="/u/Defendor">/u/Defendor</a> mentions below, it was the repealing of the Smith-Mundt Act: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into this for a school paper and I think it was the repealing of the Smith-Mundt act. The Smith-Mundt act was put in place to prevent US government produced propaganda meant for foreign audiences being broadcast domestically. This is off the top of my head, I can look up the correct sources another time.</p>

<p>There was also a supreme court case, if I remember correctly, that basically said that the news has no legal obligation to tell the truth. I think this directly was related to Fox News at the time. Again don&#39;t have a source on me this second.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="/u/Some-Random-Chick">/u/Some-Random-Chick</a> provided source on my second claim and I&#39;m wrong!</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that&#39;s what Reddit does site-wide to mentions of GMOs and <em>especially</em> vaccines. Holy shit that&#39;s a touchy one. Try going into the site&#39;s main sub on parenting and mentioning anything that remotely questions this country&#39;s insane vaccination schedule. </p>

<p>Downvote to oblivion, in addition to calling such parents negligent, dangerous, etc. There are countless parents (possibly shills) who ask things like, &quot;should I ask friends and family to present their vaccination records before visiting?&quot; Then others chime in how they do the same, or how they&#39;ve removed close friends from their life because they&#39;re not vaccinated. It&#39;s absolutely crazy. </p>

<p>When the Disneyland &quot;measles outbreak&quot; happened I thought, &quot;oh shit, here we go again.&quot; The fanaticism surrounding the subject can only be from a manufactured place. To not even permit civil discourse on the matter is just... it can&#39;t be real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. The masses have been so well falsely educated to believe the pharmaceutical companies are God&#39;s it&#39;s sad. Pharmaceuticals are the 3rd leading cause of death in the US behind cancer and heart disease. I went on that Disneyland measles outbreak post and advocated in a true democracy freedom of choice for what can or cannot be put in a citizens body and the Masses (who are asses) went ballistic crazy on me. They began swearing at me that I was against the government and big pharmacy and they are there to save us all. It just went on and on. They just don&#39;t get that money rules 99% of all decisions made and not &quot;their&quot; well being. It&#39;s profits before people. Always. 
I try to avoid those subs now because the masses are brain dead and it is useless saying anything. They personally need something happen in their life to change them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with an increasing number of things lately, I&#39;m willing to be convinced that mainstream conceptions of reality are fabrications.  But what&#39;s the biggest fear surrounding vaccines?  Is the fear that they contain something we don&#39;t know about?  Is it the fact that they&#39;re heavily forced upon people?  Are you against the profitability of the whole thing?</p>

<p>What about herd immunity and the success around polio for example?  I&#39;ve known one person whose parents were against vaccinations, and I distinctly remember her being incredibly sick every year.  The whole science of vaccines is that it skips the process of being sick and developing antibodies by feeding your immune system a weakened version of the virus. </p>

<p>Very much open to new ideas, but I&#39;ve never heard a full and compelling argument on the subject of vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with an increasing number of things lately, I&#39;m willing to be convinced that mainstream conceptions of reality are fabrications.  But what&#39;s the biggest fear surrounding vaccines?  Is the fear that they contain something we don&#39;t know about?  Is it the fact that they&#39;re heavily forced upon people?  Are you against the profitability of the whole thing?</p>

<p>What about herd immunity and the success around polio for example?  I&#39;ve known one person whose parents were against vaccinations, and I distinctly remember her being incredibly sick every year.  The whole science of vaccines is that it skips the process of being sick and developing antibodies by feeding your immune system a weakened version of the virus. </p>

<p>Very much open to new ideas, but I&#39;ve never heard a full and compelling argument on the subject of vaccines. </p>
