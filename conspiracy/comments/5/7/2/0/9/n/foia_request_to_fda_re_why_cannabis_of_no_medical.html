       Well everyone, the FDA finally gave a response to my FOIA request for when, why and how they made the decision that Cannabis was "of no medical value" which was used to inform the DEA to keep Cannabis on Schedule I of the drug code.
      </p>
      <p>
       I received a CD in the mail today with the FOIA response files.  It was not exactly what I asked for, but it is something.  It gives us a starting point to then ask for documentation on the people and very specific studies used in that decision.  This is everything they gave me:

       At first glance, I believe they cherry picked and made arbitrary decisions, esp. in terms of 'safety' and 'potential for abuse', because it's widely not considered physicially addictive (I'm an ex cigarette smoker, I know addiction, and I can tell you I picked up and put down pot 3 times in my life with no bad side effects...it's less addictive than coffee); and it's well less 'harmful' on a WHO chart of harm than ALL of the illegal drugs with the exception of LSD and mushrooms which are even less harmful (I personally think LSD is much more harmful than cannabis physically and psychologically).  It's worthy to note on the safety level mushrooms are dead last.  But I'm muddying the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       These documents give you names of people who made these decisions, and gives some insight into why these decisions were made.  I'm inviting you into a community effort to make sense of this and come up with additional documentation that we can continue to FOIA in order to get to the bottom of which 'evidence' was considered, which 'actual studies' and what documentation was evaluated to determine that cannabis satistfied the 8 Factor criteria.

      </p>
      <p>
       I want to point out something unrelated that is kind of strange.  "8 Factor" methodology is how they evaluated this, yet "Factor 8" is the name of the hemophiliac blood clotting factor and the name of the
       <strong>
        <em>

       --which, through our efforts here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , a redditor made this film available again on youtube--and with the Clintons we know about Mena Ak, the importation of competitive narcotics being narcotrafficed by the Fed itself into the US.  You may think this is symbolomania, but I tend to see things differently, synchronicities like these seem notable.
      </p>
      <p>
       More specifically, I feel like it's kind of this big occultic mockery trip, by the fed, to play around with names and numbers to make sure we know that we're being bullied here, that there's an active and extreme willingness to maintain themselves as an Advanced Persistive Threat to the mind, body and sensibility to the public.   I know they are playing around with numbers because they did the same thing with my FOIA request, which was--if you have kept up with this whole thing from the beginning--was a duplicate request
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally it was given foia request number 2016-7072 and then when we revised the request over several conversations they changed the name to 7270, and I was thinking this was done to throw me off.  It was probably done just to claim a number in the future by moving things around, but therein is the trick saying institutionally, they are used to doing that, instead of just picking a the next new foia number as it's available (the 'take a number'...'take another number')

       The FDA are nazis confirmed.   Just kidding.  That's ungrateful, they actually delivered, though it took them a while, it doesn't help much, and seems to say, "because we said so.".  What do you think?

       Good job! I can't help you with the docs, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them playing with the numbers. They are making it a legal issue. Intentionally creating typos to throw off further requests or investigation. This would be considered obstruction of justice, if the shoe was on the other foot. The more interactions you have with them the worse it is going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what kind of resources you are dedicating to this mission. Have you consulted a lawyer? Because the shit is going to get deep. The feds have a death grip on the drug trade. The money gained is over a trillion every year off drugs being illegal, if you consider big pharma's stake.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are fighting for a noble cause friend. I wish you luck. May your sails be full and seas be calm.

       I agree.  It's abusive psychology.  A type of conscious magic.  Art as sorcery.  When you start to "have the eyes to see it", by your notice and acknowledgment, it no longer has effect on you. When you think it doesn't have effect, you're half way there.  If and when you are the type of denialist who thinks there's nothing to these symbols and abuses that they can be ignored, you'll notice those people are the most deeply entrained.  They wear

       jackets thinking it's so cute--a heartagram--they have skulls on their bumper, effectively appropriating the ophiothanaterosism / cult of death tropes thinking it's just 'style' and isn't corrupting them from within.
