       Our 4.5 year old dog recently became sick out of nowhere and died a week later. My mother in law has been researching like a mad woman and turns out our pup showed signs of adverse effects of vaccination.  She was vaccinated a week before she got sick,  receiving three vaccines.  My MIL has contacted one of the manufacturers,  told them our story,  and now they want to settle for $1k of qualifying expenses for when our dog was in ICU,  in exchange for us to drop the allegation. We declined,  and are awaiting their response...anyone else ever go through something similar?

       A case for what?  Pets are considered property in the legal system.  Value of dog?  Like $50 in court.  Seriously.

       Honestly, I would take the settlement, but it's a good idea to consult a lawyer.  I suspect they will tell you the same re: the settlement.

       Tell them you are going to the media and plan on suing for at least $100,000. Record the conversation. Go to a lawyer with the tape. Have him start a class action, you know this isn't the first case. When the class action is over and you've signed multiple NDA's, leak the info on wikileaks for your fellow humans. Thanks in advance.

       Demanding a disproportionate amount of money will not work in your favor.

       Pets are considered property legally. This will most likely end up as a property damage case, maybe with some emotional damages thrown on top.

       Consult a lawyer, he may squeeze some more money out of them, which he will take a slice from off course.

       They already communicated with the company and were offered a settlement. Suggesting you will take less than a specific amount could very well work in your favor. OP could easily get over $100k without it ever touching a court. Consulting a lawyer is great advice, bad advice is asking

       $100k for property damage? What dog has a value of $100k? On what grounds can they ask for such a figure? And will this include a non disclosure agreement? I'm pretty sure it will.

       It seems OP is more interested into exposing vaccine risks than money. The best approach is dependent on his interests.

       Avoiding a recall, inspection or negative public outrage...$100k is nothing. Go slip and fall in walmart, that's a guaranteed $25k. NDA make wikileaks great. Can't prove you broke your NDA..lol. wonk/wonk..must have been a legal intern or someone left it in the copier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say OP should try and get all the money he/she can, then sign the NDA, release the info via wikileaks anonymously later. win/win

       In some states it's *illegal to record a phone conversation so the recording would be useless.  Also, as
       <a href="/r/gatekeeper">

       says, don't ever communicate with anyone you plan to take legal action against before talking to a lawyer.

       You can privately record your own phone conversations. Federal law is one-party consent.  Sure, some states still have backwards laws that don't apply, like I think it's still illegal for blacks to travel  on Sunday nights in Mississippi? Marbles, Dominoes, and yo-yos are also banned on Sundays in a handful of states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not risky at all to record your phone calls and you have no obligation to inform the other party that you are recording them...
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk to a lawyer about it.

       Good read.  Really intended to protect criminals(mafia) from warrantless eavesdropping by the police/government(mafia)...and not really applicable to private citizens recording their private phone conversations. Also, I'm pretty sure federal law supersede state laws when using satellite communications?

       Anything concerning the inappropriate death of a pet is something worth throwing down over, and I sincerely mean that.

       Tell them you'd rather contact journalists and have them publish a juicy story about vaccine induced death and hush money. Tell them you've emailed the producer of Vaxxed. Tell them the companionship with your dog was worth more than $1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dog was sick after the 3 vaccinations. They push it hard at the hospitals with a free guilt trip included. And then an officer shows up to your door a few months later demanding pet registration fees and urging you to get the lil' one neutered or spayed. The whole experience is pretty fucking annoying.

       As someone who has worked with dogs for the past 10 years, and continues to do so, I urge you to go see a lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dogs are primarily treated as property, however it is totally dependant of the judge and litigation teams involved. I've known people who have settled with major pet food companies for their dogs being ill. Not dead, ill. And we're talking hundreds of thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines are sold upon commission, which is why the biologist is pushing the agenda so greatly. The agenda is also pushed greatly and indoctrinated while these hopeful biologists/veterinary doctors are in school. I know first hand as my ex went to the top school in Canada for veterinary medicine. While she was learning I couldnt help myself but learn and study with her even though I'm more of a behavioural person with dogs.
I've also worked for a breeder/trainer for five years, and was a liaison between her, her 40 dogs and the vet who over saw the health and well being of her dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of information that big pharma(shocking I know) is trying to bury about the canine health industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime example:Spaying/Neutering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every vet in the world will tell you to do this A.S.A.P and that it's for the better health of the animal. They will claim that it lowers the risk of cancer, yadda yadda yadda. When in fact, it can almost double in the risk of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: the guidelines to spay/neuter a dog at 6mos was introduced by the company who makes the general anaesthetic to put the dog under. That was the youngest age that the dog could be put under to ensure that they could be brought back out of it. That was some 30 years ago, and even against advancement in medications and anaesthetics the 6mos rule is still followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The operation on a male dog requires 15 minutes of the vets time, and the operation for a female requires 30-45 minutes. They make a lot of profit from spay/neuters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ran off, I'm sorry for your loss, I've lost many over the years and it never is easy. I feel for you and your family. Please advise a lawyer.

       I'm going to suggest that if you lawyer up, you'll end up with loosing more than you'll gain. There is always risk in vaccinations but its a higher risk not to vaccinate. Its understandable that your emotions are wrecked, you lost a beloved pet and your decision making is likely to be affected. If you think you'll get rich from a lawsuit on this tragedy, however, you aren't being realistic. If its not too late ask for reimbursement for the medical expenses and cost of the animal.take what you can get, otherwise you won't get anything. The courts don't view animal life the same as a human life...you lost property not a child.

       To sue you'd need to not only prove it was the vaccines that did it, but that the manufacturer hadn't taken every reasonable precaution.

       thought sound bad, but you're being extremely selfish here. vaccinations are necessary for household pets - ESPECIALLY if you take them to dog parks or have other pets.
      </p>
      <p>
       so for you to stymie and obstruct the field of veterinary vaccination research is pretty tasteless. there are hundreds of dogs waiting for you down at the pound, it's not like you can't go get another one.

       Tasteless? That's rich considering you just told someone who's dog just passed away to suck it up. Dogs are a whole lot more than just pets to most people. Clearly you don't understand that, though being a "wildlife biologist" you probably should.

       Vaccine "science" started in the mid 1700's some barber/apothecary drained the puss from boils from a sick person  and injected into his son, he didn't get sick right away so he felt he had immunized him. His son died shortly thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "science" predates the quackery of phrenology, and was started by a man that thought bleeding you with leaches cured people.

       Simply taking a $1000 to keep his mouth shut would stymie plenty, actually. If you're truly for the progression of science, wouldn't you want to get to the bottom of why a vaccine would kill an otherwise healthy animal? I don't think you win many arguments over vaccine efficacy when it may actually kill the animal. Or does that pad those stats in your favor? I doubt many dead dogs contract and spread canine distemper around the local dog park.  Or does that hurt your narrative to just vaccinate everything cuz they tell you it's fine then belittle the collateral damage and their families for speaking out? A real sign of character shows compassion to people during the roller coaster ride of life we are all on. You're acting like a fanatic of a sports team towards a bitter rival after winning the championship. This isn't a contest.
Edit: BTW, genius....it's really hard to take someone seriously that has a post on Reddit of a pants hanger clipped to her enormously gross tits.

       Maybe they can pinpoint what the complication was and refine thier vaccine so it has a less chance of adverse effects while still providing protection? Maybe the solution they find can be carried over in other vaccines as well improving the whole industry?

       You're a scientist. When a test or process goes wrong you would want to figure out why wouldn't you? Then you do what you can to correct the problem.

       All of what you stated should have been done in a lab before releasing the product to the market. Testing vaccines on the public is deplorable. A bit reminiscent of nazi germany doing experiments on unwilling participants.

       You weren't a victim. You went home with him and never said anything when he pulled his erect penis out. Instead, you "rolled with it". Then, he asked you to "kiss it" and instead of saying no or simply leaving...you somehow sucked his dick. Then, 3 hours later, you regret your poor decision making skills, and have the poor guy arrested for a sex crime. You're so fucked you don't even know it. Sick, entitled bitch.
