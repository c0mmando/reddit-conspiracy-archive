<p>A case for what?  Pets are considered property in the legal system.  Value of dog?  Like $50 in court.  Seriously.</p>

<p>Honestly, I would take the settlement, but it&#39;s a good idea to consult a lawyer.  I suspect they will tell you the same re: the settlement.</p>

<p>Good read.  Really intended to protect criminals(mafia) from warrantless eavesdropping by the police/government(mafia)...and not really applicable to private citizens recording their private phone conversations. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure federal law supersede state laws when using satellite communications?</p>

<p>My dog was sick after the 3 vaccinations. They push it hard at the hospitals with a free guilt trip included.

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has worked with dogs for the past 10 years, and continues to do so, I urge you to go see a lawyer.</p>

<p>Dogs are primarily treated as property, however it is totally dependant of the judge and litigation teams involved. I&#39;ve known people who have settled with major pet food companies for their dogs being ill. Not dead, ill. And we&#39;re talking hundreds of thousands. </p>

<p>Vaccines are sold upon commission, which is why the biologist is pushing the agenda so greatly. The agenda is also pushed greatly and indoctrinated while these hopeful biologists/veterinary doctors are in school. I know first hand as my ex went to the top school in Canada for veterinary medicine. While she was learning I couldnt help myself but learn and study with her even though I&#39;m more of a behavioural person with dogs.
I&#39;ve also worked for a breeder/trainer for five years, and was a liaison between her, her 40 dogs and the vet who over saw the health and well being of her dogs.</p>

<p>There is a lot of information that big pharma(shocking I know) is trying to bury about the canine health industry.</p>

<p>Prime example:Spaying/Neutering. </p>

<p>Every vet in the world will tell you to do this A.S.A.P and that it&#39;s for the better health of the animal. They will claim that it lowers the risk of cancer, yadda yadda yadda. When in fact, it can almost double in the risk of cancer.</p>

<p>Fun fact: the guidelines to spay/neuter a dog at 6mos was introduced by the company who makes the general anaesthetic to put the dog under. That was the youngest age that the dog could be put under to ensure that they could be brought back out of it. That was some 30 years ago, and even against advancement in medications and anaesthetics the 6mos rule is still followed.</p>

<p>The operation on a male dog requires 15 minutes of the vets time, and the operation for a female requires 30-45 minutes. They make a lot of profit from spay/neuters.</p>

<p>I ran off, I&#39;m sorry for your loss, I&#39;ve lost many over the years and it never is easy. I feel for you and your family. Please advise a lawyer.</p>

There is always risk in vaccinations but its a higher risk not to vaccinate. Its understandable that your emotions are wrecked, you lost a beloved pet and your decision making is likely to be affected. If you think you&#39;ll get rich from a lawsuit on this tragedy, however, you aren&#39;t being realistic. If its not too late ask for reimbursement for the medical expenses and cost of the animal.take what you can get, otherwise you won&#39;t get anything.

<p>thought sound bad, but you&#39;re being extremely selfish here. vaccinations are necessary for household pets - ESPECIALLY if you take them to dog parks or have other pets. </p>

<p>so for you to stymie and obstruct the field of veterinary vaccination research is pretty tasteless. there are hundreds of dogs waiting for you down at the pound, it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t go get another one. </p>

<p>a real sign of character would be to know that you&#39;re dog died for the progression of science. take the $1000 and make some money at the casino. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply taking a $1000 to keep his mouth shut would stymie plenty, actually. If you&#39;re truly for the progression of science, wouldn&#39;t you want to get to the bottom of why a vaccine would kill an otherwise healthy animal? I don&#39;t think you win many arguments over vaccine efficacy when it may actually kill the animal. Or does that pad those stats in your favor? I doubt many dead dogs contract and spread canine distemper around the local dog park.  Or does that hurt your narrative to just vaccinate everything cuz they tell you it&#39;s fine then belittle the collateral damage and their families for speaking out? A real sign of character shows compassion to people during the roller coaster ride of life we are all on. You&#39;re acting like a fanatic of a sports team towards a bitter rival after winning the championship. This isn&#39;t a contest.
Edit: BTW, genius....it&#39;s really hard to take someone seriously that has a post on Reddit of a pants hanger clipped to her enormously gross tits. </p>
