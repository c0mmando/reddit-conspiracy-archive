<p>Account that is younger than the current election cycle. 
All of his karma comes from anti Hillary posts on Donald trump subs so he doesn&#39;t get a karma rating below the threshold
He dodges and avoids answering questions that may prove that he is in fact trolling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His points were not solid. </p>

<p>He listed 7 lies directly from the first article on Google when you type in &quot;Hillary Lies&quot;</p>

<p>I then went on to concede that several of them were in fact lies. But I also proved that some weren&#39;t. For instance why she was named Hillary was simply a falsehood and not a lie. There needs to be intent for there to be a lie she was just saying what her mother told her growing up. And no one can actually prove that her mother didn&#39;t actually name her Hillary for that reason. </p>

<p>I then went on to post an article that points out the 22 lies/falsehoods trump said in ONE rally speech. Just one. </p>

<p>So I asked them to please provide more evidence of lies and all they did was post different variations of the same 7 lies. </p>

<p>Besides that, this discussion we are currently having was about ProfessionalBarShot being a troll and a brigadier which his own replies, his account age, and the subs he&#39;s posted in to gain positive karma so he doesn&#39;t go below threshold when he brigades <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></p>

<p>I can give a concise and convincing argument if the other person cares to even try to have a reasonable argument. </p>

<p>When I pressed the user on issues that they were wrong about they would ignore them. They would completely miss the point of majority of my comments and sometimes bring up non-sequitur points.</p>

<p>I highly doubt you read the whole comment thread. You simply saw the bullet points on his first couple posts and were like &quot;wow what a well constructed argument. He has bullet points&quot; then several comments later his entire argument falls apart </p>

<p>Edit: now it all makes sense. You&#39;re a Bernie bro like me but still won&#39;t support Clinton. Which is understandable. But don&#39;t come in here uninformed of the entire argument and call us both idiots because we support candidates that you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I submitted and have posted nothing that breaks any rules anywhere. Unlike you, where you were rightfully banned.</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to actually think, maybe both had influence in the decision to ban you? I submitted them altogether.</p>
