       I just got an anti Hillary article up on that sub reddit thats turned into r hillary and just had an arguement with someone who I am almost certain was a paid shill. So no fear of those here right lol. Just wanted to start a discussion about the two nominees and see what my favorite tinfoil hat wearing community had to say.

       Here's what we do in a quick break down by MOI.
      </p>
      <p>
       We first of all send out all the food we have already produced so that no one needs to starve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second we take what we already know, which is a plant based diet is the cure to everything, and we start planting all the good plants across the world. The excess CO2 in the air makes plants grow bigger/faster, plants eat the carbon.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that we get our pyramids going for what they're meant to do, they are free energy devices, just like Tesla had his that put a charge into the air for anything to use,
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ae/d0/b9/aed0b99f4779e2af1e3afced8a7c5e5d.jpg">
        here he is holding a light bulb and it turns on
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck the government we're hijacking this mother fucker. Then we're going to all become spiritual (or those who are meant to) and God will lead us the rest of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What humans are actually capable of, that's up in the air. I'd say we know how to make anti gravity technology, free energy, and so much more that people don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet we will be able to repopulate the earth knowing how everything works and we will once again create a utopia. Everything we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I think all the animals we have on earth are just animals we(or something) has created by manipulating DNA. I may be wrong, but we could repopulate the earth with new animals or the same animals with new ones, and they could create a new ecosystem for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we are capable of is, anything you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the truth get's out that everything is a lie you'll see. Our hearts manifest reality based on our beliefs and how much we love/fear something. I hated the world and in turn loved God, so I've been given a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should release all the spiritual books and teach people how to correctly read them. If they don't I will. In the highest realm of existence good/evil don't even exist. There is just being. All the greats know this and many others who are trying to get the word out. People are afraid of evil but in reality we are the choosers of doing good or evil ourselves. I choose good, most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are literally capable of anything, we have been taught we aren't which is why we HAVE TO go to school. Because if we don't get disconnected from all knowing and the truth, we won't do any of this slave work. Everything is a joke it really is. Ignorance is bliss but I don't give a fuck I don't censor shit. The matrix is real and you done entered it, it's way too intricate for any of these people to realize it, they're simpletons.

       Are you joking, if I die it'd be a blessing. I can die now I'll be back. I'll spend all my time informing and fighting the good fight. The gov does not scare me, I have nothing against them I am a peaceful protester spreading information that will peacefully destroy their government.

       If they have a problem with that then we're all screwed.

       Stop sending me bills and load my bank account with funds and I'll stop spreading knowledge on here. I was told that the only thing against the rules is trying to counter brain wash the public, that's basically what Spinx club had going before. I am completely okay to participate in this forum.

       Seriously we have some big dates coming up, I'd say 9/23 next year will be the big one, and if that doesn't get me flagged idk what will.

       The whole game is rigged and scripted. Only they are getting ridiculously sloppy. Oh and Trump is installed as controlled opposition and he knows it. Only, he is not playing their game. And Will probably get murdered for it. Imho

       Trump is 50/50 and Hillary is a criminal cunt. Doesn't matter though, because they are going to crash the economy and then we are off to war with the Ruskies. You might want to start learning Russian or Chinese (Russian would be better imo - makes drinking more fun), FYI.

       I agree. That's one thing people have to realize about Putin. He's ex-KGB and doesn't fuck around. He means what he says, and says what he means. He's a stone cold diplomat.
