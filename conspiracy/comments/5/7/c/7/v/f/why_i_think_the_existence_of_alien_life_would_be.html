There would be a lot of religion proved false with the confirmed existence of alien life and that could pose a lot of problems such as wars and mass suicides. I think we are not being let in on all the details simply because we aren&#39;t ready, at least not all of us are. It could cause mass panic, terrorism, riots, and much more just based on the fact that someones book wasn&#39;t right, and I know it&#39;s sad, but it&#39;s just the way things are. But this is just my thoughts on the matter, and I assumed this was the right place to share them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would this fit in with inter-dimensional?</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) edit: It was below the clouds. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing! I definitely think you witnessed or perhaps entered a stage in a different dimension when seeing this. Sometimes we enter different dimensions unknowingly. Think glitches in the matrix, deja vu, etc etc. I have a few stories albeit not like yours in seeing crafts, but actual beings and interacting with them (not intentionally though). If your interested, I&#39;m trying to find where I wrote out my experiences. But, cannot remember the thread over in <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>, it&#39;s not in my comment history, was too long ago. Will edit or PM you or if someone here could help a bro out and remembers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good and healthy to explore these thoughts, don&#39;t let anybody get down on you cuz their opinions are different.</p>
