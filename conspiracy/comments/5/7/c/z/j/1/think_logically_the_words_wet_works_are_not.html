        Wetwork is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression "wet work", as well as the similar "wet job", "wet affair", or "wet operation", are all calques of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities, mokroye delo (wet dealings). These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the "Department of wet affairs" (Otdel mokrykh del) -

       Your test is lunacy, man. Don't you have the self awareness to see that you're being paranoid? You have delusions of grandeur and delusions of persecution. No one is after you. I mean, who do you think you are? Do you think you're fucking Neo, or Jesus Christ? Newsflash: There are lunatic asylums full of people like you. Some of them think aliens are after them, and they truly believe it, to the same degree that you do. Some of them think the government is spying on them. Your thing is that you think demons are after you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad to see someone descend into madness. I got love for my fellow man. It's pathetic that I have to pepper in all the right answers to your insane witch hunt test designed to prove that everyone who disagrees with you is a demon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is more likely? That you're the center of some vast conspiracy ran by demons? Or, that you're experiencing a psychotic break from reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       When one of your criteria for someone being a demon is them telling you to get some help, you're just going to create an echo chamber of lunatics. You keep going down this road, you're gonna wind up in the looney bin.

      <p>
       If so, why is there so much suffering in the world? Why did God create those wasps that lay eggs in caterpillars that eat them alive?
      </p>
      <p>
       If God is all knowing, and all powerful, why do you think demons exist? Wouldn't an all loving, all knowing, all powerful creator know better than to create some sort of fucked up malevolent being?
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought the Gnostics were on to something. The god of the material world, which they called the Demiurge, lacked the perfection of the creator of the spiritual universe.

      <p>
       Also, do you believe in Jesus?

       Nope.  I believe in god, the force that made us something instead of nothing.  The 'God' featured in le holy bible is a fictional character.

       Because we slowly but surely allowed ourselves to be deceived by Evil.  This existence is our test.

       Without Evil, man could not be.  Our universe is one of balance.   We (us actual-humans) are the balance between the Infinite Love of our creator and the Evil that exists in this reality.

       I believe Jesus was an entity that came back to this reality (according to
       <a href="http://llresearch.org">
        the Law of One
       </a>
       to help us with our spiritual development.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe every religion that prays in his name has missed his most important of lessons:
       <em>
        Don't make an idol of me.

       The guy Podesta is talking to, Elmendorf, big time lobbyist and Monsanto guy. Ranked as one of the most powerful on capitol hill. Someone in the know, and someone every day Americans should be aware of.

      </p>
      <p>
       Wetwork is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression "wet work", as well as the similar "wet job", "wet affair", or "wet operation", are all calques of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities, mokroye delo (wet dealings).[1] These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the "Department of wet affairs" (Otdel mokrykh del).[2][3]
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian expression "wet job" (мокрое дело) can be traced to at least the 19th century[4][5] from Russian criminal slang (fenya, muzyka) and originally meant robbery that involved murder, i.e., spilling blood.

       A slippery slope. A government official says or does something illegal or immoral. Then, more officials do it. Repeadtly. Kinda like one kid being allowed to eat cake so the other thinks that means them too. Something like Watergate is the aftermath of a slippery slope

        Didn't think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sentence appears alone, without context. Elmendorf's email contains nothing else. It's sensible to assume that this is a reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, Elmendorf is stating that he is aware of the nature of the "wet works" which are to occur, and verifying that he and Podesta both know it. "Wet works" had already been entered into the context of the discussion, probably by Podesta, who may have then asked for confirmation from Elmendorf that he understood the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elmendorf is making clear that he understands that the "wet works" to come are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "pool parties at the Vineyard". Whether or not Podesta and Elmendorf have engaged in pool parties at a vineyard together is not important. Maybe they move in circles where pool parties at a vineyard are common. The meaning in Elmendorf's message is that he is aware that what is coming on the "bad night" in question is not "fun and games", but rather serious business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta replies to Elmendorf's acknowledgement with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am all in
       </p>
       <p>
        Sounds like it will be a bad nite , we all need to buckle up and double down
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Podesta here acknowledges that he is aware of the serious nature of the upcoming event.

       spot on. It's a reply to a previous conversation where the term was used. He was stating "yes I know what it means and it doesn't mean "pool parties at the Vineyard"

       the word "meant" is past tense in that sentence showing it's a reply to a previous convo.

       Is he saying that he's confirming that wet works are not something to do with getting wet/being in a pool but is instead the covert term that we are all thinking it means, i.e. to murder someone/take someone out.

       They are talking about the primary where Bernie
       <em>
        murdered
       </em>
       Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the previous email where he mentions
       <em>
        bedwetters
       </em>
       , or the people who were afraid Hillary was losing.

       It really sucks that this isn't getting any second glances from the mainstream media. Maybe we need to create T-shirts and go to some rallies.  No shit guys.  If anything, surely the anons in the cities these fucks visit can put on something that points people to this Wikileak.

       hey guys, i got my tinfoil hat on here
       <br/>
       so i was interested in the
       <br/>
       "pool parties"
       <br/>
       so i went into wikileaks and nothing, so "vineyard" was a hit, nothing special, just mentioned marthas vineyard.... okay so go with me here,  get your hats too!
      </p>
      <p>
       so, i googled marthas vineyard pool party (do it too! its fun!) and got a hit on Malia (obamas kid) getting into trouble at a party there....
      </p>
      <p>
       i was like okay, thats cool but it was in august, lets see if i can glean anything from the article anyways..
      </p>
      <p>
       turns out obama has a summer retreat in marthas vineyard
       <br/>
       pool parties?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       actually though, this guy could be saying to the other, "who woulda thought we would be pool partying with the president cause of this?"

       If you read the preceding email, it makes sense that podesta is making a pun, a joke, in reference to the term bed-wetter. This is a distraction, probably planted by CTR to make us look stupid.

       Sometimes wet works means assassination and sometimes pool party at the vineyard means hanging out with a bunch of rich ducks shooting quail. But interesting enough- Scalia supposedly died in his bed. A bed-wetter?

       Your test is lunacy, man. Don't you have the self awareness to see that you're being paranoid? You have delusions of grandeur and delusions of persecution. No one is after you. I mean, who do you think you are? Do you think you're fucking Neo, or Jesus Christ? Newsflash: There are lunatic asylums full of people like you. Some of them think aliens are after them, and they truly believe it, to the same degree that you do. Some of them think the government is spying on them. Your thing is that you think demons are after you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad to see someone descend into madness. I got love for my fellow man. It's pathetic that I have to pepper in all the right answers to your insane witch hunt test designed to prove that everyone who disagrees with you is a demon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is more likely? That you're the center of some vast conspiracy ran by demons? Or, that you're experiencing a psychotic break from reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       When one of your criteria for someone being a demon is them telling you to get some help, you're just going to create an echo chamber of lunatics. You keep going down this road, you're gonna wind up in the looney bin.
