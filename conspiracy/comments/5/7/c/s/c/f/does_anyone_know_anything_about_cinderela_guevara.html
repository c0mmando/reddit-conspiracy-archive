<p>edit: try looking for information under her &quot;real&quot; name, Cindy Rice Guevara?</p>

<p>edit 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge Guevara was elected Presidio County Judge in 2014. She was the county’s first Mexican woman to hold that position. Prior to her election, Cinderela was Presidio County Justice of the Peace for 25 years. <strong>Judge Guevara also served in the U.S. Army</strong>. [+] </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge Guevara ruled Antonin Scalia&#39;s death a heart attack without seeing the body. This is legal under Texas law, but some question her judgement. <strong>Judge Guevara later said she misspoke.</strong> [+] </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge Guevara was also criticized in 2013 when a girl died from being hit by a train in Marfa, Texas and the Judge did not order an investigation. <strong>She said to the girl&#39;s mom: “Yes, this was a tragedy, but the true tragedy was that she died without accepting Jesus Christ as her savior.”</strong> </p>

<p>As a Dem she was probably given orders by a Dem superior to skip the autopsy.</p>
