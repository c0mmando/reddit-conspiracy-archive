    <div class="md"><p>Arrogant comment. While I don&#39;t personally believe we are allowed to vote on any major decisions, that is a belief and is not based on empirical evidence, and calling someone a moron for making a decision that differs for your belief is rather ignorant.

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly is it that you would be losing?
You are very likely correct about voting for Stein or sanders not making a difference, however, there is still no need to insult people. It&#39;s a poor strategy and ignorant because  your strategy will not be effective in convincing people that you are correct. While you may not care about such details, nonetheless you are effectively contributing nothing productive to the conversation and conversely succeeding only in making people defensive and more inclined to cling to their existing beliefs.  Lastly, being ignorant or even outright stupid about a particular subject does not automatically mean they are stupid. Would you like to have a discussion in Geopolitics or Macroeconomics? Probably about as much as I&#39;d like to discuss Astrophysics with Stephen Hawking. But I do appreciate you responding with an explanation, I don&#39;t agree with the strategy but I do understand where your coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically I&#39;m saying that by voting Id be pretending what I know is true, isn&#39;t. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m playing football. Let&#39;s say that my goal is to have the scoreboard show I&#39;m winning. That&#39;s my goal. I&#39;m playing with 10 guys my size and my athleticism. My opponent is Tom Brady and the Patriots. Not only are they far superior in every way, but they also cheat like motherfuckers. </p>

<p>I could keep playing (keep voting) but I know that has no chance. Instead I just want to sit down with my team and talk about different strategies to make the scoreboard show we are winning. Like finding some rocks, charging the scorers booth, bashing some heads in, figuring out how to work the scoreboard, and changing the score. </p>

<p>Now, I could keep playing football (voting and campaigning) keep talking about the football game (elections and politics) and keep believing we might be able to beat the patriots (global elite psychopath child rapists) while simultaneously scheming the rock thing...but that is a waste of valuable time and energy. You see, the clock is ticking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if I hurt someone&#39;s feelings. Maybe I wake them up, maybe I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t care. Maybe somebody gets their feelings hurt. Big deal. The clock is ticking and thin skin is for kindergarten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had understood my explanation which you have chosen to not post, you&#39;d realize that anyone that you insult, that then ignores the points and fires insults back, is someone I don&#39;t want to waste my time educating.</p>

<p>The RARE person that responds back, without insults, these are the people I want to deal with.</p>

<p>See, young people don&#39;t have principles, they think an attack on an idea is an attack on them... which is retarded and immature.</p>

<p>So the only way to wade through all the retards, is to find the people that react as only a mature, intelligent adult would.</p>

<p>I do this in RL and I admit it is different, but it seriously works at wading through the retards.</p>

<p>You have FAILED this test however... you still haven&#39;t explained why whore is a negative thing.</p>

<p>Words don&#39;t always mean the same to everyone, I think &#39;nigga&#39; is a perfect example of tone and phrasing having more significance.</p>

<p>I like the &#39;Tokyo Breakfast&#39; show to illustrate that; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJPMLyk_Tag">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJPMLyk_Tag</a></p>

<p>The fact is a lot of men don&#39;t use whore as a negative... a lot of men use it as both negative and positive... and a few rare ones like me consider it a neutral term that meaning has more to do with the person saying it than its context.</p>

<p>When the media assumes whore=bad, they are brainwashing you with 1950&#39;s values that the liberal elite class still clings to.</p>

<p>The fuck... this is about HILLARY paying people... how is that a conspiracy?  All political campaigns hire people to campaign....</p>

<p>Dude, please re-read the message exchange because you are a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>Hillary is WORSE than Trump... that is my point... annoying me when we are in agreement is just annoying... go circle jerk someone else.  And fuck off with your conspiracy shit</p>

<p>MUSLIMS TOOK OUT THE TOWERS, fucking deal with it... this nanothermite shit you libtards go on about is fucking pathetic.</p>

<p>Seriously, just fuck off you theist cunt, I don&#39;t care what theists like you think, I don&#39;t care that you blame the jews for everything, go fucking annoy the Shillary cunnilingus fucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only a misogynist thinks whore is a negative word so way to fuck up your trolling.</p>

<p>Look dude, just go back to masturbating, you can slut shame all you want online, but the fact you can&#39;t answer or explain why whore is a negative term pretty much proves my point, that you started with pre-conceived notions and go looking for only what confirms them.</p>

<p>That is what theists do... you start with your sexist bible full of idiocy and fucking tap dancing unicorns... and only believe what doesn&#39;t contradict it, and distort everything else if you can... and ignore what you cannot deal with.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t deal with the fact that people aren&#39;t outraged with Trump... you can&#39;t deal with the fact that religion is dying, that the theists control is slipping.</p>

<p>Have fun fucking what ugly ass bible bitch your lonely ass ends up settling for... pump out some babies.  Hopefully some will at least be fuckacble.... or a butter-face at least.</p>

<p>The only people I go after are people who can&#39;t follow simple rules of etiquette and would rather attack anonymous strangers on an internet forum to get their jollies.  I get that you think you&#39;re the smartest and most interesting person on the planet but is it necessary to alienate everyone you interact with?  No one likes an arrogant know it all.  Unless you&#39;re trying to be as disliked as possible, in which case carry on.  I highly, highly doubt you get many &quot;bitches&quot; though if your real life personality is anything like your online one.  You have a good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t look at your moderating posts, I skipped to your commentary ones.   You are attacking anonymous strangers on the internet... I click &#39;context&#39; (a few times), and then I see people posting nothing confrontational, and you roll in calling them names.</p>

<p>You can delete them from your history, but trying to convince someone that already checked is a bit pointless.</p>

<p>I think everyone is interesting to everyone, its just a matter of finding what and how much.</p>

<p>In a way I&#39;m buying ideas from others and paying with my own... I&#39;m not all insults... I just find if someone responds to insults with insults, they probably don&#39;t have an ideological stance and thus their uncertainty leads to defensiveness.</p>

<p>But... you lied, you&#39;re a total dick to people for no reason online, and then try to call me out for doing that... that is a bit &#39;douchey&#39; as you say.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck if you ban me, and you&#39;ve gone from threatening me with it, to claiming I&#39;m trying to... I can&#39;t work with this incoherent bull.</p>

<p>I have one friend that once he had half a million saved up, he retired, and then he started spending time online... became a 9/11 Truther, giants built the pyramids, pyramids are a nuclear powered alien landing pad... and he supports Hillary and thinks Russia is gonna invade.

    <div class="md"><p>I actually even made money going to University due to getting so many scholarships... which actually isn&#39;t that impressive, I never did much charity work so I couldn&#39;t even apply for most.</p>

<p>Ever hear of <a href="http://www.Overgrow.com">www.Overgrow.com</a> ?  It got shutdown for awhile and the forum never recovered.  I was one of the infamous vertical marijuana growers, I used ultrasonic fog in a coliseum.  By not having any &#39;standing water&#39;/water-droplets, your plants roots don&#39;t have to fight off bacteria, still used beneficial fungi but requires wetting the roots to actually work, and that flattens all the super-fine root-hairs so I only did it for the vegetative state.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like everything worked out the way I wanted though, I really wanted to open a lan-cafe and then render CGI movies on the idle machines and eventually my own game production company.</p>

<p>So are you actually going to stop being a little bitch, or can we have some fun?</p>

<p>I like helping people, and I don&#39;t really have anything better to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there was a time I would even take half-flowered buds and microwave them... but when you have an unlimited supply, a supply that is well trimmed and cured, you do tend to smoke a lot.</p>

<p>It got to the point where it took more time to get high, than the high lasted.  Around 2005 I switched to just weekends.  But then I ended up smoking cigarettes, which is hilarious because I said I never would.  For awhile it was just a haze of cigs and zigs.  Now the novelty has warn off and I usually just blaze during the winter when I don&#39;t feel like going outside.</p>

<p>First, you&#39;re talking to me, and just being a little bitch... so I&#39;m well aware you aren&#39;t a happy camper.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t really get to talk about yourself honestly very often, so that is kinda what I use the internet for.   Lying about yourself I&#39;d save for dates, but I always found it is hard to keep lies straight and I like the brutal honesty approach. </p>

<p>Really makes dealing with idiots effortless because I realize just how much they have to learn.  But different strokes for different folks.  I have one young friend who moved down to Calgary (winter sucks up here)... he looks like a shorter Jason Segel with black hair, like people stop him on the street and tell him that.  But he moved to Calgary with what I termed, &quot;a hospital waste dumpster fire&quot;, because he liked being the more attractive one in the relationship because he can get away with being himself. </p>

<p>I consider that actually rather wise move, just not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>He quit weed altogether, so even I realize that not everyone enjoys it forever.  </p>

<p>I assume you are a full blown libtard... but I&#39;d love to hear why you think insulting stoners is a liberal position and not a conservative one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are going to make an account specifically just to annoy me... then you want quantity.  I can just message your real account if you aren&#39;t at least going to be clever... should I just start making witty remarks for you to copy-and-paste?</p>

<p>You have failed to answer a single question, and yet you think smug comments will &quot;win&quot; the day. </p>

<p>We both know you are a sad miserable person... you made an account to talk to me... you can&#39;t recover from that.</p>

<p>I can however help you... I help people all the time.  Just love learning and teaching.</p>

<p>As a skeptic I make sure to never take something seriously without seeing counter-arguments.  Most people start with a conclusion and only believe/see what confirms it... which I learned being an atheist reading from the bible to the congregation (30 old people).</p>

<p>I mean it was fun to read the bible in front of people and a bit nerve wracking.  It&#39;s amazing what you will find interesting if you try... I had no idea I&#39;d be a good orator.  Essays are probably the only thing I hate... they make you write fluff and bullshit to make a statement I could do in point form.</p>

<p>Ever heard of Fark.com?  I found that site on 9/11; see a lot of internet news servers went down as well and Fark.com was the one site still up.  From that day forth I have seen every non-TotalFark link that hit the main page (before the subdivision of topics)... that is decades of learning every single day (had internet since &#39;95).</p>

<p>Most people have to work, and instead, I have spent my entire life learning, selling weed and making tax-free profit from selling my house (in Canada there is no capital gains tax on your primary residence)... 15 years of being on the internet with a small gap where I had to get that internet addiction under-control and went cold Turkey.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I like to predict the electoral outcome, so far been right every time... this election cycle reminds me of Bush Jrs re-election for 2nd term.  The libtards were so confident they would win, they sounded EXACTLY like they do now, except Bush Jr was hated even MORE! Polls all predicted Bush Jr would lose by a large margin... everyone said I was crazy for claiming he&#39;d be re-elected with my personal fucking guarantee.</p>

<p>This time around I&#39;m not certain who will win, either with it just sucks to be an American and kicks ass to be Canadian! (minus the foot of snow outside).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I like hearing people explain themselves. (PSST I also like doing it)</p>

<p>You can answer the questions I posed you (and your original account) and if you actually have a logical reasoning behind them, I&#39;d be surprised.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t surprise me.. then I am untouchable... I have to LEARN something for me to value you.  Until then, I don&#39;t care about you... shit I could be talking to a bot for all I know.</p>

<p>I quit playing video games a long time ago, it was Unreal Tournament, the one where they had vehicles.  For days I wasn&#39;t really having fun, no one worked together and even though I killed more than I died, it was usually just one-on-one.  Then finally  I had so much fun, I started texting the others how awesome the match had been... took awhile, but I figured out I was playing on a server full of bots and me.  Haven&#39;t played videogames since.</p>

<p>Unless you count FreeCiv... but I&#39;m weird, I have been playing the same start over and over for years... get to Turn 70 at most before I put it aside for months.</p>

<p>What points do you think I&#39;m trying to make?  I already made it very clear to you, that I know you are an inferior, sad, lonely person.</p>

<p>How do I know that?  Because you&#39;re replying to a guy just rambling on about himself.</p>

<p>Honestly, you aren&#39;t the biggest cunt I&#39;ve dealt with... I like that you aren&#39;t calling out my grammar and typos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty excited to hear you answer the questions I&#39;ve asked.  Most the time you people tend to just go troll someone else, but I&#39;ve met people that it actually results in them learning from me and I change their mind.</p>

<p>My attitude though, is you have to challenge, and then get a person to explain their reasoning... most the time that alone causes them to change their mind.</p>

<p>You have this arguing style that you think you&#39;ve really nailed. Why not? Its worked so well on all the strangers you&#39;ve yelled at online while hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem though, the whole thing falls apart if you don&#39;t have anything to latch on to. If I never give you anything to target, you have no ground to stand on.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You literally don&#39;t know a single thing about me &quot;</p>

<p>That is kinda why I keep asking you to answer the questions... normally you say that only if someone has made assumptions about someone not based on observations.</p>

<p>And you are the one that started off making assumptions, pretty clear my narrative as been your are afraid to open your mouth, and remove all doubt about how stupid you are.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t superior, that is why I&#39;m talking to you... if you were, then I would be listening to you, instead of asking questions.</p>

<p>You thought &#39;trump luvs nickleback&#39; was witty.... but if you knew anything about Canadians, you&#39;d know we laugh at the ones that get famous in your nation.</p>

<p>Also, when you say some is lowly, and that you are superior... without quantifying HOW superior, it is meaning less.  It&#39;s like bragging about getting 78% on a test when I got 77%.</p>

<p>I you want me to believe something, you aren&#39;t going about it the right way.  Right now, you have failed to produce anything.</p>

<p>Arguing; Point.  Counter-point.  Counter-counter-point.</p>

<p>You started with &quot;Your dick must be like, microscopic.&quot; </p>

<p>I blow off your insult completely because having a micropenis isn&#39;t something to make fun of, and I I&#39;m just average sized and not hung up... so insult failed to land, whatever, you wanted to converse with me... so I became interested in conversing with you.  Don&#39;t try to converse with people if you don&#39;t want them to converse back.</p>

<p>&quot;This is my favorite picture to masterbate to&quot; (link to random ugly ginger pic)</p>

<p>&quot;Literally all you do is go after people (-_-&#39;)&quot;</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>&quot;Lol, you think you&#39;re smart...&quot;</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>&quot;Only dumb people are so boastful about their own perceived intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>I correct you by explaining I&#39;m not being boastful.</p>

<p>&quot;I bet youre just a loser pothead that looks like this.&quot;</p>

<p>I explain my marijuana use history</p>

<p>&quot;Your train of thought is the definition of quantity over quality.&quot;</p>

<p>I explain you wanted to talk first.</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;You just want something to latch on to so badly. If you were so smart, I wouldn&#39;t be able to lead you around like a cat chasing a laser.
I pity every essence of your existence.&quot;</p>

<p>Since your grasping straws I just start rambling hoping to encourage you to drop your insecurities</p>

<p>&quot;You sure have a lot of stories that add literally nothing of substance to any of the points you are poorly attempting to make.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see, you haven&#39;t made a point for me to counter-point.... and by claiming I am making points that I&#39;m unaware of it makes it clear you aren&#39;t paying attention and aren&#39;t willing to drop your guard down and open up yet.</p>

<p>&quot;Lol, you want it so badly.&quot;</p>

<p>Want what?  Answering my questions because you started talking to me first is all I want... I want to understand the people I converse with.  I can only tell so much from your actions.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like nickel back... you don&#39;t like trump, therefore you communicated to me that you are opinionated.  By starting off with an insult, it communicates that you are NOT confident in your ideological views... otherwise you&#39;d use EFFECTIVE  point/counter-point conversing, as opposed insults and denial.</p>

<p>&quot;You literally don&#39;t know a single thing about me lol. You are already fully aware you&#39;re fighting an uphill battle. I can act superior because I know I&#39;m superior.&quot;</p>

<p>I point out I&#39;m asking questions for that very reason.  Still confused what &quot;battle&quot; you are talking about... and then you start boasting after claiming boasting was negative trait.</p>

<p>I got money, that means I don&#39;t have to work tomorrow.... I can talk to you easily 16 hrs a day for the rest of my life if I wanted to... I have nothing but free time.</p>

<p>Jill Stein - for her anti-war position alone.</p>

<p>Not that I am under any illusions about her chances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here.    </p>

<p>Of course she won&#39;t win</p>

<p>But if she gets enough votes to be noticed, it will pull the major parties at least a little in that direction. </p>

<p>And if she gets enough votes that it makes the difference in the election, I hope it will pull the major parties a long way in that direction.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>TL/DR: votes for third parties are</strong> <strong><em>LESS</em></strong> <strong>of a throwaway vote than votes for major party candidates.</strong></p>

<p>If you vote for one major party --- all that does is make the losing party try to be more like the winning party, and makes the winning party think they have a good platform.   If third parties get enough of a vote that they would have made a difference in an election - the major parties will both look to move in that direction to attract those voters.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the Green party gets enough votes they could have changed the outcome, both major parties will distance themselves from dirty fossil fuels --- probably with Democrats emphasizing their love for renewables; and Republicans embracing Nuclear.</p></li>
<li><p>if the Libertarian party gets enough votes to be noticed, the Republicans will return to their pre-Reagan roots of small government; and the Democrats will focus on however they align with Libertarians (drugs, and social issues).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For those who (correctly) point out that the Libertarian and Green party have major flaws --- even I think it&#39;d be scary if either the Green or Libertarian party controlled both the House and the Senate as well as the President.    But I think the country would be in a better place if they occasionally controlled <strong>some</strong> of those.</p>

<p>So technically we don&#39;t live in a democracy, because the vote of the people who don&#39;t vote don&#39;t count. </p>

<p>Fact is, when you are smarter than everyone else like I am, you really don&#39;t have anything positive to say.  And I consider intelligence mostly a choice, so there&#39;s no excuse for anyone.</p>

<p>I have one friend that once he had half a million saved up, he retired, and then he started spending time online... became a 9/11 Truther, giants built the pyramids, pyramids are a nuclear powered alien landing pad... and he supports Hillary and thinks Russia is gonna invade.  Now that is aggravating... you can come over and tell me to relax when I have to sit through one of his conspiracy sessions before we can light the bowl up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amusing.  Fucking deal with it.</p>
