        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1272</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Following a week of steady criticism directed at reddit, after news leaked that <a href="http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/%2875%29%20Chaffetz%20Smith%20to%20Tidwell%20re%20Federal%2009-21-2016.pdf">the site had became embroiled in a congressional subpoena regarding Paul Combetta</a>, staffers at Assuredly A News Agency <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/57dyr3/a_message_to_the_community_we_talked_to_the/">have been informed via sources</a>  that a high-level meeting was called today between the reddit admins, and the head-moderators of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, in order to demand that users of the subreddit be prohibited from mentioning corruption on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>It is understood that the administrators of Reddit.com have told the largest Republican subreddit on their platform, in no uncertain terms, that even mentioning the name of &quot;<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>&quot; in a submission title or comment is a violation of the site wide terms of service; specifically as they apply to &quot;brigading other communities&quot;.</p>

<p>Many users of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, and else where around reddit, were outraged at this action on behalf of the reddit administrators; as this policy prohibiting mention of //rpolitics directly undermines the ability of the reddit community at large to engage in effective oversight of corrupt moderation.</p>

<p>In a heart-stopping example, just today a thread pointing out the &quot;blackout&quot; occurring in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> with regards to the recent Podetta Email leaks was ordered to be <a href="https://i.sli.mg/KTKm7v.png">removed at the behest of reddit admins</a>.</p>

<p>This newest revelation is perhaps no surprise, as, for many weeks now, subreddits like <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> have spent countless hours crowd-sourcing oversight of the moderation on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and what was uncovered sends chills down the spine of those who seek a news aggregate with integrity; a nearly endless pattern of pro-Hillary stories were being flooded to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, while any anti-Hillary or Pro-Donald Trump posts were being removed with prejudice.</p>

<p>In an even more dramatic turn of events, submissions which aimed to paint Donald Trump in a  negative light were also being removed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/56qgv5/176666968_well_donald_trump_just_threatened_to/">the second that their respective comment sections turned against the conclusions of the article</a>.</p>

<p>Many users on the popular networking site are in open revolt as a result of today&#39;s demand on the part of the reddit admins, and this <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=&amp;cycle=All&amp;sort=R&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=reddit&amp;cand=&amp;submit=Submit">may perhaps be a result of damning new information just coming to light which seems to show that <em>all</em> donations from reddit employees during this year&#39;s campaign cycle have gone to Democrats</a>.</p>

<p>In an ill-fated attempt to quell user outrage, reddit admin &quot;redtaboo&quot; was quoted this week as saying, with regards to accusations of corruption on the part of the moderators in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/56qgv5/176666968_well_donald_trump_just_threatened_to/d8mjo7v?context=3">In the case of /r/politics there has never been any proof of wrongdoing.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, some are wondering just how impartial the reddit admins may be during this contentious election; as it seems to be very clear that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is being shielded from any potential criticism by the owners of reddit itself.</p>

<p>This type of behavior on the part of the reddit admins demonstrates, quite openly, that they are unable to effectively provide oversight in order to thwart third-party conflicts of interest on their platform; a conclusion which suggests congress&#39;s interest in the platform may only just have begun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re only &#39;winning&#39; in that one shithole.</p>

<p>They&#39;re paid shills, they don&#39;t venture outside their new trump-hate-hug-box, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Watch what happens when one of them ventures outside. They get downvoted and ignored so goddamn fast because their views are so outside the realm of common fucking sense that nobody can stand them.</p>

<p>I saw like eight posts at the top of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> yesterday WHINING that Trump was going to jail the lawyers who protected Clinton, and how he was a fascist dictator ALREADY for even mentioning doing such an awful thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And her law firm, which is a very big and powerful law firm, which is the one that said, &#39;Oh, they&#39;ll determine what they&#39;re giving,&#39; <strong>those representatives within that law firm that did that</strong>, have to go to jail,&quot; Trump said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody with more than a handful of brain cells left could possibly believe that he was threatening the entire law firm with jail if he gets elected. But that&#39;s the ONLY thing that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> would say.</p>

<p>But try and say that he was trying to jail the entire firm outside of that fucking shithole hugbox, and see how long your comment is visible for.</p>

<p>The rest of reddit is relatively shill-free, so far, so that kind of wanton fucking stupidity is not accepted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, a website with token voting like <strong>/.</strong> would be a lot better. Over there, they only allow a handful of people to vote on comments at a given time. So long as you are contributing to dicussions somewhat regularly, you&#39;ll get a number of voting tokens where you can vote comments up or down.</p>

<p>An example could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day 1: contribute to several discussions</li>
<li>Day 2: contribute to more discussions</li>
<li>Day 3: receive 5 automatic voting voting tokens to use however you want</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, another nice aspect is that if you have vote tokens, you can&#39;t both vote on a comment and respond in text. Due to this, they are called &quot;<strong>mod points</strong>&quot; where everyone is occasionally a moderator.</p>

It improved during the primaries when people were posting about real issues, then it was completely taken over by HRC PR people, who are all on new accounts.</p>

<p>it&#39;s always been a bunch of people living in make-believe land and posting about shit that doesn&#39;t matter at all. now it&#39;s just suddenly a PR outlet for the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They forced r/the_donald to setup an automod preventing direct links to r/politics accusing us of brigading.. Which is nonsense. ETS, SRS and Politics are actually organizing brigading against the_donald and others like it via their CTR paid shills. Its really fucking sickening. Politics was always skewed to the left, but a conservative could at least make a point now and then and be heard. Articles i&#39;d post would get 30-40 Karma and get burried. They don&#39;t even try to hide their bias now. They find an excuse to delete dissenting opinion immediately. Comments that go against the narrative are instantly -15, -20 and buried. They organize the CTR to squash any unapproved line of thinking. Its zero fun for a conservative/libertarian to be there, but i bet its even lost its appeal to thinking liberals who want to get the news. When 100% of the posts are anti-trump or pro-hillary, there&#39;s no other topics covered anymore. </p>

<p><a href="http://cuddlebuggery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Picard-Facepalm.jpg">http://cuddlebuggery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Picard-Facepalm.jpg</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using this site for six years now.  At this point, the idea that Reddit is literally a wretched hive of Marxist scum and villainy, is something I take completely for granted.  If I want to visit the other side of the aisle, that is what /pol/ is for, but if I want actually intelligent conversation in either case, then I&#39;m plain out of luck.</p>

<p>Reddit is run by Leftists, for Leftists.  This site is something which Joseph McCarthy would have been very glad that he didn&#39;t live to see.  That has several implications; all of them negative.</p>

<p>a}  Leftists don&#39;t debate.  Ever.  If you make a statement that they disagree with, they call it a hate crime, scream that you&#39;ve hurt their feelings, and do everything in their power to both ensure that said statement never sees the light of day, and also destroy you both socially and personally.  Leftists are not capable of rhetoric, and they therefore detest the concept of freedom of expression, because they know that they do not have the ability to win a legitimate argument.  That is the entire purpose of the voting system on this site; to ensure that Leftists are never required to logically support their opinions.</p>

<p>b}  Yes, this site is going to be a completely uncritical bastion of support for Hillary.  I don&#39;t like that myself, or excuse it, but you&#39;re just going to have to suck it up and deal.  Remember, Leftists don&#39;t do logic.  They do not <strong><em>rationally</em></strong> assess the merit of <strong><em>ideas</em></strong>; they <strong><em>emotionally</em></strong> assess whether or not a <strong><em>person</em></strong> is worthy of inclusion within the Hive, on the basis of whether or not said person expresses gateway-approved opinions, and perceived <strong><em>loyalty</em></strong>, which is primarily defined by said agreement.  If Hillary does that in public, then it doesn&#39;t matter how much of a corrupt, raving psychopath the rest of us might know her to be.  As long as Hillary expresses certainty in evolutionary theory, and support for Black Lives Matter, then they will unquestioningly support her to the hilt.</p>

<p>c}  Leftists believe that the ends justify the means.  If Hillary is their candidate, then literally anything that gets her the Presidency is considered justifiable.  Vote rigging, the stunt that was pulled with the Star Trek production community, bribery, corruption of the media, you name it.  It&#39;s all on the table.  Leftists do not believe in consistent ethics, because rules are tools of the oppressors, and the oppressors are merely to be destroyed.  Privelege is only called such, when it applies to a group that Leftists disapprove of.  If their in-group does the same thing, then they will claim that their past oppression justifies it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t condone any of this, and I don&#39;t want you to make the mistake of thinking that I do.  In six years, however, I have been through every negative emotion regarding this site that you can think of.  I&#39;ve experienced disgust, contempt, rage, despair, depression, misanthropy; you name it.  At this point I&#39;m starting to become numb.  The main reason why I&#39;m becoming desensitised to it, is because if there is one thing I&#39;ve realised, it is that Leftists will <strong><em>insist</em></strong> on their shit.  They <strong><em>crave</em></strong> it.  You can point out logical inconsistencies and complete ethical abandonment to them as much as you like; they don&#39;t care.  They demand their degeneracy, and they are going to have it no matter what.  They do not recognise that they have a problem, and they do not want help to overcome it.</p>

<p>All they want is for you to either agree with them, or shut up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that&#39;s alright except that it&#39;s not &quot;leftists&quot; that it all applies to and you&#39;re stupid if you think any of that is specific to &quot;leftists&quot;, that&#39;s how most people are, and &quot;leftists vs. rightists&quot; is a completely irrelevant way to describe people and a completely fake way to think about politics. it means nothing and has no bearing on reality. The people on &quot;the right&quot; are more guilty than anyone else of all of that, but seeing as both left and right are the same, it doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>there are people who are falling for and participating in obvious scams for personal profit, and people who aren&#39;t. both Clinton II vs. her own donor and long-time family friend, WWE Raw actor Donald Trump are scams. Just like it was a scam when Bush II &quot;ran against&quot; his own frat brother and fellow Bonesman, Al Gore. It&#39;s a scam. When an impeached president&#39;s wife is set up to run against her husband&#39;s billionaire donor and golfing buddy, there&#39;s a big problem, and it has <em>nothing to do with &quot;left or right&quot;</em>, it has to do with the masses being stupid and complacent and falling for obvious scams while thinking they&#39;re being intelligent by debating &quot;left vs. right&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like in Russia if Putin&#39;s wife was set up to &quot;run against&quot; Putin&#39;s billionaire campaign donor and golf buddy. That&#39;s not &quot;left vs. right&quot;, it&#39;s a scam of rich vs. poor with a mafia of oligarchs legitimizing their rule by installing &quot;candidates&quot; via &quot;democratic elections&quot; who will play ball. That&#39;s it. There is no left or right. There are people who are fooled by scams and people who aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Talking about &quot;leftists&quot; or left vs. right is completely meaningless in the world you live in today. It&#39;s a scam to keep you divided from everyone else and keep you distracted from obvious political realities that have nothing to do with &quot;left vs. right&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>facepalm, good luck with your pretend divisions and fake competitions that serve to do nothing but divide and conquer you and all the other people who aren&#39;t in the control mafia, and PS, clinton II vs. her donor and family friend trump is a perfect example of how absolutely fake &quot;left vs. right&quot; is, just like Bush II vs. his own frat brother Gore. It&#39;s a fake competition, like football, to distract you from the actual political realities facing your country and people, who you don&#39;t want to be united with, because [fake reason here].</p>

<p>left vs. right is a completely fake argument that you&#39;ve fallen for and now focus your attention on, because you want to feel like you&#39;re somehow in the &#39;better team&#39;, but really you&#39;re all on the same team, the team being fucked over by the mafia that has seized power (who, by the way, are most certainly NOT &quot;leftists&quot;, and only idiots would think they are). left vs. right is a fake conflict used to make  poor people fight among themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying they never brigaded, not a trump fan myself, but this new rule is incredibly ambiguous. By simply mentioning a particular sub, you are considered to be &quot;brigading?&quot; </p>

<p>If you enforce that rule to both subs with the same exact interpretation it would get so much hate for being an abusive rule from both sides. That&#39;s the beauty of enforcing rules equally in not only the judicial system, but sports, school, events in general.</p>

<p>Non biased rules mean they apply to everyone equally.  This rule is basically saying &quot;all of this particular group of people are guilty of xyz.&quot;  &quot;All cops are murderers&quot;, etc.  When in reality we know not all cops are bad.  There needs to be the same interpretation of that rule enforced across the entire site. Once everyone realizes how easily it can be abused, then it will have to be narrowed to something a little more specific like: actually calling for a brigade straight up.  Simply mentioning the sub in passing should not be cause for a ban. </p>

<p>Beyond that, we&#39;re not talking about bias. We&#39;re talking about manipulation and I don&#39;t recall r/HillaryClinton having anywhere near the same level of mod drama as r/The_Donald.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, a website with token voting like <strong>/.</strong> would be a lot better. Over there, they only allow a handful of people to vote on comments at a given time. So long as you are contributing to dicussions somewhat regularly, you&#39;ll get a number of voting tokens where you can vote comments up or down.</p>

<p>An example could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day 1: contribute to several discussions</li>
<li>Day 2: contribute to more discussions</li>
<li>Day 3: receive 5 automatic voting voting tokens to use however you want</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, another nice aspect is that if you have vote tokens, you can&#39;t both vote on a comment and respond in text. Due to this, they are called &quot;<strong>mod points</strong>&quot; where everyone is occasionally a moderator.</p>
