    <div class="md"><p>Lol, Anderson/Trump accuser interview. </p>

<p>Anderson: Trump said he has evidence that this are lies and he will make them public.</p>

<p>Woman: (swallow) well good luck. I would tell him to be more conserved with resent accusations because 35 years ago this kind of behavior was considered acceptable. </p>

<p>Anderson: You said you want to put this in the past and move on with your life.</p>

<p>Woman: Yes, i believe Trump will do something else as he always does and people will forget about me.</p>

<p>Loooool, how do they come up with this stuff ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1) she came out on her own 35 years later when no one even knew her name and no one even knew this happened and now she wants to move on ðŸ˜‚
2) if this was considered acceptable then why are we even here!!! </p>

<p>I see this stuff and they just make me crack up and laugh my ass off but then i think about the big picture and i want to cry. </p>

<p>Anderson: I used to like Anderson but after the election i will never never never in my life watch his show again, i thought he was a honest guy, he can&#39;t be that stupid, he knows exactly what he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Christine Quinn: She&#39;s really stupid. No, she must be given a phd on stupidity because she&#39;s really manipulated and highly politicized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what i was expecting to hear, but this just means that M Obama was faking it then. But doesn&#39;t that mean she&#39;s heartless? She is basically promoting the same thing she condemns. Doesn&#39;t this behavior brings attention to something that is basically yes stupid and immature but also normal. Then it means it can embed in males minds like me who see it as whatever like damn, i should be careful how i act around women, or even be careful not to have many women around my work or somewhere that i spent a lot of time and i feel like a safe place because they might not have the same mentality as me and might get me in trouble for something. And this goes for women as well, it might make them feel that more &quot;restrictions&quot; apply to men and they might get in trouble because i might see it as an abuse. This just promotes social boundaries that dont need to be there. Wearing a fake social mask just to feel that we follow the guidelines that we saw in tv etc, doesn&#39;t it??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care that trump said pussy or that he likes pussy or thinks some woman is hot.  It&#39;s different thing entirely to say you go up to women and just grab their pussy and start making out with them because you were handed more money than most people make in their lives and think you&#39;re some TV star..  It&#39;s not at all the same as your friend, who you know and are familiar with, making dirty jokes <strong>about you</strong> with you.  The difference is very easy to understand so I don&#39;t see where the confusion is coming from here.</p>

<p>I can understand how many wouldn&#39;t consider that any big deal either, but once you&#39;ve had a girlfriend or a daughter or a family member talk about being groped by people who think it&#39;s no big deal, and seen first hand how it effects their lives...  I don&#39;t find it fucking funny anymore.  I don&#39;t find it amusing or endearing.  Especially from someone who has ties to Epstein.  Trump is a piece of shit.</p>

<p>Trump was about 60 fuckin years old when he said that shit.  He ought to know better.  Money can&#39;t buy class.  Creepy fat geezer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think she was faking. I agreed with her. I watched the whole speech which I think makes a difference. I saw a clip later and it didn&#39;t have the same feel.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly pissed about Trump&#39;s comments. My dad beat my mom regularly growing up. I was sexually abused at age 10 by a 21 year old man. My ex husband was abusive emotionally and sexually. I have daughters and one of them has been sexually abused. I&#39;ve had a man pull up and stop me when I was walking to school at the age of 12 and tell me he&#39;d take me to school if I showed him my body. Not to mention random catcalls throughout life. I&#39;m hardly alone in this. ALOT of women deal with the same things.  </p>

<p>But I also know I am responsible for myself. So I have been working to better myself. I got divorced, I went to therapy, I work full time, I go to night classes. In one year I will graduate, finally. And that counts for what exactly if the world sees me as nothing more than, and will never see me as more than, a pair of tits and a pussy? Fuck Donald Trump. He was not with his buddies. He was a guest there. The woman they were cheering about on the bus was working, just doing her job. They were practically drooling and then they hop off the bus business as usual. It&#39;s gross and wrong. Trump is a threat to my daughters. He creates a culture where we rationalize sexual abuse.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m 35 so that also may make a difference. Michelle Obama has kids around the same age as mine. I consider my kids when I vote. Trump himself swung my vote because ever since last weekend I have felt exatly like Michelle Obama. Ugh, he&#39;s a creep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, nice storytelling. Not sure why you took the time. For one, most of it is false. How can you break down the life of someone you don&#39;t even know? And don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s because you just &quot;know&quot; women because clearly, you don&#39;t. And two, it&#39;s pointless. You asked for an opinion and I gave it. I don&#39;t give a shit what you think about it. You are a kid from I don&#39;t care where. You are insignificant. I see now you just wanted me to chime in and agree Michelle was faking it. You had already determined she was full of shit before I even posted based on your replies. You had anwers from less then 10 people and your mind was made up.  You posted this simply so others could chime and agree with you. And of course you <em>must</em> be right. Maybe you are just very used to women &quot;faking it&quot;.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t be surpised. You blame victims for the abuse they endure. You think life ends at 35. You believe therapy equals a weak mind. You are a single man, with no kids, on a conspiracy sub telling women about life. Lol! I believe you may also have a beardneck or a fedora. Have a good one my gentle sir.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you blamed me for allowing myself to be molested at the age of 10. A 21-year-old man in the military climbed into bed with me when I was staying the night at a friend&#39;s house. He was her older brother. This is my fault? When I said I was 12 and a man asked to see my body, you just assumed I let him. I didn&#39;t get in the car, I didn&#39;t show him my body. I ran because I thought he was going to kill me. Why would you assume I did it? Wtf? I&#39;m not even going to discuss my daughter because you&#39;re a piece of shit and there&#39;s no need. You said yourself you didn&#39;t give a fuck about this election until a few weeks ago and have never participated prior. But suddenly you&#39;re an expert? Sit down.</p>

<p>Yeah. You are insignificant. You are exactly the type of creep Trump has crawling out of the woodwork. You are exactly the type of creep Michelle Obama was describing. Your &quot;acquired skills&quot; (grammar, not being one of them) will get you nowhere here or &quot;overseas&quot; because you are socially inept. As you well know. But <em>please</em> don&#39;t let that stop you. In fact, what is stopping you? Thought you had it all figured out Spongey? As you told me, &quot;You need to take your own responsibilities.&quot; Whatever the fuck that means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww dude, why&#39;d you delete your comments? No worries. I have a copy:</p>

<p>1) Abusive dad beating mom 2) Sexually abused at age 10 3) Abusive husband (sexually/emotionally) 4) One daughter sexually abused 5) Show tits to driver for a ride to school 6) Random callcats 7) Got divorced 8) Went to therapy 9) 35 years old still trying to graduate
This is how i translate this, and please don&#39;t take this the wrong way.
Grew up in a household with inhumane parents having potato IQ. Because of that i also developed potato IQ that led me in getting abused at age 10.&lt;
So my IQ as a child of 10 led me to being sexually abused by a 21 year old man? Like I just looked so dumb laying there sleeping that I asked for it. That is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. 
Because of my lack of brain i was showing my tits to strangers for a ride to school which i had to drop out because i did not know how the brain works. 
Then as a consequence i married another man with a potato IQ because no one else would take me, this resulted in a bad relationship where i was abused again, but because i cant think i had kids with him.
 As an irresponsible parent i am it resulted of my daughter to get abused too, then i finally decided to get a divorce and seek help in which i would never really recover because if i had a strong mentality i wouldn&#39;t be there on the first place
Now i&#39;m finally about to graduate but it really doesn&#39;t make any difference because i&#39;m 35 years old. This overall resulted in people understanding how stupid i am and because of my low IQ circle the other men see me as a pair of tits.
Meanwhile: I get help from the government which hard working citizens pay that sacrifice their lives to get education, acquire skills and work like dogs to make. I let vicious politicians to manipulate me for my vote which in return strips those hard working citizens from their rights. And while those citizens are being responsible and have kids responsibly i on the other hand pee kids which i never take care just because my paycheck gets bigger.
Conclusion: You will never get the life you want, whatever that is. There is no cure on people like you, everything comes down to how smart people are, no one can make you smart, this is up to you. I do feel sorry for what you went through but i also need to consider myself. The biggest problem we have in this country is that people like you that got a bad start and for whatever reason couldn&#39;t evolve are now the majority. The bad thing on this is that you cant make mindful decisions (obviously) but your vote not only stripped all our right internally but it also kills millions of people overseas. To top this we demand $15 minimum which in reality is the same amount that people with master degrees get overseas, which will further make corporations leave and bring even more financial problems in our economy. But even if they do stay here sadly they will not hire you, for low skill jobs they will automate the processes and for skill jobs they will bring someone from overseas because sadly they have more smart people than we do and they can pick and choose.
Overall i&#39;m sorry for what happened to you. If it makes it better i work 19 hrs a day over the past 7 years and pay around 40% in taxes as a single male without kids. So i don&#39;t have a great life either if that makes you feel better.
And so you know my parents were poor too, and had no education and spoke the same style of language as me, but back then it was normal i guess, and i believe they were very intelligent and respected people who made a lot of sacrifices. I took my life into my own hands from age 13, i accepted the physical beating as they just don&#39;t understand any better, i had to figure the whole education/university/career thing on my own and grew up to get a good job, be very responsible and acquired valuable skills, which i now consider using in seeking employment to a different country!! My point is this, we can&#39;t promote weakness and build our culture around that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, i just didn&#39;t know how stupid you are and i would have felt bad if you committed suicide or something, i&#39;m not embarrassed of what i said and Trump can go fuck himself if he wants. You see i don&#39;t care what people think of me, i say what i think no matter what,  if people don&#39;t like it its their problem. I&#39;m just sick of all this cry babies saying they were abused and treated bad and all that, yea its your responsibly to defend yourself. We became a nation of sleeping pussies that feel they deserve everything on a plate, thats the truth. We somehow feel that we are so superior and we are so kind and pure that we take care of each other and we are doing the right thing, illusions. We are the most stupid nation that everyone thinks he had the worst treatment and life. We believe that we deserve so much better. All the other nations are either dictators, stupid, 3rd world countries and its our responsibility to invade them and fix everything. I have no compassion for us, we dont deserve compassion when we are responsible of millions of deaths. You say you were molested, well your decisions get 10 year old Syrian kids blown up. You deserve no compassion. And i give 0 shit of nobody, i take care myself how you also take care only yourself because this is the environment you are promoting. I know i have no rights, i accepted that long time ago. So whatever, at least i know my hands have no blood on them because i accept and put my head down when i see what we&#39;re doing, you on the other hand deny the reality, so your hands are a river of blood. When i die i can rest in peace knowing that i took no involvement in the massacre that is going on around us. You are a murderer like the candidate you are voting for. So yea, i dont feel bad for you, you can go fuck yourself. A human being that takes part in taking the lives of other people is the worst thing in my book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea i agree, i let myself feel bad and think you might take it very wrong and harm yourself. Silly me, how did i let myself go. I forgot i said to myself not to feel bad for people like you. But now i get it even more, as a said go fuck yourself you murderer. </p>

<p>Now i&#39;m even more convinced that what happens to you is not coincidence, its called karma and you deserve it. Trying to use comments to manipulate more into your bloodbath is pure evil. And i&#39;m sure your paid by Hillary to be here, you&#39;re probably working for her campaign or something. Fuck Trump, fuck Hillary and fuck people like you. I hope hell does exist because you have a first class ticket there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you deleted it to protect me? In case I were to go and harm myself after reading your made up interpretation of my life? This is what you&#39;re saying? Even though, when you deleted it, you knew I had already read it because I had replied. See, I assumed you actually deleted it because it makes you look like a huge asshole with fucked up morals.  Your explanation makes much more sense. Thanks for clearing that up <a href="/r/SpongeRedditor">/r/SpongeRedditor</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just respond to my latest post instead of editing and adding onto your previous comments? That changes the flow of the conversation for other reader, as I&#39;m sure you know. You just added this part:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, by saying that i care it wont really make me care, i already told you that. In my eyes you are an ignorant murderer and you only care about yourself. I can literally see you getting raped and i will just turn the other way and mind my own business. In my eyes you killed people and deny the accusations and take no responsibility about your votes and actions. You deserve every single bad thing that comes your way. I don&#39;t care about you or any other sheep like you. How else can i explain it? I did feel bad saying what i said the first time and i thought it was a dick move to say that and that&#39;s why i deleted the comment, you convinced me though that it was my bad for feeling something about you. You deserve no compassion. You&#39;re by any definition a Hitler supporter and i made a big mistake to feel bad for saying those things to you. You deserved every single word and i just got more convinced that people like you don&#39;t deserve to be considered as humans. So bye now you murderer, i wont spend any more time talking to someone like you. You don&#39;t worth consideration or even 1 minute of my time.</p>
