And of course those lower down are just putting the plan into action, never having &quot;authority&quot; to actually do anything with Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying but it does not work that way right now. I have a friend who worked in Dc from Nixon to big bush an he was saying that it is fucking crazy right now because of corney. Many people are pissed he embarrassed them by licking shitlaries wrinkled clit and they want to do something. The problem is if that cunt wins they are all fucked bad. So right now they must protect their careers an lives and be mad in science. I do not agree with it, but that is what it is. One of his good friends just quit the fbi sacrificing their retirement just to get out ouf there that is how bad it is right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government Communication departments do media monitoring because they need to fashion messages for their talking heads to go into interviews ready for Q &amp; A. Of course even that is controlled, for example &quot;Only these topics can be covered&quot;. In Hillary&#39;s case reporters actually work with her comms team to craft questions!</p>

<p>For social media, I highly doubt two communication specialists and even including another few contractors have the time to sift through thousands of social media posts every hour. So they now likely use fairly advanced artificial intelligence (really just algorithms) programs sorting through all the chaffe and get notifications / alerts to users of that program. I haven&#39;t seen these first hand, other than common mass aggregation programs to view and send in multiple social media sites simultaneously, yet it makes sense they&#39;d be analyzing big data as well, and just deal with the most popular. (Ex - Alert: negative tone to your chosen keywords, post title, social website link and top 3 voted comments.) </p>

<p>This is of course separate to paying voter shills. For that, they could just outsource to to company in India or China, and instruct them, &quot;for posts and comments related to these topics, vote them up or down etc.</p>
