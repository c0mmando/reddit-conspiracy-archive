       The compartmentalized structure is so easy to control and corrupt. 
And of course those lower down are just putting the plan into action, never having "authority" to actually do anything with Clinton.
But looks like they are reaching an apex of short, everywhere.

       They will choose to keep their tails between their legs and their mouths shut. If they talk and lose, they lose their cushy no fault government job. No one has the balls to stand up for what is right anymore except us and we are on the outside yelling into a wind tunnel.

       If enough of them stand up then they could make their careers more successful then they'd have ever been otherwise. Imagine being 1 of the 100 agents to expose a coup of the American government. Imagine being the lead agent, you'd almost certainly be honored by the public with a very handsome career.

       I get what you are saying but it does not work that way right now. I have a friend who worked in Dc from Nixon to big bush an he was saying that it is fucking crazy right now because of corney. Many people are pissed he embarrassed them by licking shitlaries wrinkled clit and they want to do something. The problem is if that cunt wins they are all fucked bad. So right now they must protect their careers an lives and be mad in science. I do not agree with it, but that is what it is. One of his good friends just quit the fbi sacrificing their retirement just to get out ouf there that is how bad it is right now.

       Government Communication departments do media monitoring because they need to fashion messages for their talking heads to go into interviews ready for Q &amp; A. Of course even that is controlled, for example "Only these topics can be covered". In Hillary's case reporters actually work with her comms team to craft questions!
      </p>
      <p>
       For social media, I highly doubt two communication specialists and even including another few contractors have the time to sift through thousands of social media posts every hour. So they now likely use fairly advanced artificial intelligence (really just algorithms) programs sorting through all the chaffe and get notifications / alerts to users of that program. I haven't seen these first hand, other than common mass aggregation programs to view and send in multiple social media sites simultaneously, yet it makes sense they'd be analyzing big data as well, and just deal with the most popular. (Ex - Alert: negative tone to your chosen keywords, post title, social website link and top 3 voted comments.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course separate to paying voter shills. For that, they could just outsource to to company in India or China, and instruct them, "for posts and comments related to these topics, vote them up or down etc.

       FBI agents are compartmentalized. Compartmentalization is one of the most critical elements to making people do a job without much or any true concern for what they are a part of.

       I like this idea of appealing to them. Especially as individuals.  Can we get this message out further? How?

       I am afraid they don't give a shit. They are cops, cops watch other cops back, period. As long as the money keeps coming in, that's all that matters. If they suddenly stopped getting paid, people like HRC and her banker support group would go to jail faster that you can blink.

       There are some great people in the FBI that try to do the right thing every day.  I would argue that the majority of the FBI are good people. They are just caught up in the shitstorm and trying to keep their jobs.

       It's not their fault that the tree rots from the top up on this one.
