<p><strong>Problems with double helix model</strong></p>

<p>The double helix structure of DNA was discovered using x-ray crystallography in the early 1950s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/213e5d8dc417eee9e7fcfce53c100857ee96eed7.jpg">http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/213e5d8dc417eee9e7fcfce53c100857ee96eed7.jpg</a></p>

<p>This picture and others like it are the only pieces of data we have regarding the structure of DNA.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If DNA were really a double helix, why are the only pictures we see taken from above?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are there no pictures of DNA from the side?</p></li>
<li><p>Why don&#39;t we ever see the classic figure of 8 style picture like <a href="http://biosocialmethods.isr.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DNA_basesv2.png">this?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>X-ray crystallography involves 360 degree rotation, so we should see the DNA molecule in all orientations.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with the 2012 DNA pictures</strong></p>

<p>In 2012, scientists published these pictures of DNA using a transmission electron microscope.</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/assets_c/2012/11/1-dna-imaged-with-electron-microscope-for-the-first-time-thumb-615x461-106831.jpeg">1</a>
<a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/dn22545-dna-imaged-with-electron-microscope-for-the-first-time.jpeg">2</a></p>

<p>I have one big problem with this.</p>

<p>TEM relies on electrons passing through the specimen.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The DNA double helix (allegedly) contains a phosphate backbone. Phosphate ions are negatively charged, how did the electrons pass through, without being repulsed?</p></li>
<li><p>As noted by Harold Hillman, electron microscopy can introduce artefacts during preparation. How do we know that the above pictures are not simply pieces of metal?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DNA is located in the nucleus, yet cells can function without the nucleus!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: The results demonstrate that the information necessary for attachment, spreading, shape formation, pinocytosis, contact inhibition, and cell locomotion is present in enucleated cytoplasm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/70/3/750.full.pdf">Goldman et al 1973</a></p>

<p>If DNA is needed for protein synthesis and sending instructions, how is it that cells can function without a nucleus. Why don&#39;t enucleated cells die?</p>

<p><strong>Speculation</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how our genetic information is carried between organisms, but I have a theory as to how they do race based dna testing and paternity testing.</p>

<p>We have millions of bacteria cells on us and inside of us. The makeup of bacterial species differs from person to person and between ethnic groups!</p>

<p>This was used to separate two closely related ethnic groups in India in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15051885">2004</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe this is how they do racial heritage tests, they use our bacteria?</p>

<p>More difficult to envisage is how they manage to do paternity testing.</p>

<p>The theory of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/02/baby-looks-like-ex-research">Telegony</a> has been given increasing media attention recently.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bacteria on your sperm influences the characteristics of your child?</p>

<p>We know already that mothers can pass on traits through <a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2015/02/mothers-can-pass-traits-to-offspring-through-bacteria-dna/">bacteria.</a></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I don&#39;t think that pregnancy is a psy op. Our mothers remember giving birth to us. Children definitely resemble their parents somewhat, so there is definitely some form of &#39;information&#39; being passed down onto the offspring, the question is how and by what mechanism...?</p>

<p>I will do a post about the Germ theory hoax and the emerging problems with &#39;DNA forensic analysis&#39;...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The human DNA has been sequenced. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what I thought too. But this <a href="http://phys.org/news/2011-07-scientists-seventh-eighth-bases-dna.html">article</a> gives me doubts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For decades, scientists have known that DNA consists of four basic units -- adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine. Those four bases have been taught in science textbooks and have formed the basis of the growing knowledge regarding how genes code for life. Yet in recent history, scientists have expanded that list from four to six.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So they had already expanded the list of nucleotide bases from four to six!?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, with a finding published online in the July 21, 2011, issue of the journal Science, researchers from the UNC School of Medicine have discovered the seventh and eighth bases of DNA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>and now they claim there are eight bases!</strong></p>

<p>I will look over the cloned sheep and make a longer post/comment about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These last two bases – called 5-formylcytosine and 5 carboxylcytosine – are actually versions of cytosine that have been modified by Tet proteins, molecular entities thought to play a role in DNA demethylation and stem cell reprogramming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are just demthylated, which all are very dynamic and &quot;wave like&quot; in properties in the biochemistry of your DNA.. at the level of view like the OP, there would hardly be a physical difference in properties at the molecular level. If this was a science section I&#39;d look up the molecular properties of the last 2 bases.
So I&#39;m saying your theory hardly holds up with even a bit of knowledge... and im lit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think race based testing may be real, but I don&#39;t think they can accurately do forensic testing or paternity testing.</p>

<p>My best guess is that they collect samples of the various bacteria found in certain areas (europe, east asia, sub-saharan africa) and then compare these samples with the bacteria they find in our mouths. </p>

<p>Even the MSM is reporting on the problems with DNA forensics.

<p>Clues forum had a thread about <a href="http://cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;amp;t=1487&amp;amp;start=15">DNA forensics.</a></p>

<p>Bruce Lipton has an article about his theory on how our <a href="https://www.brucelipton.com/blog/how-our-thoughts-control-our-dna">thoughts control our DNA.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0MMfHoye2E">This video</a> talks about how both creationists and evolutionists assume that DNA is a real thing.</p>

<p>He also mentions the CGI photos of the double helix and the fact that what they show as DNA looks like a worm.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find any articles on DNA itself not existing I&#39;m afraid.</p>

<p>There are plenty about DNA ancestry tests being a scam though.</p>

<p>It basically talks about how one single gene can produce multiple proteins. It&#39;s called Alternative Splicing.</p>

<p>It ties this in with GMOs, because GMOs are based on the idea that one gene produces one protein only, but alternative splicing proves that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>He also elaborates on the fact that DNA requires special proteins to align without mistake. On its own DNA makes a mistake in one 100 bases, with the appropriate enzymes the rate of error drops to one in 10 billion.</p>
