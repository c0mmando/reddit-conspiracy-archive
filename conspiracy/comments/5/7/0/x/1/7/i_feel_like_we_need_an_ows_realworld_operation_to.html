       Make a website outlining info, create a QR code to the links, print graphics on cards with the QR codes to more info. Spread them around the city and offer them for free (open source - no copy right) to download/re-distribute/print. Watch it all burn down? Be the change you wish to see in the world.. If you need any consulting on any of this (tech wise), lemme know. I don't usually respond to PM's though, I keep things transparent and in the open.

       You're in luck. I'm a web designer, web developer, freelance, and could give two fucks. You compile a list, and I could come up with the design and dev. Spit ballin' but the domain could be: usofcorruption.com. Get at me. Do the research, anyone else here a graphic designer? I do design, but mainly just for web and not print.

      <p>
       The Honorable Douglas J. Band currently serves as Counselor to President William J. Clinton and is a Founding Partner and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Teneo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Band began his career working in the White House in 1995 and has been with President Clinton for 16 years. He has served as President Clinton's chief advisor since 2002, counseling him, serving as the key architect of Mr. Clinton's post-Presidency,
       <em>
        and overseeing the 1,400 employees and volunteers of the William J. Clinton Foundation. He continues to serve as President Clinton's most senior advisor.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to his role as Counselor to President Clinton, Mr. Band served in the White House Counsel's office for four years, becoming a Special Assistant to the President before he was made one of the youngest Deputy Assistants ever to serve a President of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Band is a graduate of the University of Florida and while working at the White House for 6 years, he simultaneously obtained a masters degree from Georgetown University in Liberal Arts and a Law degree from Georgetown University Law School by attending both programs in the evenings.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Counselor to President Clinton, Mr. Band has traveled to nearly 100 countries and over 2,000 cities. He created and built the Clinton Global Initiative that to date has raised over $63 billion for nearly 2,000 philanthropic initiatives around the world which in total has impacted over 300 million people in 180 countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Mr. Band continues to serve his country in assisting various domestic agencies and advising foreign governments on nation building, infrastructure creation and democratic governance structure. He serves as President Clinton's representative to the White House and other governments, organizations and businesses around the world. Additionally, Mr. Band has advised several heads of state on their transitions out of office. He orchestrated the release of two American journalists captured in North Korea in the summer of 2009 and has assisted in the rebuilding of nations and regions after some of the worst natural disasters in the past decade including southeast Asia, Haiti, New Orleans and Gujarat, India. He serves on the Coca-Cola Company International Advisory Board, on the Advisory Board of Avenue Capital and as a member of the faculty of New York University as an adjunct professor.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       (He also upped his "philanthropic initiative" stats on the newer release but this is less important than the omissions.)
