       start by allowing discussion. having it be basically illegal is part of what makes it suspicious. there are lies within the story, flaws that can be pointed out. these are normally overlooked. the fact that other prison camps were run by the nazis as well is constantly overlooked, the insane amount of coverage given to this topic by the media and movies draws it into suspect. the fact that palestinians are being subjected to horrible treatment at the hands of jews and is constantly ignore by supposed humanitarian based societies is strange. that america supports isreal with billions every year to continue is cause for concern, and really given its on going nature why are you not more interested in the current suffering than protection of a past events portrayal in history? nothing in the past justifies current conditions in palestine.

        how to defeat deniers
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Can’t BE defeated. None of the following questions are answerable by the shills:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Elie Wiesel and countless other Jews survive the Holocaust if it was the intention of the Third Reich to eliminate every Jew? Elie was a prisoner for several years; other Jews survived even longer. Most of these “survivors” were ordinary people who did not have any unique expertise that the Germans could have exploited. There was no logical reason for them to be kept alive if the goal was extermination. The very existence of more than a million survivors even today, some sixty years later, contradicts one of the basic components of the Holocaust; i.e. that the Germans had a policy to eliminate every Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no mention of the Holocaust in Churchill’s six volume History of the Second World War, the wartime memoirs of either De Gaulle or Eisenhower, or any of the other lesser luminaries who wrote about the Second World War? Keep in mind all these were written years after the war ended and thus after the Holocaust had been allegedly proven by the Nuremberg Trials. With regard to the Holocaust, the silence of these “cognoscenti” is deafening!
      </p>
      <p>
       What was an inmate infirmary (and a brothel) doing in Auschwitz if in fact it was a death camp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the Germans round up Jews from their far-flung empire (thereby tying up large numbers of personnel and rolling stock, while fighting a world war on two fronts) to deliver people to “death camps” hundreds of miles away to simply execute them upon arrival? Wouldn’t a bullet on the spot have appealed to the legendary German sense of efficiency?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, after seventy years, have historians been unable to come up with a single German document that points to the Holocaust? Should we believe the likes of Raul Hilberg that in the place of written orders there was an “incredible meeting of the minds” by the literally tens of thousands of people who would have had to coordinate their actions in order to carry out an undertaking of this magnitude?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is is still insisted upon that six million Jews were killed when the official Jewish death toll at Auschwitz, the flagship of the Holocaust gulag, has been reduced from an immediate post-war figure of 4 million to a figure of less than 1 million? Why do many respond to this observation by saying, “What’s the difference whether it’s six million or one million?” The answer is that the difference is five million. Another difference is that saying so can get you three years in an Austrian jail… just ask David Irving!
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Germany’s wartime codes were compromised, including the one used to send daily reports from Auschwitz to Berlin. The transcripts of these messages make no mention of mass executions or even remotely suggest a genocidal program in progress. Furthermore, it has been insisted that the Germans used a kind of euphemistic code when discussing their extermination program of the Jews–e.g. “final solution”, special treatment, resettlement, etc. Why was it necessary for them to use such coded euphemisms when talking to one another unless they thought their codes had been cracked by the Allies? And then why would they still use cracked codes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The water table at Auschwitz lies a mere 18 inches below the surface, which makes claims of huge burning pits for the disposal of tens of thousands of victims untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially, claims were made that mass executions in homicidal gas chambers had taken place in camps located within the boundaries of the old Reich (e.g. Dachau, Bergen-Belsen). “Evidence” to that effect was every bit as compelling as what is offered for other camps–located in occupied Poland–yet without explanation in the early sixties we were told that this was not the case and that all the “death camps” were located in the East (i.e. Poland), outside (some would say conveniently) the probing eyes of western scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has been able to reconcile the eyewitness accounts that personnel entered the gas chambers after 20 minutes without any protective gear, and the fact that Zyklon B was a “time release” fumigant that would have had a lethal capability for at least another 24 hours. And that even after 24 hours the corpses would have themselves remained sufficiently contaminated by the hydrogen cyanide gas that they would have had the capacity to kill anyone who touched them who was not wearing protective gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we no longer hear claims that the Germans manufactured soap, lampshades, and riding britches from the bodies of dead Jews? Could it be that in the light of modem forensics and DNA knowledge these claims are totally untenable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we no longer hear claims that huge numbers of Jews were exterminated in massive steam chambers or electrocuted on special grids? “Evidence” of this was presented at Nuremberg–evidence that sent men to the gallows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elie Wiesel has been described as “the Apostle of Remembrance,” yet in his memoir, Night, which details his stay at Auschwitz, he makes no mention of the now infamous homicidal gas chambers. Isn’t this a bit like one of the Gospels making no mention of the Cross?
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtually every survivor who was examined at Auschwitz says that he or she was examined by the infamous Dr. Mengele.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to survivor testimony, hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed at Treblinka and then buried in mass graves in the surrounding area. Why is it that extensive sonar probing of these burial grounds reveals that this alleged final resting place for Holocaust victims has remained undisturbed since at least the last ice age?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Proof” of the Holocaust rests primarily on survivor testimony. There is little, if any, hard evidence. The best of this has been described by Jean Claude Pressac as merely “criminal traces.” Even Judge Grey who presided at the Irving-Lipstadt Trial commented that he was surprised the evidence pointing to the Holocaust was “extremely thin.” To paraphrase Arthur Butz, “a crime of this magnitude would have left a mountain of evidence.” Where is it? There was more hard evidence against O. J. Simpson at his trial and he was found innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has Holocaust revisionism been criminalized in at least eleven countries? What other historic truth needs the threat of prison or the destruction of one’s career to maintain itself? Should someone be sent to prison for expressing skepticism about the official Chinese claim that they suffered 35 million dead in World War II?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the court historians insist that “denying the Holocaust” is like denying slavery or saying the Earth is flat? The leading Revisionists are first rate scholars who hold advanced degrees from the world’s leading universities. Is there anyone comparable among those who say the world is flat or that slavery never existed? Notice again that it is not illegal to say the Earth is flat or that slavery never existed. The truth of these things does not seem to need legal protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Promoters of the Holocaust have expressed concerns about remembering the Holocaust once the last survivors die. Why haven’t Civil War historians expressed similar concerns since the last survivor of that conflict died in 1959?
      </p>
      <p>
       Survivors of the Holocaust have testified that smoke billowed from the crematoriums as they consumed the bodies of murdered victims–some eyewitnesses even claimed they could detect national origins by the color of the smoke. How can this be reconciled with the fact that properly operating crematoriums do not produce smoke of any color?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official version of the Holocaust, hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were rounded up in mid-1944 and sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately upon arrival and their bodies were disposed of by burning in huge open air pits using railroad ties and gasoline. Why is that there is no evidence of these huge funerary pyres in the high resolution surveillance photos taken by Allied aircraft overflying the camp on a daily basis during this time period? Furthermore, why have no remains been found, since open pit burning, even when gasoline is used, generates insufficient heat to totally consume a body?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the liberated camps were littered with corpses; is there a single autopsy report or any other forensic evidence that shows that even a single one of these deaths was a consequence of poison gas?
      </p>
      <p>
       The death toll for the Holocaust relies exclusively on population statistics provided by Jewish sources; has any independent demographic study been produced that shows that approximately six million Jews were “missing” at the end of the war? Why do the wartime inspection reports of camps made by the International Red Cross contain no references to mass executions? It strains credulity that such monumental crimes could be hidden. The only explanations are that either these crimes were not occurring or that the Red Cross was complicit in a cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has there been no effort to respond to the Leuchter Report? “The Holocaust was technologically possible because it happened.” Why is this intellectually bankrupt argument, which turns scholarship on its head, considered by the promoters of the Holocaust as historical truth, and considered a sufficient response to the mounting Revisionist evidence to the contrary? What other historical truths rely to the extent that the Holocaust does on so-called “eyewitness” testimony, and why have none of these witnesses ever been cross-examined?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official version of the Holocaust, the Jews remained ignorant of their fate until the very end–so skillful were their Nazi murderers in deceiving their victims. How can this ignorance be reconciled with the fact that the Jews have historically been, as a group, the most literate and highly informed people on the planet, with legendary access to (and subversion of) the highest echelons of government?

       Some of your points have obvious answers. The functionalist theory says that there was no organised intention of killing all to the last one, but as food was lacking, killing the weaklings/kids/elderly to save food was done at a large scale. There is no need for a top to bottom control with a lot of written communication and complex plans. You just need the boss to say in a one to one meeting with his superiors "Hey, I have not enough food to feed all those people, I started killing some, is it ok ? Yep, that's fine, keep doing it".
      </p>

       There were lots of people in Varsaw ghetto before it was emptied and much less were found alive at the end. Some died in between.

       one day you'll ask the question, maybe, just maybe, if 109 countries have kicked us out, just maybe it is something we are doing, and not that everyone else is a dick, as seems to be your assumption, just maybe they don't like being manipulated, and get righteously anger at the instigator, and in this case, it would appear to be you, given how you have acted here, and my past interactions upon this topic.

       i would add that source material, such as the actual facilities used do not support the numbers.  all the survivors appearing on television were actors before the war, what are the odds.  some can't keep their story straight either, once saying he cried when freed another time saying he had no energy to cry.  really?  dude couldn't remember such a moment....

       lets talk about facts instead of calling names.  let us examine what is real, what is practical, and what just doesn't make sense.  the numbers are out of wack, there weren't that many jews there.  the fact that talking about this brings you out (a flamer), with you lil supporters (that back you up with zero content) that say nothing actually strengthens my case.  you literally never say anything, if i show you pictures that were falsified, would you consider them?  if i show you facilities claimed to have gased and cremated 6 million jews prove inadequate, would you ask more questions?

       Honestly I think people like you are trolls either paid or bored that aim to remove credibility from a group by association. There are much more important things/conspiracies going on right now and to try and start a conversation to argue something like this is a joke. I imagine you fly the confederate flag in your room.

       once again, running from the conversation,  asserting it is simple truth, then use of name calling.
      </p>
      <p>
       each falsity will be removed in good time.  if this one wasn't so prevalent and used to benefit it would have gone away by now, it is because being a victim is useful that it continues, and also the backlash of its falsity would be equally great given how it has been used.

       You are a revisionist. You have a predetermined conclusion in your head and search for specific things to support your argument ignoring the insane amount of evidence against it. You want proof? Go to a museum, read a book, talk to a historian or even better yet a survivor. Look at facts and shed your bigoted beliefs.

       I have no predetermined conclusion. I saw all the evidence in museums and am well traveled.   I saw all the movies, read all the books.  it is because of the onesidedness of the stories that resembles that of 9.11 which I've concluded was a farce.  9.11 is also asked to be taken on faith without question, but I've seen the many holes in the story.  I researched every aspect of how the 9.11 commission report didn't repeat the truth but up lies that painted a different picture than I saw and I saw it was intentional.  now we come to the how you defend the holocaust in the exact same manner of 9.11.  you call me bigoted but I know myself to be fair and true even at the expense of my own gain.  if only you can produce people that tell me what happen, and yet the physical evidence does not exist...  when laws are enacted to restrict even questioning.  you sir are a bearing false witness.  love and peace to all beings.

       I have family who died in the Holocaust. I have seen at least 7 different survivors speak. I have been to countless Holocaust museums and have seen the pictures and physical evidence. I have been to Germany where no one denies it. The country that committed these atrocities does not deny it, and thousands of Nazi's have admitted to their crimes, which has been recorded and put on record.

       Anyone who believes the Holocaust did not happen is coming from a bigoted antisemitic neo-Nazi stance.

       right, because noooo one would ever sink so low.  can't imagine it.  i don't need to imagine it, look around you as it has been used to great effect.  any and all discussion ceases. I was immediately banned.  if it is really so uncontravertable why can't it stand up to scrutiny and require me to take it on 'because look at what you are saying, your saying these people lied about all that pain, as if, you just can't say that man.'

       whelp, i've seen some pretty fucked up shit in my life, and that little mauneavor would be no surprise.  my mind can go bigger.  what if your whole religion was manufactured?  what if you creating whatever you think about, and because you think you are children of a wraithful god that is your life experience... because you think you'll be ill treated, you do things to protect yourself, then find yourself being attacted because your manipulating others, but no you won't see that, instead you'll go after them more because now the threat is real!  omg...

       once you realize this, you can use it, then you start to trust it, then you let it guide you.  that is the natural way to grow faith, in my opinion.  being told does not lead to the experience, and the deep realization that is needed to use faith to change deeply imbedded belief systems.
