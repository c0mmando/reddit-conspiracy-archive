       ANOTHER EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       ******Hi, I am a user who does his own thing, I like to constructively communicate and be logical with my discussion as best as I can, and admit my mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was on a thread,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57wu3f/something_screwey_is_happening_in_the_donald/">
        this one specifically
       </a>
       , with a fellow user, we were simply testing if what he had stated within his thread was true, all I did was go to r/The_Donald, and I typed in: "Trump needs to bring this up at the next debate" as, we wanted to see if the message would be removed. There was no harassment involved, just honestly testing to see if his theory/conspiracy was true (we were in r/conspiracy).
      </p>
      <p>
       I then received this PM roughly 30 seconds later: "You have been automatically banned for participating in a "safe place for people who hate Muslims".
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       systemically harasses individuals and communities, including this one. An overwhelming majority of subreddits in this list have already been ""quarantined"" or banned by Reddit. Content and activity you provide to the hatereddit harms this community due to Reddit's algorithms and breaks our rules. We are willing to reverse the ban only if you will completely disengage from these hatereddits. If you will not immediately cooperate with our rules, then do not contact us; we will ignore any other response."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pure, and utter harassment. I did nothing to speak negatively to no one, including Muslims. They technically suddenly harassed me, within a separate community. The content, and activity within r/The_Donald was not harmful to anyone, and did not break a single rule, their algorithm hunted me down in a separate subreddit for something unrelated to their obvious bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will gladly co-operate with their rules, but I would rather run this by the admins, as they openly harass people for literally nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would understand if I was EVER subscribed to r/The_Donald (I have never been(to my knowledge)), that this would be a little bit more understandable, but it is not. Please look into this, this is abuse, and I have no clue what "You've just met the ctr reddit sleeper cell. Clinton's terrorist organization." means, but I think you should look into this as well.
I hope you have a great day. I will not submit anything to the moderators at r/offmychest, I do not want them to feel as if they are being harassed.******
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck r/offmychest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is fully compromised, anyone to think they can pass information on here safely is stupid. This was downvoted immediately here:

      </p>
      <p>
       It has been upvoted by a few fellow users. &lt;3.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: 1 month later, sitting at 104 karma, lets see where its at next month if they haven't admitted he's gone yet.

       Maybe as a whole. But even then I think that is debatable. I actually think most people are just so caught up in the whirlwind that they are being swept along. I don't think that makes them inherently terrible though.

       That's part of our predicament though. On an individual level, were we to stand up and do something we would be locked away or disposed of. 
And unfortunately, a united effort by the people hasn't happened yet. And all attempts in the past decade or so have been subverted. Look at occupy wall-street for instance. 
Together we stand, divided we fall. And they have done such a wonderful job of divide and conquer, that no one is prepared to work together. The left is so hateful of the right, and vice versa, that it is nearly impossible. 
And if that's not your thing, there are plenty of races to hate, or religions, or man vs woman. Christ, they now have a plethora of genders to chose from to stir that particular pot. Point is, there is no shortage of division, but I see very little that brings people together anymore.

       yup.... completely went through and broke down that thread earlier, it was just a warning sent to John kerry (US), Ecuador, and the UK, letting them know (and provided something (people were calling them hashes? Idk)) the information he had was legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This (thread) lines up with after that. They took the threat seriously.

       Also main news networks in the UK as of today are covering the 'Battle of Mosul' on the front page. War is coming. 
Something big has certainly happened in the last 12 hours, those posts you provide could be an explanation but we need confirmation. I live near an airbase and have noticed loads of activity in the last month or two compared to the general quietness over the past few years.

       Something big is going on, the island has more aircraft than anytime in the last 9 years. They have blocked off some access roads and are now parking aircraft on the road. Barriers have been set up around the aircraft areas. Temporary barracks and hangers are popping up everywhere. A tent city full of AF and Navy maintenance personnel has also been set up.
      </p>

       I have never seen B1s and B2s there at the same time. Actually I have never seen more than 1 there at a time.

       Security is nuts I had to show my id at least 8 times a day
      </p>
      <p>
       My coworker is former AF and said they are like that when nukes are around. We counted over a dozen air refueling tankers on the ground. The airfield had a take off or landing every 15 minutes, very busy. When we flew out we waited in line for quite a while. We never had to wait in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Navy had the docks full of ships and 6 to 8 more were moored just off shore. We watched many pallets of bombs being off loaded from one ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a bunch of B-52's coming in that were painted flat black. I have not seen that before.

       About the pastebin text, I want to be optimistic about the fact that he's alive and still in the Embassy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in light of this, know that journalists will sometimes write two versions of a story in advance of a major event. This way, they can be "fastest to market" by just observing if A was elected, or B was elected, then they just publish the appropriate article version. I realize this dude is not a journalist, but this is my shred of hope that he's still protected from extradition or assassination in the embassy.

       To add context to this, I was posting about the dangers of taking on syrian "refugees" aiming to show users the vast Rapes of german girls in masse over newyears 2015 -
      </p>
      <p>
       I was written and told By reddit THis is not a place for free speech, and that this was a Private company - (Referring to all of reddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       So technically I think the greater picture is that reddit itself is compromised, and or complicit to the Muslim movement as a whole, and that any party which seeks to validate a concern; Is essentially a threat to their goals and objectives -
      </p>
      <p>
       That is really all I can say is that this is a pr website and within it subs like conspiracy are open forums only to the extent they "play along" - 
I respect the mods in this community, and I would be interested to see the level of B.S. they put up with as the real MVP's standing up to our users "rights" to assemble here.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO they also are being used (the mods here). To essentially file reports on users in their postings, which the greater bulk of reddit will use against them in algorithms which segregate "critical thinkers" from articles that are easily taken apart by anyone other then the "spoon fed". (Think HRC followers).
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though the mods here are legit. It would be my opinion that we are still being selectively stripped from our free speech in its entirety, and in the future it will be harder and harder to actually work against this totalitarian system.

       What did everyone think would happen once "MSM" starting losing ratings? This website has been infiltrated for a while now. The influence grew clear to many during the debates. Now they are back in maintenance mode.

       This Napster of a forum will be supplanted with a propaganda ministers worst nightmare.

       I'm unclear. You were banned from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or another sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who sent you the PM? A moderator or an admin or just a user harassing you?
