<p>I&#39;m not saying Trump could or would do the same, but never underestimate the power of a madman. Sometimes when you have a crazy world, perhaps a man who is crazy is the only one who isn&#39;t out of his element.</p>

<p>Seriously though, Jackson was 10x crazier, (more?) /racist and legitimately violent and dangerous. They even had to remove his parrot from his funeral because it was swearing compulsively. </p>

<p>Yes, it most certainly is. Contrary to what you read in the Main Stream Media (MSM), Putin is actually a sane and responsible adult - which is more than can be said of almost all of the United States politicians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trump is a businessman. He likes money. Killing everyone on earth is not a good way to make money. Hillary Clinton is a psychopath and thoroughly criminal. Therefore she is very likely to see to it that we all die in a horrible, radiation saturated, gory death (for those not lucky enough to be at ground zero). She is batshit crazy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes they can. All that is needed is for the United States to stop fucking with other countries and stop provoking Russia. The United States Military needs to go home and stay there! They are, after all, called the Department of the <strong>Defense</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t disagree, the sensationalism you&#39;ve included in your description of Hillary deludes the fact that in actuality she is a business woman as well, it&#39;s this businessperson attitude that worships capitalism above all that is demeaning the American economy and image on a global scale and it&#39;s an attitude that her and Trump share. </p>

<p>In my opinion it&#39;s this attitude that we need to abandon as Americans if we want any real and positive change. The answer does not lie with Clinton or Trump. </p>

<p>In my mind it&#39;s a system of direct democracy where we lead and policy ourselves instead of relying on the elect to do a job that they clearly have been neglecting. Our options are basically unlimited.</p>

<p>The American people are never going to mobilize. Not as long as there are working iPhones, TV, gas for the gas guzzlers, sports and lots of disgusting food on the store shelves and in McDonald&#39;s. In short - distractions. This is by design. The people are in a prison and they don&#39;t have a clue. The elite folks who actually run the country know this and perpetuate it intentionally.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t. That is the purpose of <em>propaganda</em> - to lie (or suppress the truth) about any viable alternatives. The people at the top (Politicians, Central Bankers, Military leaders...etc &quot;elites&quot;) like it this way and will fight to everyone&#39;s death to make it <em>stay this way</em>.</p>

<p>97 years and counting. You might want to research the late Edward Bernays. He was the nephew of the famous Sigmund Freud. Edward Bernays invented propaganda and the &quot;consumer society&quot; that we find ourselves in today. So, yes, &quot;never&quot; is a strong word but it seems to be holding so far.</p>

<p>This is exactly one of the reasons for the elite to start a world war. If/when the people actually wake up, the elite don&#39;t want to be &quot;tarred and feathered&quot;...and so a world war is the perfect misdirect.</p>
