       Well, for those of you who aren't familiar with Andrew Jackson check out the Video. What few mention is that he killed the Federal Reserve(well at least the first version) and is one of, if not the only presidents to pay of the national debt.

       I'm not saying Trump could or would do the same, but never underestimate the power of a madman. Sometimes when you have a crazy world, perhaps a man who is crazy is the only one who isn't out of his element.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, Jackson was 10x crazier, (more?) /racist and legitimately violent and dangerous. They even had to remove his parrot from his funeral because it was swearing compulsively.

       Remember that Hillary Clinton is guilty of Treason, Murder and a whole lot of other crimes. She will take America (and the rest of the world) into World War III - the real version. Trump is only guilty of being a load mouth and a pussy grabber. Is Trump really so crazy a choice?

       Yes, it most certainly is. Contrary to what you read in the Main Stream Media (MSM), Putin is actually a sane and responsible adult - which is more than can be said of almost all of the United States politicians.

       Because certain "sanity challenged" people (see above) want to provoke war in order to advance their evil and insane personal agendas.

       Let me boil this down to brass tacks. I don't give a shit who gets elected. I just don't want to die in Nuclear War! The Russians aren't the bad guys here...The United States is! Trump will not start a nuclear war...even if he is in the same camp as Hillary. Trump can't be bought...Hillary can. Get it?

       Trump is a businessman. He likes money. Killing everyone on earth is not a good way to make money. Hillary Clinton is a psychopath and thoroughly criminal. Therefore she is very likely to see to it that we all die in a horrible, radiation saturated, gory death (for those not lucky enough to be at ground zero). She is batshit crazy.

       Yes they can. All that is needed is for the United States to stop fucking with other countries and stop provoking Russia. The United States Military needs to go home and stay there! They are, after all, called the Department of the

       While I don't disagree, the sensationalism you've included in your description of Hillary deludes the fact that in actuality she is a business woman as well, it's this businessperson attitude that worships capitalism above all that is demeaning the American economy and image on a global scale and it's an attitude that her and Trump share.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion it's this attitude that we need to abandon as Americans if we want any real and positive change. The answer does not lie with Clinton or Trump.

       EXACTLY!

       there are alternatives but it's going to take the mobilization of the American people to realize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering how people are unable to look past the options given to us by criminalilized political mobs and see that there are alternatives to our current model of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind it's a system of direct democracy where we lead and policy ourselves instead of relying on the elect to do a job that they clearly have been neglecting. Our options are basically unlimited.

        there are alternatives but it's going to take the mobilization of the American people to realize them.

       The American people are never going to mobilize. Not as long as there are working iPhones, TV, gas for the gas guzzlers, sports and lots of disgusting food on the store shelves and in McDonald's. In short - distractions. This is by design. The people are in a prison and they don't have a clue. The elite folks who actually run the country know this and perpetuate it intentionally.

       They can't. That is the purpose of
       <em>
        propaganda

       - to lie (or suppress the truth) about any viable alternatives. The people at the top (Politicians, Central Bankers, Military leaders...etc "elites") like it this way and will fight to everyone's death to make it
       <em>
        stay this way

       97 years and counting. You might want to research the late Edward Bernays. He was the nephew of the famous Sigmund Freud. Edward Bernays invented propaganda and the "consumer society" that we find ourselves in today. So, yes, "never" is a strong word but it seems to be holding so far.

       This is exactly one of the reasons for the elite to start a world war. If/when the people actually wake up, the elite don't want to be "tarred and feathered"...and so a world war is the perfect misdirect.

       Regardless of what he is or is not, he doesn't want to start a war. His willingness to persue peace is all I need to know. His other qualities - for better or worse - don't matter.

       I wish I could come to the same conclusions you have.

       I believe your trust in Trump to be misplaced and I see no meaningful evidence that would convince me that Trump is anti-war.

      <p>
       Reguardess of what Trump will or will not do, this is a troubling time for us all and I wish you the best. Finding conversation as civil as this was is a rarity on the Internet and I appreciate and respect your conduct.

       Even Jill Stein endorse Trump by saying a vote for Hillary is a vote for nuclear war.  They are no way equal on shittiness. Trump is an entertainer, Hillary is a killer. Your hopelessness is merely a case of myopia.

       I think by now most the world understands donald trump, and congress will keep him in check. If anything he will lsst 18ish months before quitting cause he realized the president cant do anything he wants without help.

       So really its clinton vs pence this election. And if you took away his gay bashing and buring aborted fetuses. He aint that bad.
