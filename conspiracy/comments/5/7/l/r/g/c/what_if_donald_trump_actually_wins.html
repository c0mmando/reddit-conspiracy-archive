<p>Then the people who really run our country will be left with a clown for their puppet, and at this point entertainment value alone almost makes that a worthwhile outcome.  But no matter how much bravado he spits, one of the world&#39;s worst criminals will never see any jail time and it will disillusion his idiot followers the same way Barack Obama&#39;s idiot followers (myself included) were disillusioned when he continued the worst parts of the Bush administration and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost voted for Obama, but something just didn&#39;t add up. He was the definition of a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing, and worse than I could have imagined.
I&#39;d appreciate it and you&#39;d look more professional if you didn&#39;t assume or label all Trump supporters as Idiots. Though I will agree that with all candidates there are idiots that follow them blindly. 
As for myself, a proud Trump supporter; I have a Bachelors degree in Finance, and am just about to finish with  Dual Masters degrees in Political Science and Economics. </p>

<p>This is a non-zero sum game, and Trump is the only potential chance at us winning. The odds may be next to none, but any number of odds is better than what Hillary has to offer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sympathize with Trump supporters, but I think the man himself is awful.  He doesn&#39;t stand for anything worthwhile and somehow he&#39;s billed himself as this outsider when it is people like himself and his buddies who have fucked this country up almost beyond repair.  I understand their want for an outsider or for someone who isn&#39;t bought, I just can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why they think Trump fits that description.</p>

<p>Although I cannot conclude with any sort of finality that he is a bought and paid for pawn of the Clintons, there is enough to make me think that until he is able to somehow prove otherwise.  And Trump supporters in general aren&#39;t doing Trump supporters in specific any favors.</p>

<p>And while I admire any efforts you have made to educate yourself, there are lots of professionals out there who can claim similar accolades as yourself but support Hillary Clinton to their dying breath, so no offense, but I don&#39;t consider that a very good indicator of a sense of how politics works.</p>

<p>Really all you have to do is look back.  Over and over again, throughout our history, this is how it has played out time and time again.  It was just harder to see in the past due to lack of interconnection and easy to forget because the narrative that our media presents is easier to swallow than listening to upset and outraged fringe lunatics, which is how people speaking the truth have been painted when they go against the grain.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t really care less about looking professional. I care about speaking the truth about what I believe.  You seem civil, and that&#39;s nice.  I want people to understand exactly where I stand when I talk to them though, and if the cost of that is being disliked, then it just weeds certain kinds of interactions out of my day, which is also fine with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and with anything outside of debating politics or economics I could care less what people say, or how they say it.

    <div class="md"><p>Because insulting people doesn&#39;t contribute anything positive. Your right it&#39;s very subjective and if people just want to vent or talk shit, so be it. However, as for myself I&#39;d prefer to have rational conversations and try to no be so divisive. </p>
