        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy theory for entertainment purposes only. Some random guy who writes scripts and sends them to people like John Podesta and Gov. Pataki is likely just some random guy.</p>

<p>Starts here. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a></p>

<p>So why did this random ex-military, German finance connected script writer send this to Podesta and Pataki? Podesta is not a film studio and neither is Governor Pataki.</p>

<p>Look at the map of the US and Mexico he linked. Notice the line in South Texas. <a href="http://archive.is/lnzI9">http://archive.is/lnzI9</a></p>

<p>Now look at the location of the ranch where Scalia died. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cibolo+Creek+Ranch/@25.5481469,-101.0025618,5.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5b5bbb720c4900f1!8m2!3d29.861264!4d-104.3329128">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cibolo+Creek+Ranch/@25.5481469,-101.0025618,5.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5b5bbb720c4900f1!8m2!3d29.861264!4d-104.3329128</a></p>

<p>What a coincidence, eh? But what would it mean if it wasn&#39;t a coincidence? That would mean people pitch movie scripts which are actually scripts for plots. Crazy, right? Except that would be the way to do it in the age of mass surveillance.</p>

<p>An NSA contractor is not going to pull a Snowden if he sees a movie script about assassinations or something. Heck, Tom Clancy &#39;predicted&#39; 9/11 in a novel, even if a script &#39;came true&#39; later it could be another coincidence like that. Of course, ordering the script as instructed might get one sent a physical copy with more details that would not be read by internet snoops, unless intelligence is still big on opening snail mail (they are not.) We also know Hollywood in general has a good relationship with the government and military, but not just in using their equipment in exchange for favorable scripts. Setting up a fake movie company for secret missions has happened in the past (Iranian hostages) so setting up a company or using a legitimate one to send some of these scripts around would be easy. The authors and creatives invited to Bohemian Grove to party in the woods could also help with this. And reminder, even the Washington Post found the Grove presence at the ranch noteworthy. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-scalia-spent-his-last-hours-with-members-of-this-secretive-society-of-elite-hunters/2016/02/24/1d77af38-db20-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-scalia-spent-his-last-hours-with-members-of-this-secretive-society-of-elite-hunters/2016/02/24/1d77af38-db20-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html</a></p>

<p>Also weird in this email and the guys profile is the focus on the ending of the move, merging Mexico and America and the great economic benefits it would bring. I guess a thinly-veiled propaganda film could end like that, with a lecture to Greta Van Sustern and economic statistics. But it could also be a pitch for the scheme. Robert Lucas might also be a reference to the economist of the same name whose plan to turn the economy around was endorsed by George and Jeb.</p>

<p>There are some other script summaries on his page. I guess to read the whole things you would have to order it. Of especially creepy note is this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OUR PLACE IN HISTORY - a docudrama of our time. From their HQ in an ancient European castle, a terrorist group plans their suitcase NUKE attack on the Harbor of Los Angeles. They watch our television for their intelligence gathering. We/you choose what they watch and talk about.
A ten year old Muslim boy emerges as a hero in the end - a much needed role model for Muslim youth.
I have a 16 page budget from <a href="http://www.castelfilm.ro/">www.castelfilm.ro/</a> of $1.5M. It needs to be updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We/you choose what they watch and talk about? Weird way to address the reader, unless you are emailing someone whose job it is to manipulate what is on television.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s today&#39;s conspiracy theory. There are more obscure references to look into and connections to make here while we wait for the next batch of Podesta leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;ve been thinking too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like in those countries where you have to bribe the police/judge when the cops pull you over for something. It&#39;s all in the open, everybody knows, but can&#39;t be spoken about. Meanwhile everyone &quot;plays along&quot;, because what the fuck else are you going to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  And that&#39;s a pretty darn big part of the problem - that people have the &quot;what the fuck else are you going to do?&quot; attitude.  I understand that it is indeed hard, but dammit we can accomplish almost anything as a people if we&#39;re <em>together</em>.  This is the very reason why TPTB work so damn hard at making sure and keeping us apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely.</p>

<p>We have the power. TPTB are all too aware, hence the division.</p>

<p>This is why George Soros funds BLM while at the same time pushing for the militarization of police (gotta love those leaks!).</p>

<p>We&#39;re being played from all sides, when the fact of the matter is that we have far far more in common than not. </p>

<p>Sheesh I&#39;m so glad <em>some</em> people get this.  I was just the other day arguing with some blockhead on here who was trying to say that humans&#39; &quot;natural way&quot; is about conflict and division.  I was like <a href="https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Jackie-Chan-WTF.jpg">WTF?</a>  Seriously?  That some people actually think this way is a <em>horrible</em>, horrible sign in terms of how far we have to go before we come together as a species.  smh</p>

<p>I had a similar discussion with a guy the other day who was highlighting the &quot;justice&quot; in a video of a pick-up truck plowing through a crowd of protesters.</p>

<p>HOW could a &quot;budget film producer&quot; make a &quot;game changer&quot; for 2016 for $1.5 million? Sounds like a covert op.</p>

<p>D.A.R. is Daughters of the American Revolution???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Is the Ancestor search feature of the online Genealogical Research System (GRS) a complete listing of patriots from the Revolutionary War?</p>

<p>A: No, it is a composite of only those patriots whose descendants have joined the DAR. For example, George Washington had no children and will not be found in the DAR Patriot Index, but Martha Washington, who had children prior to her marriage to George, is included in the Index.</p>
