       "All the President's Men" Woodward &amp; Bernstein will give you the official story. Back then I recall feeling like it was a hit by the media powers that be, for whatever reasons. There was Vietnam, race riots drugs. It got rough. Whatever is coming down the pipe now is going to be a whole lot rougher. If accountability ever becomes fashionable again, I can't imagine how far all this would reach.

       Yeah received a pardon basically so the country could get past it all. We were dealing with a lot of bullshit trying to get out of Vietnam, the country didnt need to have a giant trial thats viewed on an international stage of the disgraced former pres that resigned. We needed to just move past it. What Nixon did was obviously wrong, but I agree with Ford pardoning him. Nixon became a recluse and rarely spoke to the media ever again until he died. Did no one any harm by being pardoned, but if he wasn't pardoned it could've done a lot of harm to the US on an international level.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, Hillary doesn't deserve any pardoning, she's well beyond that. She deserves a cell.

       He received a pardon because that's how those bitches protect each other. If it was a case of healing, then the full ramifications of watergate and nixon's presidency should have been exposed.

       I disagree. Just because something is true doesn't mean it needs to be said. We're talking about a time that was a powder keg, Vietnam, all of the tension still around the Civil Rights movement, the height of bad relations with Russia, A beloved president,a recent assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't have been hard to turn that into absolute chaos. If Watergate was a coverup, I'd argue it probably kept this country from the brink of a second period of unrest in twenty years, and probably from going to war with Russia.
      </p>

       Should the truth come out? Yes, but it should be now that it's too late for it to hurt us as a country.

       it hurts us as a country. Nixon got away with lying about a break in he "wasn't involved in" and deleted 18 minutes of audio tape". Was pardoned.

       If the US had actually prosecuted Nixon, it would have garnered far more respect than giving the whole issue a whitewash.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Did no one any harm by being pardoned

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Consider the precedent Nixon's pardon set. He went to his grave without admitting any wrongdoing. The US was supposed to be a country founded on law. Nixon put paid to that lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth mentioning that Hillary's first job for the government was as part of the legal staff for the House Judiciary Committee as they considered Nixon's impeachment. Hillary's job required her to listen to Nixon's tapes. Her favorite were his "tapes of tapes" - where Nixon would record himself listening to previously tapes, while 
explaining what he meant, and how his words should be interpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nixon had faced the full consequences for his actions, Hillary would have learned a much different lesson than "it depends on what the meaning of 'is' is".

       How is that a "moronic narrative" ? lol. Obviously its a subjective moment in history, but when considering other similar moments in history in other countries in the past, it is likely this is why it was done. I have a bachelors degree in history; one of my professor's who has written several books on the time period and has a doctorate in history was the one who "pushed that moronic narrative" to us in class. Im not saying its absolutely correct, but when considering other factors it is a pretty close guess to why it was done.

       I don't disagree with your last point, but I still will agree with my opinion that pardoning him was necessary for the country at the time because 1974 in the US was a time where we were immersed in controversy dealing with the Civil Rights movement that just ended, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis. Our country needed not to pile onto the bullshit, but rather to move on. But, thats only my historical opinion on the matter where I am comparing it to past historical events

       The person they wiretapped used to work for Howard Hughes in the fifties when Nixon was Vice President under Eisenhower, and Nixon was nervous because he was working for the DNC.  Nixon wanted to know if this person was spilling secrets about events that occurred between 1959 and 1964.

       Daniel P. Sheehan explains it better than me.  It should be in the video I linked, or one of the others.  Maybe I linked the wrong one...

       really depends on who you talk to. Some say that he just put someone in charge of finding information for him. That person ordered the burglary and when Nixon found out he was afraid it would come back on him so he tried to cover it up.

       My thought is that producing food/water/other necessities in your backyard or in a public space is about the most subversive thing you can do at this point. As the "recovery" continues to grind away at peoples' ability to get by, you can trade or share with your neighbors. If you have skills, consider trading your time for things that you need; barter is untaxable. As the economy continues to deteriorate, there will be more idle people in need. By looking out for ourselves and our neighbors, we can break the myth that government (in its current form) is necessary. Cheers and good luck!

       Probably because most people do no have enough land to grow enough food to survive. Even if people haver enough land it sometimes seems that in a few years you will not be able to plant anything if you don't buy the seeds from Monsanto or other large company.

       The infographic says 1.5 to 2 acres but a lot of the things don't make sense to me. 3 pigs living in 207sq feet, that's basically a 10 by 20 foot pen. Now, what happens if you eat one of the pigs how would you replace it?

       It's not like Nixon did nothing... "The prowlers were connected to President Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign, and they had been caught while attempting to wiretap phones and steal secret documents. While historians are not sure whether Nixon knew about the Watergate espionage operation before it happened, he took steps to cover it up afterwards, raising “hush money” for the burglars, trying to stop the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from investigating the crime, destroying evidence and firing uncooperative staff members.

       Good response. I'm sure you have lots of good theories about how a mediocre candidate for President is an evil mastermind with dozens of murders to her name but frankly I don't care.

       Wow, she's been a busy lady. Once they put a country that's not actually a country in Abkhazia at the top of the list it became a lot less interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want her doing something shitty, look at the softpedaling the entire Obama administration did when the elites in Honduras exiled Zelaya. Much of the rest of the list is a grab bag of 'something bad happened in the world, let's connect somebody who might have some connection with Hillary in the past.'

       I tend to assume that there is nothing unique about Watergate. It appears like another day in Washington. We no matter the issue, we are always given the lone gunman hypothesis. It seems more likely that Nixon needed to be removed. I would like to think it's because he was asking too many questions about certain state secrets.

       Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

       Think of impeachment as being indicted for a crime but when the case went to trial the person was found not guilty.

       Ive been reading up in this thread, you are right about everything, you are 98% correct... He just wasn't impeached. Change "impeached" to "resigned" and you got a very valid and factually consistent argument.

       Yes, the vote to impeach is close enough to impeachment, in this context, to use the phrase impeachment. Much like democracy is an acceptable substitute for representative republic in most contexts.

       Impeachment indicates Congress voted to remove him from office.

       Resigned means he willfully relinquished the office.

       Yeah, no. Impeached means the House passed the articles of impeachment, as with Bill Clinton. The subsequent trial in the Senate is where the vote to remove from office (or not) happens.

       1984 doesn't even closely resemble today's America. It's not that bad, you're being way to dramatic. I want Trump to win just so Hillary can be put on trial. If she wins, it'll never happen and it will all be swept under the rug. And in 50 years, people will look back and think 'What the fuck was America thinking!?'. It's very much a sad state of affairs, of Orwell's 1984 is a completely different reality than our own. The only thing you can compared it to is the economic disparity (Inner part = rich, outer party = middle class, Proles = the poor, obviously) and the fact that we are basically constantly at war. But the Fascist social structure and doublethink of 1984 definitely doesn't exist. At least, it doesn't exist YET.

       I realize that. I read the book less than a month ago. He was talking about what he envisioned the future if Stalinism won. The whole "oligarchical collectivism" was a form of that. Clinton is the opposite of a communist. She is a crony capitalist, she LOVES them big corporations. Loves them. IDK why anyone would think she is socialist at all. She loves big business and big money.

       1984 is an exaggeration. Our world is NOT that bad. It could, but it isn't. Not yet. But if we let this shit happen, it will.

       War is Peace - check. They gave constant wars now ans no declaration of war as required.  We are told to keep us safe and secure and peaceful we need to give away our rights, our guns and our young people to fight never ending invasions of middle eastern countries.  And on top of that we wage war on drugs and poverty which has incarcerated the larges percentage of any country's population in the entire world and breeds cartels and gangs and endless death.

       Ignorance is Strength - check. We no longer teach our children even a quarter of what was taught to the founding fathers in their youth.  We don't teach Latin and Greek and we have adults who cannot even balance a check book or pick out their state on a map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom is Slavery - back to my incarceration comments. Everything is illegal now and confusing. And with NDAA if they decide you are a terrorist you cease to exist.

      <p>
       1984's protagonist had a job rewriting history daily.  Have you seen a public school text book recently? Do you see how MSM fawns over Clinton and ignores her constant criminal acts?  Fraud and perjury?  Do you forget how they scrubbed Obama's past off the Internet? How they spin narratives and tour talk shows to propagate?

       And he ran afoul of the Ministry of Truth... our very own NSA and CIA combined with FBI.  Thought police? We aren't too far from that either.  Torture? Well they deny water boarding, sleep deprivation, sound and lighg assault are torture and yet we all know they are psychologically.  But it's gotta be done to save is from the terrorists... that our govt creates.

       You make a very compelling point. 1984 also engaged in psychological torture and warfare very much so. Beyond the obvious propaganda (of which we are bombarded by daily. So much so we can't even also identify it all the time and some can't at all). But towards the end of the book

       When they imprison Winston and he starts his talks with O'Brien about the true nature of reality, they force him to believe what they believe. To alter his mind so to him, his past crimes are inexcusable and he wants to be punished. Or tried to do so, at very least. Forcing him to wage psychological warfare upon himself, even so far as view O'Brien as his loved friend as well as his torturer. Like some kind of Godhead-figure. We don't do this on that scale, because it's technologically difficult and hard to attempt without the right tools. But America would do that in a second if they could, sadly.
      </p>

       Also, that ending was depressing as hell in the Chestnut Inn(?). Once I read it though, all I could think was 'why did I expect anything else?'.

       Oh but they do it with peer pressure. Not as much with Bush jr in media but definitely within his party if one questioned the Patriot Act they were no longer patriots.  Shame on you, long live Despot Bush II.

       Now it's leaps and bounds worse.  With Obama they could label any dissent as disgusting racism and bigotry.  He is the Teflon president.  Nothing he does wrong is ever held to account and even a full Republican held congress hesitates ro stand against him at all.  When a few do they are harshly belittled and even their own party yanks them down or distances themselves.  Our PC world guarantees a minority or female or both as POTUS can literally get away with anything. Hilbeast has already been getting away with everything and her in the Oval Office is Armageddon coming.  Not that I think Trump is a real opponent or viable option... he is a foil to make her the less bitter pill.  Doesn't matter the votes will go same as the DNC this election and RNC last with voters hijacked, masses of dead people voting and no one getting arrested despite boasting to a news crew they voted 6 times for Obama.

       Peer pressure can be so intense when you know you are in a room of rabid politician worshipers and decide maybe for an unsinged hide you can grow to love their human god too.  Or at least pretend.

       I have no doubts with the right psychological torture, alternated with care and compassion and drugged states while horribly sleep deprived we could all be reprogrammed.  But for now keeping the narrative spinning 24/7 and carefully created distractions they keep us in line.

       We who refuse to be sheep get cut from the herd and ostracized as long as we aren't a real threat.  Then we slaughter ourselves with strange ODs, freakish car accidents and suicides.  RIP Michael Hastings

       That was a time when the press lived for the story and details. Every reporter trying to get the latest details, because that's what mattered. Now we have media, not news. You literally have to go to conspiracy to get news, I used come here for my UFO fix or 9/11 truth info, but now it's actual breaking news. We have to have a new separation between media companies and news organizations, but I don't see that happening.

       Thank you.  This is what I've been saying for several months now.  In 1972-1974 it was the Babyboom generation that stood up to Nixon and led the nation-wide groundswell of anger against Nixon's cover-up of the investigation into the Watergate burglary.  Now many of these same liberal Babyboomers have abandoned their ethical and moral values in supporting the cover-up perpetrated by the Obama administration (FBI and Justice Department) and Hillary Clinton of Hillary's illegal use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State.  This is the shame of the Babyboom generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ditto the shameful cooperation of the Hillary cover-up perpetrated by the liberal media elites, led by none other than the Washington Post and the New York Times.  It was the Washington Post and New York times who published the
       <em>
        leaked
       </em>
       documents, The Pentagon Papers, which is what triggered Nixon's 'White House Plumbers' into committing burglaries and acts of 'dirty tricks' in 1971 and 1972.  And of course it was the reporting by Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein that led to the disclosure of the cover-up of the Watergate burglary.  I am dismayed that these papers are ignoring the leaked emails that demonstrate that both Clinton and Obama have lied about the details of Hillary's illegal use of her private email servers.  Worse of all, the Washington Post actually has editorialized that there should not be any further reportage of the email scandal, or, presumably, follow-up investigation of the information that is contained in the leaked emails.  (What do Woodward and Bernstein think of this?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, many people from the younger generations, those who backed Bernie Sanders for instance, are correctly outraged by Hillary's actions and they aren't buying into Hillary's moral and ethical sellout.

       No one cares anymore. Back in the 60s and 70s we still had some fight left, the people actually checked the government's power, now we're just pacified cattle, I don't know how it happened, maybe they poisoned the water supply, maybe they've just dumbed us down with an overload of media, but we certainly aren't as observant as we once were.

       I mean just look around you, we're in a state of tensions with Russia that equals that of the Cold War and people just want to talk about video games, or movies, or celebrities. Its absolutely pointless to try and wake people up, they're only going to acknowledge reality when the nuclear blast blows right in their face.

       There will never be another draft nor any sort of conscription ion in this country. It's way easier and more politically convenient to incentivize military service and worst case scenario, offer reduced sentences or pardons to prisoners. The country literally almost faced a revolution the last time there was a draft. That kind of social upheaval is dangerous to the power structure.

       Well, we were actually suppose to be a republic and that has been dead a long time.  In the words of Benjamin Franklin when asked  while leaving the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, what form of government the United States was going to have. Franklin answered succinctly, "A Republic, if you can keep it."

       as Comey stated in the committee hearing. She knowingly violated the espionage act, destroyed evidence and lied under oath and they had the evidence for all of it....
      </p>
      <p>
       but since she didn't "mean to" he decided not to press forward with a prosecution. BTW, intent doesn't matter when it comes to prosecuting for a crime but that was Comey's excuse to stop her from being prosecuted, not that there wasn't evidence of her crimes.

       Actually, I don't even see anything unexpected in the e-mails so far (though certainly unsavory in places). I'd be interested in seeing the Trump campaign's e-mails too, for that matter. Might be pretty fun.

       I read the BBC articles and it summarized many of the emails I already read. They are gossipy and sometimes reveal insider strategy(the 'what position should I take on an issue to get maximum effect') but there is nothing too nefarious in there. Her commitment to opposing TPP has always been an open question and is unlikely to be minimized by telling a bunch of banksters that she wants free flowing labor and capital across the hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most damaging emails, IMO, are still the DNC ones where they were discussing how to harm Sanders' campaign. It's not criminal for the DNC to take sides but it's a really shitty thing to do and it's terrible for party unity.

       The juicy ones are: Supporting TPP (and discussing how to 180 on for electorate to swallow it), same 180 with fracking and being openly in bed with big oil. Open AP, CNBC, CNN, Boston Globe, NYT and The Hill reporters collusion.

       Nothing really outright damning except obstruction of justice, yet. But the releases are paced to get progressively more heavyweight, so things will get more interesting week by week.

       You said both sides had dirt on each other but are afraid to drop it for fear of retaliation. Why is Trump different? He's absolutely tanking the Republican ticket, so at this point using his likely dead campaign to at least knock out the DNC would be a hail mary for the GOP

       No, by take down I mean to send them to jail or other criminal punishment.  Republicans wont do that because they know Democrats will return the favor.  Calling your political opponent a name and/ or exposing a weakness to the nation is called political gamesmanship.

       While not impeached, the charges were far more than "simply lying" and I have no doubt that he would have been found guilty on all three articles of impeachment.  The first were all the crimes related to Watergate, including, but far more than "simply lying".  The second covered the general misuse of power, such as misuse of the IRS and FBI.  The third was not responding to Congress' summons and demands for information such as the Oval Office recordings.

       To be fair, it was really all about Nixon's back room deal with the Vietnamese communists to kill the Paris peace talks so that he could get elected.  So there's some shady shit there below the surface with watergate.

       I see a lot of groping, and inappropriate behaviors. But I don't see any Rape allegations, other than his wife who recanted her statement and said it was not rape in a physical sense, it was an emotional mistreatment when they were intimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there is some legitimacy to these claims, but it's not the same to grab someones crotch as it's to rape them.
If someone grabbed my girlfriends genitals, I'd  beat them unconscious. But if someone raped her, I'd have to be restrained from killing them.

       They'd have impeached Obama the first month... and definitely now. He does all that every day before breakfast.  And he is just following the path paved by W.

       The infographic says 1.5 to 2 acres but a lot of the things don't make sense to me. 3 pigs living in 207sq feet, that's basically a 10 by 20 foot pen. Now, what happens if you eat one of the pigs how would you replace it?

       Only 2 presidents in history have been impeached.  It is kind of a big deal.  Was enough of a stigma on the Dems to get Caligula Bush elected for the next 8 years.

       You make a very compelling point. 1984 also engaged in psychological torture and warfare very much so. Beyond the obvious propaganda (of which we are bombarded by daily. So much so we can't even also identify it all the time and some can't at all). But towards the end of the book

       When they imprison Winston and he starts his talks with O'Brien about the true nature of reality, they force him to believe what they believe. To alter his mind so to him, his past crimes are inexcusable and he wants to be punished. Or tried to do so, at very least. Forcing him to wage psychological warfare upon himself, even so far as view O'Brien as his loved friend as well as his torturer. Like some kind of Godhead-figure. We don't do this on that scale, because it's technologically difficult and hard to attempt without the right tools. But America would do that in a second if they could, sadly.

       Also, that ending was depressing as hell in the Chestnut Inn(?). Once I read it though, all I could think was 'why did I expect anything else?'.

       Oh but they do it with peer pressure. Not as much with Bush jr in media but definitely within his party if one questioned the Patriot Act they were no longer patriots.  Shame on you, long live Despot Bush II.

       Now it's leaps and bounds worse.  With Obama they could label any dissent as disgusting racism and bigotry.  He is the Teflon president.  Nothing he does wrong is ever held to account and even a full Republican held congress hesitates ro stand against him at all.  When a few do they are harshly belittled and even their own party yanks them down or distances themselves.  Our PC world guarantees a minority or female or both as POTUS can literally get away with anything. Hilbeast has already been getting away with everything and her in the Oval Office is Armageddon coming.  Not that I think Trump is a real opponent or viable option... he is a foil to make her the less bitter pill.  Doesn't matter the votes will go same as the DNC this election and RNC last with voters hijacked, masses of dead people voting and no one getting arrested despite boasting to a news crew they voted 6 times for Obama.

       Peer pressure can be so intense when you know you are in a room of rabid politician worshipers and decide maybe for an unsinged hide you can grow to love their human god too.  Or at least pretend.

       I have no doubts with the right psychological torture, alternated with care and compassion and drugged states while horribly sleep deprived we could all be reprogrammed.  But for now keeping the narrative spinning 24/7 and carefully created distractions they keep us in line.

       We who refuse to be sheep get cut from the herd and ostracized as long as we aren't a real threat.  Then we slaughter ourselves with strange ODs, freakish car accidents and suicides.  RIP Michael Hastings
