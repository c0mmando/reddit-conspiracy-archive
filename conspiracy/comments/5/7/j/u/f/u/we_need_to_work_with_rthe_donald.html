<p>A lot of people go to breeders or buy them right after they&#39;re born. But honestly, I think the most responsible way is to go to a rescue shelter and adopt. They may not be exactly what you wanted, but <em>they really need you</em> and it&#39;s way better than participating in the for-profit mills.</p>

<p>Sorry, getting carried away with such a trivial and universally applicable low-effort attack such as &quot;fake deep&quot;. You can literally call anyone who is attempting to be sincere &quot;fake deep&quot; and I am now abandoning my previous efforts to actually think about my arguments, and going entirely with the &quot;fake deep&quot; strategy.</p>

<p>Honestly, it caught me off guard because it has no defense but to try and be <em>even more sincere</em>, which just plays right into it. I like to assimilate weapons that I am defeated by. This fake deep one is going to get used, let me tell you.</p>

<p>I personally never <em>not</em> want to know what the truth is.  I always, <em>ALWAYS</em> want to know what the truth is regardless of whether it&#39;s to my personal liking or not.</p>

<p>Truth is always superior to non truth in my estimation, and people should therefore always work toward having it revealed - and exposed if it&#39;s being hidden (which it greatly is on this planet).</p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t deny it - but then again, I also don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; we&#39;re not a democracy.  I <em>know</em> it, and have known it for quite a long time now.</p>

<p>Painful truth 100% - 10/10.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I prefer the lie of thinking we can control our fates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, preferring a lie to the truth is always, always ultimately self-defeating.  I always wonder why anyone would ever want to do something that is sooner or later going to undermine their self.  Makes no sense to me.  Secondly, if you understood existence thoroughly enough, then you&#39;d also understand what is really meant by the word “we”.  The I is connected to, with, and <em>as</em> The All.  It&#39;s a holographic reality dynamic.  Once you understand that, then you’ll grasp that there is a source from which everything comes and which even fate itself is subordinate to it.</p>

<p>Tap into that source and fate at that point becomes a mere blip in the radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do end up with a lot of the same information as we do here. </p>

<p>Like others have said, the titles are sensationalist, and the vernacular is ridiculous. The sub doesn&#39;t exist to swing rational neutral voters, but I don&#39;t think that was ever the goal and it&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. It comes off as a place where like minded people from all walks of like go to essentially celebrate their knowledge of our corrupt and poisoned system. It&#39;s a party, not a fireside chat about policy and past practice. (That&#39;s a generalization, LOTS of  harder to find but good discussion there) </p>

<p>I do think that a combination of the relative seriousness of this sub and the energy of the Donald could move some undecideds. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t have any idea what could possibly move any Hillary supporters. Now that they can openly call him a rapist, all bets are off. I&#39;ve always hated the hyperbole &quot;X candidate could murder someone in broad daylight and people would still love them!&quot;. Now I honestly am not sure. I think a lot of people in this country value human life less than they do human feelings. Especially the apparent victimization of women or minorities. So now I do question the validity of that phrase. </p>

<p>&#39;Brainwashing&#39; isn&#39;t sitting in a theater for a couple hours watching a spinning circle with a hypnotist chanting in the background. It&#39;s not a special hat that you put on and receive transmissions from that reorganize our brain chemistry.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very slow, very effective and very real all encompassing change in culture. It&#39;s using a tiny minority to create a straw man that is purported to represent a much larger number, and allowing that to dictate political and social policy. It&#39;s the control subconscious control of language and thought through that change. And it&#39;s already happened. </p>

<p>Imagine the social ramifications in your individual social circles of being called a racist, misogynist, conspiracy theorist, islamophobe, homophobe. These are things that people take very seriously in modern culture. When it&#39;s an allegation with no proof, the new default is to err on the side of condemnation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The war, I buy into. If Clinton wins, everyone, even her supporters, will question how. They will see the rigging, and that will ignite a possible civil war/coup attempt, not to mention Russia&#39;s threat. If Trump wins, everyone will think it was bought because of his wealth, igniting riots and protest. </p>

<p>r/The_Donald may then dissolve since it will have served its purpose, or failed to do so. If he loses, then it will turn into something dedicated to revealing the truth.</p>

<p>As for the army of truth-seekers... we have this. Need I say more?</p>

<p>The last bit... my only response is HAHAHA!</p>
