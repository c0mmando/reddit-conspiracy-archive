<p>I tried posting two different stories about Hillary&#39;s speeches, one of them about her marijuana comments, and both times it did that to me. This is some Orwellian shit on the private scale. It should tell you that if Clinton is going to sanction this much propaganda and censorship now, what kind of evil schemes will she pull off in office?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a real shame that there&#39;s no way to publicly shame the subreddit, as Reddit is owned by publicly traded companies, and what they&#39;re doing is pretty much shitting in their own kitchen. If I were on a board of directors, I&#39;d definitely be concerned with how reddit and that sub in particular is manipulating content and alienating their users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly thought they were just censoring me at first. But now i see its almost everyone that has something negative to say about Hillary. Also Reddit is not the only social media doing it, Facebook is censoring like this too. Technically we should be happy to have /conspiracy. But i can also see that people start to realize what is going on, so they just make it worst on themselves, especially because you get millennials in Reddit who actually know how to use Technology and jump around to connect the dots.</p>

<p>Facebook is censoring like this too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Noticed this on FB a few weeks ago after Trump&#39;s medical records were released.</p>

<p>A FB friend claimed Trump was &quot;obese&quot; due to BMI over 30.  Well, I found numerous sources quoting different BMIs - 29.5 (not obese) and 30.3 (obese).</p>

<p>To demonstrate this,  I tried posting a CNN article with the 29.5 number and a NY Times article with the 30.3 number.  Can you guess which link Facebook had banned for some reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm a wild guess 29.5???? </p>

<p>By the way i just realized the seriousness of the matter and the fact that we speak about censoring and sharing Wikileaks link etc on social media, i think its better to keep our mouths shut, delete our accounts and hope they will forgive us. I mean if you think about the extend of craziness and effort going on to censor this stuff imagine what they will do to us if we keep it this way. With all respect i am out, this is where i draw the line, i definitely dont want to commit suicide or anything similar. It doesn&#39;t really matter anyway, it will still go their way, i would recommend you rethink what is going on too and keep your mouth shut too. Its corruption like never seen before and they get away with it, we&#39;re like a walk in the park to clean us up. </p>

<p>I am officially a Hillary supporter, everything i said and posted it wasn&#39;t really me, my account was hacked by Russians and they posted all those stuff against my personal beliefs and consent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be very anti Hillary, which is fair because there is a lot of crap she brings to the table, even when the shills were active.</p>

<p>I saw this on some posts here a few months ago, and I belief I observed it at the time as well, that because the million dollar shill program saw it wasn&#39;t working to make a turd look shiny, they&#39;ve decided to focus on how much a turd the other guy acts like.</p>

<p>That seemed to have worked wonderfully as now the hivemind is successfully obsessed with it, or the shills have increased (perhaps both, but the hivemind definitely shifted). </p>

<p>The reason why hiveminds are exist and work so powerfully by the way, is because all people have a desire to connect with life, most people do that primarily through social bonding, by feeling part of a group, and that works via reddit as well. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read the emails, you know they love to &quot;marginalize&quot; issues. Therefore in most of the MSM nobody talks about the behind the scenes corruption, they only care about the alien banter, Chelsea being a brat, and fucking b/s recipes. Awful.</p>

<p>I have been on Reddit for years now and have proof in my karma that I&#39;m not only posting to further a political agenda. Shit, most of my posts are with r/makeupaddiction. I hate how censored things have become on that sub in such a short amount of time. </p>
