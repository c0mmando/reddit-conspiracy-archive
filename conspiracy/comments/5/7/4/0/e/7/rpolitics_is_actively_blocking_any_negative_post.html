       It's gotten to the point where they don't even let you post the story and then they take it down, it just says "that post has already been submitted" without taking you to the supposed post like it does with literally anything else or on any other subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried posting two different stories about Hillary's speeches, one of them about her marijuana comments, and both times it did that to me. This is some Orwellian shit on the private scale. It should tell you that if Clinton is going to sanction this much propaganda and censorship now, what kind of evil schemes will she pull off in office?

       It's a real shame that there's no way to publicly shame the subreddit, as Reddit is owned by publicly traded companies, and what they're doing is pretty much shitting in their own kitchen. If I were on a board of directors, I'd definitely be concerned with how reddit and that sub in particular is manipulating content and alienating their users.

       Reddit censoring content on their own website has nothing to do with right of free speech. They're just showing that Reddit doesn't have free speech.

       I honestly thought they were just censoring me at first. But now i see its almost everyone that has something negative to say about Hillary. Also Reddit is not the only social media doing it, Facebook is censoring like this too. Technically we should be happy to have /conspiracy. But i can also see that people start to realize what is going on, so they just make it worst on themselves, especially because you get millennials in Reddit who actually know how to use Technology and jump around to connect the dots.

       Noticed this on FB a few weeks ago after Trump's medical records were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       A FB friend claimed Trump was "obese" due to BMI over 30.  Well, I found numerous sources quoting different BMIs - 29.5 (not obese) and 30.3 (obese).
      </p>
      <p>
       To demonstrate this,  I tried posting a CNN article with the 29.5 number and a NY Times article with the 30.3 number.  Can you guess which link Facebook had banned for some reason?

       Hmmm a wild guess 29.5????

      <p>
       By the way i just realized the seriousness of the matter and the fact that we speak about censoring and sharing Wikileaks link etc on social media, i think its better to keep our mouths shut, delete our accounts and hope they will forgive us. I mean if you think about the extend of craziness and effort going on to censor this stuff imagine what they will do to us if we keep it this way. With all respect i am out, this is where i draw the line, i definitely dont want to commit suicide or anything similar. It doesn't really matter anyway, it will still go their way, i would recommend you rethink what is going on too and keep your mouth shut too. Its corruption like never seen before and they get away with it, we're like a walk in the park to clean us up.

       I am officially a Hillary supporter, everything i said and posted it wasn't really me, my account was hacked by Russians and they posted all those stuff against my personal beliefs and consent.

       They are allowed to censor whatever they want.  That's not the point, the point is that the sub claims to be non biased, but is in fact one of the most biased places on the entire internet.   r/the_donald is biased , but admit so openly, r/politics is just as biased the other direction but pretends to not be.

       It used to be very anti Hillary, which is fair because there is a lot of crap she brings to the table, even when the shills were active.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw this on some posts here a few months ago, and I belief I observed it at the time as well, that because the million dollar shill program saw it wasn't working to make a turd look shiny, they've decided to focus on how much a turd the other guy acts like.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seemed to have worked wonderfully as now the hivemind is successfully obsessed with it, or the shills have increased (perhaps both, but the hivemind definitely shifted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why hiveminds are exist and work so powerfully by the way, is because all people have a desire to connect with life, most people do that primarily through social bonding, by feeling part of a group, and that works via reddit as well.

       I'm pretty sure someone shared a Podesta email which discussed this change in tactics. The move from trying to highlight how Hillary is the rational politician compared to Trump and Sanders to how Trump and Sanders (or their supporters) are stupid/uneducated/unexperienced/crazy.

       If you've read the emails, you know they love to "marginalize" issues. Therefore in most of the MSM nobody talks about the behind the scenes corruption, they only care about the alien banter, Chelsea being a brat, and fucking b/s recipes. Awful.

       The alien shit is very very very real and extremely serious.  It basically has 100% connection to the corruption that we've seen in the last 100 (possibly more) years.  Start reading John Mack, and just read read read on.

       Honestly, I feel like the shill-army is doing her campaign more harm than good. No one even takes the slightest pro-Hillary comment seriously now. It's getting to the point where people universally assume anything not-terrible about her is paid content.

       I posted to the subreddit earlier, and while it did not get deleted, it has remained at exactly zero even though a good amount of shills have commented with attacks on why the video I posted was "highly" edited and displayed "entrapment" because the people in the video were "baited" and filmed without knowing.

       I have been on Reddit for years now and have proof in my karma that I'm not only posting to further a political agenda. Shit, most of my posts are with r/makeupaddiction. I hate how censored things have become on that sub in such a short amount of time.

       Much of the Clinton opposition came to conspiracy because they couldn't/can't get a word or post to stick because of organizations and strategies like CTR. It is a concerted effort and is a conspiracy to suppress unfavorable Clinton news and posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other more neutral settings/political sub reddits to post until the CTR ilk infects them.

       It needs to be said that a great number of progressives are disgusted with the Clinton campaign. The majority of Sanders supporters can be found calling out the shills.

       I would imagine that a lot of us hate Trump just as much. But we know he's just a small time crook, and the juiciest bits from him aren't exciting conspiracy scavenger hunts.

       Not really. All he is saying is "why don't we hate trump" . He's ignoring that you can get your anti trump news everywhere else, but not Hillary (not without being removed). He also generalizes everyone into Trump lovers, only for hating Clinton. It's backwards logic.

       You assumed that he generalized you guys into trump lovers.  All he did was point out (accurately) the lack of anti-trump news.  I personally dont care for either one but he has a valid point...still.

       I never said this sub is a group of Trump lovers. And maybe it is the groups I associate with, but Clinton has been getting much more heat in this election cycle than Trump. Maybe I see this because I do not watch the news anymore and gather my own information. But from what I have seen on Reddit, the dirt that comes up from trump gets completely disregarded while everything Clinton does/ has done is looked at under a microscope.

       Try this: search for trump under r/conspiracy and see how it compares to the posts about Clinton. Spoiler alert: it's not even close. I support neither candidate, however, this sub is doing everything it can to bash Clinton and nothing at all to show the dirt that Trump is/has been involved in.

       I'm pretty sure someone shared a Podesta email which discussed this change in tactics. The move from trying to highlight how Hillary is the rational politician compared to Trump and Sanders to how Trump and Sanders (or their supporters) are stupid/uneducated/unexperienced/crazy.
