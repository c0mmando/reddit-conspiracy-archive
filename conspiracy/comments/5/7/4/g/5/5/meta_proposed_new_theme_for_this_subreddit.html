       So I've noticed lately that this sub has been sort of... single minded, lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pBvRpW8.png">
        this is what i'm talking about
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       16 out of the top 20 posts are about Hillary Clinton and/or her staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, yall are really going hard right now. If I didn't know better, I'd find this a little suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even a post up right now on the front page complaining about how
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is nothing but anti-Trump articles. And yet the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is crowded with nothing but anti-HRC material almost every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my proposal is to just have a temporary theme, until the election, and rename the sub
       <a href="/r/ANTIHILLARY">
        /r/ANTIHILLARY
       </a>
       or something like.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least then we can be honest with ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS- Just to be clear, this is not meant to a political post (i know that sounds crazy, just listen), this about my love of conspiracy discussion and reading crazy articles about fascninating topics I'd never considered. I used to love coming here to find some new and novel idea about something, some new perspective I hadn't considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sick of being inundated with this shit. Maybe we just need some good megathreads or something, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I just want to read about bigfoot and aliens and mysterious disappearances, and secret government experiments.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all the time, but seriously... I feel as though
       <strong>
        all other content
       </strong>
       is being drowned by anti-hillary materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what the community wants? Am I alone with these thoughts?

       That's a great point on more megathreads. That would help organize things. Mods?

       <a href="/r/politics">

       How about the posts i made about other political squabbles? What about the posts that point out Trump, the Alt-Right, the Globalists, the Zionists, Vaccines, Syria...etc? This isn't only anti-hillary and anti-ctr, there are much bigger conspiracies to expose, but this one about Hillary and the CTR is just the most glaring and obvious at this state.

       You are paying no respect to those other conspiracies which sometimes appear on the front page.

       This. It's not helpful for people to make posts screaming at the community "YA BUNCH OF TRUMP SHILLS!" when many of us hate both candidates and are posting other things besides Hillary emails. This is annoying, inaccurate and offensive to our intelligence.

      <p>
       Then maybe you should pay attention to what's going on right now with WikiLeaks? We're less than a month away from the election, things are heating up, scandals and conspiracies are being expounded upon with the WikiLeaks information just dropped this week, so yes, there are a lot of posts about Hillary and her corruption. This should not be suspicious to anyone paying attention to world events and the media right now. This isn't a random influx of anti-Hillary propaganda like you're implying.

      <p>
       Have you considered the obvious that there isn't nearly as much new information coming through on those subjects as what's coming up on Hillary? Where is this week's bigfoot evidence reel (not human beings walking around eagle nests in fur suits and miraculously captured on film at the right moment)? Where is there new alien evidence outside of the absurd Podesta emails? (which are related to Hillary moreso than aliens at this point) I'm also not a fan of the SecureTeam10 stuff that constantly claims to identify moon structures and UFOs within incredibly blurry pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things will die down after the election. Until then I don't see a need to radically change the sub and start pointing fingers at users for being suspicious.

       I'm not even giving this a serious response because you clearly aren't interested enough in the political aspects of these conspiracies to have an opinion. I totally understand that you're not interested and don't personally care (politics are confusing and the corruption absolutely gets tiring to hear about), but it's not all the same like you're saying. You very clearly only browsed through those posts and decided not to look very deep because you're not interested, and THAT'S FINE, but don't complain to everyone else and try to change the fundamental nature of the sub because you aren't interested.

       Do you always make sweeping assumptions about people with little to no evidence? I bet you do. But I'm not sure. (because I don't make sweeping assumptions about people with little to no evidence)

       I'm not interested because after investigating the last 400 posts about hillary's corruption, I think I got the picture.

       She colludes with the media, she has private positions, her staff works with the DNC, she works with big money, etc etc etc

       Your post and comments are the evidence. You don't get to claim my comments are sweeping when you've laid out your position for all to see. You don't care about the corruption because it
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       similar to you as all previous corruption instances. This is a great example of people becoming desensitized to the corruption and giving up altogether. Now you're going so far as to scorn others and the community for caring about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't know how you claim I'm arrogant when you feel entitled to judge the entire community and ask for renaming.

       Ive been saying this for a bit now.
R/conspiracy is overrun with trump shills.
Im not saying shillary is better, but it distracts from what should be discussed, the prez is a puppet, and the bankers and buisness men are against all reg americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there wasnt for this onesidedness, maybe we could expose somthing bigger than deleted emails, which every administration has done by the way.. im not defending hill, just making a point that there are bigger fish to fry.

       I'd rather vote for my dead parents than Trump, but I post most often about Hillary corruption because she's more involved in the establishment and international (foreign) affairs. Does that make me a shill? Am I shill for contributing to the email discussions? If there are bigger fish to fry then post about them instead of alluding.

       We read it. I found it just a ridiculous idea. Temporarily renaming a subreddit isn't logical or beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to change what's being discussed in here then submit content you would like to talk about. There's plenty of other individuals in this sub who also like the subjects you suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that this subs current front page is a combination of factors.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's towards the end of a major election
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump supporters have been pushed here from the Trump subreddits
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clinton has always been a subject of interest during the election
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Third parties are pushing political content to the front page in order to slide anything relevant to global politics
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Third parties want to push the Clinton propaganda that all Trump supporters are conspiracy theorists and all damaging claims made are in fantasy land
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Content creators are not submitting as much content during this time due to the actions of third parties bombarding the new queue with political propaganda
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Individuals from the politics subreddit have come here due to the politics sub being so one sided. Although, as you stated, this sub is now also one sided due to any anti-Trump content being buried or slided
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit has no mitigation in place to deal with groups pushing propaganda and controlling subreddits
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What's the answer?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Continue to browse the new tab. You will still find the content you are interested in. You will just have to search for it a bit longer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Become a contributor and share the content you wish others to find
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Make sure you promote content that's not politics related

       You have no problem with 80-90% of the posts being random shit about Hillary that does nothing but induce scandal fatigue while failing to deliver any "bombshells" or "smoking guns"?

       I mean, if that's the kind of content you want, so be it. I'm just voicing my opinion.

       The posts aren't random shit. I'm sorry you're offended that the sub isn't discussing bigfoot or aliens nearly as much this month as you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I applied that same logic to your ideal sub primarily consisting of bigfoot and alien stories every week, you wouldn't be allowed to post. I guarantee there are not "bombshells" or "smoking guns" being posted every week about aliens or bigfoot. They're both incredibly old subjects. Not less important, just old and beaten to death, waiting for new, reliable information.

       No I get it, you just want to read about Hillary doing exactly the same shit over and over again.

       That's fine, dude. If that's the content you want, that's your right. I don't know why you're getting so cranky about it.

       Just go read your cookie-cutter "NEW EMAIL SHOWS STAFFER IN CONTACT WITH CNN" post or whatever.

       That wasn't a rebuttal and now you're repeating yourself. Hopefully you understand the other side of this story now at least instead of only your side.

       You're right, it wasn't a rebuttal. I was saying that I understand your position. Why do you keep trying to argue? Like I said, I get it dude. I understand that you just want to read about the same scandal over and over again.

       Again, if you're not interested in politics, don't click on the political articles. End of discussion. You're not clever by insulting me and then asking why I'm arguing. Jesus.

       As if you could tell that I'm physically worked up over such a ridiculous post and request? Pffft. Again you're not the only one to try and condescendingly label the sub and declare it Pro-Trump and full of Trump shills. I'll be here every time someone baselessly accuses me of that.
