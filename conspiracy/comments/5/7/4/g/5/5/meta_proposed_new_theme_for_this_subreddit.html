        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve noticed lately that this sub has been sort of... single minded, lately.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pBvRpW8.png">this is what i&#39;m talking about</a></p>

<p>16 out of the top 20 posts are about Hillary Clinton and/or her staff.</p>

<p>I mean, yall are really going hard right now. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d find this a little suspicious.</p>

<p>There is even a post up right now on the front page complaining about how <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is nothing but anti-Trump articles. And yet the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is crowded with nothing but anti-HRC material almost every single day.</p>

<p>So my proposal is to just have a temporary theme, until the election, and rename the sub <a href="/r/ANTIHILLARY">/r/ANTIHILLARY</a> or something like.</p>

<p>At least then we can be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>PS- Just to be clear, this is not meant to a political post (i know that sounds crazy, just listen), this about my love of conspiracy discussion and reading crazy articles about fascninating topics I&#39;d never considered. I used to love coming here to find some new and novel idea about something, some new perspective I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of being inundated with this shit. Maybe we just need some good megathreads or something, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p><strong>I just want to read about bigfoot and aliens and mysterious disappearances, and secret government experiments.</strong> </p>

<p>Not all the time, but seriously... I feel as though <strong>all other content</strong> is being drowned by anti-hillary materials. </p>

<p>Is this what the community wants? Am I alone with these thoughts?</p>

<p>I vote no x10000. You&#39;re just feeding the political shills trying to categorize this sub as anti-Hillary on the same level as r/politics being corrupted, and that&#39;s not remotely truthful or helpful.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then maybe you should pay attention to what&#39;s going on right now with WikiLeaks? We&#39;re less than a month away from the election, things are heating up, scandals and conspiracies are being expounded upon with the WikiLeaks information just dropped this week, so yes, there are a lot of posts about Hillary and her corruption. This should not be suspicious to anyone paying attention to world events and the media right now. This isn&#39;t a random influx of anti-Hillary propaganda like you&#39;re implying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just want to read about bigfoot and aliens and mysterious disappearances, and secret government experiments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you considered the obvious that there isn&#39;t nearly as much new information coming through on those subjects as what&#39;s coming up on Hillary? Where is this week&#39;s bigfoot evidence reel (not human beings walking around eagle nests in fur suits and miraculously captured on film at the right moment)? Where is there new alien evidence outside of the absurd Podesta emails? (which are related to Hillary moreso than aliens at this point) I&#39;m also not a fan of the SecureTeam10 stuff that constantly claims to identify moon structures and UFOs within incredibly blurry pictures.</p>

<p>Things will die down after the election. Until then I don&#39;t see a need to radically change the sub and start pointing fingers at users for being suspicious.</p>

<p>She colludes with the media, she has private positions, her staff works with the DNC, she works with big money, etc etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We read it. I found it just a ridiculous idea. Temporarily renaming a subreddit isn&#39;t logical or beneficial.</p>

<p>If you want to change what&#39;s being discussed in here then submit content you would like to talk about. There&#39;s plenty of other individuals in this sub who also like the subjects you suggested.</p>

<p>The truth is that this subs current front page is a combination of factors.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s towards the end of a major election</p></li>
<li><p>Trump supporters have been pushed here from the Trump subreddits</p></li>
<li><p>Clinton has always been a subject of interest during the election</p></li>
<li><p>Third parties are pushing political content to the front page in order to slide anything relevant to global politics</p></li>
<li><p>Third parties want to push the Clinton propaganda that all Trump supporters are conspiracy theorists and all damaging claims made are in fantasy land</p></li>
<li><p>Content creators are not submitting as much content during this time due to the actions of third parties bombarding the new queue with political propaganda</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals from the politics subreddit have come here due to the politics sub being so one sided. Although, as you stated, this sub is now also one sided due to any anti-Trump content being buried or slided</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit has no mitigation in place to deal with groups pushing propaganda and controlling subreddits</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What&#39;s the answer?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Continue to browse the new tab. You will still find the content you are interested in. You will just have to search for it a bit longer.</p></li>
<li><p>Become a contributor and share the content you wish others to find</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you promote content that&#39;s not politics related</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can I recommend you visit <a href="/r/HighStrangeness">/r/HighStrangeness</a> until the elections are over, they have a wealth of posts about the weirder side of conspiracies. There&#39;s been a huge amount of actual conspiracies surrounding this election and people are going to post about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The posts aren&#39;t random shit. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re offended that the sub isn&#39;t discussing bigfoot or aliens nearly as much this month as you&#39;d like. </p>

<p>If I applied that same logic to your ideal sub primarily consisting of bigfoot and alien stories every week, you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to post. I guarantee there are not &quot;bombshells&quot; or &quot;smoking guns&quot; being posted every week about aliens or bigfoot. They&#39;re both incredibly old subjects. Not less important, just old and beaten to death, waiting for new, reliable information.</p>
