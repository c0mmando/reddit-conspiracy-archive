       We should all vote "none of you bastards" as a vote of no confidence. Let us face it; none of the career politicians currently in and/or running for federal office represent the civilian populace who supposedly elected them. Instead, they represent
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       the moneyed interests that paid into their campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start by voting no confidence; then, we must organize with our communities to draft our own declarations of independence and also draft new constitutions that have in place not only the checks and balances that have worked so far, but also new checks and balances to ensure that the mistakes that led us here aren't repeated or at least establish the mechanisms for self correction.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it stands now, the general electorate is no more than serfs and viewed as no better by those in power. It is high time we changed that.

       IMO a vote of no confidence still assumes the system you are voting in is not corrupt.  By voting you are legitimizing their system of control.  By participating in the charade you become an accomplice to the crimes of this country.  Non-participation is the answer not voting for none of the above.

       this is so true, too bad most people voting aren't aware. imo, it's obvious that the matrix is cracking; TPTB doesn't give a crap who is running for office &amp; we aren't supposed to realize it.

       Yeah, Trump is a big time shill, I've heard absolutely
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       from him that would make me believe he was 'anti establishment', there was a glimmer of hope when he acknowledged that the US national debt isn't a problem, but he has gone back to the stupid neoliberal idea that the US debt is a burden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why alt-righters seem to like him, I haven't heard him say a thing about interracial crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even mind the fact that he is a zionist, but his silence on interracial crime seals the deal, as he might say...

       Hillary Clinton is documented as "not liking everyday Americans". [That's an exact quote from the Wikileak emails.]
      </p>
      <p>
       From everything I've seen, Trump and Hillary have two diametrically-opposed personalities. Hillary grew up unpopular and working-class. As a result, she was a social climber (who sucked up to the rich and powerful, while displaying contempt for normal working Joes--from whom she sought to distinguish herself to the wealthy people she was trying to ingratiate herself to.) Trump, by contrast, started out as popular and rich. From a biography on him, his wealth embarrassed him--even as a boy. When his dad's chauffeur drove him to school, young Donald asked to be dropped off a block away, so he wouldn't be seen being ferried to school in a limo.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1988, when Trump first flirted with the idea of politics, a witness commented that Trump ignored all the rich and connected people, blew them off and went over to talk to the blue-collar working men. He remarked that Trump (who was the target of constant sycophancy from people who wanted something from him) drew a sigh of relief to talk to "normal people," whom he was desperate to be accepted by.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still see this pattern today on the campaign trail. Trump exults in hobnobbing with ordinary Americans, whereas Hillary hides from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her aspiration is to be accepted by the Power Elite [the Henry Kissingers, the David Rockefellers, etc.] Trump (who was born a member of the Power Elite) is desperate to be accepted by ordinary, hardworking Americans. It's why he speaks coarsely. It's his primitive way of putting people around him at their ease . . . to remind them that he's human just as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       One candidate aspires to snobbishness. The other candidate aspires to be a man of the people (whom he idealizes, since he's been cut off from them his whole life).
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't have two more radically different candidates in my opinion. Hillary Clinton said it herself in a speech she gave to Goldman Sachs [and now available due to Wikileaks]: "I wish more successful businessmen went into politics, because they can't be bought."
      </p>
      <p>
       (And
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is why the entire establishment is coming out against Trump. Since he has no money motive, he's operating from idealism. And Washington is terrified of only one thing: an honest man. Honest men might end the gravy train, and the Tammany Hall-level corruption.)

       Some poitive thinking there. Yeah we'll all be gone, but til then I think we can change things for the better a least for our children so that they don't get played like our generation and shipped away to be killed in the elites wars

       Great. The thing you're missing however is that somehow there is some kind of mechanism that causes us to somehow arrived in this space as though we were coming off of the conveyor belt. Perhaps I have been here before many times? It doesn't matter. Humans and so many other people that feel the way we all do are arriving in this existence through some mechanism and we owe it to ourselves and future humans to transform this existence and make it better. Realism and giving up is just a pussy sway of not thinking this through.
