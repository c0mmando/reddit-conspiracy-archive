    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t entirely true. 
Let me explain...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a lot of the emails and many of them speak about helping middle class with better education, health care, access to credit, increased pay....etc. Even HRC&#39;s private speeches are filled with good intentions, where she is more or less telling the PTB that they need to start being less greedy and let the little man catch a breather for a little while.</p>

<p>The main problem as I see it is that all of the HRC staffers think that the ends justify the means. They do a bunch of shady shit to progress their plans. These are people who drink the kool-aid and believe they can do no wrong. They cannot see that even with the best intentions or ideal end results, that they have been acting immorally and possibly illegally. </p>

<p>So do you care to cite these emails that show genuine concern for the people?  I didn&#39;t think so.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Are these the speeches that she took $675k from Goldman Sachs from where she told them they need to look at Iraq (war) as a &quot;business opportunity&quot;?  Was that her telling them to &quot;start being less greedy&quot;???</p>

<p>Does she care so much about wasting the peoples&#39; money to bomb brown people so that her friends can go and suck up the natural resources and the banksters can bring them into debt slavery?</p>

<p>You&#39;re so full of shit.  Fuck off.  You&#39;re disgusting.  Don&#39;t try and apologize for these criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I can just play devil&#39;s advocate for a moment:</p>

<p>To preface this, I will say that I&#39;ve worked on a municipal election campaign team in the past, trying to get a very progressive candidate elected over the the extremely wealthy incumbent who had been in power for over a decade and who had ties to the local police unions, the steel mill, and to the gleefully corrupt (and Democrat) state governor. We lost, unfortunately, but it was an enlightening experience.</p>

<p>One thing that stuck with me from this was how little impact the campaign manager had on the candidate&#39;s policies. Yes, she had to spend her time promoting them in public and and coming up with ways to make them attractive to the voters, but behind the scenes there was very little talk about this at all. The candidate had his own policy team for that, whereas the campaign manager&#39;s job was to keep on top of presentation and optics.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that I am not really surprised at all that this <strong>team of people focused on winning an election</strong> spend most of their time in these e-mails... talking about <em>that</em>. Of course they&#39;re &quot;plotting for power and control&quot; - that is literally the job of a campaign staff, and especially of a campaign manager: to run <em>the campaign</em>. If the e-mails of Clinton&#39;s policy people - or even moreso from Clinton herself - were leaked, we&#39;d probably see something rather different. Too bad she destroyed so many of them I guess? /gag</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I think there&#39;s plenty enough in these e-mails to support her disgrace and conviction without being upset that a campaign staff was mostly focused on running a campaign.</p>
