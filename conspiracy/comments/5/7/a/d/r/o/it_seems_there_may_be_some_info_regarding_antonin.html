<p>Anyway just google &quot;rotschild party 1970&quot; and it should flare up, there&#39;s a good bunch of awesome photos.</p>

<p>However if you just want to know what&#39;s behind all the &quot;esoteric&quot; (as in: look me i torture people and talk intellectual about it I&#39;M COOL K?) symbolism just search for &quot;the illuminati formula&quot;. If that book is not fake (i doubt it is, too much overlapping info from good sources) i think you got a winner at X-Factor: Psycho edition - pisces age</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what the trigger was, but anything I typed using the words &quot;scalia&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;murder&quot;, was removed. I then tried typing things like s****a and the post would stay up for a couple minutes and then be removed. Also tried with generic titles like &quot;Donald Trump is cool&quot; and nothing in the text. It would post, but then I would go back in and edit the text and they would remove it. That&#39;s why I resorted to posting an image. It immediately started gaining traction and I was then able to type whatever I wanted.</p>

<p>After this, I tried posting here (conspiracy) and whenever I would click the &quot;Submit&quot; button, it would say, &quot;submitting&quot; but wouldn&#39;t go anywhere or submit. I could keep pressing the button over and over again and it would just leave me at the same page. I tried different browsers and at different times. I honestly don&#39;t know how or what is going on but it definitely isn&#39;t normal. I imagine there are are plenty of people watching out for stuff like this and flagging somehow or doing something funky. Not a conspiracy theorist but I&#39;ve never had that happen and it seems right now things are hot, so to speak.</p>

<p>I believe he is talking about A bedwetting liberal</p>

<p>Bedwetting Liberal is a derogatory term used to describe people of a political leaning. The term bedwetting is used to denote a hand-wringing, scared, worrisome, pansy attitude, afraid of their own shadows. The term liberaldenotes the love of spending, social programs, handholding and acceptance of such things as illegal immigration and allowance of the same to have all of the social benefits of being in the United States.  </p>

<p>Bedwetting Liberals are generally terrified of Republicans and conservatives. They shriek at the thought of combat operations or allowing the police to do their jobs. They are quick to point fingers, cry to the media and ACLU, and snivel about attempts to maintain US heritage because it might “offend” somebody.  </p>

<p>I think that some were scared that Republicans would question the events and ask questions. Hence, why he called the bedwetters. </p>

<p>Now why is the ledge given (**) well </p>

<p>a small starlike symbol (*), used inwriting and printing as a reference markor to indicate omission, doubtful matter,etc</p>

<p>This is a sign and I believe this email is instructing Podesta that it has double meaning and he trying to be vague and will talk with Poedsta in NH.</p>

<p>His long weekend in NH was the week before the NH Presidential Primaries 
(wmur.relaymedia.com). Which, is no surprise he is a strategist. </p>

<p>2nd email</p>

<p>Sounds like it will be a bad nite, we all need to buckle up and double down. I am all in</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com">john.podesta@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard</p>

<p>Both write in cryptic ways and they could still be talking about both the primaries and Scalia. I think Steve&#39;s in straight forward, it means the Dems have to buckle down in NH for Hillary and for the backlash coming from the future assassination. </p>

<p>Yes, Bernie had a pool party in Martha&#39;s Vineyard. But here&#39;s where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>Scalia made headlines in 2015 as read in the story below:</p>

<p>Jerusalem is the Capital of Israel</p>

<p>Scalia was one of three dissenters in the 2015 case of Zivotofsky v. Kerry, which heard arguments that the United States should describe the place of birth of Americans born in Jerusalem as “Israel”.</p>

<p>Americans born in Jerusalem have had their place of birth described on their passports as “Jerusalem” since Israel’s founding. Menachem Zivotofsky, an American born in Jerusalem, had petitioned to have his passport reflect his place of birth as “Israel” instead. The case went to the Supreme Court, and many legal scholars thought the Court would recognize his plea, allowing “Jerusalem, Israel” to describe the place of birth on passports of Americans born in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aish.com/jw/s/Justice-Anton-Scalia">www.aish.com/jw/s/Justice-Anton-Scalia</a> and-the-Jews.html?mobile=yes</p>

<p>So, I bet your asking what does this have to do with anything? Keep reading this explanation of Vineyard from the Bible. </p>

<p>Here the vineyard signifies the Ancient Church, thus the spiritual church, and it is plainly said to be the house of Israel; for by Israel in the Word is signified the spiritual church, and by Judah the celestial church. In Jeremiah:--</p>

<p>Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou deck thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dance of them that make merry again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria (Jeremiah 31:4, 5),</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblemeanings.info/Words/Plant/Vine.htm">www.biblemeanings.info/Words/Plant/Vine.htm</a></p>

<p>Get that? The Vineyard is the house of Israel. Scalia recognized Israel as a State in his dissent and made news about it. Podesta has strong opinions on Israel and Steve E. is Jewish. So, it&#39;s not far-fetched they would get religious reference. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0415/cummings042015.php3">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0415/cummings042015.php3</a></p>

<p>Pool parties seemed straight forward, but what kind? Four years prior the Secret Service was busted for having parties all over the world with prostitutes. Many included pool parties with hookers. 
<a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/03/25/secret-service-prostitution-scandal-one-year-later/amp/">https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/03/25/secret-service-prostitution-scandal-one-year-later/amp/</a></p>

<p>Wet work is a term they using with Bernie for some reason. So, it can be used in this context and they can point to that fact. But it is also known as assassination. </p>

<p>I see a cryptic message </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think wet works (assassinating) meant pool parties (using a hooker to blackmail family, about death) at the Vineyard(Scalia&#39;s retreat).</p>

<p>Most would be stupid to discuss a murder in email. But they had a perfect cover story that allowed them to discuss it, quickly, freely and from a distance. These people are masters of word play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good explanation, especially the Israel and Biblical references. In case you missed it, I will copy and paste what one user found. It simply blows my mind. I read this to my mom (the email in the following link) and even she was piecing things together. This was a hit-job plain and simple. </p>

<p>&quot;I have proof of the hit contract they put out on Scalia. They being Podesta. I believe I have found proof in the wikileaks emails, specifically this one </p>

<p>(<a href="https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a>) </p>

<p>which seems to be detailing a &quot;movie&quot; contract for Podesta to pick up? But he&#39;s not a film producer. What could this be? Wet work codespeak? Yep. Includes even a map. They had a contract out on Justice Scalia. I found the &quot;order&quot; in the emails disguised in a subtle request for &quot;funding&quot; for a &quot;film idea&quot;. The cost, $1.5 million dollars down, $15 million on completion of the hit.
They were so brazen that they even sent a URL to a map showing a line to the location in texas where the ranch is that Scalia died......they used a smithsonian map to mark the spot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html">http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s the map URL as it was sent in the email to Podesta (seemingly responding to the contract request)......with the line showing precisely where they would do it at.....the ranch in west Texas and how they would escape, to Mexico through Tecate. Here&#39;s the wikileaks email Podesta was sent:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a></p>

<p>There it is, a contract to kill a supreme right there in CIA codespeak with a cute little &quot;movie&quot; pitch idea that went like this
&quot;I have the script, the budget and a producer for this 2016 political, game changing film project - funding is needed. You would be in charge of the content and selecting the producer.&quot;
But again, Podesta is not a film producer. You&#39;re welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>3) As OP stated in an earlier reply here, the pillow on Scalia&#39;s face was apparently a warning to others.  To whom, and why?</p>
