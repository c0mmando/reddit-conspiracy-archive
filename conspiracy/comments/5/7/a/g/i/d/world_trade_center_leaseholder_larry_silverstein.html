        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Journalist Steven Brill wrote, in his book <em>After: How America Confronted the September 12 Era</em>, that Larry Silverstein told him he had been &quot;so shocked and sickened by the destruction and by the loss of four of his employees&quot; on September 11 &quot;that he did not think he focused on issues like insurance or finances until &#39;perhaps two weeks later.&#39;&quot;  </p>

<p>However, Brill wrote, Silverstein&#39;s lawyers said that by the evening of September 11, Silverstein was &quot;on the phone with them worrying whether his effort to shave costs when he&#39;d bought insurance would now come back to hurt him, or whether his insurance policies could be read in a way that would construe the attacks as two separate, insurable incidents rather than one. The difference was roughly $3.55 billion versus $7.1 billion--the kind of gap corporate litigators dream of.&quot; (Steven Brill, <em>After: How America Confronted the September 12 Era</em>. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, pp. 18-19.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we&#39;re talking billions of dollars in insurance payments.  The insurance companies were probably rounding up their lawyers for a fight by the noon on 9/11, why wouldn&#39;t Silverstein begin his fight?</p>
