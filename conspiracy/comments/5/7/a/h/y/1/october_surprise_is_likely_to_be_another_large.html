       , it seems like the October Surprise will be a large scale terrorist attack. It was most likely being planned in France when they found that cave full of ISIS stuff, but who knows.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The October Surprise conspiracy theory refers to an alleged plot to influence the outcome of the 1980 United States presidential election, contested between incumbent president Jimmy Carter (D–GA) and opponent former California governor Ronald Reagan (R–CA).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the leading national issues during that year was the release of 52 Americans being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979.[1] Reagan won the election. On the day of his inauguration—in fact, 20 minutes after he concluded his inaugural address—the Islamic Republic of Iran announced the release of the hostages. The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan's presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election to thwart President Carter from pulling off an "October surprise".
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the allegation, the Reagan Administration rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons via Israel and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in US banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       After twelve years of mixed media attention, both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, several individuals—most notably former Iranian President Abulhassan Banisadr,[2] former Naval intelligence officer and National Security Council member Gary Sick; and former Reagan/Bush campaign and White House staffer Barbara Honegger—have stood by the allegation.

       The October surprise was the trump tapes and the Hillary podesta emails. That's likely all that will happen. Clinton will skate and trump will lose historically like people have said since he first threw his hat in the ring.
