    <div class="md"><p>A statesman contributes to his community in non-political ways, whereas a politician is only that, a societal leech. A statesman is in politics for the greater good, whereas a politician is in it for personal gain.</p>

<p>Politics are a side interest to a statesman - he has a career that doesn&#39;t rely on the state. A politician makes a career out of power brokerage and creates nothing of value beyond the framework of government.</p>

<p>&quot;A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation.&quot; - James Freeman Clarke</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would consider someone who makes a living from public service a politician regardless of his honesty or wealth. If I knew any honest politicians, I suppose I would be inclined to think of them more as elected bureaucrats. But having an occupation separate from politics is integral to my definition of a statesman. Makes for a more well-rounded individual with a point of view from outside the political environment or bureaucracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even that, it&#39;s just that he tricked the media into covering him by giving them a dog-and-pony show to sensationalize. By the time they figured it out, it was way too late. They had given him so much airtime that they&#39;d basically elevated him to front-runner status. </p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s faking his crassness - I think he&#39;s just being himself - but he definitely used it to his advantage. Trump is an extremely shrewd man.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a perfect man, not a perfect candidate. He&#39;s vulgar and snide and he has enough history as a member of the establishment that there&#39;s dirt they can use against him. </p>

<p>And he knows it. So he&#39;s using it to his advantage.</p>

<p>The reality is that the only men who have a chance of taking on the establishment are men that hail from it &amp; then have a change of heart, and you don&#39;t get to be a member of the establishment without breaking a few eggs, as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Trump and Hillary are evil....You know that they are now trying to take over the internet because their talmudvision no longer works against the intelligent populace? And this all started in Gamergate. </p>

<p>Did you see this happen before Obama presidency? No. </p>

<p>Why only now?</p>

<p>Because Gamergate PROVES to the intelligence and government shills about how easy to censor the internet is.</p>

<p>All internet communities will sooner or later be taken over by the government...and those who do not have their internet records given to Russia and China and were purged by foreign &quot;peacekeepers&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media didn&#39;t ignore him because the DNC and Clinton staffers probably asked them not to.  Someone posted leaks a few days back where Clinton&#39;s team was talking about how they needed Clinton to go up against Trump because then the fear of Trump would help her win. They even had someone petition the GOP, in effort to change some GOP primary events so that it would benefit Trump and eventually her.  Trump wasn&#39;t a plant but he was the opponent that the DNC preferred. I have no doubt that the media powers hyped him up in efforts to eventually help her. </p>

<p>The DNC brought this down upon themselves.</p>
