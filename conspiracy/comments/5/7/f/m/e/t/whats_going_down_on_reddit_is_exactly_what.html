       A statesman contributes to his community in non-political ways, whereas a politician is only that, a societal leech. A statesman is in politics for the greater good, whereas a politician is in it for personal gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics are a side interest to a statesman - he has a career that doesn't rely on the state. A politician makes a career out of power brokerage and creates nothing of value beyond the framework of government.
      </p>

       Would you consider someone who makes a living from public service, but is honest and does not grow rich -like Truman- a statesman?

       I would consider someone who makes a living from public service a politician regardless of his honesty or wealth. If I knew any honest politicians, I suppose I would be inclined to think of them more as elected bureaucrats. But having an occupation separate from politics is integral to my definition of a statesman. Makes for a more well-rounded individual with a point of view from outside the political environment or bureaucracy.

       Bernie's been running for office since '72. To my mind, that makes him a politician. He and Ron Paul share the commonality of being a "protest vote" in each of their cycles.

       Trump's statesmanship remains to be seen. That speech yesterday sure sounded like he's talking the talk.

       Here's what you do: unsubscribe from any reddit that censors information and stop posting there. Instead spend your time and energy in places that don't. And what will happen is that the masses will come back to
       <em>
        you.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       People will seek out interesting content and the truth. People also know subconsciously when they are being lied to. If we let these places turn into echo chambers full of shills and idiots,
       <em>
        all the normal users will leave.

       You're absolutely right. His being crass is part of what draws people to him. He's not a career politician who owes favors to special interest groups all over D.C. I truly hope the 4chan peeps come through with their videos, barring that it's a rap.

       It's not even that, it's just that he tricked the media into covering him by giving them a dog-and-pony show to sensationalize. By the time they figured it out, it was way too late. They had given him so much airtime that they'd basically elevated him to front-runner status.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I don't think he's faking his crassness - I think he's just being himself - but he definitely used it to his advantage. Trump is an extremely shrewd man.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not a perfect man, not a perfect candidate. He's vulgar and snide and he has enough history as a member of the establishment that there's dirt they can use against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he knows it. So he's using it to his advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that the only men who have a chance of taking on the establishment are men that hail from it &amp; then have a change of heart, and you don't get to be a member of the establishment without breaking a few eggs, as they say.

       Yeah, his reality really solidifies people's vote for him...I've never seen so many people come together vote for a single candidate. If his rallies are any indication of voter turnout, Hillary doesn't stand a chance...no amount of scandals can stop a runaway train, kid. Get on board, or get out of the way.

       Do you not remember the packed stadiums for RP? The millions in donations from small donors (myself included). The record breaking military donations(former Marine here &lt;---) I will gladly eat my words when I see the Donald being sworn in on a crisp day in January.

       The media didn't ignore him because the DNC and Clinton staffers probably asked them not to.  Someone posted leaks a few days back where Clinton's team was talking about how they needed Clinton to go up against Trump because then the fear of Trump would help her win. They even had someone petition the GOP, in effort to change some GOP primary events so that it would benefit Trump and eventually her.  Trump wasn't a plant but he was the opponent that the DNC preferred. I have no doubt that the media powers hyped him up in efforts to eventually help her.

       Yeah his scandal, talking about having sex with women, nothing at all like what Bill Clinton did, and it's not like his getting his dick sucked by an intern stopped him from serving 2 terms.

       Yeah, his reality really solidifies people's vote for him...I've never seen so many people come together vote for a single candidate. If his rallies are any indication of voter turnout, Hillary doesn't stand a chance...no amount of scandals can stop a runaway train, kid. Get on board, or get out of the way.

       The media didn't ignore him because the DNC and Clinton staffers probably asked them not to.  Someone posted leaks a few days back where Clinton's team was talking about how they needed Clinton to go up against Trump because then the fear of Trump would help her win. They even had someone petition the GOP, in effort to change some GOP primary events so that it would benefit Trump and eventually her.  Trump wasn't a plant but he was the opponent that the DNC preferred. I have no doubt that the media powers hyped him up in efforts to eventually help her.

       The DNC brought this down upon themselves.

       Yeah his scandal, talking about having sex with women, nothing at all like what Bill Clinton did, and it's not like his getting his dick sucked by an intern stopped him from serving 2 terms. Or the scandals with the DNC, and Clinton, and the people that die around her. Non of those are scandals.
