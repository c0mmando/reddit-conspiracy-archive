<p>In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.</p>

<p>Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.</p>

<p>There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.</p>

<p>The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.
For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.</p>

<p>This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.</p>

<p>The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We’ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.</p>

<p>And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.</p>

<p>With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before – and we won’t let them do that.</p>

<p>This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.</p>

<p>This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.</p>

<p>Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.</p>

<p>But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.</p>

<p>Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.</p>

<p>Our political establishment has no soul.</p>

<p>I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.</p>

<p>The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.</p>

<p>They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States – in the back of her airplane, while on the runway – for 39 minutes – to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he’s done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more – and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.</p>

<p>This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.</p>

<p>I didn’t need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I’m doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.</p>

<p>Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.</p>

<p>In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else – and I know what’s like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I’m the only one who can fix it. I’m doing this for the people, and this movement is just right – and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.</p>

<p>The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future – but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.</p>

<p>We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country – and the disenfranchisement of our people.</p>

<p>Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.</p>

<p>-Donald J Trump

<p><strong>EDIT 10/17/2016</strong>
Lots of replies asking for source of this. This is not the entire speech, I narrowed it down to form a readable message instead of a wall of text as this was at a rally held for about an hour or more. </p>

<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2sAjxDQcQ">Youtube link to full rally</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/remarks-on-the-clinton-campaign-of-destruction">The transcription of the full speech</a></p>

<p>I have always found for myself and others that reading, has a bigger impact on conveying a message rather than watching someone speak to you from a television screen.</p>

<p><em>Why is this on r/conspiracy?</em></p>

<p>Well first of all he uses the word conspiracy twice. Second of all, I believe this is the first time in a critical moment of history we&#39;ve had a Presidential Candidate calling the establishment a criminal cartel along with the media conspiring against the people of America. Regardless of what you believe to be the truth I thought it important that as truth seekers you all had an opportunity to read this and apply to the puzzle we all try to piece together on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about that. The media has created such a frenzied hate for Trump among average US citizens that they could paint a &quot;deranged, rogue antihero&quot; who took it into his own hands. Enough people wouldn&#39;t believe that it&#39;d still be a nation, divided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Newt. The powers <em>behind</em> Newt.</p>

<p>Like when Reagan ran. He was asked if he&#39;d ever consider any of his primary rivals for his vice-president. He said, he&#39;d consider any one of them--except George Bush. Reagan (a nationalist) had a deep and abiding distrust of Bush (a globalist). Remember: It was Bush who coined the term, &quot;New World Order&quot; and Bush who pushed NAFTA [even before Clinton did]. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU</a> Reagan was from the Goldwater/liberatrian branch of the Party, whereas Bush was from the crony-capitalist Rockefeller wing.</p>

<p>I watched a political insider on C-Span years ago talk about how he saw Reagan pulled aside by Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller took Reagan to a back room and showed him what his media coverage would look like if he didn&#39;t choose Bush. Then he showed him what it would look like if he did.</p>

<p>Reagan folded and put Bush on the ticket. Mere months into his first term, an assassination attempt nearly installed Bush in the White House. (Reagan was supposed to be his Trojan Horse.) Bush was never charismatic enough to make it in on his own. They needed someone with personality to win--and then be taken out to install Bush.</p>

<p>Reagan did something brilliant, though. When he survived and was rushed to the hospital, he disbanded his secret service detail and demanded that the Navy come and protect him. As Commander-in-Chief, he trusted the navy more than the secret service. And he survived.</p>

<p>Had he allowed his secret service detail to &quot;look after him,&quot; he would have gone the way of Justice Scalia.</p>

<p>At any rate, the media has long hidden and suppressed the connection between John Hinckley, Jr. [Reagan&#39;s would-be assassin] and George Bush. Hinckley was from Texas [where Bush was from]. Hinckley was the son of Bush&#39;s businesses partner (through oil company Vanderbilt Enery), John Hinkley, Sr. In addition, John Hinckley, Sr. was a huge contributor to Bush&#39;s presidential run.</p>

<p>The two families were incredibly close. See newspaper article from the time, entitled &quot;Bush&#39;s Son Was To Dine With Shooting Suspect&#39;s Brother&quot;: <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-5.jpg">http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-5.jpg</a></p>

<p>What a coincidence that, of all 300 million Americans, the guy who tried to take our Reagan had such close ties to Bush. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1965234-the-hinckley-bush-reagan-connection">http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1965234-the-hinckley-bush-reagan-connection</a></p>

<p>At any rate, a lot of parallels have been drawn between Trump and Reagan. The neocons wanted to replicate the Reagan-Bush dynamic by sticking the &quot;Globalist&#39;s Choice,&quot; NAFTA Newt on Trump&#39;s ticket. Had that been allowed to happen, it doesn&#39;t require much imagination to see what would have likely happened next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a radio show going over all these issues: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjlUrQ-V_VE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjlUrQ-V_VE</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: A fascinating angle to the assassination attempt. After George Bush&#39;s company [Zapata Oil] bought out John Hinckley, Sr.&#39;s company [Vanderbilt Oil] Hinckley went on to become President of World Vision United States. Both his son [John Hinckley, Jr.] <em>and</em> John Lennon&#39;s assassin Mark David Chapman worked there. And both shooters (who operated within months of each other) were triggered by a copy of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. There&#39;s quite a bit of circumstantial evidence that World Vision United States was a CIA front, and may have been used in the famous MKUltra program. (It bears pointing out that George Bush was head of the CIA before he became Reagan&#39;s VP.) Here&#39;s his pic from the time when he was Director of the CIA: <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.jpg">http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.jpg</a></li>

<p>Not so much mass desertion of individual soldiers walking away from the job.  More like entire organized companies of soldiers continuing to work together, but breaking the chain of command and essentially switching sides to we the people.</p>

<p>100% true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is the main reason the 2nd amendment exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% false. There was no notion of a world war when the declaration was drafted. The 2nd amendment was originally meant to make sure that states could raise a militia in order to prevent and suppress rebellions, <em>in the service of the state</em>. </p>

<p>It has evolved over the years and now means many things to many people, but the original intent is clear. </p>

<p>Edit: for the downvoters, please read <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ossb5/the_united_states_second_amendment_starts_with_a/d4fe4zp">this fantastic /r/askhistorians thread</a>, and specifically <a href="/u/uncovered-history">/u/uncovered-history</a>&#39;s answer linked there. The 2nd amendment was a direct result of rural armed &quot;rebellions&quot; (a title used by the gentry) such as Shay&#39;s Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve made sure that will probably never happen. Average citizens think protesting is pointless and stupid due to all the recent riots and the &quot;Occupy&quot; movement. Also we&#39;re all glued to our portable media devices (read: telescreens) and are a more selfish society than ever. I don&#39;t think anything beyond China-level internet censorship could get anyone to care enough to revolt on a massive scale.</p>

<p>And, yes, I know I&#39;m pretty pessimistic when it comes to the American people, but let&#39;s face it, you&#39;re probably not going to see another Million Man March. Especially one that doesn&#39;t become violent. I&#39;m all for it and I hope it happens, but I&#39;m not getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>Sadly, they are. </p>

<p>The only comforting thing is that they&#39;ll hopefully someday wake up and realize they were wrong. If Trump becomes President, they&#39;ll see that he is just like Obama. Just another politician telling lies, working for the same banksters and military industrialists. The only thing slightly &quot;new&quot; about Trump is that he divides the populace more than Obama did. It&#39;s the old divide and conquer strategy. </p>

It&#39;s truth to thinkers like us, yes, but how can you trust truth from a group of serial deceivers, liars and power maniacs? This speech has a purpose and we think that purpose is to elucidate the truth, but its not. It&#39;s to maintain power, maintain hegemony and maintain the lies. Super duper rich elites are not your friend and they don&#39;t have your overall wellness in mind. None of them. Just want to clear that up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of.</p>

<p>At least in Clinton&#39;s case, the Podesta emails reveal they have about 2-3 writers that create the core of the message. Then it is given to strategists to chime in. Finally, about 5-6 of her immediate campaign staff take a look at it and finalize it. And that&#39;s just of the people we know from the emails. There could be many others we don&#39;t know about helping create the message.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Trump has something similar set up, but not as many hands in the cookie jar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Location?
The majority of Trump supporters have to lie or hide their support for fear of social ostracization or worse being physically attacked. I live in Southern California, and the schools are packed with indoctrinated youths who don&#39;t have the slightest clue about socialism, yet alone economic policies in general. They are frustrated like most of us,  hate the establishment and want a 3rd Party that isn&#39;t big corrupt government. Sadly, they don&#39;t realize that socialism is even bigger government and while they might get some &quot;free stuff&quot; they don&#39;t realize they are being bribed with their future earnings. Socialism is quite romantic to the ignorant. I got caught up in the &quot;dream&quot; in my early-mid twenties. Then I took courses in Philosophy, Economics, Finance, Accounting, Geopolitics, Foreign Identity Politics, Debate, Cultural Anthropology and even Sociology. In the end, empirical evidence and rationalism had a much stronger argument. Capitalism is the worst, except for all of the rest. I understood the appeal with Bernie Sanders, he came across as a very sincere and passionate individual about making change. He has an established history of wanting to help disenfranchised  members of society and in general seems like a nice old man. There is just one problem, while his intentions might be well intended, socialism is an economic nightmare. Big governments are never the solution. Ask France, Italy, Greece, Venezuela how their Socialist policies are working out? Capital flight and no fuc*ing jobs. People like to mention Denmark, Norway and Sweeden, which aren&#39;t actually socialist, they are free market with more socialist policies, which aren&#39;t necessarily bad. In a perfect world the balance is probably something like 75% Free Market(not the crony capitalism we have) and 25% socialism. But comparing countries that are homogeneous and have the populations of California is not an apples to apples comparison. Multiculturalism is largely a failed ideology, that very well may have been intended to divide and conquer us all along .</p>

The messengers however are just as guilty of everything the DNC has done - had they been in control of the White House for a decade do you not think they would have done exactly the same thing or taken it even further? The only DNC trait lacking in the GOP is discretion, to an extent. Fuck the Republican party just as hard as the Democrats, they are two sides of the same goddamn coin.</p>

<p>Nothing will change for the better for the average American until we abolish both parties and all of their insidious ties to Wall Street, corporations and the billionaire cabal that owns Washington DC.

Is it that hard to believe the slimy business actor teamed up with the sneaky con artist (WHO HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE BILL WAS IN OFFICE) for the perfectly timed win win situation? Why did Trump wear a puny blue tie in the first debate while Hillary wore the flaming red full body suit (the opposite colors of their resembled parties)? Maybe in order to make Trump look weak and Hillary to look intimidating. Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmu2glcDqJ0">watch</a> and tell me I&#39;m wrong. Trump is a master of manipulation and if you don&#39;t think he knows that his body language says &quot;I&#39;m weak and don&#39;t know anything&quot; (eye contact) then you have underestimated the teamwork of this long lasting friendship. Then the next debate comes and its time to make voters afraid of Trumps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXODJVmSV00">potential</a> again! All in all Trump is like Hillary&#39;s good doggy who will get a very nice bone for distracting so many voters this election. </p>

<p>Watch and please keep an open mind. Trump &quot;showed up&quot; just as he promised he would in 1988, when he said if things ever got so bad. Things have never been worse since the cold-war.</p>

<p>Of course they were cozy. Trump is a wealthy and successful business man who knows how to play the game. Why the heck wouldn&#39;t he want a friend with political clout. Sure as fuc* wouldn&#39;t want her as your enemy. I have  mutual clients with other companies and we despise each other, but we both put on a shit eating grin and pretend we are friends because it&#39;s mutually beneficial economically and because it&#39;s better than having an enemy. But don&#39;t think for a minute that I wouldn&#39;t fuc* him over legally and that he wouldn&#39;t do the same. Were not actually friends, the extent of your friendship ends the moment one of us is a liability or can be certain the other would not pose a threat(economically) Its business at the end of the day, nothing personal, I wouldn&#39;t hate them, I&#39;d be upset that they beat me, but it&#39;s not personal.</p>

<p>The colors of their clothing, cmon bro. Gonna need more evidence than that. Shit I&#39;ve heard better arguments from the flat earthers, lol
I as well have my doubts, but sometimes you have to dig deeper.
There are such things as coincidences. </p>

<p>Watch the video Below, Ignore Ale Jones, just watch what Trump says and the length he went to. This isn&#39;t friends talking wwf smackdown and hugging in the locker room afterwards. These are fighting words and you wouldn&#39;t even roast someone this badly. This is permanent irrevocable damage to the Clintons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of reasons why someone may not feel inclined to vote for Trump, though most of them are fear and ignorance based.</p>

<p>I just recently came out of the closet with my support for Trump, and believe me, it&#39;d have been easier to be gay in the 60&#39;s. The sheer amount of fear porn and ignorance on college campuses in Southern California is disturbing. People are literally going to lengths to silence free speech so that they can have safe spaces without fear of micro-aggression&#39;s. Text book communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the hell did you get the meaning of this radical leftist peace activist&#39;s speech so twisted that you think it&#39;s applicable to Mr. neo-Nixon&#39;s message? Trump supporters have by and large proven to be uninterested in making the kind of sacrifices that Savio was accustomed to making in defense of liberty and peace. They just want to show up at a rock-concert atmosphere celebrity rally and cast a vote for someone else to fix all their problems.</p>

<p>Savio is a man who led student activists to block in a police car with their bodies for over 32 hours to secure the freedom of their comrade inside. Trump is a man who goes around the country sucking blue dick to score points as an &#39;alternative&#39; to candidates who pay lip service to people pissed off about unaccountable cops.</p>

<p>Trump thinks the FBI is a &quot;great institution.&quot; It&#39;s the same institution that targeted Savio&#39;s activism for disruption under COINTELPRO and had him on secret list of individuals to be detained without warrant in case of national political emergency. That&#39;s the FBI actively planning to violate one of the few constitutional provisions that really draw a clear line against police state tyranny, the 4th amendment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an insult to Savio&#39;s legacy to pretend Trump had any idea what he was talking about just because he uttered the meaningless truism that our political establishment &quot;has no soul.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was on the short list of candidates they were willing to debate (because they felt they could win against him).  As I understand it, they helped deconstruct everyone else&#39;s candidacy.  So yes, I think he was a &quot;plant&quot; in the sense that the Hillary campaign was satisfied with having him in the running.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think they planned on the email leaks.  You&#39;ll notice that the press has universally engaged in a round-the-clock shutdown of the Trump campaign.  This smells a bit like the Brexit, where the actual public sentiment was not accurately measured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much have you been exposed and/or following Trump&#39;s campaign, beyond ordinary mainstream sources and general exposure to online communities?</p>

<p>Without going out of your way to seek out truthful information about the Trump-Pence ticket, odds are that the average voter is subjected to the media&#39;s blatant collusion with the Clinton campaign alongside mass thought-policing efforts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57dsdb/look_at_rpolitics_right_now_ctr_has_completely/">Correct the Record</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t ever been, go spend some time over at <a href="/r/the_Donald">/r/the_Donald</a> with an open mind. It&#39;s in the spirit of this decidedly partisan (and proudly so) community to engage in frequent shitposting in ordering to maintain their enthusiasm and spirited approach to shutting down the corruption that&#39;s becoming more and more evident each day. That said, you might find some voices there contributing both facts and personal opinions that shed light on why the Trump-Pence ticket is a feasible and well-planned approach to restoring American economic and cultural strength while maintaining our national security. </p>

<p>I would also suggest looking through <a href="/r/AskThe_Donald">/r/AskThe_Donald</a> for specific queries. Members of that subreddit are very helpful in pointing out and citing specific stances on policy issues.</p>

<p>Given that you&#39;re posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you may of course be familiar with this. But with so little time left before the election, I really do feel it is important for all people who feel strongly about the future of our country to start spreading not only strengths of DTJ&#39;s plan for the next four years of our country and beyond, but also (and perhaps more importantly) the very real dangers of electing Hillary Clinton into office.</p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like some jimmies have been rustled below. Look, I just answered OP&#39;s request--pointed him to a source that is now being recognized by quite a bit of third parties as a crowd-sourced approach to investigating the outstanding claims against Hillary Clinton. I&#39;m on mobile and am quite busy at work today, and can&#39;t afford more than a few thoughts and glances at Reddit today. Nonetheless, I trust that users here (and anywhere) can objectively consume information, rather than needing to be barreled with agitated attempts at making my submission above seem insincere and misleading. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t insult the intelligence of people here. The election cycle has done that far too much already. </p>

<p>Just going to drop one more link here, something that might broaden perspective for some:

<p>Is this more of a dog whistle for social conservatism or white supremacy? I can&#39;t tell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maintaining our national security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a joke for so many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He&#39;s already undermining national security with his candidacy alone by suggesting that honoring NATO is a conditional proposition.</p></li>
<li><p>He claims he knows more about ISIS than our top generals and that he would basically fire them immediately - yet his rhetoric about Hillary fighting ISIS her &#39;whole life&#39; is patently absurd given that ISIS hadn&#39;t even formed when Hillary was SoS. He can&#39;t even agree with his own VP on Syria policy - how can he implement his plans when even his closest political ally doesn&#39;t agree with them? His plan to exclusively go after ISIS is misguided in light of the fact that it would hand over territory to Assad and allow Russia and Iran to build a gas pipeline through Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>He casually advocates nuclear proliferation and demonstrates profound ignorance on nuclear policy in general.</p></li>
<li><p>He wildly disrespects members of military on a regular basis (Khan feud, implying vets with PTSD are &#39;not strong&#39;, insulting McCain&#39;s service) which would undermine his effectiveness as commander in chief.</p></li>
<li><p>He has loans from China to the tunes of hundreds of millions of dollars - you honestly believe The Donald would selflessly put the American people&#39;s interests ahead of his own when dealing with them? (And perhaps the same would apply to Russia if rumors about his business dealings there are true.)</p></li>
<li><p>His immigration plans as they relate to national security are just plain stupid. He knows his border wall plan is ludicrously expensive which is why he keeps insisting on the ridiculous proposition that he will force Mexico to pay for it (hint: they will never pay for it in a million years). Not only would the wall be stupidly expensive but it would be largely ineffective as well, or at least, extremely cost-ineffective. His plan to ban all Muslims, putting aside the obvious bigotry and xenophobia, is equally stupid given that we already screen immigrants extremely thoroughly. It also disregards the fact that we have more deaths from white terrorists and Islamic ones since 9/11. </p></li>
<li><p>He harps endlessly on Iran&#39;s sponsorship of terrorism, yet is mysteriously silent on the number one state sponsor of Islamic extremism: Saudi Arabia. Could it be that he isn&#39;t really serious about going after state-sponsored terrorism, and just uses Iran as a way to criticize Obama, or is it perhaps that he has <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-donald-trump-made-millions-saudi-government-article-1.2777211">business dealings with Saudi Arabia</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>World leaders everywhere have been continuously begging Americans not to elect Trump - good litmus test for how America will be perceived if he is elected.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if his plans were logically sound, the guy can&#39;t go a single day without making some asinine statement that insults one group of people or another - he would be a diplomatic nightmare and would have trouble accomplishing his plans due to alienating key foreign powers.</p></li>

Regardless of if it was taken out of context, a big part of being a diplomatic and effective politican is ensuring that what you say can&#39;t be taken out of context. If Trump can&#39;t communicate with tact in a job that requires the uptmost care in the words you say then that&#39;s a point against him.

I&#39;ll give Trump the benefit of the doubt that he was trying to express sympathy (or at least, emulate it, since I kind of doubt he&#39;s actually capable of true sympathy), but his phrasing is incredibly insensitive - if not having PTSD means that you&#39;re &#39;strong&#39;, then doesn&#39;t that pretty much directly imply someone with PTSD is <strong>not</strong> strong and/or can&#39;t handle themselves? Not only is that really insulting, it&#39;s inaccurate from a medical standpoint. Don&#39;t care about my interpretation? Fine.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Robichaux: Good morning Mr. Trump. As you mentioned there is a tragic suicide epidemic among our veterans, among our military and their families. While the military and the V.A. are working on the problem, their efforts continue to fall short. There are a number of faith-based programs outside the DOD and the V.A., that are continuing to be successful in stopping suicide and divorce rates.</p>

<p>Spiritual fitness works on these types of problems. The government is not taking advantage of these programs and services. So my question for you is, when you become president, will you support and fund a more holistic approach to solve the problems and issues of veteran suicide, PTSD, TBI and other related military mental and behavioral health issues and will you take steps to restore the historic role of our Chaplains and the importance of spiritual fitness and spiritual resiliency programs?</p>

<p>Trump: Yes I would. Look we need that so badly and when you… when you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you’re strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can’t handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn’t see in a movie, nobody would believe it.</p>

<p>Now we need a mental health help and medical. And it’s one of the things that I think is least addressed and is one of the things that — like your question — one of the things that I hear the most about when I go around and talk to the veterans. So we’re going to have a very, very robust, level of performance having to do with mental health. We are losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care.</p>

<p>You know when you hear the 22 suicides a day it’s a big part of your question. But when you hear the 22 suicides a day that should never be. That should never be. So we’re going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue is going to be a very important issue when I take over and the V.A. is going to be fixed in so many ways but that’s going to be one of the ways we’re going to help.</p>

<p>And that’s in many respects going to be the number one thing we have to do. Because I think it’s really been left behind. OK? Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Clinton is bad but Trump is a walking disaster. For all his finger pointing and ranting about how badly people are being screwed, in which he is often right, he has no better policies of his own. The big plan is just to cut taxes and everyone can be a miner or work in a factory because there will be so many jobs for everyone.</p>

<p>He&#39;s living in fantasy land and so are his supporters. If you want to change things, grow a pair of balls, start unions, go on strike, demand more at a grassroots level.

<p>Can we just write him off as a total loony?  I mean, isn&#39;t there some truth to this?  I believe that might be a mistake. Our government does not have our best intentions. It seems they want a perpetual war and they&#39;re not making decisions that benefit the people of the world nor the people of the US</p>

<p>I agree with him on this. If every country has nukes then it would effectively cause peace. I know it&#39;s ironic but it&#39;s true. When only certain countries have nukes you have power hierarchies and oppressed countries ala Israel owning the Middle East. If you&#39;re honest then you have to admit that having only a few countries like the U.S. maintaining nuclear dominance is unfair and gives us excessive power over the world.</p>

<p>Muslims will always pose a threat as long we&#39;re going after ISIS--which I don&#39;t think we shouldn&#39;t be. Everytime an American or a European fighter jet bombs ISIS and kills some innocent Muslims Muslims in America and Europe retaliate against the host country. And of course, the more we bomb them the more refugees there will be. ISIS is a no-win situation for us so we shouldn&#39;t be fighting them at all this is a problem for the relevant Muslim countries to deal with. Oh and, he originally said he wanted a temporary ban on Muslims, and has changed to &quot;extreme vetting.&quot;</p>

<p>He claims he knows more about ISIS than our top generals and that he would basically fire them immediately - yet his rhetoric about Hillary fighting ISIS her &#39;whole life&#39; is patently absurd given that ISIS hadn&#39;t even formed when Hillary was SoS. He can&#39;t even agree with his own VP on Syria policy - how can he implement his plans when even his closest political ally doesn&#39;t agree with them? His plan to exclusively go after ISIS is misguided in light of the fact that it would hand over territory to Assad and allow Russia and Iran to build a gas pipeline through Syria.</p>

<p>This is terribly rambly.  I&#39;m not even sure what you are saying except for that last point, and I can&#39;t tell if you are being serious.  So what if Russia and Iran build a gas pipeline?  Big fucking deal.  At least it would put a stop to the refugee crisis (thank, Hillary, for that one).</p>

<p>The Khan situation was ugly, but it was also a harped-up attack by the Clinton campaign.  End of story.  He never said vets with PTSD are &#39;not strong&#39; the way speak.  That&#39;s false.  As for insulting McCain&#39;s service, I don&#39;t know enough about his service but I know he&#39;s not terribly popular among my military friends.</p>

<p>So what?  He wants to renegotiate China&#39;s &quot;most favored nation&quot; status.  You can&#39;t possibly get more chummy with China than we are already.  You&#39;re holding this up as a spectre of horror but ... so the fuck what?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His immigration plans as they relate to national security are just plain stupid. He knows his border wall plan is ludicrously expensive which is why he keeps insisting on the ridiculous proposition that he will force Mexico to pay for it (hint: they will never pay for it in a million years). Not only would the wall be stupidly expensive but it would be largely ineffective as well, or at least, extremely cost-ineffective. His plan to ban all Muslims, putting aside the obvious bigotry and xenophobia, is equally stupid given that we already screen immigrants extremely thoroughly. It also disregards the fact that we have more deaths from white terrorists and Islamic ones since 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to give you this one, but frankly you are a little off base.  He intends to pay for it by scalping money transmissions across the border, if the Mexican government doesn&#39;t pay for it.  And furthermore, border fences work great.  Ask Israel.  Or ask the multiple states around Iraq and Syria that are building border walls RIGHT NOW to keep out ISIS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He harps endlessly on Iran&#39;s sponsorship of terrorism, yet is mysteriously silent on the number one state sponsor of Islamic extremism: Saudi Arabia. Could it be that he isn&#39;t really serious about going after state-sponsored terrorism, and just uses Iran as a way to criticize Obama, or is it perhaps that he has business dealings with Saudi Arabia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, he&#39;s been pretty quiet on Saudi Arabia.  I&#39;m going to digress a little bit and point out that SA has been actively funding the Clinton presidency.  Trump deserves the American vote for this alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World leaders everywhere have been continuously begging Americans not to elect Trump - good litmus test for how America will be perceived if he is elected.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your opinion and you are certainly entitled to it.  However, if you actually pay attention to the man himself rather than what his enemies prattle about on endless repeat, you would know that this is simply false.</p>

<p>It is not reasonable at all. In fact, it&#39;s insane. NATO is a core component of American hegemony and therefore world stability. It is the primary deterrent to Russian aggression in Europe. Without it, Russia would be more or less free to do in Europe what it did in Crimea. Sure, they&#39;re (hopefully) not much of a threat to us at this point in time, but dismantling NATO would probably be the surest way to return us back to the Cold War and worse.

<p>I don&#39;t understand how it is rambly to point out how absurdly stupid, uninformed, and contradictory his comments about ISIS are in virtually every aspect. Let&#39;s put aside for a moment that he can&#39;t even get basic facts right, like the length of time that ISIS has existed. The essence of his plans is that we are going to aggressively bomb ISIS without putting troops on the ground. Assuming this bombing is successful, who is going to take over once ISIS is gone? The obvious answer is Assad. The only thing his plan will accomplish is to directly serve the objectives of a state that is effectively at war with us (Syria). It would not end the refugee crisis, it would in fact possibly make it worse since it would allow Assad to focus on fighting the rebel groups more effectively, not to mention all the refugees created by bombing ISIS&#39;s human shields.</p>

<p>This will not work.</p>

<p>They work great, for a cost. A cost which would be astronomical given the length of the border, and which, economically speaking, would come nowhere close to justifying its benefits.</p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s a bad look for Hillary, but then again it&#39;s a bad look for America as a whole anyway, pretty much at the core of our issues in the ME. The reality is SA is our strategic ally. The next president is going to have to work with them so why insult them by refusing their donations? At least Hillary has acknowledged that they are the number one funders of extremist terrorism. And at least she acknowledges that climate change is a thing, which hopefully means she takes action to develop renewable energy so we can distance ourselves from oil-producing shitholes.</p>

<p>This is just another way of saying that he&#39;ll spend money for his pork barrel projects differently than Clintons pork barrels. </p>

<p>People need to understand that the system is rigged and both sides are part of the system. It&#39;s impossible for the ruling elite to lose when they control both sides. It&#39;s naive to think that they would not have planned things like this, when if we were running things, thats how we would have done it.</p>

Not to mention war with Russia, and hence risk of extinction level nuclear war, being tens or hundred of times greater with Clinton willing to start shooting over how Russia treats gays.</p>

<p>So even if you&#39;re 100% convinced Trump will loot the country like an African dictator just those three things make him a far better option than Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While my cynical mindset has often landed me at the same core conclusion--that the whole thing is all rigged, top-to-bottom, and all the way across--I think the material evidences that have been made possible due to an intersect of technological access and exposure to information point out a very clear indicator of who a corrupt candidate really is.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is a vote to maintain the establishment. Perhaps DTJ is not the most skilled politician, but I can resonate with the <em>movement</em> he&#39;s provoked among ACTUAL people--people working right now to expose more and more corruption in emails that are being released daily. To a person like me, he is more symbolic of heading in a better direction--because, let&#39;s face it: there is no quick-fix for our system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, a vast majority of voters in the country are woefully uninformed and uneducated--even those who have been through its instutions and are socially percevied as well-adjusted individuals.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much Trump urging his camp into violence, as it is the camp itself aligning with his anti-Establishment sentiment. It is, however, true that the fringe of this camp will express desires to resort to violence in order to accomplish their political goal. That said, there is just as much violence <em>actually</em> enacted by liberals, as in the case of Trump supporters being physically attacked in recent weeks and months. </p>

<p>A sad state of affairs, really. But do not paint Trump as a sole candidate trying to rile anyone up. It is the populace itself that responds to ideological stimuli. This is seen time and time again, though certainly worse than ever before in this particular election cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m skeptical too. However I will say that the R and D establishment have been actively trying to squash him since the beginning. The fact that the neocons (I say Clinton is a neocon too) hate and oppose him so much is the only thing that might suggest Trump is the real deal (meaning he&#39;s looking out for every day American interests). As a libertarian, I oppose nationalism and disagree with many of his stated policies, but nationalism is still far better than globalism, which is exactly what Clinton and the neocons want. </p>

<p>It turns out this theory was partially confirmed through the emails.  He didn&#39;t run to help her, but she and her campaign wanted the candidate to either be Trump, Cruz or Carson.

With Trump, I disagree that he&#39;s corrupt, but it&#39;s okay if you think that he is, because with Trump you get to try again in 4 years.  Hillary is an eight year presidency, minimum, and do you really think she won&#39;t rig the polls even further than she already has?  The Clinton Foundation is the face of the enemy here, the one backed by the globalists.  At some point we have to back a horse, even if you want to abolish the horse races entirely.  I&#39;m backing the horse who won&#39;t rig the races for good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a monster of the Clinton campaign&#39;s own creation. They were pushing for Trump since the start because they thought he would be easy for Hillary to beat. And then they realized it wouldn&#39;t be the case and started to pull every dirty trick in the book. They subverted Bernie&#39;s efforts even though he stood a decent chance of beating anyone, including Trump and then after the primaries they continued to use their political and media influence to cheat. </p>

<p>Are we to believe that a debate question was leaked to Clinton just once? Are we to believe that Clinton attempted to get an event rescheduled (or canceled) to favor her number, just that one time? There were emails of her staff asking the GOP to change their plans, do you think she&#39;d even have to send such email to ask this favor of the DNC? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve often viewed the DNC as the less evil and corrupt of the two major American political parties but it is clear that their hunger for victory has compromised their judgement. Maybe they were always this corrupt and just were better at hiding it, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised given their cozy relationship with the media.</p>

<p>Hillary is either complicit in a criminal undertaking or benefiting greatly from a large network of people committing criminal acts on her behalf. She cannot possibly be unaware of the events that have been revealed from these leaks. I think Trump is a fascist and that he shouldn&#39;t be allowed near the reigns of power. The issue is the power of the office of the president, where one individual holds so much authority in a country that deeply divided on large and important issues. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had it with the GOP and DNC. 
I will be voting third party from now on.</p>

<p>This is exactly how I have felt. I think at the top democrats and republicans are two sides of the same coin. Like Hillary pushing for fracking. They both push what their global elite puppet masters want. That&#39;s why I believe the GOP establishment has come out against Trump.</p>

<p>I think its important to remember that it hasn&#39;t always been this way and its really the corporate infiltration of politics that is very much at the root of the problem. Any time you see bullshit politics, corporate money is flowing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a die hard progressive and I still see the legitimacy in a lot of conservative ideals. In my lifetime I would love to see legitimate discussion of the ideas between intellectual progressives and conservatives, without all the horseshit &quot;religious freedoms&quot; and &quot;transgender PC everything&quot; pushed to obfuscate the real issues. </p>

<p>It pisses me off that no matter what the problems this country faces, its always these surface issues that receive the most commentary. And its clearer than ever that the collusion between politicians (mainly the Clinton associates) and the media is deeply embedded to push a very specific agenda that very few seem to actually want or cared about until the media told them to. When I was still in communications research, I knew of a fair number of people doing paid research in exploiting useful idiots. Its just disgusting...</p>

<p>No.  The way it was implemented in NYC and how Trump has been pushing was ruled unconstitutional.

<p>I&#39;m not the OP, but I&#39;ll answer.   Fact checking organizations pore over public speeches and debates.  In checking &quot;statements of fact&quot; Trump proves to be the worst we&#39;ve had in the US since they started fact-checking.  It&#39;s hard to quantify, but he is about twice as bad as the average <em>politician</em> and about 2.5-3 times worse than H Clinton.  Everybody gets things wrongs, tries to phrase something in the most positive light, or as is popular in the case of politicians ... to just deny it and hope that nobody challenges you.  And Trump is the worst I&#39;ve seen for US national politics.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really interesting is that Trump supporters don&#39;t really even seem to care whether he&#39;s accurate or not.</p>

<p>She was not taken off the case.  The ruling stands and has not been appealed.</p>

<p>Are you an troll?  Or are you stupid enough to just believe what Trump tells you?  Read the link for the accurate details:  <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/is-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional/">http://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/is-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional/</a></p>

<p>If you go ahead an inform yourself by reading the link, you&#39;ll see that &quot;stop and frisk&quot; wasn&#39;t ruled unconstitutional ... it was the way that NYC implemented &quot;stop and frisk&quot; (racial profiling) that was ruled unconstitutional.  Of course, it should not be a surprise that what Trump supported was the racial profiling aspect ... ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it wasn&#39;t the supreme court anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re just making yourself look stupid.  State courts can rule on constitutionality of state laws (both US and state constitutions; these rulings, though, apply only in the given state).  Federal courts can rule on constitutionality (US constitution; applies nationwide).  And there is an appeal process that goes through successive tiers of authority until it is not accepted by the higher court or goes to the Supreme Court.   It has not been appealed ... so it stands in NYC.</p>

<p>Because the President doesn&#39;t have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor.  He <em>can</em> instruct his AG to do this ... but due to Nixon&#39;s use of this power, even that has some severe boundaries in the US.  In this case, since it has already been investigated by the FBI ... it almost certainly wouldn&#39;t satisfy these criteria.  And for good reason.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from Paul Charlton (GOP) who spent a decade as a federal prosecutor before serving as U.S. attorney for Arizona under President George W. Bush.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For Donald Trump to say he will have a special prosecutor appointed and to have tried and convicted her already and say she’d go to jail is wholly inappropriate and the kind of talk more befitting a Third World country than it is our democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was nose diving in the polls long before the Access Hollywood tape.  His horrible debate performance, the Alicia Machado issue leading to him tweeting at 4 AM to look at her sex tape, and the revelation of his tax returns that he lost a billion dollars and likely hadn&#39;t paid taxes in twenty years were tanking his polls.</p>

<p>The Access Hollywood tape was just pouring gasoline on a dumpster fire, but he was diving in the polls long before then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly the Trump campaign as-it-is is a fraud, but committed by whom? By his advisers against Trump, by Trump against the Republicans voters, by Trump and the DNC against the whole of the electorate? Political opposition research on oneself is a sine qua non of American campaigning for high office, if it was not undertaken (apparently not even minimally) then one can safely assume the campaign was not genuine ab initio. This means that this presidential election there was no true election, at least from the time Trump became the Republican presidential candidate, but rather a pre-selection based on an inevitable mediatically-effected defenestration of the Trumpian sacrificial effigy from the zealously defended tower of political legitimacy: at this point Kim Jong-un has as much of a chance of being elected the next president of the United States as does Donald J. Trump.</p>

Unknown economic consequences to his businesses, a tarnished family name, death threats of which many are likely legitimate threats etc.... Seriously people, any regular candidate could have been a puppet to prop up Hillary, like perhaps the radical left Socialist Bernie to make her look more rational. Why would nearly the entire world be at Trumps throat if he was a shill. And since when has the establishment ever exhausted so many resources on a single candidate, when such a clear bias?
For fu*ks sake, the governments official story after 2 planes vaporized 3 buildings and destroyed the black box&#39;s was that one of the terrorist passports miraculously emerged unscathed. The 911 story is full of so many holes it&#39;s pathetic, yet it was sufficient to fool the masses, so why expend so many resources to make Trump look bad unless he is a legitimate threat??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree.  It&#39;s Truly mind boggling how someone so intelligent could appear to be so stupid at times. He is under attack night and day, and I am sure it&#39;s taking a toll on his sanity and ability to not react emotionally. If we were to debate something at length and you could not back out of the conversation, at some point one of us would no longer maintain our composure and say something unintelligent. Ones ability to make intelligent decisions is not always adequately represented in their initial emotional reactions, its how they proceed afterwards that determines their success.</p>

<p>People in general like to believe that they are intelligent creatures that base their decisions on facts and logic. Sadly, to a varying degree, and for many to a  much higher degree, we respond to and act on decisions on an emotional level. I believe he exploits this to garnish support from certain demographics, and has calculated the risk and determined that it&#39;s beneficial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I really don&#39;t think Trump has been making more &quot;outrageous&quot; comments recently, it&#39;s just that voters generally don&#39;t pay much attention until the first debate and then it became clear that his various troubles like insulting the Khan family, asking that judge to step down, commenting that mexicans are rapists, were not exceptions but simply who Trump has been the entire time. </p>

<p>Remember last election how Mitt Romney got hammered over his one 47% comment? Trump has been making those kinds of offensive remarks the entire time and it seems like it&#39;s caught up to him.</p>

<p>Do you think that Trumps current woes are worse than the ones he faced earlier? Do you think he did worse in his two debates than in the primaries? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s the Trump that ran for President, he would have a much better chance. He was poised, rational, clear, and eloquent and talked respectfully to a black woman moderating him. The Trump actually running in contrast babbles incoherently, constantly sabotages himself, is erratic, shouts lies, is xenophobic and misogynistic. So the question is why? We have evidence in this video that shows that either he has developed demential in his old age, or he is purposely trying to lose. If the latter, why? Why would he want to squash all other Republican candidates and then deliberately lose in spectacular fashion? The only explanation I have is that he is a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shared you line of thought for quite some time. It&#39;s truly a confusing mess trying to figure out what the heck is up with Donald Trump. I&#39;ve reduced it 2 two thoughts. 1. He has Bi-polar disorder and this is responsible for his erratic behavior. 2. He is a shill ,or developed Dementia.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I believe he most likely has Bi-polar disorder and suffer from poor emotional impulse control. He is very intelligent and capable of making good decisions, but periodically suffers from his low emotional Iq.</p>

<p>Trump is far from perfect and there are many flaws in his character, however I believe he is competent and well enough composed to act as chief commander. </p>

<p>Read up on Andrew Jackson. He had a temper like none-other. He got into duels while president, at his funeral his parrot had to be removed because it was swearing incessantly. However he accomplished something no single other man could have. </p>

<p>He killed the federal banks. Well at least for a while.

<p>The time is not for calm talking, it is time to beat on the drums and sound the alarms. There is no room for Political Correctness.

<p>They do prove to be correct more often than not though. Like I mentioned above, I&#39;m willing to consider that the voting is rigged to fit the polling data. It&#39;s just a question of how far down the rabbit hole we want to go. </p>

<p>The whole point though is that there is no evidence that Trump is winning. Well I take that back, you have one poll saying this. All the other polls say the opposite though. This still suggests that Hilaries plan is still on track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a little foray into the rabbit hole. Let&#39;s say the Hillary campaign&#39;s internal polling shows Trump leading.  Say they are planning on rigging the election in their favor a little or a lot depending on the lead.  The polls must match somewhat the rigged vote numbers, so they have to rig the mainstream media polls or the disparity will be too obvious on Election Day and the rigging will be obvious.  I know Roger Stone has a site asking for volunteers to conduct exit polling to expose any rigging and I&#39;ve heard Trump mention that he is also concerned about a fix so this seems not too far fetched for some.</p>

<p>So if there was evidence to show that Trump actually did something substantial to stop potential vote rigging (not just mentioning  it a couple times), then I could agree that he&#39;s truly opposed to Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please think of it another way. It&#39;s not free coverage, it&#39;s that the media is focused on sensationalist , clickbait subjects and, just in being the fucktard-machine that he is, Trump fed into that machine perfectly. Along the way, he became the lightning rod for how angry America is at the Establishment. This is not any kind of plan on the media&#39;s part. He just tapped into the way their machine is already setup to run perfectly. Trump is basically a hostile takeover of a party that was using the very same mechanisms he was using in The Apprentice.</p>

<p>I can agree with this, except that when the Clintons were searching for a stooge to run up against, they would have been smart enough to know that Trump is a king of marketing. Between the king of marketing and the queen of insider knowledge, they surely had considered all the angles that things would play out. We shouldn&#39;t underestimate their intelligence and tenacity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really man? I think you may need to hop off the BernieBro idealism train. Although I vehemently disagree with Sanders&#39;s democratic socialist platform, it really seemed like he was an outsider who was ready to shake things up in pursuit of what he thought of as the greater good. However, I lost 100% of my respect for him when he weakly flipped and endorsed Hillary. That&#39;s inexcusable in my book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in another comment, I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that he cared about the average American prior to running for office. That makes it hard for me to believe that a switch just turned on in him that made him start caring so passionately about average Joe&#39;s well being.</p>

<p>I agree that the majority of media is biased towards Clinton (and has been for quite some time). I am aware that the media influences my opinions. </p>

<p>However, my distaste for Trump began when HE was using the media to construct a caricature of himself to further his fame/fortune. He literally built the character that is being torn apart now. The macho successful man&#39;s man character who wins at all cost worked great for his ego/persona/empire. Not so much for president. I also expected his demeanor to be different than my expectations when watching him debate. I thought for sure that the Trump I had in my head based on his reality TV character and random blurbs was a front that he put on &quot;for the show&quot;. But time and time again, that same character showed up to debate after debate, speech after speech. </p>

<p>So yes, the media IS biased and that&#39;s a huge problem, which is why I think this was a great speech. But I believe Trump making this speech allows people to take it less seriously than they should due to his role in creating &quot;the monster&quot; that the media portrays him as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to what caricature you believe he made, and how the media is ripping it apart? The media has capitalised on the common person&#39;s ignorance of business operation, and doubled down on personal attacks that attempt to make his braggadocio actions somehow non-presidential. When all else failed, they have resorted to what appear to be outright lies.</p>

<p>The entirety of their actions have been laughable, if they had not left me so depressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say the media is ripping him apart, I&#39;m referring to the same things you are. Character attacks mainly. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not passing judgement on whether they are accurate or not because I don&#39;t know the guy and I&#39;m aware that our media is biased and real investigative journalism is all but dead here. But it is the same characteristics that made Trump a household name in the first place that are being played on/spun by the media to showcase him as non-presidential now. He helped create the braggadocious asshole they are portraying him as and it has benefited him up to this point (by way of increasing his media coverage&gt;fame&gt;wealth.)</p>

<p>Again, this was a great speech that needed to be said. I just don&#39;t think Trump is the best messenger for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Resorting to name calling when you&#39;re trying to have a civil discussion isn&#39;t very effective but I&#39;ll respond anyway.</p>

<p>His actions up to this point (i.e. prior to his presidential run) have not convinced me that he passionately cares about the average person. If you have evidence to the contrary, provide it and we can discuss.</p>

<p>What exactly are you referring to when you say he has sacrificed and risked everything? I was under the impression that he is going to be fine (if not better off) financially/professionally after this election regardless of the outcome based on his past endeavors in which he has leveraged his fame (which has undoubtedly increased due to his presidential bid) to profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he has sacrificed everything, the first week into his campaign he lost many business partners (Macy&#39;s, Univision, etc) and you look at whats going on today, his reputation is being viciously attacked by the left bringing up false accusations to smear him. </p>

<p>Do you ever stop to imagine what being attacked like that by the media/press is like for him/his family? Seeing these frauds spin their narratives and lies about him on the news 24/7? This guy is carrying a massive burden, I myself believe he really loves his country and wants to give back to it because its done so much for him.</p>

<p>But think about it, he put his life on the line to run for office when he didn&#39;t have to, he could be relaxing in one of his resorts or enjoying his time golfing but instead chose to run, flying across the country (which isn&#39;t cheap btw) doing 1 hour rallies 1-3 times a day, taking the time to meet with small communities and speak with them directly, spending over 100million out of his own pocket to fund his campaign.</p>

<p>You look at what he said in West Palm Beach and its eerily similar to JFK&#39;s speech before he was killed, so ya, he is putting his life on the line doing this, and doing it against a lying, murdering crook who is known for making her political opposition disappear (I think she knows she can&#39;t have him killed like she wants so she&#39;s assassinating his character instead) </p>

<p>So you say he&#39;ll be fine after all this but just take a look at what Hillary and the left are trying to do to him and how all these accusations just happen to start coming out 28 days before the election. Her whole campaign is a fraud and he knows it, he knows what she did and how she sold out her country when she was SoS, he knows its going to be the end of America if she becomes President and he&#39;s the only one capable of standing strong against her fucked up, demonic Clinton machine that is being fueled by billionaire globalists all over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does he have in mind then if not the average American? He said it in the speech, he could have just rested on his laurels and lived a life of sheer luxury for the rest of his days. He could have influenced politics and agendas, he could have himself just donated to the Clinton&#39;s for favors. Lobbied for tax cuts for the rich, paid politicians for speeches, etc. Instead he risked it all on a campaign against the establishment. Donald J Trump is a man for the people, he is <strong>exactly</strong> who the framers saw running our country. A successful business man who wants to donate his time to our country. This is a great speech and not only am I not disappointed Donald gave it, I believe he is the only person who could have made this speech and meant it. </p>

<p>DJT is our only hope to defeat globalism. Our country has been taken over. Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are literally interchangeable. The establishment must die and we have a chance to fire the first shot on November 8th. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>by that, what he really means is &quot;I&#39;m a clinton donor and long-time family friend who has been set up to act as false opposition to a Clinton and to make you people think you have a dog in this race, and potentially to convince you that you&#39;ve &#39;won something&#39; or &#39;took the government back&#39; or &#39;beaten the corruption&#39;, by electing a billion-heir clinton donor&quot;. It&#39;s also saying &quot;stay in your houses, don&#39;t protest, fall for this scam and think you&#39;re being represented&quot;.</p>

<p>it&#39;s sad to see people falling for it. it&#39;s just a management technique and he&#39;s the republican version of Obama (someone the rich employed to make people think they were getting &#39;change&#39; after the Bush II years.. but who really just did all the same things and then some, but he <em>says</em> all the right things). It&#39;s almost like they picked Trump specifically to make a mockery of the people who think they&#39;re &quot;fighting the elite&quot;.</p>

<p>This entire election is an opera/political theater - it&#39;s the same as Putin&#39;s wife &quot;running against&quot; Putin&#39;s long-time family friend and donor/golf buddy (which is what Trump is to Clinton the First). If the Russian people are sick of the Putin mafia, they&#39;d need to provide a new fake opposition candidate and a big false political &quot;struggle&quot; to trick the Russians into thinking they&#39;ve changed something - while really changing nothing. That way they&#39;ll sit down and shut up and think they&#39;ve &quot;won&quot;. This is a social management technique.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking this must be the first election for a lot of people in their adult lives, so they don&#39;t realize that this scam has been played out over and over again through the decades, and they&#39;re still thinking they can &quot;get their guy in&quot; and change something. It will be a disappointment for you all, the same as Obama was for the people who fell for that guy and his great &#39;change&#39; speeches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding. Everything just aligns too well. </p>

<p>2008 comes, Clintons people start the whole birther scandal and Trump lightly jumps on board. </p>

<p>2011 comes around, Clintons and Trump supposedly have a falling out but now Trump is pushing a very vocal birther movement. </p>

<p>2015 rolls around and even though they are supposedly on bad terms, Bill Clinton is calling Trump, urging him to run for president, to which Trump agrees</p>

<p>Trump is now running for president, with a ton of fringe conservative supporters backing him, riled up on an anti-Obama message that started with Clinton</p>

<p>He has regularly said very stupid things. He does very little to actually ever correct these errors in judgement. And aside from this speech, very rarely directly attacks Clinton on all her bullshit - instead almost always gets half of an attack right and the rest a jumbled mess of crap that winds up making it look not as bad as it should.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t trust him. He regularly donated to their slush fund. That should give anyone pause, unless you are under some ill conceived idea that a man at his level of power, would be unaware of the Clintons wheeling and dealing.</p>

<p>I feel like we are living in a country wide Truman show...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason why conspiracy theorists get a bad reputation is that so many will cling to a specific theory as the 100% correct answer.  Conspiracy theorists all agreed there was something shady about 9/11 that the government is hiding from us... but the ones that go too<sup><sup>*</sup></sup> far are the ones that state with 100% certainty that they know the specific interworkings of how the event was conspired and took place.</p>

<p>Personally, my interest in conspiracy theories is somewhat mundane:  Of course, political and business leaders work together to maintain the status quo because that is, in their minds, stability and security for the country/world, which ensures the country/world continue to exist and those figureheads continue to live comfortable lives.  Naturally, they give little thought or care to the overall direction of the world/country so long as the stability/security/comfort of themselves and a couple generations after them can be preserved.</p>

<p>What this means is that hell fucking yes Hillary is part of that conspiracy.  But hell fucking no does that <strong>necessarily</strong> mean that Trump is the answer.  Trump <em>might</em> be the answer.  But I sure as fuck haven&#39;t seen any evidence that he cares about anyone other than himself.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t controlled and that&#39;s why the Clinton campaign is so scared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re too jaded to think that change may happen, but if you actually looked at the facts you&#39;d see that there has never been anyone like Trump in the history of US politics. He&#39;s not backed by special interests. He&#39;s spent his entire career in the free market, being an entrepreneur and satisfying customers. He&#39;s written some of the most successful business books ever while the political scum of Washington DC are driving up national debt and starting endless wars in the ME. </p>

<p>This guy was down <strong>a billion dollars</strong> in 1995 (hence the tax scandal) and managed to come back from it, writing the Art of the Comeback in response. So unless you have any actual evidence that Trump is exactly the same as the rest of the political vermin instead of pessimism and a tired distaste for the guy that you picked up from the venom spewed out by the mainstream media, I wouldn&#39;t give in so quick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why you still think its just all &#39;for his ego&#39;. The man left his comfortable billionaire life to get completely attacked from every angle by the media and both sides of the political establishment, harrassed by swarms of idiot regressives, his life threatened, his brand most likely irreparably tarnished, his family put under fire, etc. </p>

<p>As for the ground troops, its been established that not leaving troops in destabilised regions is what led ISIS to properly form in the first place. Trump&#39;s stance has been completely anti-interventionist for the past 30 years, long before he ran for office. Its why he proposed to have far far less troops than Hillary. He doesnt like it but its necessary.</p>

<p>Trump doesnt want to ramp up budget, he wants to <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/08/donald-trump-denounces-wasteful-pentagon">reduce waste</a>.</p>

<p>Trump wants to have an Isolationist ideology where the military is only used for defense (like Israel). I&#39;m preeeeetty sure a massively successful businessman knows that warmongering is bad for business. (unless you&#39;re backed by special interest which he isnt)</p>

<p>The same cant be said for Hillary though. But you know I keep an open mind. Maybe you and others are right and he isnt what he turns out to be. He&#39;d still never be a worse choice than HRC I can promise you that. In my opinion not voting is a vote for her so I&#39;ll take my chances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the big thing that changes if Trump wins is it legitamizes sexual harassment, racism, bigotry and ugliness of the heart. I hear what you are saying, but if Trump is elected, all of the hatred and disgust he has been spewing for the last few months becomes admirable, because they are traits of a President. So the next generation of children will grow up thinking it&#39;s OK to grab women by the pussy even if they done want it. They will think it&#39;s OK to denegrade women. That it&#39;s OK to tar an entire religion with a brush. That calling all Mexicans rapists and murderers is acceptable and admirable. </p>

<p>Honestly, if Trump hadn&#39;t said all of those disgusting things, I think he&#39;d be a shoe in this election.  I just don&#39;t think the American people are ready for their President to be a racist, sexist, rude, nasty, crude, tax dodging piece of shit. I may be wrong though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need to downvote you. You are speaking in a professional demeanor and contributing valid points to the discussion. The fact that we may disagree about certain points and can have an intelligent discussion without insulting one another is both refreshing and always welcomed.</p>

<p>He has said many inexcusable things and unfortunately many people would prefer to try and silence speech that they interpret as hurtful, hateful or just offensive. There is no excuse for  many of the things that he has said, however, I too have said and unfortunately continue to occasionally say very inappropriate things. I pride myself in being an egalitarian, but I have said things that are sexist and even racist. These things that I have said are not accurate representations of how I genuinely feel or believe about people or reflected in the my relationships and interactions with people, but sometimes I get overwhelmed when the very same groups of people I try to advocate for, are gunning me down simply because I am a white male. </p>

<p>The next generation of children will grow up however their family decides to raise them. Which unfortunately for many families due to democrat welfare policies will be without a father figure. You should not rely on sheltering your children from the world to ensure they develop good moral values. People need to take more responsibility in their parenting and not rely on society to ensure their kids don&#39;t become racist or xenophobes. </p>

<p>He never called all Mexicans rapists and murders, he said Mexico is sending us rapist and murderers. And sadly Mexico, like many countries has a lot of bad people, many of which Mexico is dumping into the US.
 Trump did however say this in the least elegant and likely most offensive possible manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. Getting citizens united overturned is extremely important. Trump has zero interest in that. Getting serious about climate change is extremely important. Trump thinks its a hoax. Making sure women have reproductive health access is extremely important. Trump wants to punish women for having abortions.

<p>We still have a just over 50% voting rate in this country, we should be shooting for 80+%. We need automatic voter registration. Critics of progressive voting rights laws often try to claim that fraud (at the individual voter level) is an issue but it hasnt shown to be at all significant. Gerrymandering, shutting down polling places on short notice, putting less polling places in minority areas etc are all still issues. And if you want to get into fraud im sure there are plenty of threads on here about electronic polling machines being hacked, paper ballots going missing etc. Maybe the conservative justices were right in 2013 when they struck down section 4 of the voting rights act, we need a new updated act that looks closely at the present situation with disenfranchised voters and the ability of ballots to be manipulated. We should be making it easier for people to vote, not more difficult. I&#39;ve always thought voting day should be a federal holiday (not sure if either candidate has brought this up).</p>

<p>Absolutely no one (besides maybe the born-again&#39;s who think the world is only a few thousand years old) is claiming that &quot;climate change&quot; hasn&#39;t happened before. And yes Milankovitch cycles are taken into account. The change is happening much more rapidly than it would naturally. There is not a single defensible argument against man made global warming. I&#39;m not saying I think a carbon tax is the best way of dealing with it, or that politicians didn&#39;t find a way to capitalize upon carbon emissions. Climate change is the end product of 2 centuries of reckless environmental destruction. Our rivers lakes and streams are poisoned. Poor air quality is responsible for literally millions of deaths every year. It is absolutely essential to our survival as a culture if not species that we reign this in as fast as possible. We need to be thinking about what the world will be like in 100 years, 200 years even and aiming for sustainability not endless consumption and growth.
Its funny that you say you&#39;re all for clean air then that man made warming is a fallacy - the planet is warming because of poor air quality. I urge you to do more research, any question that has been raised by climate deniers has been answered. </p>

<p>I am not a Hillary supporter per se and not a registered democrat. I am going to vote for her because I&#39;m not convinced yet that it&#39;ll be a landslide against Trump, and I believe he would be the worst president this country has ever had. If you want to break the 2 party system vote libertarian or green party so that hopefully at least one of them will get the 5% it takes to get federal funding in 2020. I&#39;m not the person to debate you over Trump v Clinton policy. Feel free to respond to this with any rebuttals though or I&#39;d be happy to continue the conversation through pm.</p>

<p>I definitely will keep an open mind on the subject, as I am well aware of the consequences, and I appreciate and respect your response.
However, currently The evidence I have studied (satellite) the professor I lectured with, who was a former Geological Consultant for NASA,  and hours of reading have not convinced me that we understand climate change well enough to be making drastic economic adjustments that inhibit developing nations. 
Again, It&#39;s not an area I am especially well versed on regarding the Scientific aspects, however, the carbon tax proposal reeks of conspiracy and perhaps this has affected my ability to research the subject impartially. So, I will continue to research the matter. --Thanks..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I looked up a few of those laws and I&#39;m pretty sure all of them just say that if you are stopped by a police officer and are suspected of committing a crime you are required to give them your full name, not that you have to carry identification of any kind. Showing up to the right polling place and providing your full name and address is all you should need to vote. Voter ID laws have all been proposed by racist conservatives in order to keep minorities from voting, not because of any issues that came up with fraud.</p>

<p>I honestly havent looked into the carbon tax enough. I understand al gore made a bunch of money off it somehow (but i think it was ultimately a failure?) - if you have a link to a good source I&#39;d like to read about it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally impossible for someone to be worse than Hillary? Even hypothetically?</p>

So conceivably their is someone who possess all the the undesirable qualities present in Hillary, and is additionally very stupid.

    <div class="md"><p>So ... a rich criminal who&#39;s in bed with the same people as Hillary Clinton, and a war hawk - but instead of being creepily knowledgeable of foreign policy he just talks vaguely about having a &quot;secret plan&quot; to defeat ISIS, or how Russia &quot;will never&quot; invade Ukraine, or whatever? Too stupid to even take advice?</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see how that would be worse than Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I doubt such a person would be competent enough to get elected. They&#39;d probably screw it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Apple made superior products, and the market embraced them. They didn&#39;t firebomb Samsung. They did try to strong-arm other tech companies with lawsuits, but those were either bad money wasted in lawsuits or Pyrrhic victories. Using might harmed their image while gaining nothing. In modern societies the use of might seems always to come at the expense of actual well-being.</p>

<p>Look at Iraq. We kick this hornets nest, and now we have Isis. The Dems and Reps answer to dealing with them is &quot;Kick it again.&quot; Not &quot;Let&#39;s get away from the hornets nest.&quot; Is there any question what the result would be? Sure we could win. If we use WMDs. But that&#39;s not going to happen, is it? Of course lots of people would be willing to say &quot;fuck it,&quot; we&#39;ll actually annihilate the Middle-East. But then were are you? Looking a lot like all the evil regimes of history. We&#39;re not going to do anything, just continue to kick hornets. This would be completely uncontroversial and obvious if people weren&#39;t having their heads warped with propaganda and pride.</p>

<p>Powerful people avoid fights because they can afford to. Might is not having to fight. So why do we keep fighting when we don&#39;t have to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. And we&#39;re at a crossroads where the ideas and policies of both major parties are inferior. Trump is some amalgam of the two, calling himself a Republican, but he&#39;s really just a mishmash of bad ideas from both parties. Authoritarian. Which would be the perfect name if we joined the two together.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s where the philosophy of might makes right has taken us. It&#39;s one thing to recognize that it&#39;s true, and it&#39;s another to embrace it. When any organization or unit or tribe is right all the time for too long, it becomes too big to fail, is broken, or collapses under its own weight. The country than can survive is the one that ages gracefully, sits out of the ring, and uses wisdom rather than brute force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You appear to have somehow concluded I had a specific thing he said on camera in mind. I had several in mind. It&#39;s a thing he says all the time.</p>

<p>Just off the top of my head, Trump has said (in front of a camera) and then denied saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Iraq war was a good idea.</li>
<li>Man, it would be great if we could beat up protesters</li>
<li>If you beat up a protester at one of my rallies, I&#39;ll pay for your legal fees.</li>
<li>If some of the people at the Orlando shooting had been carrying, they might have stopped the shooter. [Not even sure why he bothered lying about this one.]</li>
<li>It&#39;d be better if Japan etc. had nukes</li>
<li>We need to profile Muslims. (<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-never-called-profiling-muslim/">Seriously, he&#39;s denied ever saying that.</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are loads of examples like this I&#39;ve already forgotten, just google it. And that&#39;s without mentioning things he&#39;s tweeted that he categorically denies tweeting (without even bothering to delete the tweets), or news events that never happened he claims he saw on TV, or whatever. </p>

<p>How have you not heard of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where does Trump the Iraq war is a good idea? These are the <strong>videos</strong> of him talking about Iraq:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBiP1-USUrQ&amp;amp;list=LLFvyzy6KCjX8UCapOzq-FRw&amp;amp;index=6">From 2003</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxf1XmVZ9qY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=6m26s">From 2004 and then 2007 immediately after</a></p>

<p>In the often touted audio recording of him on Howard Stern he says in regards to whether we should invade Iraq: Yeah I guess so...you know I wish the first time it was done correctly.&quot; He clearly expresses hesitation about in a second time. More than that, he was an average citizen at the time and this interview took place in 2001. The whole country was fresh off of 9/11 and the Bush admin was feeding us lying about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. Hillary was a NY senator with access to classified information so she probably knew the truth. Plus her husband was a former President. Regardless, here she is actually voting for the Iraq War: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS9y5t0tR0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS9y5t0tR0</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s ludicrous to criticize Trump for Iraq. He had as much knowledge as the average Joe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man, it would be great if we could beat up protesters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no problem with this. He&#39;s not threatening violence he just wishes he could do it. He&#39;s being honest. People happen to appreciate that in a politician. I wish I could beat up Trump protesters too since the Wikileaks emails from the DNC leaks show that those protests were staged by Hillary interns. Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna do it and it doesn&#39;t mean Trump did it either. He&#39;s sharing his honest feelings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you beat up a protester at one of my rallies, I&#39;ll pay for your legal fees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not so great. But it is still a good gesture to offer to pay someone&#39;s legal fees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If some of the people at the Orlando shooting had been carrying, they might have stopped the shooter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said this yes. I don&#39;t rmbr him ever recanting it. He actually believes this. It could be true too. People have used guns to stop massacres before you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to profile Muslims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is understandable I don&#39;t know why you people pretend he&#39;s just pulling this out of his ass. Some Muslims have proven to be seriously dangerous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not criticizing Trump for Iraq, but for lying about it afterwards.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but he wasn&#39;t being honest when he denied having said it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not so nice to say that, and then claim you never said it and refuse to pay when multiple people go through with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said this yes. I don&#39;t rmbr him ever recanting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He later claimed that he was referring to armed security guards, not people at the club carrying in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights. Which is both clearly a lie and fucking idiotic, since there <em>was</em> an armed guard at the club.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know why you people pretend he&#39;s just pulling this out of his ass.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reaching pretty far up his ass to <strong>claim he never said it</strong> in an interview.</p>

<p>You know he has to do this. It&#39;s a two-party system. It&#39;s rigged and it&#39;s also why he needs to appeal to the Christians. The Republicans never wanted to nominate him and reluctantly did so when he overwhelmingly won the primaries. From the beginning, they were against him too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Trump is not a minority, he is not attractive, he is not polite, he is not a woman, he is not overtly religious. He has a huge disadvantage because no one will be backing him for who he is. In a matter of fact, those like him (wealthy, white, old businessmen) will NOT be backing him. If he does win this election it will be solely because of what he had said, not who he is.</p>

<p>I believe his campaign parallels the occupy wall Street movement. You show the American people they do have voices and can protest. Perhaps the movement has many different opinions internally on which way to go but the central idea holding it together is &quot;get your voice back&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope you will not be damned; I wish that on no one! I project very few people will see this, perhaps only just you.</p>

<p>Laissez-faire economic policy is akin to a reset button in many Americans eyes. Our nation started with this form of economics, and has slowly crept towards &quot;authoritarian rule&quot; through the implementation of regulation and taxation. Perhaps regulation and taxation are positives on a free market economy, but I seems apparent the current system in place is a negative on the market. By returning to a Laissez-faire system we can (if we again choose to) rewrite regulation and taxation in a way that has the peoples rights to freedom in mind and allows self-organization. Is it not true that Laissez-faire economics is closer to anarchy than the current system?</p>

<p>Ethnic Nationalism seems to me to be the only logical way to categorize people. I believe that multiculturalism will not create a united nation and would lead to civil war if not addressed. I idolize the idea of a borderless society but realize that this cannot be imposed by government and will not be imposed individually. If we somehow managed to remove border laws from society, individuals would impose their own restrictions to protect their way of life and the people they love from non-assimilating immigration.</p>

<p>I do not understand your comments regarding &quot;vague limits to federal power&quot; being equatable to the &quot;people&#39;s revolution&quot;. Would you please elaborate on this point and explain how it relates to Trump? I would love to be more informed on that area of thought!</p>

<p>I would also again ask you to respond to my original question (altered in an attempt to be more neutral): &quot;Would you agree most people who back Trump would prefer someone else, yet have no other popular choice that opposes the status quo?&quot; I believe Gary Johnson would be an alternative to Trump but he does not have the popularity the Republican party does nor do his stances on ethical issues line up with the majority of fiscal conservatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to hear your explanation of why unregulated capitalism is a bad thing when compared to the current regulated version of capitalism we have! I acknowledge that you may not have the time to fully explain your points, Perhaps a few links to areas of thought you believe reasonable would suffice. </p>

<p>I do not believe I was condoning state-imposed ethnic separatism when I stated ethnic nationalism seems to me to be the only logical way to categorize people. It is perhaps true that people should not be categorized at all! I do not have a solid stance in this area of thought but would love discourse to inform myself! I merely recognize the human condition that is self imposed when personal defense is brought to the forefront. </p>

<p>It is very easy to conceive of a scenario where a borderless society has clashes between groups of people. One example; Village A has become overpopulated due to a religious belief of having as many children as possible, and has spread their hunting territory to feed all of their people. Their encroachment on Village B&#39;s hunting territory threatens to create a situation where neither village is sustainable due to only Village A&#39;s actions. Village A is acting in a humane manner (they are trying to feed their people!) but in doing so killing everyone collectively. Village B recognizes they may be able to self-sustain if they can create borders to prevent the encroachment. </p>

<p>Both Villages come from a point of morale high ground, yet have differing ethnic social and cultural values. Village A adopts ethnic nationalism and only allows those who agree with their self sustaining lifestyle to join them, and only at a rate which would not jeopardize their self sustaining nature. This is a relatively simple example that bring about the question; Is ethnic nationalism&#39;s only opposition that of emotional or morale questioning? Is there a logical reasoning against ethnic nationalism?</p>

<p>I personally do not agree with vague limits to federal power, and oppose nearly all federal power with the exception of national defense (which could be handled without a federal system put in place).</p>

<p>Did I pass the Turing test?</p>

<p>Per the document itself:</p>

<p>“Operationalizing the Strategy</p>

<p>Pied Piper Candidates</p>

<p>There are two ways to approach the strategies mentioned above. The first is to use the field as a whole to inflict damage on itself similar to what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012. The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right. In this scenario, we don’t want to marginalize the candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren’t limited to:</p>

<p>Ted Cruz
Donald Trump
Ben Carson</p>

<p>We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously.”</p>

<p>The operative words, to be sure, being “tell the press to [take] them seriously.” Two paragraphs later the document concludes:</p>

<p>“In this regard,  any information on scandals or ethical lapses   on the GOP candidates would serve well. We won’t be   picky.”</p>

<p>The document consistently assumes the press will be automatically compliant in taking the Democrat-selected Republican candidates “seriously” so as to only then sequentially (as ongoing media behavior is making clear) take “any information on scandals or ethical lapses on the [eventual] GOP candidate”–thus belatedly and therefore determinatively–seriously; all the while simultaneously, diametrically (and therefore hypocritically) avoiding reporting on equivalent or more substantial Clinton scandals, especially those related to “Transparency &amp; disclosure,” “Donors &amp; associations,” “Management &amp; business dealings” (as the document in question itself oppositionally points out). Is it therefore convergence/coincidence/compliance that the MSM is evidently so closely following the “strategy and goals” outlined in the pro-Clinton document in question?</p>

<p>First person said something along lines of &#39; I didn&#39;t think wet works meant a pool party at the vineyard&#39;.  Reply was: &#39;I&#39;m all in, it&#39;ll be a long night, we need to buckle up and double down.&#39;</p>

<p>This was 3 days before Scalia  &#39;mysteriously&#39; died in his sleep at a ranch/resort after a party.</p>

<p>The national enquirer maybe it was ran with there being a prostitute/murder conspiracy.</p>

<p>They are a tabloid, but they&#39;ve broken some decently large stories recently when they were just dismissed as not being real news.</p>

<p>I say &#39;mysteriously&#39; because he was 79 years old, and was not in the best shape.  But there wasn&#39;t anything publicly known about his health and as a member of SCOTUS likely has some of the best healthcare in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen an election like this...and I&#39;ve seen a few. Trump has battled his way past so many roadblocks. He&#39;s beaten his own party candidates and leadership. He now fighting against overwhelming media control against him. He&#39;s up against one of the biggest political families alive today. Reading this speech is just shocking. To see such truths being spoken out loud to so many people. I&#39;d never have believed it possible. No matter the result of the election Trump has already contributed more to waking people up to the control they are under than anyone else I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is being trolled! &quot;Our Independence Day is at hand&quot;...?  GTFO!  Breitbart and Alex Jones wrote this speech, to attract and maintain low education voters that he already has in his column, and you guys are creaming all over yourselves? This sub has devolved to Above Top Secret.  Good Work!</p>

<p>FYI: Trump and Clinton are in this TOGETHER for the Long Con.  He is deliberately torpedoing the Republican Party, and has no intention of winning this election.  This is the &quot;real conspiracy&quot;, but this sub has been overrun by Trumpets trying to scramble up a few more meaningless votes.  The real game here, is to identify all of the &quot;bucket of deplorables&quot; so that when the NWO does kick in, they already know who YOU are.  Makes rounding YOU up for those Walmart FEMA camps, much, much easier.</p>

<p>Clinton will be the next president.  More shit is coming out on Trump, and by the time it is all said and done, there will be a majority in the House and Senate as well.  At the end of all this, the people in this sub that have thrown their support behind Trump, especially because of this speech, will end up looking stupid.  Red Pill my ass...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s where I call bullshit. Not on the message, but on the messenger and leader of the revolution who is also delivering the message... aka Trump the brand. </p>

<p>For the most part, everything he says about corruption, institutions, and machine like smears is correct, or it is based in small distillations of complex ideas, which are true, but 1000x more complex than the simple distillation. </p>

<p>However, the problem comes as Trump has been unable to do any of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run a competent campaign. The fact that he is on his 4th campaign manager, that he routinely shifts positions, and didn&#39;t have ground campaigns in battleground states belies the desire.  </p></li>
<li><p>Prepare on policy. Trumps knowledge is a mile wide an half an inch deep. Even the debate last week on insurance: &quot;We&#39;re going to bring in companies who will compete and offer better rates.&quot; We had that already. It didn&#39;t work. Nothing he said about Canada was close to realistic. Clinton at least isolated one of the three fundamental problems of health care in the US - we are an employer based system.  (the other two issues stemming from quality of life determinations and the big one, patients want Cadillac treatment... insurers want to pay Ford prices... doctors opinions are marginalized.  He could have stood a chance if he actually could go toe to toe on debates outside of &quot;you&#39;re a failure&quot; rhetoric. </p></li>
<li><p>Run on this tenet of us vs them from the beginning. If this is what he believed (and it isn&#39;t a Hail Mary position pivot) then you don&#39;t spend 60% of the campaign scapegoating Mexicans and Muslims. Trump routinely punches down against poor people, working class, black people (who he assumes all live in the ghetto of America, and not in suburbs as well) and foreigners. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This seems like the ramblings of a drunk who swears he&#39;ll get his life together tomorrow. Yeah, I know there is a part of this which is true, maybe it&#39;s the person he wants to be, but Trump is 70. He&#39;s not going to change... we have ample evidence of him not altering or apologizing. If he loses the election, he&#39;s going to open his news network and keep hammering his stump speech. </p>

<p>This is a Ron Paul speech with Trump interjecting himself. Everything is formed in place, there is rational though behind it. I just don&#39;t believe the origins of these thoughts came from Trump, he just feels his campaign in a tailspin and is shifting to the hard realization that he has to pay for the sins of his past like anyone else. Maybe he feels these ideas resonate now when the media is roasting him for his faults, but it&#39;s not like he hasn&#39;t been the cause of the majority of the attacks on him now,  they are, after all, about his character, not his position. </p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;ll reform. The US needs a real counter culture president (like Sanders too). But I doubt it. For 1% of this campaign, we have this speech, representing a morsel of a good idea. On the other we have his twitter feed. We have his white supremacist dog whistles. We have his public feuds with minor people. I&#39;m naturally specious that he&#39;ll eschew the 3am tweets when a senator speaks out, or a policy he pushes doesn&#39;t go through congress (like every president). </p>

<p>Tl;dr I&#39;d love to believe this; nothing Trump has done in past 15 years or duration of his campaign would allow me to believe he has the conviction to stay to it. </p>

<p>EDIT- Fixed mobile formatting.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a career politician. He has never run a political campaign before. This is what an average Joe&#39;s campaign would look like also in terms of disorganization and poor prioritizing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What he said about Canada&#39;s user based system is true, the waiting times are ludicrous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then you don&#39;t spend 60% of the campaign scapegoating Mexicans and Muslims. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything &#39;scapegoating&#39; he said about them was in relation to immigration. Illegal immigrants in particular, not American citizens. So he&#39;s a nationalist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump routinely punches down against poor people, working class, black people</p>

<p>Talking about their problems is now &quot;punching down&quot;? </p>

<p>(who he assumes all live in the ghetto of America, and not in suburbs as well) and foreigners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You call it retarded, but it&#39;s something he&#39;s refined over many years with deep roots in psychology and certainly coached from specialists in the field. I&#39;ve found dozens of video clips from him over the years, and watched them for the explicit purpose of seeing whether his speech patterns were something he always exhibited.</p>

<p>You may call it retarded, but it is made to emphasise complicated points in easy to digest patterns. Combining this style with different kinds of content and different purposefully crafted messages (his message style and content has deliberately morphed 3 or 4 times through out this campaign), he has effectively targeted and won-over key demographics... enough that he has legitimately been seen as a threat by the Dems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is absolutely part of the &quot;1%&quot;.
 Btw the 1% is only 365k or so a year, so when people refer to the 1%, it&#39;s more accurate to say the .1% which is the multimillionaires and billionaires. Sure 380k is a lot of money, but not enough to purchase even modest political favors, well not in the US.</p>

<p>I do concede that your second point may be equal to my argument, except that Trump is already very wealthy and while he is not &quot;powerful in a direct manner&quot; he certainly has the financial means to purchase most of the lobbying interest that he might need. So the question is, why would Trump drag himself and his families name, and potentially his Businesses into politics for a relatively small net gain of holding the title of President?
 There is a good reason that most businessmen yet alone owners of Corporations speak publicly regarding political matter, because they isolate themselves from half the population. Trump could have easily sat back and enjoyed the fruits of his labor, instead because of this he will forever be remembered very poorly by most of the world. This is a man who spent his entire life building up how the world thought about him, just to toss it all away in the end?</p>

<p>Your right about a struggle between 2 powers, however, I believe it&#39;s a struggle between good and evil. Trump loves America and feels obligated to give back to the country that provided him the opportunities to become so successful, which is not something that can be accomplished in most of the world.</p>

<p>I work and consult with very wealth clients, many of whom are immigrants that built their fortunes with hard work. They love our country and are disgusted with how is has transformed in the last 20+ years. One of my clients started off by driving taxis 7 days a week 16 hours per day for 10 years until he saved enough to purchase his own cab company. He later got into real estate and 30 years later, a Hungarian immigrant who came to this country with less than 50$ in his pocket is worth over 300$ million dollars and at one point before 2008 was briefly worth 1.2 Billion dollars. I have spent many nights with this gentleman talking geopolitics and business and he understands exactly why Trump is doing this, because he loves is country. Not all wealthy people are bad or selfish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I thought long and hard about writing back, which might not seem like a lot given that it&#39;s reddit and all, and...who the hell cares. But it&#39;s early on a Sunday, and it&#39;s something you might be interested in. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try to roughly go in order, but this is a complicated issue, so there&#39;s going to be a bit of overlap.</p>

<p>When I say 1%, I certainly do mean it in the way the that 99% protest group of hippies meant it. There is another group of people out there that meet roughly once every couple of years that liked the moniker of 1%. This is a group of individuals who have an abnormally large amount of sway in money, political influence, economics, etc, etc. Couple celebrities, a few politicians, a handful of scientists, investors, and a lot of bankers. It&#39;s a big group. Not all of them meet at the same time at the same place, but they do have ways of talking to each other. There are sub-groups inside this group. Just like a high school, you have nerds, goth kids, etc, but in this case the groups are split on how it&#39;s best to move humanity forward. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you have an end goal, that realistically, you know for a fact the planet is going to do die (economically, natural disaster, what have you) in the next 20 years. In order to save the species, you have to get as many people as you can past point X. Whether that be not reliant of fossil fuels, addicted to a certain drug, willing to die for a cause, or just accepting of alien life, you need to have as many people okay with that before the alarm goes off. How do you do it? </p>

<p>In this hypothetical case, you might have 5 or 6 different groups that all think they have the best method for manipulating people into getting where they need to be. And let&#39;s say that instead of settling on just one idea...each group is allowed to attempt what they think is best, even if it&#39;s in direct competition to another group. Natural competition wont save everybody, but it will narrow down the idea that will work best. </p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, I can tell you that this is not a battle of good and evil. This is literally a choice between two sides of the same coin. The &quot;end result&quot; is going to be the same either way. The only thing we are choosing is how we get there. But even that is a bit of a misnomer, because technically the President was chosen quite a long time ago. It&#39;s her, by the way. I&#39;m not a fan of that concept either, but it is what it is. </p>

<p>I will tell you though, that the feeling you and every die hard Trump fan gets that he genuinely cares about America...you&#39;re not wrong, but you don&#39;t have the full story either. I can tell you on a very small personal level, Trump is very much a guy you want to have a steak and a scotch with. He&#39;s personable, cares about his family more than anything else, and knows he&#39;s lucky as fuck. But...and I don&#39;t mean this in a political way, just truth...he is more than a little racist, sexist, and he doesn&#39;t give a damn about understanding anybody&#39;s point of view besides his own. And realistically...that&#39;s kind of understandable. He&#39;s dealt with some of the worst people on the planet. And then New Yorkers. (I kid, I kid...) Plus he&#39;s getting older. Our brains are wired to seek out comfort and familiarity as we get old. We naturally associate comfort and familiarity with people who look and sound like us. It is an unpopular idea, but it&#39;s 100% natural to get more racist and sexist as you get older. </p>

<p>As for Hillary? You really don&#39;t need any insight to see it. Everybody sees it. She doesn&#39;t like you. She doesn&#39;t like anybody. And this is true. You get her alone in a room, and she will tell you with all honesty that she despises 99% of the people she comes across. And it&#39;s at this point that I am loathe to admit it...but I agree with her. I usually hate 99% of people within a 10 seconds of meeting them too. I&#39;m an asshole. She&#39;s a bitch. A big one. And she&#39;s a little quick with her trigger finger...but she&#39;s certainly not the dumbest person in the room. </p>

<p>&quot;Not all wealthy people are bad or selfish&quot; - I wanna talk about this for a second. What would you do to accomplish your goal if you believed it to be the right thing to do? Right and wrong, good and evil, are all relative to the amount of responsibility and power you control. For instance;
If I ask; is it okay to kill 1 person to save a thousand, the answer is of course, &quot;No.&quot; Because it&#39;s a slippery slope. Why not ten? Why not a hundred? And I can give that answer, because I&#39;m essentially armchair quarterbacking a hypothetical riddle. But...if I&#39;m the leader of some group of country, and a rival group has captured one of my people who was bombing their cities, I can either disavow him and let him die, or declare a war that&#39;ll cost a thousand lives...well, the clear (and right) answer is to let him die. </p>

<p>Both answers to both questions are &quot;correct&quot;, even though they&#39;re literally polar opposites to the exact same question. Both are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right&quot;. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m going to set a hypothetical stage, and ask you a question, okay? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got to get 318 million of the technologically dominant species on this planet to be okay with a laundry list of things in order to meet my goal, in the timeline, of the much larger, multi-generational, plan. My goals are only a small, small step in the much large chain of events it was determined were necessary to the end goal. But I do have some autonomy on how I implement them. How I decide to get the American people ready for;
- Autonomous Cars (leading to autonomous technology) 
- Base Living Wages, because we soon wont have enough jobs. (Which eventually leads to us gradually accepting the loss of the concept of currency) 
- Being okay with a war where we need to kill a faction of people who wont fall in line with their sector leaders plans. </p>

<p>And on, and on, and on. </p>

<p>What would you do to keep your word? To promise the survival of the human race? How would you do it? </p>

<p>And more importantly, how would you keep calm when the only thing anybody wants to talk about is &quot;grabbing her by the pussy&quot;, falling into a car, and bitching about healthcare. </p>

<p>You kinda get that feeling that both of them think everyone they talk to is a fucking moron? Yeah, I would too. </p>

<p>/rambling over</p>

<p>Kindly disregard my crazy bullshit rant. Carry on! I hope [Your candidate here] wins! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic Post, and I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to put it together. Ultimately, it comes down to who you think will best do the job and we make the choice to overlook the rest, often times going into denial to rationalize it. Personally speaking, I choose to think of Trump like Andrew Jackson, most likely a lunatic,probably a guy you&#39;d be afraid to have scotch with, but I&#39;ll be damned if he didn&#39;t do a might fine job with balancing our debt.  </p>

<p>I agree with all of your logic, and confess that I too am an asshole and dislike the vast majority of the people that I meet.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a great head on your shoulders, and one of the few people that I&#39;ve come across on here that I see eye to eye with regarding your rationalization, logic and deductive reasoning&#39;s. </p>

However, it is quite remarkable that we do have a major party candidate who is willing to say these things publicly.

<p>Read or listen to his speech.  He specifically names at least 3, and more broadly speaks of political corruption, media control, global power cetralization, etc. etc. etc.  This entire speech is literally about conspiracies.  If you can&#39;t see that, and still can&#39;t figure out why this is in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just Trump, they did it for Bernie as well. People are brainwashed to love authority at the deepest level. They think it&#39;s their answer to everything. Someone else will make people treat me the way I want to be treated! If I don&#39;t make enough money they&#39;ll force the minimum wage up! If I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re saying the cops will arrest you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most important message coming from this speech is that people change. Trump clearly states and admits to &quot;being part of the club&quot;. This is important because no presidential candidate is ever willing to admit to there being special interest clubs and secret agendas. We all know they are there but its nice to finally see someone who is not afraid to just say it. Trump changed and left these &quot;clubs&quot; when he realized the country needed someone to open the doors of government and let the people back in. Of course its good for him but its also good for the country. </p>

<p>He cares about his businesses and thats what keeps this country prosperous. We need someone who cares about businesses and opportunities and the economy. Thats how things progress and grow. For far too long the American people have not been doing what the constitution intended. Government runs the people instead of the people running the government. Trumps intentions are to change that. I can only hope his goals and ideas are sincere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he&#39;s controlled opposition as the leaks tend to indicate, he has the same handlers as Hillary Clinton, and the same ultimate dangers will still look over us.  As others have said, these are old tricks.  Was it not Rothschild who manipulated stocks and played both sides during the war to make himself and his heirs wealthy and powerful?  Everyone has people they love.  Everyone has a weakness. And thus everyone can be made to submit if sufficiently pressed.  Just look at Clinton&#39;s meeting with the attorney general as his wife was being investigated for what amounts to a series of definite crimes and likely treason.  Oh, all they talked about was grandkids!  That&#39;s all!  As in, if you want your grandkids to live to see adulthood, then you play ball.  Same with Bernie.  Same with anyone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to think that some figurehead is going to save us, that there is one of them who really is on our side against the other evil candidate, but that too is an old divide and conquer trick.  If any change is going to come it will have to be from brave individuals putting aside their superficial differences and coming together against our common enemy.  Trump and Clinton are two sides of the same bloody coin.</p>

<p>Presidents don&#39;t decide shit.  They are the public face of what the unnamed, unelected people behind the scenes have decided for us all.  Snowden proved this to us.  Most Americans don&#39;t even know what sort of policies are being enacted behind closed doors.  Most of our Congress doesn&#39;t even know.  This election is not about one evil over the other.  This election is about the revelation that we don&#39;t have a choice at all.  Our country is run by criminals and thieves, people who live by the only true law that exists: do whatever you want as long as you have the power to get away with it.  They only care about your voice if placating you will make them more money or make them have to spend less resources fighting their own populace rather than their enemies abroad.</p>

<p>But Trump won&#39;t do this, however, right?  <em>Right??</em></p>

<p>Riiiight.  Because he&#39;s not a corporate multi billionaire, right?  Oh wait a minute...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit - what he was saying in this OP sounds good...but you&#39;re a damned fool if you think that Trump is the answer to this country&#39;s problems.  It&#39;s correct that Clinton is by <em>far</em> not the answer either, but people are going down the wrong road as well if they go toward Trump.</p>

<p>So? That sort of opportunistic infighting has been going on for a while, from Barry Goldwater to Ted Cruz. That doesn&#39;t make Trump any less of a Republican. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What more does he need to do to go against them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno -- quit supporting the GOP&#39;s talking points?</p>

<p>Trump is obviously a rogue element, but he has dedicated himself to campaigning on Republican, and conservative, issues, to win over the base. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What part of it is trickle down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part where he slashes the taxes for the top income brackets -- the 1%. The TPC provides analysis on this topic: </p>

<p>&quot;... the highest-income taxpayers (0.1 percent of the population, or those with incomes over $3.7 million in 2016dollars) would experience an average tax cut of nearly $1.1million, over 14 percent of after-tax income.</p>

<p>&quot;The revised Trump plan would reduce the top individual income tax rate to 33 percent, reduce the corporate rate to 15 percent, and allow owners of pass-through businesses (such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations) to elect to be taxed at a flat rate of 15 percent rather than under the regular individual income tax rates.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t change the fact that most of the tax relief goes to the top .1% Reagan&#39;s trickle-down economics also involved cuts across the board, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that it also reduces the top bracket is what the media keeps using to attack him.</p>

<p>Paul Ryan&#39;s trickle-down scheme was also criticized in the 2012 elections, so it isn&#39;t just about Trump. The world doesn&#39;t revolve around the dude.</p>

<p>Ever since Bush senior labeled Reagan&#39;s tax scheme &quot;voodoo economics&quot; in 1980, people have been critical of supply-side economics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go look up what it&#39;s doing for the low class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have. Have you?</p>

<p>The link I provided in my previous post concluded that &quot;the poorest fifth of households would see their taxes go down an average of $110, or 0.8 percent of their after-tax income.&quot; That&#39;s less than the average tax cut that lower-income people received under Obama (which you&#39;ll never hear right-wingers admit).</p>

<p>$110 ain&#39;t jack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of lowering tax from 33 to 15 is to keep business from moving overseas and keeping owners from throwing everything in off shore accounts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of companies already pay 15% or less in taxes, some of them even pay zero after subsidies, but that still doesn&#39;t stop them from taking their money to the Cayman islands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is alarming. Most because it likely isn&#39;t genuine.</p>

<p>Trump has flirted with a POTUS run a few times before. So his posturing to be perceived as our last chance to save the government isn&#39;t something I&#39;m buying. This is something he&#39;s wanted and finally pulled the trigger on it.</p>

<p>He&#39;s talking about getting attacked and all the negativity surrounded him. How quickly he forgets that he helped smeared Ted Cruz, and insulted most of his competition without much provocation.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that we all knew that Trump and Bernie were beating the anti-establishment drum, but were vastly different. A Bernie vs Trump election would leave Trump dead in the water. He&#39;d have no anti-establishment message. This speech wouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid some of you are doing the exact thing that you accuse Clinton supporters of doing. Which is choosing their perceived lesser of two evils after they&#39;ve been fear-mongered into obedience.</p>

He&#39;s a fucking con man that&#39;s at least as much of a pathological liar as Clinton. He doesn&#39;t say what he means or what he believes. He&#39;s saying what he knows will captivate people. It&#39;s a method of control that we&#39;ve fallen for time and time again with standard politicians. I&#39;m not voting for Clinton and I&#39;m definitely not voting for Trump. The ugly truth of this election is that regardless of who wins, we will all lose. If anything, I&#39;m rooting for Trump to take Clinton down a few pegs through this last month before she gets elected so that she&#39;s not at peak hubris when she&#39;s sworn in. Fuck this country.</p>

<p>If he beefs up this point -- this common thread between Trump supporters and Sanders supporters -- he wins the election for sure. Instead, he takes beatings on his being unqualified at every turn. All he has to demonstrate is that he&#39;ll hire advisors that aren&#39;t corrupt industry insiders, that he won&#39;t make unilateral decisions that have no support in the electorate, and suddenly he isn&#39;t so scary anymore. Instead he wants to run his mouth and propose whatever widely unpopular platform comes off the top of his head just to sound like he knows what he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Say what you will about Hillary&#39;s overly focus grouped platforms.  She garners support because she targets the positions people support (give or take a misguided policy that ensures funding).  Her only problem is that people realize she has her public positions and private positions.  Donald can easily sidestep this concern, but instead he allows everyone to gather that he doesn&#39;t have any idea what his positions are.  And that wouldn&#39;t be a disadvantage if he can make people feel like his inability to draft comprehensive platforms reflects a populist approach.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s your plan for Syria?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;[rambling, incoherent, noncommittal guesses, full of whatever buzz words he can remember hearing from his campaign&#39;s advisors]&quot;</p>

<p>Not going to play.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s your plan for Syria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The American people are tired of intervening in foreign conflicts.  They realize we can&#39;t afford it.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a priority for me.  If our generals have a good plan, one that has clear benefits to all of us and not just their budget, one that actually has a chance of defeating ISIS, the American people will support that plan, that&#39;s when I&#39;ll decide that it&#39;s the right course of action.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are the speeches the media machine has purposely put off to the side to show his gaffs, when I read stuff like this it brings me away from Gary and back to Trump.</p>

<p>I am truly torn, is Trump really the bastion of hope we need to completely wreck the oligarchy machine at hand? Or if I vote for Johnson, since he is a politician, will he simply be bought by the machine and become complacent with legalization of Pot and the current cycle continues. </p>

<p>My only reason for voting for Gary is that he is adamantly against the drug war, and I am too, I feel is has destroyed us as a nation. But I also wholeheartedly believe so has the current corrupt machine and we need a someone who is already rich and can&#39;t be bought off, a bit of a lunatic unafraid to say what needs to be said, and really good at business management.</p>

<p>Lol and Obama used to be anti-war. I&#39;m voting Trump for one reason and one reason only. The entire establishment, Republicans and Democrats seem to view him as an enemy. </p>

<p>This gives me hope that he&#39;s not a puppet and is potentially a threat to the establishment agenda. </p>

<p>This is the first time in decades Americans have a chance to vote in someone who isn&#39;t a career politician. Not only that but a runner that didn&#39;t require tons of outside funding</p>

<p>While rhetorically it is a nice speech, it comes from the mouth of a billionaire. Until I see any sort of coherent and honest action to go along with such rhetoric, it is all soothing lies. You all should know that. Go listen to some of Hitler&#39;s speeches. He inspired people too.

What he&#39;s saying is sometimes true however his reasons for saying it is disingenuous. Trump does not give a shit about me or you or anybody whose name isn&#39;t trump.

<p>The content isn&#39;t his personal beliefs, it&#39;s his campaign responding to how the public are feeling.

    <div class="md"><p>My question, and I mean this seriously, is why do you find Trump to be more trustworthy than other members of the global elite?</p>

<p>I mean, this whole business about him being &quot;an outsider&quot; is kinda bullshit, right? He runs with all those circles, he even has said before that he&#39;s friends with all the same people as the Clintons.</p>

<p>So why put your trust in him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ... nowhere did i say I &quot;trust&quot; Trump.</p>

<p>I said &quot;I support this 100%&quot;  </p>

<p>And what do I support?  It&#39;s simple.  The message he presented in that section of his speech.  It was powerful.  And I believe it to be true based on my research.  I&#39;m sure many others here have come to the same conclusion.  </p>

<p>Trump could be a scoundrel, hateful piece of shit, and he could have been, or still be running with the &quot;wrong circles.&quot; There are many indications for the former ... some slight indicators of the latter.   But regardless, none of this changes anything about that particular message to me.  It&#39;s just words/ideas after all.  Sometimes people with flaws (and many flaws at that) can say powerful, great things, no?  Sometimes we have to analyze the words/ideas rather than come to a conclusion based on the person who spoke them.  For instance, (extreme example follows...) Hitler wrote plenty of interesting things about society and the world.  Just because he is a scoundrel (according to mainstream history, I might add) doesn&#39;t mean those interesting things should be invalidated.  They should be taken piecemeal and evaluated &amp; probed for their value.</p>

<p>As for running with the wrong circles and him being a false hope.  I hope he&#39;s not that.  I can&#39;t say for sure.  I&#39;m not going to pretend I know which way it goes.  But what I will say is that this speech <em>increased</em> the percentage chance (in my analysis) that he&#39;s truly on our side.  (See this post for more information about what I&#39;m getting at: The chains of yes or no belief - <a href="http://cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;amp;t=1926">http://cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;amp;t=1926</a>)</p>

<p>P.S I might have went on too long explaining myself.  You might have understood it after the first sentence.</p>

You sheeple are just as susceptible to cult of personality as anyone. Trump is a douchebag. A douchebag reading a good speech is still a douchebag. Actions speak louder than words.</p>

<p>If you actively support Donald Trump, you&#39;re for just as bad, possibly worse, self serving corruption. You are for Donald and Donald&#39;s friends getting every advantage they can get while you just get lip service. I&#39;m no fan of Hillary, but at least she acknowledges that she&#39;s on notice when it comes to her party&#39;s revolt. I still hope she&#39;s prosecuted, but I definitely hope she beats Donald, if this shit show is what we&#39;re working with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the man, but Americans need to hear those words until they get angry enough to take action (not violent action, but action in demanding REPRESENTATION for those that tax us). Trump is only out for himself and his legacy, but we have a historical opportunity to get this message out.</p>

<p>The American Revolution occurred because people rose up against the concept taxation without representation.</p>

<p>Like so many times throughout history throughout so many countries/empires, our country is headed for the collision between the rulers and the common people. The rulers will become more and more ruthless to maintain their power. Other rulers will capitalize on this to dethrone the current power structure. We will have a world war unless we can defuse this and come out with a clear plan for a new way of governance in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Over a period of time (roughly 100 years) a world power emerges from a global war only to experience a gradual decay in its position of preponderance,” writes Thompson. “Global order decays at a parallel rate until a new global war occurs and facilitates the emergence of a new world power.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To everyone thinking this is Trump&#39;s &quot;JFK Speech&quot; and that his assassination is imminent - Do you really think that?  This speech, while eloquent and thoughtful, is hardly something containing prohibited speech in the eyes of those who would assassinate such a man.  He didn&#39;t start naming names or reveal any new information.  </p>

<p>The media and political establishment seem perfectly happy enough to assassinate his character and leave him alone otherwise.  Honestly I imagine that is their preferred course; it&#39;s cleaner than a killing.    The man has a long history as a cultural / reality star;  it
s not hard to turn him into a tabloid drama queen.  </p>

<p>More likely is that he is one of them and is playing a role, either via his campaign and the message he&#39;s spreading, or he&#39;ll become president and has a key part in the next scenario. </p>

<p>If the system isn&#39;t rigged, why would you vote for someone whose beliefs are wrong?</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills here. Trump talks about how there&#39;s this vast conspiracy working against him, a corrupt cartel that will stop at <em>nothing</em> to prevent him from getting elected, and that this conspiracy has the full weight of the government and special interests behind it ... but also that Trump is going to win, 100%, he&#39;s going to win and he&#39;s going to get rid of this evil conspiracy easily and that everything is going to be great and all you have to do is vote for him. I know I can&#39;t be the only one who sees this contradiction. In a rigged system, voting doesn&#39;t matter. The fact that Trump is telling you it&#39;s a rigged system <em>and</em> that you need to vote for him should tell you something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hannibal became a legend in his own lifetime and, years after his death, Roman mothers would continue to frighten their unwilling children to bed with the phrase &quot;Hannibal ad Porto&quot; (Hannibal is at the door). His campaign across the Alps, unthinkable even in his day, won him the grudging admiration of his enemies and enduring fame ever since. Hannibal&#39;s strategies, learned so well by Scipio, were incorporated into Roman tactics and Rome would consistently use them to good effect following the Battle of Zama. After the deaths of Hannibal and Scipio, Carthage continued to cause problems for Rome which eventually resulted in the Third Punic War (149-146 BCE) in which Carthage was destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I hate Trump, he makes a few good points. If the GOP could have came up with someone even 10% qualified I would vote for them over Clinton (reallllllly don&#39;t like her), but unfortunately the GOP left me to choose between Clinton and Trump- this is no contest, Clinton wins each time. </p>

<p>If one objectively steps back and looks at their policies and HOW they will enact these policies, then one can see that Clinton wins where it matters (climate change, social rights such as abortion and LGBT rights, less tax cuts for the very wealthy {thnx Bernie})</p>

<p>Trump very rarely explains HOW he will do anything, and I can&#39;t believe so many people gloss over that. In either debate when asked about policy (let&#39;s ignore the loaded questions against him, I know, it&#39;s fucked. But focus on his answers regarding policy for a moment) he cannot expand on his policy. It seems that Trump doesn&#39;t know very much about what he plans to do, and he always ends up simply rambling on without making any clear points.</p>

<p>Clinton is an awful candidate and has a shit-load of baggage, but Trump is objectively worse for America. He will bring economic ruin and take our social policies back 10+ years. </p>

<p>satanism is probably on a whole different level. who knows. but the witches dont know that they worship satan too?</p>

<p>they think they are guided by familiar spirits? which in truth turns out to be demons? weird shit.</p>

<p>while the real satanists are sacrificing their first born and rape their own daughters? witches are not very rich, but satanists are very wealthy.</p>

<p>witches think they are powerful, while all they do is cast spells. the spells are programmed to enslave the lower demons doing specific tasks.</p>

<p>witches are stupid, weak and delusional. LMAO.</p>

<p>PS: the term witch is gender neutral. it can refer to both, male and female.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been paying attention knows Hillary controls the voting machines. It&#39;s not possible to win while these are rigged. See the Election Justice report that proves the fraud.</p>

<p>Trump knows this. Yet Trump, suggests we can vote our way out of this, by voting for him. He even suggests &quot;poll watchers&quot; while fully knowing the fraud doesn&#39;t come from shady dealings at the polls, but in the source code of the machines linked to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump knows he&#39;s loosing.  His floor of support is the 35% of Rubublicans who voted for him in the Republican primaries, and he hasn&#39;t done much to reach out to the rest of the population.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the media barrage has wounded him, and the amateur hour quality of his advisors have been unable to articulate an effective response.  &quot;Bill Clinton did worse&quot; is not an effective response. </p>

<p>His speech not going to change anyone&#39;s minds, nor is it intended to.  Trump is preparing the ground for whatever his next move is, most likely a Trump TV network with Bannon, Ailes, and Pence (who also has a background in broadcasting).  Such a TV network would be directly competing with FOX for viewers, so expect them to turn against Trump as well.</p>

Seriously people, any regular candidate could have been a puppet to prop up Hillary, like perhaps the radical left Socialist Bernie to make her look more rational. Why would nearly the entire world be at Trumps throat if he was a shill. And since when has the establishment ever exhausted so many resources on a single candidate, when such a clear bias?
For fu*ks sake, the governments official story after 2 planes vaporized 3 buildings and destroyed the black box&#39;s was that one of the terrorist passports miraculously emerged unscathed. The 911 story is full of so many holes it&#39;s pathetic, yet it was sufficient to fool the masses, so why expend so many resources to make Trump look bad unless he is a legitimate threat??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all what I said.  I&#39;m pointing out that people will vote for the candidate that they feel will represent their vote.</p>

<p>Say what you will about Hillary&#39;s overly focus grouped platforms.  She garners support because she targets the positions people support (give or take a misguided policy that ensures funding).  Her only problem is that people realize she has her public positions and private positions.  Donald can easily sidestep this concern, but instead he allows everyone to gather that he doesn&#39;t have any idea what his positions are.  And that wouldn&#39;t be a disadvantage if he can make people feel like his inability to draft comprehensive platforms reflects a populist approach.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s your plan for Syria?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;[rambling, incoherent, noncommittal guesses, full of whatever buzz words he can remember hearing from his campaign&#39;s advisors]&quot;</p>

<p>Not going to play.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s your plan for Syria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The American people are tired of intervening in foreign conflicts.  They realize we can&#39;t afford it.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a priority for me.  If our generals have a good plan, one that has clear benefits to all of us and not just their budget, one that actually has a chance of defeating ISIS, the American people will support that plan, that&#39;s when I&#39;ll decide that it&#39;s the right course of action.&quot;</p>

<p>People love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Newt. The powers <em>behind</em> Newt.</p>

<p>Like when Reagan ran. He was asked if he&#39;d ever consider any of his primary rivals for his vice-president. He said, he&#39;d consider any one of them--except George Bush. Reagan (a nationalist) had a deep and abiding distrust of Bush (a globalist). Remember: It was Bush who coined the term, &quot;New World Order&quot; and Bush who pushed NAFTA [even before Clinton did]. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU</a> Reagan was from the Goldwater/liberatrian branch of the Party, whereas Bush was from the crony-capitalist Rockefeller wing.</p>

<p>I watched a political insider on C-Span years ago talk about how he saw Reagan pulled aside by Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller took Reagan to a back room and showed him what his media coverage would look like if he didn&#39;t choose Bush. Then he showed him what it would look like if he did.</p>

<p>Reagan folded and put Bush on the ticket. Mere months into his first term, an assassination attempt nearly installed Bush in the White House. (Reagan was supposed to be his Trojan Horse.) Bush was never charismatic enough to make it in on his own. They needed someone with personality to win--and then be taken out to install Bush.</p>

<p>Reagan did something brilliant, though. When he survived and was rushed to the hospital, he disbanded his secret service detail and demanded that the Navy come and protect him. As Commander-in-Chief, he trusted the navy more than the secret service. And he survived.</p>

<p>Had he allowed his secret service detail to &quot;look after him,&quot; he would have gone the way of Justice Scalia.</p>

<p>At any rate, the media has long hidden and suppressed the connection between John Hinckley, Jr. [Reagan&#39;s would-be assassin] and George Bush. Hinckley was from Texas [where Bush was from]. Hinckley was the son of Bush&#39;s businesses partner (through oil company Vanderbilt Enery), John Hinkley, Sr. In addition, John Hinckley, Sr. was a huge contributor to Bush&#39;s presidential run.</p>

<p>The two families were incredibly close. See newspaper article from the time, entitled &quot;Bush&#39;s Son Was To Dine With Shooting Suspect&#39;s Brother&quot;: <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-5.jpg">http://whowhatwhy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-5.jpg</a></p>

<p>What a coincidence that, of all 300 million Americans, the guy who tried to take our Reagan had such close ties to Bush. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1965234-the-hinckley-bush-reagan-connection">http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1965234-the-hinckley-bush-reagan-connection</a></p>

<p>At any rate, a lot of parallels have been drawn between Trump and Reagan. The neocons wanted to replicate the Reagan-Bush dynamic by sticking the &quot;Globalist&#39;s Choice,&quot; NAFTA Newt on Trump&#39;s ticket. Had that been allowed to happen, it doesn&#39;t require much imagination to see what would have likely happened next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. And we&#39;re at a crossroads where the ideas and policies of both major parties are inferior. Trump is some amalgam of the two, calling himself a Republican, but he&#39;s really just a mishmash of bad ideas from both parties. Authoritarian. Which would be the perfect name if we joined the two together.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s where the philosophy of might makes right has taken us. It&#39;s one thing to recognize that it&#39;s true, and it&#39;s another to embrace it. When any organization or unit or tribe is right all the time for too long, it becomes too big to fail, is broken, or collapses under its own weight. The country than can survive is the one that ages gracefully, sits out of the ring, and uses wisdom rather than brute force.</p>

Nothing about their representation is thorough.  It is practically a brainwashing cult over there.  It&#39;s the same way cult leaders brainwash people into following them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake what...? Up until Obama&#39;s election he was buddies with the Clintons... Hillary didn&#39;t run in 2012 and now that he&#39;s suddenly a Republican as of 2008, he&#39;s running against the lady who was runner up in 2008. After reading this monologue I have a lot more faith that he&#39;s legit but I definitely wouldn&#39;t put ot past the Clintons to conspire with their own best bud up in Wall Street. </p>
