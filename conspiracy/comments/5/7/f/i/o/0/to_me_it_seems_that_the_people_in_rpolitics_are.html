       The DNC could have easily won this election if they ran with Sanders but they desperately wanted a "status quo" candidate and conspired to get their golden gal on the ticket. I think the DNC leadership genuinely felt that they were doing the right thing, every step of the way. Every time they cheated Sanders or helped Clinton cheat when going up against Trump, they felt that the ends would justify the means. It looks like in an effort to preform a greater good and avoid upsetting the economic climate of this country too much, that the DNC became completely corrupted. Now they appeared to caught red handed and are in a state of perpetual damage control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Clinton wins, these problems will not go away for the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt any of us will stop digging through those emails regardless of who wins.

       C'mon man, don't act like a Hilltard. One can disagree with Trump and Clinton. YOU may think voting third party is throwing your vote away but to some of us it isn't about getting a third party candidate in the Oval Office. Instead it's about getting those parties above the 5% threshold in order to be eligible for federal general election funds in future elections.

       In Politics, like in Religions, you need fanatics in the lower levels to facilitate the dirty work. Both GOP and DNC should be studied and criticized for promoting fanaticism towards their side. Both are extremely corrupt. And maybe they both have always been. So, even if they thought the means would justify the end, they did not count on our new sources for more realistic and real timed information.

       My biggest fear the the moment is that our free and easy access to information will be lost completely within a few years. The powers that be can see the danger that it poses to their stranglehold on our society and they will work to get rid of it or at least move everything into a very well maintained and walled off garden.

       They made a huge mistake by sabotaging Sanders. He would have won easily, and there's no serious baggage or skeletons in cupboards about him. I see this election from a foreigner perspective, and while I don't like much about HRC at least she's an experienced pair of hands who will listen to her advisers. Trump is an unstable lunatic and the thought of him having control of the US nuclear launch codes - and ours in Britain - fills me with utter dread.

       It's such an obvious lie that people are waking up and they're having to try even harder making it even more obvious.

       We all know exactly what we will get with Hillary. And Jill Stein or any other 3rd party has zero chance of winning. So the remaining option is Trump, who may or may Not be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally nothing to lose by voting for Trump. If it's rigged, then Hillary will win regardless. If Trump is phony and no different than Obama or Hillary, and he wins, then we are no worse off than Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if Trump wins and his is genuine then we could have a net gain. Watch and keep an open mind

       Believe me, I have Serious doubts about Him. And even bigger suspicions, but if you do the math and keep an open mind then you might realize voting for Trump isn't incurring any additional risk and is the only option with the potential for a gain.

       Not true.

       Even if there will be no material difference in what happens after the election, there is a reason not to vote for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's openly, loudly selling fascism, authoritarianism, willful ignorance, proud anti intellectualism, warmongering, and ... I'm getting tired, you can easily grow the list yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that every vote he gets tells all the other people like him that they are OK, they're justified.  That's very bad.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.

      <p>
       She is also bad, but at least she's trying to hide it.  She's a fascist, but she's not singing about it.

        I won't be voting for her either.
