       Content and activity you provide to the hatereddit harms this community due to Reddit's algorithms and breaks our rules.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for

       What the fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actually mods who ban you from their sub because you happen to be subscribed to another subreddit they don't like? A sub that's totally unrelated? The sub for one of our presidential candidates?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the most ridiculous bullshit I've ever heard of! (not your post, them banning you.)
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they even know? Did you just happen to mention
       <a href="/r/the_Donald">
        /r/the_Donald
       </a>
       or did they find out from going through your comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: nevermind, I somehow missed the part where it said "automatically banned."

       Yeah, I may have posted a comment to
       <a href="/r/offmychest">
        /r/offmychest
       </a>
       once and may have subscribed - not sure. So, that act alone put me on their watch list. They started to monitor my future behavior and as soon as I posted a couple of things at
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , they auto-banned me. It was not my subscription but my posting to it. I do not think I explicitly subscribed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creepy shit. They have all of my post history and they have been deciding what to do with me based on my post all this time.

       First it is getting auto-banned. Next thing would be ... an automatic drone strike?

       It's total fucking bullshit that they're referring to the_donald as a "hatereddit" like it's a sub for the KKK or Nazis. There's plenty of dicks there but there's also plenty of dicks in the Hillary subs and Politics. Do they automatically ban everyone subscribed to those subs as well? I fucking doubt it.

       The fact you weren't even a big supporter of Trump before they banned you is even more hilarious and ironic. By automatically assuming anyone subscribed there is a racist asshole, they swayed a possible undecided voter to the person they're trying to beat.

       Reddit is designed for Democrats, liberals, progressives, people of "color", atheists, sexual deviants. It is not designed for the use of white Christians, or anyone of any race who perceives the value in traditional Western culture. Understand this clearly -- Reddit is not for you if you are white. It is not for you if you are a man, especially a white man. It is not for you if you are a Christian, or even if you believe in God. It is not for you if you value the family and children. Basically, Reddit is not designed for you if you are a decent, caring human being. It is designed for flakes, freaks, and leftist fanatics.

       It can be pretty shitty to be a woman on Reddit sometimes too, but just for being a woman. Everytime I mention I'm a woman, where it's relevant information for the post or discussion, there's always a pretty good chance I'll have at least one douchebag mock me for mentioning my gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always pretty horrible in comment sections of posts about women not going to jail, women getting children in custody battles, divorce in general, or false rape accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it might sound stupid, but sometimes I'll read hundreds of really awful comments about how absolutely evil we are, how you shouldn't get married because your wife will want/probably get all your money when she inevitably cheats on you and how you should always get a paternity test done even if you're in a loving, happy family because chances are your wife is a lying slut, etc. And it'll legitimately make me worried that a lot of guys think like this now, which makes me even more worried because I'm single. I don't want to be alone forever, but I'd be absolutely crushed if my partner thought the same things dudes on Reddit do.
      </p>

       Can definitely be
       <em>

       Yeah, it definitely does seem that way sometimes, but then I remember that I'm a woman and don't consider myself a SJW.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually really weird to me. My entire life, I've always been on what most people would consider the "far left." And I definitely still am, especially considering what passes as "left" nowadays. But it's strange to me how these people can consider themselves liberal or social justice anything while at the same time, being authoritarian dickheads.
      </p>
      <p>
       No clue how they think they're helping anything at all by using censorship instead of well reasoned arguments or discussions.

       At least the post hasn't been removed. Although, the only reason it's probably still up is because the mods from there have most likely seen this post by now.

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3pme4i/a_list_of_sjwcompromised_subreddits_and_viable/">
        Did you read this post?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From my knowledge the SJWs, intelligence shills and HRC had got their hands on that board so hard that it should be avoided at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest you avoid
       <a href="/r/depression">
        /r/depression
       </a>
       as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never went to these boards but if you are scared of SJWs you can go to
       <a href="/r/rant">
        /r/rant
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/trueoffmychest">
        /r/trueoffmychest
       </a>
       , but my fear is those are being compromised as well, cannot be sure whatsoever considering one of the front posts in
       <a href="/r/rant">
        /r/rant
       </a>
       tells you to vaccinate your children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just beware anyway if you are going to depression boards because the SJWs and intelligence shills love to use these boards to manipulate public opinion.
