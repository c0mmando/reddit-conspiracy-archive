       That first anon 5 thread you linked to seems like disinformation laced in.
      </p>
      <p>
       S/he was talking about "linked to cells", but it's more likely a black ops false flag.
       <a href="http://www.anonews.co/cia-agent-terror">
        Every Terrorist Attack In US Was A False Flag Attack, perpetrated by the CIA or the military industrial complex
       </a>
       . Unless s/he is saying cells are created and maintained by rogue CIA or FBI groups for example. If so, this should be clearly noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he claims the towers and building 9 was "thermitted", but given the massive caverns below as well as intense ground heat for days afterwards, all signs point to mini nukes, as exhaustively detailed by

       Vintage /pol/, and as interesting as usual.  Makes me think I should start hanging out there again; although the neo-Nazis and the idiots from Sydney were offputting.

       It's good to see that despite the OWS hijacking and various other forms of bullshit, Anonymous are still occasionally managing to deliver.

       A quick tip I've learned about 4chan;
       <em>
        A lot
       </em>
       of the shit said there is ironic. People love pushing buttons and since they're anonymous, they use every tool they can to stir shit up and rustle some jimmies. That said, there is legitimate conversation to be had there and many users are reasonable, sane humans. Just be cautious of bait.

       If you don't know what /pol/ is, then it is probably better for you that way; but I will tell you.  It is a specific imageboard on the website
       <a href="http://www.4chan.org/">
        http://www.4chan.org/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably know about the two political divisions, that we refer to as the Left and Right.  Reddit is primarily urban Leftist; which usually means Socialism.  It is, however, important to understand that as far as subreddits like
       <a href="/r/Socialism">
        /r/Socialism
       </a>
       are concerned, Socialism is only really a politically correct or more palateable term for raw Marxist Communism.  Socialism is more subtle and insidious, and contains much more of a cultural emphasis than pure Communism, but the ultimate goal is largely the same.  Pure Communism also doesn't care as much about things like feminism as Socialism does, although the real point with Communism is simply to get as many different people from as many different groups on your side as possible, and if feminism is one of those groups, then so much the better.  This is the entire reason why Socialism has become so much about minority activism, as well; they claim to care about equality, but that is mostly a lie.  What they are more truthfully concerned about, is simply getting as many warm bodies into the army as possible, and then using that numerical superiority to overwhelm their opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, /pol/ went in the other direction.  It is one of the Internet's main strongholds of the hard Right, that I am aware of; although unfortunately that does not

       mean conservatism in the Jeffersonian or Libertarian sense of the word.  In /pol/'s case, it means male chauvanism, white supremacy, and intense, undisguised fascism.  Just as feminism is also an adjunct of Reddit's Socialist tendency, the Red Pill ideology and mens' rights advocacy tends to also be the equivalent where /pol/ is concerned as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent probably three years browsing /pol/, and it changed me.  Before that I was a political centrist, but I agreed with the goals of the earliest generations of feminists.  Being in /pol/, however, (as well as six years of exposure to toxic, radical Marxist Millennials here on Reddit) opened my eyes to just how dangerous Socialism, globalism, and collectivism in general really are.  While I still consider fascism an obscene political ideology that is ultimately incapable of producing anything other than vast loss of life, in emotional terms I am now much closer to the Right than I used to be.  While I also do not condone the moral right of
       <strong>
        <em>
         any
        </em>
       </strong>
       single human group to determine the destiny of the entire species, (and conscientious objection to Jewish supremacy was actually one of the major reasons for my departure from Christianity) I have also recognised the fact that, as a white man, it makes no logical sense for me to ally myself with groups or ideologies who not only want me oppressed, but entirely destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also do not define myself as progressive.  I do not accept as valid the single linear theory of human evolution, and my emotional attitude towards the twenty first century (especially where smartphones, social media, and the Millennial generation are concerned) at this point is largely one of rejection and repudiation.  I have also become much more of a student of antiquity and ancient civilisations, (although archaeology has been an interest of mine since childhood) and have developed an overall belief that the past is usually preferable to the present or future in general terms; which I am aware is a prototypically fascist attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must also be said that when it comes to historical and political analysis, in my experience the Right are usually better at it.  This is overwhelmingly because conservatives are a lot more likely to engage in real critical thinking.  The Right think, and the Left feel; and more, the Right are far more likely to retain the Aristotelian willingness to at least
       <strong>
        <em>
         examine
        </em>
       </strong>
       ideas which they are opposed to and logically refute them, whereas the Marxist response to dissent or unacceptable ideas, is generally to simply censor or otherwise try to destroy them.  It is a tremendously sad irony that I consistently experience much more genuine reverence for the concept of freedom of expression among self-identified fascists, than I ever have here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, if you have not been to /pol/ yourself, I strongly recommend keeping it that way, and that is true for 4chan in general.  I still consider both Nazism and white supremacy to be two of the most potently evil and psycho-spiritually harmful ideologies in existence, and prolonged exposure to them does not have a positive effect on the human mind.

       Right about reverse osmosis, expensive though. In a shtf scenario good to have portable, city may not have running water. They have all kinds of diff ones, life straw, survival straw etc. If you look on Amazon read the reviews, and if you can afford, get one to help someone else/barter etc.

       It's incredibly unwise to act right now IMO. The informed public (I baselessly assume &gt;60% are not part of the informed public) have no clear goals. Releasing all of the information right now might cause untold chaos. I don't want another leader. I want people to lead themselves. It's a complicated situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, for the most part, don't participate in the consumerism that plays a large part in the current status quo. It's all about money and power right? Don't buy what you don't need. Support the one's who care more about their craft and customers than they do about profit, like fine, small batch whiskey makers and bean to bar fair trade chocolate makers. Quality over quantity. Mass production doesn't have a strong correlation with quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are right. The first step is to wake up the people. Maybe it'd be easier to have a small part of the population go ahead and fight the aliens (I use the term for legal reasons) so that an environment and society more conducive to self-awareness can form.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit 1: I mention the quality over quantity because it's a mindset dangerous to many industry practices, and something the individual can do even within the system. It might not do much, but it's something for now.

       What I get from it: The FBI agents on humanity's side fear for their own lives and don't believe that they can affect substantial and beneficial change with what information they do have and what they can do with it. It's a complicated situation. They want to help, but they don't know how. It's not easy for them.

       If any of that is true it needs to get on the mainstream somehow.   Someone needs to stoop to HRCs level, hack that guy, find his identity and blackmail him into to going public

       Why would you believe anything a bunch of anonymous keyboard kids say? There's a whole lot in those posts that nearly anyone could have thrown in based on the recent Wikileaks.

       Sorry for the late reply, busy life. It's not about believing or not believing, it's about exposure to new perspectives, no matter how far-fetched or unbelievable. Keep all the perspectives you've encountered in the back of your mind as you take in information. Some perspectives will line up more than others. I think it's difficult to have to much certainty in cases such as this however, due to the information war / lies / propaganda / misdirection / basically a bunch of shit that makes it hard to actually know anything for sure. Just, keep an open mind. You don't need to believe or disbelieve.
