<p>Secretary Paulson has indicated he would like to have you (Obama) choose among a list of candidates he will develop for the new position of an Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability, who will manage the TARP and related programs.</p>

<p>TIME lists Secretary Paulson in their: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877351_1877350_1877341,00.html">&quot;25 people to blame for the financial crisis&quot;</a> because he pushed the bailout bill through congress! </p>

<p>&quot;Me? Oh So you waited while the economy crashed, you then created a mandatory unprecedented bank-welfare LAW, then you basically chose who would likely manage over $1 trillion in corporate donations? Well sir, I think it&#39;s a winning strategy!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t the Treasury department administer TARP?  So wouldn&#39;t it make sense that Paulson pushed the bill and picked the leadership?</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something here, but it seems like the bigger issue is that Hank was CEO and Chairman of Goldman prior to his role as secretary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Treasury is the umbrella department. You think there&#39;s no director? This short post says <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/node/13790">Elizabeth Warren</a> was TARPs lead administrator.</p>

<p>The question now, was she on the list that Paulson crafted? Isn&#39;t EW adored by many? This might shine a light on a ever so slightly darker side, but it&#39;s not like she&#39;s done something bad. She was merely chosen I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh beyond that- the crook in question played a significant role in BRINGING it all down and then distributing government funds to his crook friends.</p>

<p>aside from paying very little in tax under the bush statutes when cashing out his $600 million in Goldman Equity prior to the 2008 crash, he was quite literally &quot;possibly&quot; engaged in feeding information for insider trading to his buddies at the big banks while sitting as secretary of treasury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The secretary, then 62, went on to describe a possible scenario for placing Fannie and Freddie into “conservatorship” — a government seizure designed to allow the firms to continue operations despite heavy losses in the mortgage markets…</p>

<p>Paulson explained that under this scenario, the common stock of the two government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, would be effectively wiped out…</p>

<p>The fund manager who described the meeting left after coffee and called his lawyer. The attorney’s quick conclusion: Paulson’s talk was material nonpublic information, and his client should immediately stop trading the shares of Washington- based Fannie and McLean, Virginia-based Freddie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hank Paulson basically walked out of Goldman Sachs (conveniently cashing out equity that wouldn&#39;t normally vest), was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, created the largest financial bailout in American history, then dipped back out of public view.  </p>
