       The corruption goes further than just Hilary Clinton. If they brought her down they'll just replace her with someone else.

       Clinton needs to be embarrassed and shamed for her outright lying, manipulation, and corruption. Bernie still would have lost in my opinion, that's how rigged it was, no amount of bad press could sink her according to the lies the media pushes.

       Even without these leaks I have no idea how Bernie wasn't the nominee. As someone watching this from a different country he was the obvious choice. It wasn't a coincidence that he won every country except two in the democrats abroad vote. Unfortunately the media didn't bother to cover that.

       Massive election fraud, targeted disenfranchisement, and collusion between the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the mainstream media. Frankly, considering how hard they cheated him, I think it's incredibly impressive he only lost the pledged delegate count by 4%.

       I think Bernie would have won the Democratic nomination, he just seemed way more popular back then. Also, a reason they probably did not release the documents was to wait for the event to actually take place, if it was before the event they would have covered it up, like how media go back to them now and they have an excuse ready. Also, when they released the emails on Bernie the topic was hot, the people were screaming and complaining and if you remember the day they were going to announce Bernie asked for his name to be added for vote but the DNC refused and also escorted his camp mgr out of the building. The you had that awkward timeframe when Bernie supporters were ignored by the media, called ridiculous etc just to silence the subjects and then when the things calmed down the cams started rolling again, and by then they probably threatened Bernie to endorse her, which he did and he basically ended his election. Also, if you remember once the leaks came out Hillary was literally having issues getting people to her rallies, only when they managed to manipulate the Bernie supporters back she started showing crowed again. All this time was enough for an investigation but the plan was to kick Bernie out, even when they said they changed it was a setup, in a realistic world a revote should have happened. Basically, they told them this "look we cheated, it was unfair, Bernie is out and now we only have Hillary so we're moving and you will still vote us, stop being ridiculous". I can't imagine though going from Bernie to Hillary, they are completely the opposite, the only reasons some stick with her is because the old Rep/Dem mentality that you need to have a party. Which actually is fading away because new generations dont see the point in the party, and this is why Trump managed to get his crowd and the young people, because he went against both Rep and Dems and attracted the new generations, thus the wars you see now within the Rep party, they know that it doesn't really matter for them if he wins, he's neutral and doesn't stick to i only listen to Reps mentality which is causing him to lose some really extreme Reps. Overall we all agreed her campaign is a true masterpiece, what you see now was planned 2-3 years ago, all this were planned, they even said it that the people are sleeping and they control them, they even promoted Trump because they thought the people will never vote him and she'll basically have a free ride to the white house. This is where they made the biggest mistake though, they chose Trump at the worst time ever because they fell short predicting the millennials and wikileaks/internet power. In resent years we had a shift away from the normal way of thinking i am a Dem/Rep and chose to go agains the only person who doesn't represent the current establishment that people got sick of, the same reason Bernie was popular. So we get to this point, leaks are out, they lost control and now they endangered they whole elite/establishment(Rep/Dem) system, they're all in now because the foundation is shaking and thus you see media full Hillary, censoring, fake polls and full manipulation to gain back control. If Trump wins its over for them, you'll see their system come down in pieces, politicians both Rep/Dem will go to jail and probably an economic collapse because we're surviving out of the crooked system now, you add logic to it fast and it can collapse. If Hillary wins you will see the same lies and manipulation but this time they'll slap us to go back to sleep because we were bad. You will also see intense foreign policies and even ww3, because Hillary is going there for a reason, i dont know the reason but i know foreign leaders, EU, Russia, China warned for ww3 if she gets elected. So sit back and enjoy the ride i guess. It will be bumpy..

       also, It makes plenty sense. The opposition is controlled on both sides.    All of this clickbait for us deplorables, yet the theater marches on with everything the same, less covert even... all around the world in military actions, economically, socially, in collusion with this election being a huge psy-op party.

       The parties are the same. Neocons–run by israel–have controlled American politics for the last 40 years. But along comes a nationalist and shits on their parade. Just chocolate rain all up in this bitch. He threatens to undo the last 70 years of foreign and domestic policy, and so they universally gang up on him.

       Part of the established agenda is to destroy America, which would mean bringing down "the establishment" as most Americans know it. There's very little mention of Israel or any of the central bankers in any of this. I think those arguing "limited hangout" are justified.

       I think you guys take it too far. Wikileaks have been around for years now, people just didn't bother to read and study them. On their main website, not the Hillary archives they have stuff for about everyone. I think what's going on now is that wikileaks works with foreign leaders to bring down the US establishment because the stakes are really high, we are possibly looking ww3 if Hillary is elected. wikileaks would work with everyone in order to bring disclosure. At this specific point the US is an important matter and it needs to be disclosed to its people. And honestly i think what we see now is combined intelligence from multiple intelligence agencies to bring disclosure. They probably give 2 cents about Trumps, but without then he stands no chance agains the Hillary manipulation machine, so they try to keep him alive hoping to prevent a big war with Hillary. As to if wikileaks is sold out to a specific country or group i would say deff not, the reason is that the core foundation of wikileaks that is composed from hackers have a genuine goal of full disclosure and transparency, they even had an internal fight once because the hackers wanted to dump everything out to the people and Assange was arguing is not a good idea because it will being chaos and people would get killed. So now they have this strategic releases to maximize media coverage and prevent anarchy, you can also see they cover some emails and names of intelligence assets and other material to prevent civil wars, innocent people getting killed etc. i first did not agree with not dumping everything out, but soon you realize that many people are just not ready, look how hard is now for people to see reality, its just the world we live in that is not ready for them. Do they have Trumps taxes? Maybe, is it logical to put them out now when the whole planet is at stake? No. its just a complicated process, they got screwed when they started Wikileaks and many of them were hunted down and killed with no impact, so there are many things in play behind to when they release, what they release and if they should release. My 2 cents 😁

       Oh, of course not. That’s not what they’re about. Other than sacrificing a chicken to Moloch (not a chicken…), no direct mention was made because they just don’t do that over any sort of open channel.

       Plenty of people have said that Assange's aim wasn't to help Bernie but to make life difficult for Clinton or just provide transparency about the workings of politics. (Also he knew Bernie wouldn't be allowed to win.) Regardless of his aims, though, it seems all too late now to achieve anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, on a recent Swedish TV program, Assange seemed to be dangling something in front of Clinton:
       <a href="http://www.svt.se/ug/ug-referens/fallet-assange-1">
        "The Swedish case it's a nothing case, right, so it’s easy. The US case... I don't believe the US will ever drop that case, but it's not about that it's about how aggressively they chose to pursue it which is a different question."

       When someone get access to information stored on a computer, they usually want to wait longer to gather more information as time goes by. Some hackers will still send batch of informations to wikileaks to get reviewed but they will basically ask wikileaks to hold the leaks until they are satisfied or the security breach is fixed.

       There is no transparency of how long Wikileaks holds something they got before they release it.    It could be 3 hours,  three days,  or three months.    So, you don't have a basis to claim wikileaks sits on it.   They might be at the mercy of the timing for when they actually get stuff,  and from parties that are not disclosed.

       The point of controlled opposition is deception, and deception often involves mixing lies with truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks has exposed TPTB to the general public, this is true. But have they exposed all of their secrets? Have they exposed them for righteous reasons? Or by giving the masses a taste of truth that is TPTB corruption, exposed those of us who publicly oppose them in action and thought? Think of the "off switch signal" in Terminator Salvation as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       IDK, it seems to me that as sophisticated as hackers can be, that they could get information out to the public more efficiently...like take control of airwaves or something. And on the flip side of that, with as sophisticated as TPTB are, silencing Julian Assange or Edward Snowden or some other SJW people put on a pedestal, would be easy as making a phone call.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, we haven't seen the worst things Wikileaks has "uncovered". For all we know wikileaks, willingly or unknowingly, are being used to further TPTB agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point is, don't accept that an ally is an ally simply because they say they are or even show you they are. Tongues can lie and eyes can blind you to the truth. Be diligent with your belief system.

       Well one thing i know is that they recently settled a case were they freed up some documents to publish. From what i understand is a tedious process to release them legally on how Wikileaks works. Usually govs sue them, then they try to lock up those cases as long as they can, and Wikileaks needs fight to speed up the process so it can free the docs. Not sure with what docs this happens but i know its there. Assange was going through one of this cases recently where basically if he was to leak before the court he was going to jail. I do think though they should start doing it the dirty way, leak everything everywhere completely uncensored, while this will create a temporary chaos and anarchy it will get the disclosure era up and running. Like aliens for example, imagine if tomorrow they leak 100k docs and making aliens an official reality, i know i can take it but take a look around you, can this people take it? They cant separate reality from delusion anymore. It will shock their world, and honestly i dont know if i wanna see what this lunatics will do. They're currently giving us a mass murderer as president that might ignite ww3, at this point i expect anything from them.

       And honestly, why do you even need Wikileaks as an organisation or Assange as a spokesman for it? If one is capable enough to obtain this kind of information, you would think they would be equally capable enough to distribute the information to the masses while remaining anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i mean how odd is it that HRC for example is clever enough weasel her way into her position of power, and make millions of dollars over the years in the process, and be careless enough to use a personal server on the grid instead of a closed loop military server when dealing with classified and governmental data? Really odd to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       and imo, an "official reality" isn't necessarily truth. Wikileaks could release a million documents which reveal how pigs really spend their nights flying around the earth, but it wouldn't make it true, regardless of how many people believed that it was.

       IDK...like I've said before...we gotta be diligent in our belief system, because lies are floating around like air these days.

       Well they are an organizations. Everyone can send them stuff, lets say you work for the government and you have stuff, you can send them to them and never worry of finding a way to publish anonymously etc... they have to go through the legal channels just so they can keep the light on and keep going. Also, remember his lead layers was murdered couple of months ago. Hillary basically had to use a personal server. She had stuff to hide and deals to make, if she were to use it now we would have had all her emails and know exactly about her deals, remember this woman genuinely thinks is above the law, she might didn't even think of not having a server. She supposedly hired an "expert" to secure the server but turns out he wasn't that good at his job. Is honestly not that hard to make a server, i think it was a combination of i can do whatever i want, a need to take it off the grid (so she delete them without trace)  in case something goes wrong like now, and not knowing the risks associated with the technology.

       Podesta's emails are much less of a deal than, say, her deleted emails or the 1,000 emails with Petraeus or the documents that got suppressed when the administration dropped the Turi arms dealing case last week. What damage are the current leaks doing? And once President, Clinton would squelch any further investigations.

       Because it allows them to omit convenient facts and as per modus operandi, control the narrative. Leaks out the light stuff to distract people so you can hide away the real heavy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They own most media so they can control the amount of exposure to the crimes. Why? Probably because they know that same old thing, word moves fast, people love to gossip, and when some secretary or office yes man has a few too many drinks suddenly they spill things they otherwise would have forgotten about what they saw. So they knew eventually the truth about their criminality would be revealed.

       Would you rather have a building just topple over into the streets at random in a major metropolitan city, or would you rather have a controlled demolition that makes everything neatly fall into its own foot print for an easy cleanup?

       It's suspicious that we're not allowed to discuss whether Wikileaks is controlled opposition without getting hit hard by the downvotes. Throw in the fact that the most vocal opponents of the "controlled opposition" theory are coming from accounts with
       <em>
        questionable

       history, and something feels very off about all of this.

       Indeed. Though i wont be the first to call shill. Some people just have a real hard time letting go of an established perception of reality. The first phase in realizing a lie is almost always denial and irrational anger. And it becomes even more complex when dealing with the mixing of truth and lies, hence the frequent use of that tactic by TPTB. And again, im not saying that Wikileaks IS controlled opposition, I'm just pointing out the very real possibility that they are. As long as my comments aren't getting removed completely, I'm comfortable, and even expect down votes to a lot of things I have to say here. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, i really have no delusions that I can convince anyone about anything if they don't want to be convinced. And most people just don't wanna let go of what they believe. But its therapeutic to pour my brain out onto the world from time to time, come what may.

       Just as a thought exercise...damning revelation sinks Hillary right before the election, Trump wins, some conflict escalates to all out war (which is what really spins the wheels for TPTB). Establishment of both DNC and GoP goes "we told you". There is no shortage of flashpoints around the world as is.

       Saying that Bernie had a chance suggests the system he is a part of is legitimate. I do not believe that to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't say that he didn't have a chance because people wouldn't have voted for him. I'm saying he didn't have a chance because he had no real intention and TPTB, who control the system from start to finish, had no real intention of him becoming President of the United states.

       I mean come on...he folded pretty easily.

       I think you guys take it too far. Wikileaks have been around for years now, people just didn't bother to read and study them. On their main website, not the Hillary archives they have stuff for about everyone. I think what's going on now is that wikileaks works with foreign leaders to bring down the US establishment because the stakes are really high, we are possibly looking ww3 if Hillary is elected. wikileaks would work with everyone in order to bring disclosure. At this specific point the US is an important matter and it needs to be disclosed to its people. And honestly i think what we see now is combined intelligence from multiple intelligence agencies to bring disclosure. They probably give 2 cents about Trumps, but without then he stands no chance agains the Hillary manipulation machine, so they try to keep him alive hoping to prevent a big war with Hillary. As to if wikileaks is sold out to a specific country or group i would say deff not, the reason is that the core foundation of wikileaks that is composed from hackers have a genuine goal of full disclosure and transparency, they even had an internal fight once because the hackers wanted to dump everything out to the people and Assange was arguing is not a good idea because it will being chaos and people would get killed. So now they have this strategic releases to maximize media coverage and prevent anarchy, you can also see they cover some emails and names of intelligence assets and other material to prevent civil wars, innocent people getting killed etc. i first did not agree with not dumping everything out, but soon you realize that many people are just not ready, look how hard is now for people to see reality, its just the world we live in that is not ready for them. Do they have Trumps taxes? Maybe, is it logical to put them out now when the whole planet is at stake? No. its just a complicated process, they got screwed when they started Wikileaks and many of them were hunted down and killed with no impact, so there are many things in play behind to when they release, what they release and if they should release. My 2 cents 😁
