      <p>
       Recently I've seen many posts here describing the exact feeling I was going through once I woke up to the absolute corruption of American society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always knew things were corrupt, but not to the point where I thought EVERYTHING the media or the gov does is to hold the people down or in many cases, murder the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you realize you literally live in a biological beast matrix, it can be quite depressing. It makes you not want to be involved with society as you start looking at everyone as sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start to lose hope in your future because you are expecting some horrendous shit around the corner. We are witnessing the setup now with the new Russian red scare.
      </p>
      <p>
       IT GETS BETTER!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep doing what your doing, be positive, try to plant seeds when you can to wake others up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself realized that as much as I want to say fuck the beast matrix, at this point in time I have to live within it to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other option is to go into the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of living in the woods.. I want to suggest a new movie that just dropped called "captain fantastic". It's about a guy who raises his family in the woods and how their lives are affected with they have to communicate with "normal society". Shows they are superior in some aspects, but due to their seclusion they are lacking in other aspects that make us human. Like relationships and sex and other nifty things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your TVs shut off and encourage others to do the same. Go out and enjoy nature. It's autumn and the leaves are really colorful. It can cheer you up. Eat clean and exercise to keep your mind and body on point because you will need it in tip top shape in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get rid of your Facebook, even if you "just use it to keep in touch with family and friends". Delete it. Rekindle human relationships instead of digital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get rid of twitter, Snapchat and Instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get rid of your Gmail as it is state run. There are alternatives. Check out
       <a href="/r/privacy">
        /r/privacy
       </a>
       for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Download Orbot and get used to tunneling your traffic through Tor to keep yourself anon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be a good person and realize that now that you are awake, you have the opportunity to help and protect the weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lord is not our Sheppard, for we are not sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck everyone.

       Once you realize that Islamic terrorism isn't actually a thing on such a grand scale they try to make you think it is, you realize the world isn't so bad...

       It's one group basically doing all the murder and mayhem, and they don't have brown skin. That's for sure.

       I remember early in the primaries and I was pointing out all this sketchy shit happening by Clinton. I'd even carefully connect all the dots for people and then they'd just respond with me for being a conspiracy nut with no proof blah blah. And I'd have to explain you don't need a smoking gun to see the very obvious and clear writing all over the walls. It's just like clear as day it's so fucking obvious what's going on. I mean super early on I was even pointing out obvious things like Hillary leverage her powerful network within the media to Push for Trump to create an unelectable ringer to fight against.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people would literally get pissed and angry. And I thought it was so strange because it made me feel crazy. Because from my perspective it was just so so so ducking obvious, and I'm a HUGE skeptic and it was still clear as day what was going on. Then I just started feeling frustrated FOR THEM. Like these people were just idiots. They were successfully being played and being played perfectly. They were all getting hooked just as expected. And as each email dump comes out is just shines more light onto what I was calling blatantly obvious all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even after all this they still manage to rationalize away what is just so fucking unbelievably obvious. Like I get it. They support Clinton. She's probably the lesser of two evils. No problem with someone using their vote how they please. But come on don't be so fucking ignorant. This lady has been carefully planning this since 2008 and has been brilliantly putting her pieces in play by leveraging her very powerful network of allies and elites while using every dirty and unethical trick in the book. How this isn't incredibly obvious to people just makes me feel sad for them. Being that ignorant to the point that you're literally falling into their plan perfectly is a sad state to be in.

       She's going to just keep doing what she's doing. She is going to get close the elites and get all of her allies rich while helping out special interests. And since she is the preferred candidate of the elites she's probably going to be able to walk right through because both sides of the isle will be protecting her.

       I would rather live a primitive life with no advanced technology like we have now, and go and live a self-sustainable life in the wild. Living in a mud brick house and catching food for myself, rather than have to deal with all this shit that is happening right now. The first option seems very peaceful and self-fulfilling.

       It's actually a worse feeling when the rare person actually can understand the fuckery behind 9/11 but they just don't care. Like, they understand it could be a inside job  but when I ask if they want to ever look into more they tell me they would rather not look into it and stay ignorant because going along with the story makes their lives eaiser. I consider them complacent in mass murder, usually I end up stealing things from them, you know, just to make life easier. Yes, I am a little off the ball, who cares.  Not you.

       I feel quite overwhelmed by the whole 'waking up' process. The main thing that scares me and makes me sad about learning of governmental corruption makes me wonder what we the public can do to change this - and currently my main thought is: nothing. I feel we are completely and utterly overruled to the point where a revolt of any kind would be pointless and overlooked.

       Can attest, going into the woods is not for everyone. That being said, OP is severely ignorant about people who choose that route. I'm the happiest I've ever been (I've made money in the cities - traveled, etc etc), and do not lack on the enjoyment or sex. Having sex in a hot tub on  acres of your own land with no one around in nature is pretty niiiiice.... Don't knock it till you try it...
      </p>

       Everything else, carry on OP. I agree...

       You warned people against it, based on an extreme example from Hollywood. Which is why people have a negative outlook of mountain people. We are among the happiest people on earth and do not lack societal tendencies or friendships. We actually have better relations with people and our neighbors.... If you are sincere, my bad, if not, that is why I responded as I did...
