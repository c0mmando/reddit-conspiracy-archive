<p>And why no emails about the GOP coup against Trump.  I&#39;m sure there are literally 100 campaign managers that are hackable with this same shit in America.</p>

<p>Also, in a way I&#39;m calling for Assange to bring the heavy shit before too late.  Because if heavy shit does emerge before Nov 8 I take it all back.  &quot;4D Chess&quot; indeed.</p>

<p>Exactly; there have been. Remember that we’ve proven that Cruz went to work with the DNC to stop Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just normally I see lefties act like if Trump wins its literally the end of America and &quot;this time it&#39;s different&quot;.  And even though Hillary is bad I don&#39;t want to fall into that trap.  I think she did break the law hard with the emails, and started wars.  But most politicians start wars and we don&#39;t have actionable evidence on the emails yet.  So I don&#39;t want to fall into the trap of acting like we have to go all out supporting trump including exaggerating the significance of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so I can see that you&#39;re more intelligent than I thought. I&#39;m not a Trump fan either, but I do like what he has to say about this particular issue and I think he would be more honest than Hillary on all issues.</p>

<p>Lots of the anti-Hillary shit is meaningless and petty, I&#39;ll give you that.  Presidential races tend to bring the worst in everyone. I think Trump&#39;s biggest sin is that he is a terrible public speaker and hasn&#39;t spent much time thinking on the issues. Hillary on the other hand is calculated but corrupt. </p>

<p>This election is incompetence vs corruption. Personally I think incompetence can be cured, but corruption is forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emails that prove she deleted emails and docs subpoenaed by congress. She lied to congress about Benghazi and here private email system. She gave/sent/received classified and above communications and also shared these communications with people that did not have clearance. Just those items there legally disqualify her from holding security clearance thus a position as high as president. Emails prove the above allegations I made are true. Comey and Lynch shit the bed on charging and prosecuting her for these crimes. Why they did this we can only speculate, but emails prove she and her administration lied and colluded with Platt River Networks to destroy official government property.</p>

<p>Again, this is just about the emails. The leaks cover so much more. Rigged DNC primaries/pay-to-play with the state department/taking money from foreign governments etc...I mean come on man, it&#39;s out there and the reason she and her staff have not been charged/prosecuted shows just how big the corruption and collusion between HRC/State Department/DOJ/FBI/Media/Obama/Obama administration really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, and he decided to spend the last 5 years as a prisoner in an embassy faking that the US wants his head just to make it more appealing to us. Also i assume last week the US illegally raided the embassy to get him and the thousands of people who ran at the embassy were also staged. But, they did not cover the news just to make it more realistic. I see it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. Now you&#39;re getting into the right frame of thinking :-)</p>

<p>But seriously, controlled opposition and hostile take overs is central to these people. Either Snowden, nor Assange have released anything seriously damaging to tptb. I suspect they are there to make us believe the system is not entirely corrupted and that if things go to awry people in the secret corridors will come out and spill the beans.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, when WikiLeaks was at the height of its fame, the main message from that story was that the information they released hurt and killed intelligence operatives on the field, supposedly to make us less sympathetic toward these kind of leaks.</p>

<p>I don’t know where Assange actually spends his days is and neither do you. I do know however that the Ecuadorian ambassador is a freemason and that when Assange joined WikiLeaks many years ago he acted like a despot and got into conflict with most of the people involved with WikiLeaks in those days. I also know that all MSM media is controlled and that hostile takeovers of organisations and countries is not uncommon in these scenarios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Wikileaks released many damaging documents both for the US as also any other country it gets information on. There is also zero evidence that they got field operatives killed, this was a US propaganda to go after them. He spends his days locked in the London Ecuador embassy, which he is locked there for the last 4-5 years with asylum. The ambassador had nothing to do with the asylum, i believe it was Ecuadors last 2 presidents who gave it to him. But i think he gets support by many other latin countries too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, well maybe it&#39;s just me that is paranoid and cynical, but I find him suspicious. But then again my world view has turned to &quot;conspiracy mode&quot; these days. Before I did not believe something was a conspiracy until there was compelling evidence. But after having discovered so many big lies covered up by a completely controlled MSM , I now tend to view things as a conspiracy until I find compelling evidence it&#39;s not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well spies are handled by CIA, he is not an american citizen so that means the US gov had to ask CIA opinion before going after him, and why would CIA give up their spy so the government can chase him? And out government went to great lengths so far to get him, he&#39;s alive only because Ecuador gave him asylum in London. It wasn&#39;t the US that raided, i believe it was UK police by US request and it was 2-3 weeks ago, you got me on the heat of the moment there, sorry! I saw a YouTube interview/speech video were he was talking about it and giving some advices on how to prevent govs taking humans rights etc, i searched for the video but i could not find it, i will try to find it and post it but also search it yourself, he just got many videos recently so prob need to do some digging to find it. Also they false accused him that he raped a woman/kid dont remember, which also doesn&#39;t make sense if working for the CIA. Basically there&#39;s no chance that he works for CIA because he published stuff on them too.  </p>
