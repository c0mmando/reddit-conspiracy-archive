It seems like everything is fake, like there&#39;s some hidden plot underneath everything. Movies, tv shows, news channels, whatever. Whenever I talk to friends about things like this though, they always call me crazy, even if I&#39;m not spouting off about Satan and his Illuminati gang. If I just bring up the idea that maybe not everything is perfect and that there definitely IS corruption in the world, I&#39;m automatically crazy. It doesn&#39;t matter if what I&#39;m saying is completely logical...i just want to know if anyone else feels the same, because I&#39;m starting to think that maybe I am crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we live in an incredible age of information, misinformation, and disinformation. The corrupt leaders of this world need us to be confused, disoriented and distrustful in order to continue being corrupt. Yes, it is only logical to feel distrust after awakening to the shit going on. With just the slightest bit of research, the illusion of the benevolent government you once believed in crumbles away to reveal a truly sinister network of war criminals, pedophiles and eugenicists. This is a hell of a shock when it first is discovered, and naturally so. The people and institutions you&#39;ve spent your life believing in have been revealed to be, in a sense, &quot;out to get us&quot;, which evokes a lot of cognitive dissonance and even denial. And once the veil is lifted, it can never ever go back, which you will learn to appreciate as you begin to recognize the illusions as they play out in front of you.</p>

<p>But hang in there. Keep your sense about you, and continue to do your research. Follow the facts, and ALWAYS check sources. Too often in this sub, people post articles from atrocious sources that are clearly just wrong, made up fear-mongering speculation. Don&#39;t get caught up in this. Use your discretion and intuition to filter through the information. </p>

<p>As far as talking to other people about this stuff......that part doesn&#39;t get much easier unfortunately. I&#39;ve been researching the same things for going on 8 years, and my family still rolls their eyes at my &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. I understand you want to wake your people up to this madness, but the tragic reality is not everyone is ready or willing to accept this. A large percentage of people will not pay any attention until it is far too late. Count yourself lucky to be awake, and don&#39;t be afraid to engage people in conversation with documented facts to support your findings. If they don&#39;t want to hear it/believe it, so be it. You tried. It is not your responsibility to convince everyone, but it IS your responsibility to awaken those who are receptive to the message. Never underestimate the power of planting a subconscious seed. Because they may pick up on a tiny bit of the information you put out, and weeks, months, years later they will recall your information and use it to wake themselves up. This is important, because it is the ONLY way we will ever be able to build a better world, one not held captive to the whims of the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest problem of today is indeed the tremendous amount of disinformation. From very delicate/subtle/devious up to outrageous/outlandish and everything in between.</p>

<p>The main concern of OP&#39;s is starting to feel crazy. Binge watching conspiracy theories on youtube for example is an easy way to get crazy/distrustful of everything.</p>

<p>The thing is, in math, there are absolute truths. In science you can do experiments to verify theories and build models of knowledge that can predict reality.</p>

<p>But when you are talking about history or current events, almost all the information is secondhand. Every source has an agenda, it can be as simple views/ad revenue up to manipulating your entire belief system. The thing is, you can never be 100% sure about anything, you have to get comfortable with this.</p>

<p>My advice: Choose your sources wisely, stick to good ones, don&#39;t spent time on bad ones. Think critically, don&#39;t obsess over absolute truths too much, first be interested in &#39;the bigger picture.</p>

<p>It depends on your circumstances btw, how much do you know already, have you only watched tv, been to school. Or have you read quality books, watched documentaries?
I expect you&#39;re quite young, If none of your friends actually believe corruption exists. At least I hope :P</p>

<p>what are you actually looking into atm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely relate. You&#39;re not crazy, not from what you described. </p>

<p>Grappling with the fact that all the media we consume is delivered to us with intentions that may not be in our best interest is important. Turn on the TV and there&#39;s a conspiracy that no one will call a theory: that of the marketers to make you purchase something you didn&#39;t want before. Changing how you interpret and act on the ideas presented to you by the media can be jarring because it&#39;s different from how you previously thought.</p>

<p>As far as your friends, start with the small stuff and don&#39;t push, if they&#39;re not receptive you might be best dropping whatever the subject may be, for a little while. Someone told me once, &quot;all you can do is show people the door...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts are your friends.</p>

<p>I was patronized in a political discussion the other day when someone said (unrelated to the topic at hand), &quot;But you believe the US govt actually caused 911!&quot; I said, &quot;Let&#39;s get back to the issues,&quot; and proceeded to use facts as to why his foreign policy argument about Clinton being a &quot;good diplomat&quot; was utter rubbish, specifically mentioning entanglements in the middle east.</p>

<p>Confident that I knew more than they did, I paused midway through the conversation and did a douchey thing. I stopped and said, &quot;wait, you <em>do</em> know which country the Peshmergas came from, right?&quot; The silence was the best smackdown. It was almost as good as the look of disapproval that I got to give when someone meekly said, &quot;Libya?&quot; And to be clear, I don&#39;t want to be that asshole. But when someone pulls out the &quot;you&#39;re crazy&quot; line, that goes out the window.</p>

<p>This manic defence of their delusion bubble is a form of moral cowardice. They will protect the bubble if you try to burst it, and the best way to get inside is to instill doubt. So don&#39;t try to push your worldview on them, just drip-feed them information that makes them doubt their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, but not really.</p>

<p>Logic, has it&#39;s &quot;flaws&quot;, in the sense once logic is acted upon, and reason leads one to a conclusion, that conclusion has more than one perspective.</p>

<p>Explaining this perspective is incredible difficult.</p>

<p>Out in the world, one sees with new eyes what one didn&#39;t see before, and then the whirlwind starts. </p>

<p>Not everyone has logic or reason, or the interest for truth.</p>

<p>They do what they do, just try to avoid them, and be rational and concrete.</p>

<p>Try to explain with your 5 senses - i.e. from personal experience. Then people will understand more.</p>

<p>We just have to carry the torch, and make sure it doesn&#39;t blow out. It never does actually, but it can get very dim.</p>

<p>Just trust your heart - you know what you know, and learned, and that no-one can take from you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>A truth seeker is like a sun-flower;</p>

<p>It stretches for the light, matures and blossoms. But the elements have seasons, and soon the flower fades away.</p>

<p>During it&#39;s time in the sun, it has matured, and grown it&#39;s seeds.</p>

<p>These seeds falls to the ground, and hibernates for a while, but the sunlight will return...</p>

<p>Next season, a new generation starts a new. The seeds have the exact same recipe as it&#39;s parent, and it&#39;s parent before that.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Self-awareness, which has grown out of the experience, makes one able to trace back one&#39;s own origins, and pick up where we left off, or went astray.</p>

<p>And the snake then sheds it&#39;s skin, and grows once more.</p>

<p>-We never stop growing.</p>

<p>What many tend to forget, is to get rid of the old ways. That way, we can&#39;t grow..</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here are a few latin quotes i picked up on my journey:</p>

<p>-&quot;Nisi Sapientia Frustra&quot; - <em>&quot;Without knowledge, all is in vain&quot;</em></p>

<p>-&quot;Vitam Imperende Vero&quot; - <em>&quot;To stake one&#39;s life on what is true&quot;</em></p>

<p>-&quot;Lucendo allis ego ipse ardeo&quot; - <em>&quot;While I burn, I give light to others&quot;</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit:
Another analogy I conundrum&#39;d about, was how a sunflower thrives in the warmth of sunlight. Well what do one do if it&#39;s an ice-age then? Well, I thought about it for a while, and remembered the reason we have Christmas trees. It is the chopped-off top of a Norwegian Pine, or a pine tree. It&#39;s structure and seeds, like the sun-flower, is based upon the Fibonacci sequence, only this plant can be evergreen in the hardiest environments... </p>

Now I spun that around and when I see double digits it reminds me to stop, and say a few words that I need in that moment, hour, day or just in general. They are words like; peace, love, truth, honesty, happiness, and every single time I end with DISCERNMENT. It&#39;s become like a mini meditative minute several times during my day and has helped me stay &#39;sane&#39; thru all of my truth seeking.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.</p>

<p>Once you realize that the elites of every country are working together to create the NWO it all becomes clear. </p>

<p>Only way to stop WW3 is for everyone to refuse to fight for their respective countries once its officially declared. Anyone with a brain knows that actually fighting in the war serves 2 of the elite&#39;s agendas: depopulation and mass profits from war. The average citizen will benefit in no way.</p>

<p>What would be even better is if we rounded up the politicians in every country and dropped them all off on an island to fight WW3 in battle royale fashion. I mean why not? They&#39;re the fucks jerking each other off over the thoughts of WW3. The surviving politicians get to form the one world government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have recognized that there are people out to both influence your thoughts and opinions and keep you frightened. It&#39;s like a switch - now that it&#39;s on, you no longer process just the content of the message, but you take note of how it is conveyed, worded, and framed. And each time you recognize an attempt at manipulation, you are offended and upset.</p>

<p>This all adds up very quickly, and before you know it, you begin looking for evidence of propaganda where it may not really be. You realize you&#39;ve made a couple of oversteps in accusations, and as a result, you&#39;ve begun questioning all of what you believe in the first place.</p>

<p>Look, you&#39;re on the right path. You&#39;re stuck on it though. We all are. After the past few days, I don&#39;t even know what memories of mine are real, what experiences I thought I&#39;ve had really happened, or who I know of is dead or alive.

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to my life ðŸ˜… well sometimes people might make you think that you really are crazy but then you see all this other people who have the same feelings, and you see the evidence and it just makes sense. It feels you&#39;re walking toward the light and it just seems wrong to turn around again. </p>

<p>3 possibilities can exist:</p>

<p>1) We&#39;re right and the majority of people are in deep sleep.</p>

<p>2) we really are crazy but i highly doubt it because once you pick through the whole is where the actual research start, and it will always make you feel that you&#39;re right. But it can also be schizophrenia ðŸ˜¬</p>

<p>3) Watch your back because your family might find you dead one day, either from unknown reasons or suicide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the exact same, it started with me believing a few of the standard conspiracies like JFK etc but now I genuinely don&#39;t know what to believe either. I discovered flat earth stuff and was like no way this can&#39;t actually be a thing sure we know the earth is round. I&#39;ve looked at 9/11 stuff and my mind is blown. I am fascinated so much by this stuff and also confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a ton of crazy stuff like 15+ years ago of people who were in those top secret dont even exist govt projects and that stuff is over the top. This 9/11 stuff and JFK is peanuts compared to that. You have to learn quickly to Just take it all in but dont trust it. Its probably all false, or has some truth to it here and there, or twisted truths. Eventually you read so much of it the pieces start to fall into place and you have those aha! moments. Thats when a bunch of stuff you read doesn&#39;t fit the narrative and it drops off as probably made up. </p>

<p>But yeah it&#39;s definitely something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your not crazy. But if you start talking Satan or illuminati people may think you are. Satanists are some of the best people I have met. Some of them are a bit out there but they are respectful and kind. Illuminati I don&#39;t believe exist. There is a group that calls themselves bilderburg that most definitely exists, and has same MO illuminati has. They are not satanists as far as I can tell. Their &quot;god&quot; is money, their goal is world domination, their pleasure is derived from millions of suffering people (it ups the profits).</p>

<p>The force you feel guiding tv, Internet and the like. Is this Bilderburg Group. But it doesn&#39;t stop with them. They have ties to every single aspect of the government. I call them the shadow government.</p>

<p>Theory can get to some people. Their weak minds can&#39;t handle it. I have a relative that knows about the corruption but has to keep away from the relentless torrent of bad news it causes them to have severe depression.</p>

<p>Best wishes my friend and always remember. If someone gets angry with you for speaking the truth, they are living a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are afraid of the truth. This relates to pessimism in general. You can&#39;t be ontologically redpill without accepting that life could be possibly a punishment or a mistake, and things won&#39;t necessarily &#39;work out in the end&#39; and stay in order &#39;ever after&#39;.</p>

<p>Look at redpillians gone by-like arthur schopenhauer. First up, his essay &#39;On Women&#39; could have been written by Tucker Max and Rooshv. Second, remember that one quote about &#39;three stages of truth&#39; i,e ridiculous, offensive, self-evident? Classic Schoppin&#39;. Now, finally and more saliently, marinate in this one: People  say that my philosophy is cheerless, because they want to be told that the good lord made all things and made them good. Very well, go to your pastor, and leave philosophers to their philosophy!&#39;</p>
