        Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his "George" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.  And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to
        <strong>
         produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
        </strong>
        The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

       TPTB care only about the 3 main tenets of American public indoctrination as it relates to capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) That the unmitigated, unrestrained accumulation of wealth by individuals and corporations is a good thing for YOU/ AKA the interests of the employer and employee are one in the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) That regulation and associations (unions) are bad (because freedom, remember).
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Blame the victims of the above 2 rules. You're poor? Well you just didn't want it bad enough.

       Yeah I would advice against violence. Every process is already in place to label dissidents to hunt them down, demonize them via media propaganda, amd crush any uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the first step is to have a clearly drafted and specific alternative to our defunct government (cant leave that to some random revolutionary authoritarian), we need to reach critical mass across institutions around the country to mobilize Americans to storm DC by the millioms until they re-instate the laws and constitution that were essentially suspended since the Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know how to play us on that front too... They have made us so financially/economically insecure, that we cant take off work to fight for our Democracy and protest for fear of being fired from our jobs for taking PTO.

       Even if we didn't lose our jobs, I highly doubt the government would give a fuck about a few million protesters.

       They would just use the media to make us look crazy and nothing would change.

       A coordinated national day of boycott of the banks, if done right (millions of people all over pulling out in the same week), can truly shake the bankers. The only way to do it is to get "leaders" that can spread the message far and wide and coordinate the campaign.

       Just playing devils advocate: no one has money to pull out of the banks.  Average person has less than $1000 liquid, and most have negative net worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But massive withdrawal within the population of people that have 401k's will cause a major shock.  Because 401k's and mortgages are financial products that profit from inventing money from nothing.  So if the people who own those assets suddenly ask for all of that invented money to be turned in to cash there is likely to be a shortage.

       Very true. I think in the end it would be more of a PR/psychological battle of bankers not knowing what to expect/how to prepare for withdrawals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any public push like this, and any subsequent scramble by the banks is the kind of stuff that can snowball into bank runs, but I agree... barely anybody has anything in the bank these days to make much of a difference.

       Thanks. I'm basically paraphrasing Sharon Beder, but I keep running into those three aspects in my research into propaganda and mass manipulation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it must have three aspects. Firstly it needs to provide a rationale for minimising government intervention. Secondly it needs to justify “untrammelled, uninhibited pursuit and possession of wealth” in terms of the common good. Thirdly it needs to explain poverty and unemployment in terms of the individual faults of those who find themselves in that situation.[79] Economic education sought to provide all three.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly ‘economic education’, in schools, workplaces and in broader public fora, plays a crucial role in achieving capitalist hegemony.

       The 2016 primaries and election have truly been a site to behold if you approach cable news and the big media corps with a cynical eye. They have the process down on capitalizing on any damaging Trump news through pundits, while diminishing/downplaying massive government corruption stories that puts Watergate to shame on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll check those links out. I read Edward Bernays before this election and holy shit... they have perfected the craft (before the advent of social media I think, which has put them on the defensive about their blatant propaganda).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       ― Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also more insidious ways to control the masses, such as through economic insecurity, but every tyrant relies on fear of a "common enemy" to keep the population scared, compliant, and wanting more protection from daddy government.

       This is crucial. United States in 2016 is reliving a lot of the culminating moments throughout history where the people go from complacency to revolution, but it hasn't happened yet because we still get food stamps (so people don't get hungry/angry enough), and because we are still fighting the inertia of so many Americans being unaware and compliant. Having awareness is good, but change won't happen gradually, as much as we will wake up one day in a police state full of surveillance, carefully-crafted propaganda instead of news, silencing of dissent, incarceration for those labelled as "internal enemies", etc etc etc. Scary times in a way. I'm starting to think the book "The Fourth Turning" is quite prophetic.

       Indeed. The one warning I have about basic income, is that they are both pushing for a cashless society, and the idea of basic income (with strings attached I'm sure... nothing in life will be free).

It was all written in the 90's in the book "Creature of Jekyll Island".

       You could implement basic income through existing  online bank account or an online wallet tied to natonal id eg- an implantable chip is unnecessary. It's essentially an export programme for basic necessity companies to regular people to  stimulate spending and provide them with security. This could easily be done by stopping compound interest and other parasitic schemes the zionist banking cartel have conjured up, bringing the money creation back to the government and people, reducing the cost of capital, helping businesses and industry, government and consumers by increasing profits, reducing business costs, consumer prices and taxation by curbing the parasitic banking sector. Most importantly it would be democratic, stopping the zionist from corrupting media government academia law and politics. Marx never told you this, but lincoln sure did

       It's hard to come up with an alternative to what we have that would not be just as easily corruptible, but indeed compound interest and time-value of money concepts are quite dangerous for most that don't take the time to understand all of its ramifications (the bankers do, and they enslave one country after the other under their scheme... they bomb and topple the ones that don't play along).

       In a weird way, it is lost now that John Maynard Keynes was a Fabian socialist who believed that the ultimate best system would be one without profit/rent seeking capitalists, but one where wants and needs are met by the simple reallocation of capital/resources to where it is needed.

       My opinion is that technology innovation and efficiency improvement is the only way forward, a basic income would give people the security to further increase support for tech innovation, the majority of profits made by banks are not legitimate and only serve to provide them with a greater share of the money supply which they use corrupt the institutions of democracy and cause 911 nor dissimilar to whatever they were doing in pre nazi europe
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the study of economics and monetary policy is intended to deceive and not elucidate nor to serve people. I agree rent seeking behavior should be discouraged especially as it applies to residential property and banking which should be reverted to its social function of connecting borrowers and savers and insurance and money creation returned to a democratic body. Innovation isn't going to come from some zionist banker fuck and his ilk, its going to come from people who are empowered to innovate

       I agree that technology innovation will pave the way, in that the goal should be more transparency in markets, and a free-er flow of information (the elites make TRILLIONS often because they are the holders of most of the actionable
       <em>
        information

       in the world, by design).
      </p>
      <p>
       The balance in economics and human nature is to satisfy the basic needs of all humans, and balance short-term WANTS with long-term sustainability. One of the worst developments in today's world is the financialization of EVERYTHING in the economy, so that the goal is not to do what is best for ALL
       <em>
        stakeholders
       </em>
       of a company in the long-term, but to do everything possible to increase profits for
       <em>
        shareholders
       </em>
       by next quarter. It's a fucked up frat-boy "I got a bigger dick than you" mentality that is crushing the entire planet.

       Yep, ~20 years of schooling and not one mention of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although not an ultimate truth (some edge cases are to be expected,) "schooling" is more concerned with petty information ( a large chunk of which is controversial and/or false,) rather than meta cognition, psychology, long term frameworks for learning etc.  This should be the reddest of red flags for all to ponder.

       It's the critique I can give to most teachers, although something else is surely to be blamed (this thread covers that semi-comprehensively)

       Absolutely. I think for parents it is a cheaper form of childcare at this point, for kids is a mechanical bullshit stepping stone they tell you you have to go through to chase after the American dream, but the idea is not to develop humans that can think for and rely on themselves (which is I believe the ULTIMATE bliss, instead of "blissful" ignorance).

       Well said.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, I've used "Ignorance is Bliss" in conversation and sometimes thought it to even be true in some circumstances.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was injected into the minds of children when they are young.  Now, I am completely in line with your views, especially after understanding (some of) the scope of the lies in modern society.  I can only imagine how deep it really goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, come to think of it, I think I first learned of "Ignorance Is Bliss" through the propaganda novel "The Giver" which was mandatory reading in one of my middle school classes (or high school?  I forget.)  What do you know!

       Wait, #1 is entirely valid. We are in the mess we are in today because of a government that is too big Wi-Fi had too much power. They have sold that power to the corporations (in the form of tax preferences, criminal prosecution immunity, absence of regulation, or just cash).
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently the federal government can regulate just about anything. This was not the case 100 years ago. But today, the federal government will give corporations/banks (and the responsible individuals on their board of directors) immunity from criminal prosecution, selectively enforce regulation, not to mention bail them out for trillions of dollars using our tax dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to target the government and the Fed first and foremost.

       The interests of the employer and employee SHOULD be the same. Regulation (especially government) and associations do have negative impacts on businesses. This does not mean unions are bad but can sometimes be used for other peoples benefits which may be why the mob was tied up in unions from their inception. If you're dumb enough to blame the people who have been negatively effected by American capitalism than you probably don't have a chance of doing great things in society anyways.

       I don't expect you to believe me but regulation is a bad thing, government has their hands in just about every single pot, they're causing every single crisis with their ridiculous planned economy, we are literally trillions in debt to a group of private bankers who own our entire economy. And you think this is because of a lack of regulations? They regulate everything in their own favor, that's how it works. Every dollar that is born into existence represents DEBT to the federal reserve, and that is because we  have a central bank in this country that prints debt notes. Go read The Creature of Jekyll Island to learn about these so called regulations you want so badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulation, of course, is two centuries-worth of production, in the matter of 2 decades entirely uprooted itself and went to China. You think that's because we need more regulations? No, it's because our country is so over-regulated in the favor of these banker fucks that to earn a damn dime you have to move to China to even come up with a profit! Of course, the regulations aren't to help anyone -- they're there so bankers can dip their fingers and get a taste of the profit.

       Outstanding explanation.  What I point out when someone argues in favor of this system is that none of our founding documents mention capitalism as our economic vehicle.  Though our founding documents establish a system of checks and balances.  The checks and balances on capitalism were unions and regulations, they have both been virtually eliminated.

       Here is a good list of reasons I found, but the biggest reason to me alone is that the only 2 educators in the group that came up with the curriculum are actually campaigning against it after states were coerced/bribed into adopting Common Core. It was messy:

       This is subjective. It was adopted the same way most education initiatives are, and it is still a choice. Any state can opt out at any time. So you still have  a"voice."

        The standards are not of high quality. The Common Core standards were not ranked as the top set of standards within the United States by the

         Fordham Institute.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh wow, a conservative think-tank doesn't think the standards are that good. Sounds like a fair and balanced source /s
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Common Core standards are “instruction-based standards” that limit how content will be taught to students. Teachers will be forced to use instructional strategies that are experimental and have not been proven to raise student achievement, and that in many cases have even proven to be failures.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is just untrue. I read the entire compendium report from CEP, and their official conclusion is "no clear trends have yet emerged. more data required."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Common Core standards diminish the amount of literature read in English class in favor of informational texts. Data from international tests, such as PISA, show a strong correlation between higher literacy scores and students who read more complex literature. The same cannot be said about informational texts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, cherry picking a study that shows a correlation between high test scores and reading literature. This is to imply that reading informational texts will decrease test scores, but that isn't true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The federal government is collecting massive amounts of personally identifiable information on students.

      <p>
       So what?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The standards are costly. National implementation of the Common Core standards and assessments will cost an estimated $15 billion across the participating states, according to the Pioneer Institute.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the only good point so far. Yes, it is very costly, and since it's technically unproven, and new, I see why this concerns many people.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        States with the earliest implementation of the Common Core standards, such as Kentucky, have seen a decline in student achievement on the National Assessment of Education Progress, showing a lack of results from the standards.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More cherry picking. Read the CEP reports.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The new Common Core pilot tests were plagued with major technical difficulties and complaints from teachers regarding the content. Parents are upset that the Common Core increases the amount of time spent on testing and robs the classroom of valuable instruction time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a valid complaint, as well, I think.

       The problem there lies in funding of schools, priority we give to teachers and education in this country, etc. etc. We are fucked, but it is not because of decentralization IMO.

       They turned a "choice" into a bribe to states, tying grant money to the adoption of common core behind everyone's backs.

       There is a lot to discuss on common core but unfortunately I don't have the time. If I have the choice for my kids to learn like humans have learned about life for thousands of years, I will go with much better existing models of education.

       Common core is only about setting standards, there are no educational materials  no curriculum materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason it was created was so that a child moving from Alabama in 4th grade to New Hampshire would be at the same level as  his or her new classmates.
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason the Bush Adm, pushed the standards was that long hard sell to "make teachers and schools accountable."
      </p>
      <p>
       Core was created by mostly Republican governors. It is not a government organization.

       The highschool I went to (graduated 2006) is a DISASTER now. I know multiple people who attended shortly after I did (2008-2012 and 2013-2017) and holy fuck. First off, this is in New Jersey:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Common Core math
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Gym is like a military drill. Everybody waits in their locker rooms after getting changed (door is locked until the teacher comes out with them). After, you do 5 minutes of each type of workout- sit ups, pushups, jumpingjacks, lunges, for half an hour. They do this EVERY. DAY. No playing basketball or walking the track, no, you workout and then EVERYBODY does the same sport until the end of class, and it isn't PLAYING, it's "practicing." Stand there and dribble the basketball. Okay. Now go bounce it against the wall like you are passing it. Okay here is a basebal, toss it up and catch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They had bagged grilled cheese sandwiches at lunch. The vending machines were removed because "they were unhealthy" but never replaced with something healthy.

       All they say is "FALSE! ... no, he wasn't taking the stand the day after he was killed... which was a wednesday...  because it was a

       Having a bias doesn't mean automatically incorrect.  The conclusions Snopes comes to on whether something is true or false based on the evidence may be biased, but at least they lay out their evidence.

       Too often, I see people say "just another part of the disinformation campaign" without bothering to come up with a counter-argument (or even read anything to know what the argument is).

       "According to alarmist web sites such as Conservative Tribune, InfoWars, Natural News, and others, Ivey"....
That is a biased statement right there. While AJ gets clicks through his hulk hogan style of reporting Natural news does not. So to categorize those 2 sites together is already creating bias. So a reader who might say "Natural..hmm I like that" will now subconsciously ignore it all together for fear of being labeled an inforwars supporter.

       The second paragraph was pointing out the maturity of the author. 20 years in journalism and "bimbo eruptions" is what he chooses to put in his short bio.  That says to me professionalism and integrity are not his strong points.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have to agree with my example. Calling them alarmist websites instead of alternative news site creates a bias against something that does not go along with their version of the narrative. As for the rest of the artilce i have not dug that deep yet. Just a quick scan came up with a form of bias which is what you asked for. My bad if I was able to present that with a quick scan of the article and not a full read.

       I will admit it is an alternative news site.Some article come across as sensational so does all your ctr approved new sources. I gave you an example of bias, you choose not to accept it. That is ok, i would fear shitlaries retribution if I was you too. Cannot end up like Seth Rich can you.

Brian Dunning listed it as #1 on his "Top 10 Worst Anti-Science Websites" list. Adams is listed as a "promoter of questionable methods" by Quackwatch. Robert T. Carroll at The Skeptic's Dictionary said, "Natural News is not a very good source for information. If you don't trust me on this, go to Respectful Insolence or any of the other bloggers on ScienceBlogs and do a search for "Natural News" or "Mike Adams" (who is Natural News).

       I never said those other things, but shitstains like you always try to put words in the others persons mouth..kinda like bimbo explosion tried to put ideas in the head of his readers on that biased website. I only copy and pasted a comment you made after noticing all your shitlary support on other subs, and seeing that you claim they are not manipulating reddit sends the message that you are one of the ctr and a part of your contract is to deny everything until shitlary can steal the WH.

       I mean, all you're doing is attacking one messenger and defending another messenger.  You haven't brought up anything substantive about the Ivey email.  Although I guess it's hard to come up with something substantive when the primary counter to the alarmist interpretation of the email is possession of SAT-level reading comprehension skills.  Like when they ask you to interpret a sentence and then you're supposed to read the paragraphs above it to understand the context.

       .What I did do(even if not good enough for people like you) was answer the other persons question about "Show how snopes is biased using this article alone" I pointed out a bias by the author when saying alarmist. I also mentioned that I did not read the entire article but skim through it. They may not have the best tactics to get clicks but neither does cnn or faux news or any of the state sponsored media. An if you have been around as long as your karma shows then you know reddit is corrupt with ctr shills(part of shill tactics is to bring up education to be able to dismiss their comment cause they did not get the same education as you.) and right now until next month no one is safe or without suspicion. I do not support either candidate but I for some reason feel it is my job to help others see what a waste of life shitlary is. I support neither major party candidate and would be happy both of their tour buses chased each other off the same cliff never to be seen again like flight 370.

       If you bother to look up the posting history of a redditor of 6 years who mostly comments about video games, and still reflexively call them a ctr shill for disagreeing with you, the accusation kind of loses its punch. Hint: The main sign of an astroturfer is posting in volume and with repetition of phrases.  Even then, it's also the sign of an ideological zealot so it's hard to tell.  My comment wasn't so much about education (high school education isn't elitist) as the TL;DR syndrome that afflicts a large number of redditors.  It's a safe assumption that the majority of people upvoting and commenting here have only read the snippet in the OP.

       I didn't realize going to the source of the email after the fact to get their prepared and well thought through response was a good enough source to discredit the original interpretation of the email. Of course they're going to have a reason why it was totally interpreted the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm not saying your interpretation is wrong, only that going back to the source of the email to give them another chance to explain what they really meant is not definitive proof that OP's interpretation was incorrect.

       He specifically says they conspire to PRODUCE an unaware and compliant citizenry. Not that they take advantage of it. Sounds like they are actively promoting this lack of awareness.

       People should also read the whole paragraph.  Look at this shit:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Dear John:    Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his "George" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.
       <em>
        And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

       Yesterday I saw it meantioned in the emails that the Obama type plan was meant to cause problems.  It was implemented as it was an easier pill to swallow,  once in place the problems would begin and the people would accept a revison.  The revison was towards a one payer health care plan through one company that the government backed.  The government is meant to control this industrys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't create links because it took me six hours to go through the little I did read out of the thousands of emails.   I was exhausted.  I remember parts of it and I remember using the search words Soros, Trump, and CTR .  By the time I finished reading, I was numb.  I didn't see anything illegal but I saw a huge political machine operating under poor ethical practices which caused me alarm.

       If people question what is being shown, take some time out of your day and read those emails.

        I didn't create links because it took me six hours to go through the little I did read out of the thousands of emails. I was exhausted. I remember parts of it and I remember using the search words Soros, Trump, and CTR . By the time I finished reading, I was numb. I didn't see anything illegal but I saw a huge political machine operating under poor ethical practices which caused me alarm.

       Absolutely. Ask anyone who considers themselves "aware" of all the amoral shenanigans from those in power, and the process of investigating all that is out there gets exhausting and ultimately depressing (as in actual depression and a sense of helplessness/lack of control). More and more, what we see is outright disdain for us common folk who dare to hope that our government is there to serve us.

       Thank you for expressing my thoughts better.  And the link was enlighten as well.  I have a lot of time on my hands but I think I will take a break from the emails today.  I was overwhelmed yesterday to the point of distress.  I am going to have to take a break for a bit.  No one can read those emails without eventually getting very angry.

       Well... to be fair to the Elite at the top whoever they may be... the masses ARE too stupid to understand. That's why critical thinkers like us and the Trumpers are immediately put as a hate group with buzz words.

      <p>
       I may not agree with the shadow government and how they think of society but on one part the shit they say IS true. When you have a population of dumbasses who say everything is x buzzword when you share your valid observation then you really can't blame em.

       The problem is that the mindless followers are pretty common on both sides. A lot of Clinton followers have no critical thinking skills, but the same can be said for a lot of trumps. The average voter is remarkably uninformed and has a hard time thinking for themselves. Which of course makes them easy prey for people like Clinton or Trump who use them to reach their own goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump does have some good things to say, but so does Clinton. And pretending like one is an ultimate evil while the other is  blameless messiah here to save the country is ridiculous. We need more balance and discussion. More policy driven debates and less of the shenanigans we are seeing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem here. The masses have found that being entertained is more interesting than being informed. So now they dance like puppets on a string while thinking they are smarter than their perceived rivals.

       John D Rockefeller created what is today the Board of Education with $180,000,000.  The purpose was to enact all these stringent standards based upon the Prussian Education system of pre-WWI Germany.  It is thought control by the state to elicit patriotic obedient workers rather than critical thinkers.  This is detailed in The Leipzig Connection and Exposing the Global Road to Ruin Through Education.

       Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).
       </strong>
       It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

       Honestly i really believed this document topped them all, i really thought there's no way in hell they can explain this. While your try was good it was not accurate enough, you just commented on the first part but the part that has the biggest meaning is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       " And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the part that you need to explain, it sure needs a really creative answer because in my eyes there's no other way ti see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this one i thought the one saying she needs to block foreign governments from sending medical help to war victims so she can send first to win points was inexcusable, but people did try very hard to explain it, which again i find inconceivable, so lets see what will happen with this one.

       I mean come on now, you're really acting like a layer now that needs to save his guilty client. First, you dont go back and ask for an answer and use that answer to justify the so obvious statement he did when he was unaware that this would get public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, this line is pretty self explanatory, this is what their intentions were, in plain english.
      </p>
      <p>
       "we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a justification of the pure intention, he literally  says that they are still unaware and that is still going well but the compliance is fading, meaning they are still blind and stupid but they get distracted and don't listen:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,...."

       Yo. I was just at the barbershop and a conversation started out about how Hillary killed Donald Trump this debate. All the guys there were so brainwashed. One guy was so convinced that Hillary is the savior of all black men and the world. I'm so pissed about people. I started speaking out and this fucking asshole is going to tell me to Google all the information that I need to know. WE ARE FUCKED.

       Oh yea, you better get you butt clean cuz they'll give it to us really hard. I see the same thing and i just wonder if we can really pull this off and not elect Hillary as president. The issue is that many people are very ignorant, they just can't see it. What is so obvious to us is conspiracy to them and they see us the same way, but in our case we just see the facts, true leaked facts and what is going on with all this censorship etc, they don't realize this because they think we are Trump supporters and all that go with that, which was pretty well structured by the media not to look good. This is not true though, when you start chatting with people you will soon realize the most people who will vote for Trump are people who realize the importance to keep Hillary out and just hope for a change, one that might bring back the power to the people. But i do think they might have it, i just cant tell anymore how many of us are really out there. I see online polls and Trump is destroying Hillary, i see media polls and Hillary wins. I try to compare based on people posting but then you have all this censoring that again you can't really know. The media forget about it, we all know what is going on there, so i just dont know. I want to hope that especially younger generations that live in the internet and usually are unbiased to political parties are on our side, but then i see some really brainwashed young people that not only support Hillary but you can consider them fanatics. Also, i'm kinda split on Bernie supporters, Bernies people are usually good, i want peace and freedom kind of people, that i hope can realize the importance on not voting Hillary, but from what i see in the media they're saying Hillary has those votes, all my Bernie friends though would rather cut their hands off, so again, good luck figuring this out. I guess at this point is trying to spread out the leaks and hope they will reach the open minded people because they will definitely not hear anything in the media, then i guess November will show. I do believe though that those leaks are the final act of international governments to wake us up so we can prevent war. If you see the YouTube videos, foreign leaders called us out and they're done putting up with us, Putting especially pointed out Hillarie's corruption and manipulation and said he will not put up with it. China and Europeans(citizens not the gov) are done with us too. They are right, we are manipulating and killing their people while out people are sleeping and have no clue of what is really going on, the sad those same people are ready be manipulated into picking up arms and fighting for our corruption and elite greed. So whatever is going to happen will happen guys, i just know that if Hillary starts a war i will not sacrifice my life. What our founding fathers predicted many many years ago is happening now, our government operates completely opposite of what they structured it and its "us" the peoples fault for letting it happen. I guess now history will repeat and we will pay the price of our ignorance.

      </p>
      <p>
       In my observation, the single main thing that the American government wants at the moment, is to get the public sufficiently angry that they will attempt to rise up, so that the government will then have pretext to engage in a truly massive crackdown, and throw any pretense of a free society completely out the window.  Hence, they could well be using the Podesta emails in order to try and make themselves look like even more complete raving psychopaths than they actually are, so that you will get so angry that you will become violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything they will do from here on in will be an attempt to trigger you, so that they then have an excuse to subjugate and abuse you.  Don't give them one.

       this has been in the works for a long time...the entire purpose of the Prussian education system, which began to be adopted in the US during the late 1800s, is to produce citizens who are submissive to authority. When you look at the social sciences of that era, a lot of work focused on this kind of thing: figuring out how to manipulate people through various means and for various purposes. Gustave le Bon, Freud, etc. Add to this the work of 1900s propagandists like Bernays, which it looks like others here already have covered, and one can see where I'm going with this line of thinking.

       This has been in the making for decades. Porn, video games, soda, and pharmaceutical drugs. all these quick pleasures/fixes that are meant to be here to distract you or not have you deal with life.theyre saying it's the world changing but no it's us they're changing on purpose.  They want single mothers raising little boys by themselves as to lower masculinity. Estrogen mimickers in the plastics. Its all a collective ass fuck to our generation. They want a welfare state and us to not be independent. and this email is just scratching the surface of  what they're doing.

       I think what's interesting about this quote is that they believe they need both compliance and unawareness for control and then acknowledge that they're losing the compliance aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes sense when you see unrest and "people behaving badly" in the news. Things like random shootings and protests, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess this means people are getting fed up. So now all "we" need to do is raise awareness.

       They're both in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump &amp; Clinton are both backed by billionaires like Koch &amp; Soros. Clinton is crazy backed by Time Warner who owns HBO &amp; CNN which explains why CNN is tits out for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       FOX backs Trump. FOX is owned by Murdoch's Newscorp which has faced a ton of criticism for journalism breech of ethics.

      <p>
       You think Murdoch gives a fuck if the gays can get married?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just happy to be making money by pandering to conservatives while profiting off liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the major media outlets work together. When Ron Paul was running, it was obvious they colluded to ruin his campaign. Same goes with Bernie Sanders. The system is rigged to put in a CFR puppet and they've pretty much promised it to Clinton.

       ITT: People ranting about a rant.

      <p>
       From the context, it appears to be a sarcastic commentary on the current state of public discourse in this country. Which, given the ridiculous shit people are saying both in the news and online the past few years, seems spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also left off the final sentence which drives home the tone of the whole email.

       Ya'll seriously need to read it again. This time focus less on the words and more on the message. This isn't a grand conspiracy, it isn't even a story. There are MUCH more important things to be worried about.

      <blockquote>

        Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process.

       How do I put this? There was a topic yesterday talking about how Killary $hills have invaded this group and some would try to defend it by saying if that were true, topics like this would be downvoted to hell.

       However it seems that they are upvoting it just to inject discourse such as comments regarding this being taken out of context in response to another email to create some semblance of active progressive conspiracy discussion.

       I saw this and wondered the same thing.  I have doubts about its authenticity. Any "leaked" document I would scrutinize. Also wiki leaks just recently promised a big exposure but dropped the ball. I have a healthy dose f skepticism on any report from anyone anymore.

       Very true. I think in the end it would be more of a PR/psychological battle of bankers not knowing what to expect/how to prepare for withdrawals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any public push like this, and any subsequent scramble by the banks is the kind of stuff that can snowball into bank runs, but I agree... barely anybody has anything in the bank these days to make much of a difference.
