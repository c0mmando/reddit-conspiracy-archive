       These smartmatic machines have been involved in rigged elections in Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and Venezuela (all those Huge Chavez landslides???). I found this video below of a testimony in a US court from a  programmer who says voting machines are 100% capable of undetectable voter fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Bernie people were complaining about in the primaries. Now guess whose voting machines it turned out they were using? Smartmatic of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Edge2Plus electronic voting machine was specifically designed and manufactured for the US market by Smartmatic. Edge2Plus voting machines are still being used in Chicago and Cook County; and in the past two elections -the General election 2012 and the midterm election 2014- President Barack Obama cast his ballots using these voting machines."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same place James O'Keefe got hidden camera footage of voter fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the Smartmatic chairman is also on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the voting machines were set-up to screw Bernie. The election
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that puzzles me is
       <em>
        why?
       </em>
       What could possibly be the
       <em>
        motive??
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: that was a joke its kind of fucking obvious.

       If I was American, I would walk into the electronic voting booth with a big cup of water and 'accidentally' tip that sucker all over it and walk out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard rumours about upcoming black outs. Maybe someone intends to shut the power down on election day where these machines are used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if you're keen get there early and just kick the machine in and stand there with your second amendment rights and demand paper ballots.

       I don't think I could answer the why of it all completely but I do think a decent part of it is a desire to induce anxiety in the population. I believe they want to make people irritable and edgy so that they can induce fearful emotional decisions at will.

       When everyone's all mad and pissed off while at the same time feeling powerless and unsure they become scared. Scared people overreact and are easy to kill/control.

       The motive is having a favor from the potus in your back pocket. it's insider information at the highest level  of gov. it's influence. simply put, it's money and power. TPTB are literslly addicted to money and power. like a gambler on a hot streak.
      </p>
      <p>
       you won't know the EXACT precise motive for each individual until it's all said and done. it's a favor or a decision from the POTUS disconnected by multiple layers of people and/or corporations.

       Of course it's possible. But I highly doubt it. To find truth you can't write off any possibility, especially when you don't know how deep the inner workings go. I would find it hard to believe that Trump knew anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see how pieces begin to fit, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish where reality and fantasy separate. Just because there's a relation doesn't mean there is intention or design. And just because there is no relation doesn't mean there's no intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why these wiki leaks look almost TOO good. As a relation, I try to keep my beliefs in things minimal, because beliefs tend to blind me (and I presume everyone) from picking up an alternative possibility. I try to remain open to everything. With that being said, I believe Hillary is guilty, and I'm not really open, anymore, to the possibility that she is innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compartmentalization is probably so fragmented that even those involved don't fully understand all the moving parts. Things are delegated well beyond sight. Macro and micro management manifesting natural actions and causes that work to benefit a grand design. That's the basic principle behind social engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impossible to control everyone individually, so you change trends and collect the bulk of people and the outsiders who've resisted become the strange ones to be ostracized or eradicated or simply ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely possible that Donald Trump was a straw man devised by some  cabal to be an outsider to be ostracized or ignored, making Hillary appear desirable in the process. It's looking more and more like we are run by a bunch of idiots who are quite fallible and shortsighted, afflicted beyond reason by the need for greed. Maybe their straw man is an unexpected monster of its own. What to do about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure we'll find out one way or another.

       Nah,
       <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/11/elevating-trump/">
        the Dems just got their buddies in the media to give Trump a lot of free advertising
       </a>
       . It's why Trump got more free coverage than any other candidate. It was that free advertising that let Trump win, he didn't need electoral hacks. In fact, although evidence suggests massive vote tampering in a dozen states on the Democratic Party side due to reported results falling far outside of the margin of error of the exit polls, all of the reported results of the primaries on the Republican Party side match up well with the exit polls. No evidence of vote tampering for the Rs.

       There was another story going around a few months ago. It was some guy in Argentina (I think?) outlining all the tactics he uses to help those in power to rig election results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have this story that focuses on the voting machines, but also mentioning the Philippines and some South American countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost sounds like they use these places as a testing ground for methods of committing election fraud. Try out your techniques somewhere else and work out any bugs. They take their time, get some practice and get really good at it.

       If the Machine is connected to a Network yes and not even to the internet but say an older modem, it can be made corruptible with a simple firmware revision or code change and a reboot, done. For them to say it's impossible to do is just ridiculous.
