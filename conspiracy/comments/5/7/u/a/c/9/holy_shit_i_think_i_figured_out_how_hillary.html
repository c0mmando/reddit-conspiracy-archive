        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These smartmatic machines have been involved in rigged elections in Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and Venezuela (all those Huge Chavez landslides???). I found this video below of a testimony in a US court from a  programmer who says voting machines are 100% capable of undetectable voter fraud.</p>

<p>This is what Bernie people were complaining about in the primaries. Now guess whose voting machines it turned out they were using? Smartmatic of course. </p>

<p>&quot;The Edge2Plus electronic voting machine was specifically designed and manufactured for the US market by Smartmatic. Edge2Plus voting machines are still being used in Chicago and Cook County; and in the past two elections -the General election 2012 and the midterm election 2014- President Barack Obama cast his ballots using these voting machines.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the same place James O&#39;Keefe got hidden camera footage of voter fraud. </p>

<p>And of course the Smartmatic chairman is also on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.</p>

<p>I think the voting machines were set-up to screw Bernie. The election <em>is</em> rigged.</p>

<p>The only thing that puzzles me is <em>why?</em> What could possibly be the <em>motive??</em></p>

<p>edit: that was a joke its kind of fucking obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s possible. But I highly doubt it. To find truth you can&#39;t write off any possibility, especially when you don&#39;t know how deep the inner workings go. I would find it hard to believe that Trump knew anything about it.</p>

<p>When you see how pieces begin to fit, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish where reality and fantasy separate. Just because there&#39;s a relation doesn&#39;t mean there is intention or design. And just because there is no relation doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no intention. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why these wiki leaks look almost TOO good. As a relation, I try to keep my beliefs in things minimal, because beliefs tend to blind me (and I presume everyone) from picking up an alternative possibility. I try to remain open to everything. With that being said, I believe Hillary is guilty, and I&#39;m not really open, anymore, to the possibility that she is innocent.</p>

<p>The compartmentalization is probably so fragmented that even those involved don&#39;t fully understand all the moving parts. Things are delegated well beyond sight. Macro and micro management manifesting natural actions and causes that work to benefit a grand design. That&#39;s the basic principle behind social engineering. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to control everyone individually, so you change trends and collect the bulk of people and the outsiders who&#39;ve resisted become the strange ones to be ostracized or eradicated or simply ignored.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that Donald Trump was a straw man devised by some  cabal to be an outsider to be ostracized or ignored, making Hillary appear desirable in the process. It&#39;s looking more and more like we are run by a bunch of idiots who are quite fallible and shortsighted, afflicted beyond reason by the need for greed. Maybe their straw man is an unexpected monster of its own. What to do about that?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find out one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/11/elevating-trump/">the Dems just got their buddies in the media to give Trump a lot of free advertising</a>. It&#39;s why Trump got more free coverage than any other candidate. It was that free advertising that let Trump win, he didn&#39;t need electoral hacks. In fact, although evidence suggests massive vote tampering in a dozen states on the Democratic Party side due to reported results falling far outside of the margin of error of the exit polls, all of the reported results of the primaries on the Republican Party side match up well with the exit polls. No evidence of vote tampering for the Rs. </p>

<p>Now we have this story that focuses on the voting machines, but also mentioning the Philippines and some South American countries.</p>

<p>It almost sounds like they use these places as a testing ground for methods of committing election fraud. Try out your techniques somewhere else and work out any bugs. They take their time, get some practice and get really good at it.</p>
