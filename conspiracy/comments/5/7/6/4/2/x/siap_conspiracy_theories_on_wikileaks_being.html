       I peruse this sub from time to time and enjoy reading, but I'm curious why I haven't seen any theories on whether WikiLeaks is being informational or nefarious with their leaks. Does this sub believe WikiLeaks is to be trusted completely? Or am I just missing these posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       TIA
      </p>
      <p>
       Just an example before I leave: any chance Assange doesn't want a Democrat in the White House because the current Democrat Attorney General wants to prosecute him?

       Wikileaks has given us pretty much all the dirt on Clinton that we have so far. For that I am very grateful. Assange looked into Trump. Said everything he found was boring. I doubt Trump (not having the political power that Hillary has had) has really done anything scandalious as far as ruining countries and raping democracies.

       But the question is why do you trust Assange? Why would you assume that he's telling the truth about Hilary or Trump? Why wouldn't you assume he is just as corrupt and power hungry as the people he "exposes"?

       Not necessarily, but the fact that the idea that these emails could be doctored isn't discussed here is shocking to me. If the roles were reversed and the DNC or RNC were spouting off about things Assange had said/done, wouldn't you question them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying WikiLeaks is nefarious, I'm just surprised with all of the farfetched theories that you see that you don't see this one. Does no one wonder what Assange has to gain from bringing down the DNC?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I'm not good at theorizing, but there are plenty of people that are and I'm surprised those people seem so one sided on who they're choosing to theorize on.

       Idk maybe the collusion to jail him or the request to kill him via drone strike. Probably pretty good reasons to make Obama administration look horrible and try to ruin HRC's life.

       Huh? He pretty obviously committed treason. What collusion happened? I can understand the call for pardon, but lets not act like he didn't blatantly commit one of the most serious crimes in the US.

       That's never actually been defined by courts. The actual passage says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, you might interpret "owing allegiance to the United States" as "an American citizen", but its definitely not 100% that the court would interpret it that way.

       no, because he is wanted for treason for exposing corruption in our military. There is a reason so many people want Assange and Snowden pardoned, because they are viewed as patriots for exposing corruption and abuse of power as well as a direct attempt to erode the liberties of average Americans. WikiLeaks isnt a national political party. Clinton has been cloaked in conspiracy and corruption since their Iran-Contra ties in Mesa Arkansas. Assange, however, has been spot on with verifying his sources and info prior to releasing.

       I know that. Do you not consider that he might have a conflict of interest to elect the person and/or party that he believes is most likely to pardon him? And if you can acknowledge that, how can you believe what he says about that person's opposition? And how can you ignore that Assange is ignoring that person?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to believe Assange is a freedom fighter and whistle blower. I'm also willing to believe Assange has nefarious plans which include him being pardoned. Why are you only willing to believe the former?

       Get over it.  Assange has leaked information on several countries, including Russia.  Nothing has ever been proven to have been tampered with or false. Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.

        It doesn’t strike me as a good idea for a group that relies on its credibility when it comes to the authenticity of what they publish — and which thus far has had a stellar record in that regard — to be making boastful claims that they published forged documents. I understand and appreciate the satire, but in this case, it directly conflicts with, and undermines, the primary value of WikiLeaks.

       It has been proven now that most of the media is colluding with HRC now.  And technically, you or I, can log into a Russian server via VPN and break into a computer and make it look like the Russians did it.   That doesn't necessarily mean I am in Russia.  I have seen too much now...  I have read thousands of emails, I was there when stonetear was outed, and I am intelligent enough to see the bigger picture.  See you are hung up on Assange and wikileaks when there is a big hairy ugly monster hanging right above your head.

       Not necessarily, but the fact that the idea that these emails could be doctored isn't discussed here is shocking to me. If the roles were reversed and the DNC or RNC were spouting off about things Assange had said/done, wouldn't you question them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying WikiLeaks is nefarious, I'm just surprised with all of the farfetched theories that you see that you don't see this one. Does no one wonder what Assange has to gain from bringing down the DNC?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I'm not good at theorizing, but there are plenty of people that are and I'm surprised those people seem so one sided on who they're choosing to theorize on.
