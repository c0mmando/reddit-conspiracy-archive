        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve read this over many times now, and the more I read it the more that things become even more clear. This really really feels like a hitman or middle-man contacting Podesta regarding down payment, payment, plans and characters in the assassination of Justice Scalia. Another reddit user found this, posted it on reddit and deleted it. But I copied his original text before he deleted it and saved it. The following is a copy of this user&#39;s find. </p>

<p>&quot;I have proof of the hit contract they put out on Scalia. They being Podesta. I believe I have found proof in the wikileaks emails, specifically this one </p>

<p>(<a href="https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a>) </p>

<p>which seems to be detailing a &quot;movie&quot; contract for Podesta to pick up? But he&#39;s not a film producer. What could this be? Wet work codespeak? Yep. Includes even a map. They had a contract out on Justice Scalia. I found the &quot;order&quot; in the emails disguised in a subtle request for &quot;funding&quot; for a &quot;film idea&quot;. The cost, $1.5 million dollars down, $15 million on completion of the hit.
They were so brazen that they even sent a URL to a map showing a line to the location in texas where the ranch is that Scalia died......they used a smithsonian map to mark the spot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html">http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s the map URL as it was sent in the email to Podesta (seemingly responding to the contract request)......with the line showing precisely where they would do it at.....the ranch in west Texas and how they would escape, to Mexico through Tecate. Here&#39;s the wikileaks email Podesta was sent:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a></p>

<p>There it is, a contract to kill a supreme right there in CIA codespeak with a cute little &quot;movie&quot; pitch idea that went like this
&quot;I have the script, the budget and a producer for this 2016 political, game changing film project - funding is needed. You would be in charge of the content and selecting the producer.&quot;
But again, Podesta is not a film producer. You&#39;re welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>My original thread regarding this with other emails and news articles is found here - </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good job, there is definitely something fishy about that email. It is rife with code speak.</p>

<p>HOW could a &quot;budget film producer&quot; make a &quot;game changer&quot; for 2016 for $1.5 million? Sounds like a covert op.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe this important film is deserving of the services of a major producer, However, Ken Del Conte is an expert in producing low budget features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conte&#39;s third top movie when you look him up on IMDB is Death Calls (2010) whose plot reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An action-packed love story on the Mexican border featuring oppression, revenge, reincarnation and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Smithsonian map points to the place of dispute at the Mexican border...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the script, the budget and a producer for this 2016 political, game changing film project - funding is needed. You would be in charge of the content and selecting the producer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that mean Podesta would be in charge of the &quot;exact location&quot; (Cibolo Creek Ranch) and selecting a &quot;proper host&quot; (Poindexter) who would go along with the whole thing?</p>

<p>Dunno just trying to piece together the cryptic doublespeak. This is not a film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>his facebook bio says that the movie he&#39;s planning is one where Mexico becomes a state of the US:</p>

<p>SCREENPLAYS: 1. INEZ COMES TO AMERICA - action/adventure - a stand alone, exciting story; with an alternative ending that will ignite a spirited debate regarding the benefits of &quot;Statehood&#39; for Mexico. </p>

<p>In the (alternate) ending, our male lead; who is a part time Border Patrol Agent/law student, runs for congress. He lays out the benefits of the U.S. and Mexico merging as one Nation. </p>

<p>The traffic will now flow South for the economic boom in our new territory of Mexico.</p>

<p>If Mexico were to become four new states protected by the American flag, the drug cartels and the political corruption would be eliminated. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I just completed a complete review and polish of the script with the paid assistance of award winning N.Y. producer/script consultant, Lee Levinson. It was seven hours on the telephone, going line by line to make the script &#39;production ready&#39;, complete with prompts for the auto manufacturers to promote their vehicles. Lee claims that for film professionals - reading a script in this format is like seeing the film.</p>

<p>All of the people, previously referred to as illegal would now become legal - but watch what happens next - the people who are established with family, friends and good jobs will most likely remain. </p>

<p>The rest, possibly 75% of the 11 million estimated total, would go back home, because that is where most of the new jobs will be and where their family and friends are. </p>

<p>We would then welcome and fast track to citizenship the world’s most talented young engineers, doctors, teachers, hi tech people, investors and speculators. We are the world’s melting pot.</p>

<p>An enormous economic boom would be ignited, solving immigration, budget and social security issues and the smaller border at Guatemala will be easier to secure. </p>

<p>Our final Hispanic ethnic balance will be in the low 20% level. It is now 37% in California and Texas and working well. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t remember or might not have heard about our war with Mexico and - The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which forced Mexico to accept $15 million for all this land. - one dramatic scene brings this to light. </p>
