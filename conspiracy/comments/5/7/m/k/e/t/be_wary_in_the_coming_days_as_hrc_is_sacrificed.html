       Maybe after a revolution there will be a third party but trying to go third party now is just voting for a democrat (by removing a republican vote). 
With all the fraud don't you thin they have the 3rd party already nixed? I didn't want Trump but Hillary is 100 times worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really wanted to make your vote count and not vote for Trump you should have become a democrat and do a write in for Sanders. then neither Trump or Hillary gets the benefit of your vote.

       Trump has a Neo-con as his VP. They are our enemies as well. It has been pretty much confirmed he was going to give Kasich the keys to his policy decisions. He has given that to Pence now. Maybe Pence is not as much of a Neo-Liberal as Hillary but he is definitely a Neo-Con like her. Trump is just a figure head. You also need to look at his cabinet choices. They are going to be same crony capitalist goons that we have running the show right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only two choices, IMO, are revolution or voting in a 3rd party and hope that we can get some extra funding during the next cycle.

       I just hope our country survives until we get to the next cycle. I had fully expected the country to get fed up with the BS in Washington and figured it would show in the next 8 years or so. I was a bit shocked it showed up now in the form of Trump.

       That's not a plan.  Voting for Trump can only be interpreted as supporting him. You don't get to attach nuance to your vote. Once it's counted, that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if enough people vote for neither of them, then we have a legitimate basis from which to argue that they are ruling illegitimatly. Overthrow whoever gets elected in this rigged cycle, by a popular nonviolent uprising based on actual arguments, and reform the voting system.  Do not give in to the false forced choice because that only validates the system.

       A 3rd party vote this election is basically a half vote for both of those candidates. If there's any election to pick one of the main parties, it's this election for sure. A vote for is also a vote against.

       This mindset is the only thing keeping the duopoly in power. I've heard this line during every election since I was old enough to pay attention; "maybe next election you can vote your conscious, but this election you have to vote against X"

       43% of Americans identify as independent. But they all listen to their friends that keep spreading the lie that voting third party is casting a vote for 'the enemy'. Stop it. You are helping to perpetuate the oppression we all want to get rid of.

       IF what is already known isn't enough, then what could be unknown to be enough? You could have video footage of Hillary gunning down black children of some remote african tribe while taking a strap-on to Huma Abadin and calling all women deplorable and the feminists would still think she's their champion.

       I'd like to think so but I think it's just certain political pundits on both side using this very unique time in history to attract as many eyeballs and make as much money as possible from the lookieloos. It's like church-goers waiting for the Apocalypse every week now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I think it'll be much more predictable and staid: Hillary wins by 8-10 points and runs an extremely destructive campaign as POTUS for at least 4 years where the liberal MSM defends the crap out of her policies every step of the way.

       I hope it's all coming these next two weeks. But I mean if you would've asked me three days ago, I would've told you there's nothing that can stop Hillary. But I think these people really have some shit that will lead to mass unrest if Hillary is not removed. I hope they have enough info to take down the media too

       Hey, man. I'll be happy as hell if these leaks lead to a bomb that takes down Hillary. I just don't see it happening. I'm much more cynical in regards to the corruption and political machinations brewing within the MSM. All we can do now is be aware of its existence but I think the book is already written as far as Hillary becoming POTUS.

       Sorry I'm just linking you to Reddit shit but I have a feeling wikileaks and James O'Keefe were one step ahead of them. I think the Clintons were very sloppy with their communications and their ruthlessness and Assange and O'Keefe have proof that will take her down and wake the people up. I think the media will be held accountable and I hope maybe in the future there will be laws to prevent manipulation by the media. Who knows. Obviously this is just my last hope. Either way, things are going to get ugly very quickly if Hillary becomes president. With trump out of the picture and Hillary in office, the people will not put up with her. Her and her family and friends have become too sadistic and evil for their own good and the people can see it without trump blinding them. And Hillary will go to war with Russia as soon as she gets the chance.

I will give you a clue: "The missile strikes began three days after Clinton was called to testify before a grand jury during the Lewinsky scandal"

       Read this. This is what I'm talking about. But Obama is likely the kingpin holding them back and they will expose his involvement a couple days before the election.

       Okay I've read that post (thank you though) but where is Obama implicated, I understand he has possibly lied about the timing of his knowing of Hilary doing certain shady shit like that?

      <p>
       But what is going to bring down Obama and his "record high approval rating"?

       The reason FBI Comey did not indite Hillary is because he knew it would lead to Obama being exposed. The 33,000 emails deleted are between Hillary and Obama doing very corrupt things. That post has some more predictions regarding videos and Bill Clinton rape confirmations and election fraud and so on. It is all coming together. All the different facts, coincidences, and predictions are all lining up and will be executed between Monday and the election. I am hoping it will give reason for impeachment and serious reform.

       "Ahhh I see said the blind man". What a bitch out by Comey, I don't respect that decision even if it would cause us to look 'weak' on a international stage, as a nation we have freaked out on a President over much much less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought his decision was purely based upon being him being interwoven with H, but that is sooo much more interesting, I wonder the specifics on Obama because as of now his legacy is relatively untarnished in the public eye and I get such a large feeling that he really does care and take pride in his "legacy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how much I believe a tape of Bill will be released but I totally the election fraud being wide open, I'm still worried these two assholes are "too big to f(j)ail" and nothing will really get done because of who and what they know within our government...

       I mean the reason Comey said not to indite was because they didn't do it with knowledge or on purpose. But it's been proven now that they did have intent and FBI executives have come out saying that everyone was down to take out Hillary and everyone was pissed when Comey made his executive decision to not indite.

       The Clintons and their bosses have trillions of dollars riding on their house of cards. And a lot of it is going to be exposed in the next two weeks. I doubt it will all get resolved but like I said, we will wait and see. There is just so much that I have watched, read, and studied the last months with the leaks, connecting the dots, and it is pretty obvious that wikileaks and the trump campaign have been one step ahead and waiting for the "last two weeks" to systematically crush them without a chance to recover before the election is supposed to take place. The Clintons are crumbling by the day and are supposed to be finished by the election. We will see how it plays out.

       WSJ is super tame right now. They aren't putting it in the news section, they're putting it in the opinion section. The first 80% of the article is discussing the "Russians", and the last 20% covers the leaks, but only the least damning.

       We want a fair election, and so far we have not had that. To make matters worse, it now appears the electronic voting system is compromised in a presidential election where the leading two of the four candidates are running such conspicuous activities as to prompt grand jurys to properly weight in. The way I see it, the only way to make this election fair is to move to indict Trump and Clinton, thereby permitting a short time for the nation to validly consider all parties as a winnable option, both electoral and general.

       An ama by James O'Keefe stating he has video proof of election fraud and other damning evidence. Wikileaks has been waiting until the last two weeks to dump the rest of their stockpile including emails between Hillary and Obama. They will be taken down. Systematically and with purpose

       Don't forgive until they are legitimately repentant, and I mean
       <em>
        repentant
       </em>
       . It's a mistake (which some of us have to learn the really hard way), to "forgive and forget" too easily, while there are actual psychopaths out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, psychopaths have no conscience. Everything they do is a matter of what's convenient and what will benefit them. They don't care if other people are hurt -
       <em>
        at all!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You do no one any favors, least of all yourself, by forgiving too easily.

       Well, if they do this that is the only way to keep everything stable at the moment, which I think is the most important thing considering the scary direction she is trying to go down with Russia. Another important thing to consider is if there is extreme turmoil in the political process here, whether influenced or not; other countries will use it to their advantage perhaps in land/resource conquest since we will be too ensnared here at home to care. If the DNC and the inner government agreed about this and used her as the fall person, it would be in everyone's best interests and the best possible outcome.

       Doesn't make it 100% ok but this might be our best hope. What happens afterwards would be anyone's guess except I don't see a war happening if this is the case

       Where would they turn to, though? All of their eggs are in her basket. It's too late for Biden to swoop in. They hate Trump. It's still in TPTB's best interest to have an obedient figurehead like her running the show, even if most of the country knows she's corrupt. No revolution broke out under George Bush, mind you.

       They are just one of the many rats abandoning a sinking ship. You're right, I expect to see many others disavow her as the leaks keep coming. It's a good way to judge if she's still in control or her grip is slipping.

       Donald Trump remains a danger in the way an authoritarian right-wing populist "revolutionary" can sweep in and become a Mussolini or a Hitler when a country's people feel oppressed and economically insecure by "the establishment". This same story has happened many many times in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now up to the Democrats at the top to realize this, but also to realize that the macabre and corrupt Clintons will not win this election.

       Don't forgive until they are legitimately repentant, and I mean
       <em>
        repentant
       </em>
       . It's a mistake (which some of us have to learn the really hard way), to "forgive and forget" too easily, while there are actual psychopaths out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, psychopaths have no conscience. Everything they do is a matter of what's convenient and what will benefit them. They don't care if other people are hurt -
       <em>
        at all!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You do no one any favors, least of all yourself, by forgiving too easily.
