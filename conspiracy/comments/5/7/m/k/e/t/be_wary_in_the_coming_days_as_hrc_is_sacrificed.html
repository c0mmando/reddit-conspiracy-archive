<p>If you really wanted to make your vote count and not vote for Trump you should have become a democrat and do a write in for Sanders. then neither Trump or Hillary gets the benefit of your vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has a Neo-con as his VP. They are our enemies as well. It has been pretty much confirmed he was going to give Kasich the keys to his policy decisions. He has given that to Pence now. Maybe Pence is not as much of a Neo-Liberal as Hillary but he is definitely a Neo-Con like her. Trump is just a figure head. You also need to look at his cabinet choices. They are going to be same crony capitalist goons that we have running the show right now.</p>

<p>The only two choices, IMO, are revolution or voting in a 3rd party and hope that we can get some extra funding during the next cycle.</p>

<p>However, if enough people vote for neither of them, then we have a legitimate basis from which to argue that they are ruling illegitimatly. Overthrow whoever gets elected in this rigged cycle, by a popular nonviolent uprising based on actual arguments, and reform the voting system.  Do not give in to the false forced choice because that only validates the system. </p>

<p>Like I said, I think it&#39;ll be much more predictable and staid: Hillary wins by 8-10 points and runs an extremely destructive campaign as POTUS for at least 4 years where the liberal MSM defends the crap out of her policies every step of the way.</p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m just linking you to Reddit shit but I have a feeling wikileaks and James O&#39;Keefe were one step ahead of them. I think the Clintons were very sloppy with their communications and their ruthlessness and Assange and O&#39;Keefe have proof that will take her down and wake the people up. I think the media will be held accountable and I hope maybe in the future there will be laws to prevent manipulation by the media. Who knows. Obviously this is just my last hope. Either way, things are going to get ugly very quickly if Hillary becomes president. With trump out of the picture and Hillary in office, the people will not put up with her. Her and her family and friends have become too sadistic and evil for their own good and the people can see it without trump blinding them. And Hillary will go to war with Russia as soon as she gets the chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Ahhh I see said the blind man&quot;. What a bitch out by Comey, I don&#39;t respect that decision even if it would cause us to look &#39;weak&#39; on a international stage, as a nation we have freaked out on a President over much much less.</p>

<p>I thought his decision was purely based upon being him being interwoven with H, but that is sooo much more interesting, I wonder the specifics on Obama because as of now his legacy is relatively untarnished in the public eye and I get such a large feeling that he really does care and take pride in his &quot;legacy&quot;. </p>

<p>Not sure how much I believe a tape of Bill will be released but I totally the election fraud being wide open, I&#39;m still worried these two assholes are &quot;too big to f(j)ail&quot; and nothing will really get done because of who and what they know within our government...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the reason Comey said not to indite was because they didn&#39;t do it with knowledge or on purpose. But it&#39;s been proven now that they did have intent and FBI executives have come out saying that everyone was down to take out Hillary and everyone was pissed when Comey made his executive decision to not indite. </p>

<p>The Clintons and their bosses have trillions of dollars riding on their house of cards. And a lot of it is going to be exposed in the next two weeks. I doubt it will all get resolved but like I said, we will wait and see. There is just so much that I have watched, read, and studied the last months with the leaks, connecting the dots, and it is pretty obvious that wikileaks and the trump campaign have been one step ahead and waiting for the &quot;last two weeks&quot; to systematically crush them without a chance to recover before the election is supposed to take place. The Clintons are crumbling by the day and are supposed to be finished by the election. We will see how it plays out. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forgive until they are legitimately repentant, and I mean <em>repentant</em>. It&#39;s a mistake (which some of us have to learn the really hard way), to &quot;forgive and forget&quot; too easily, while there are actual psychopaths out there.</p>

<p>Remember, psychopaths have no conscience. Everything they do is a matter of what&#39;s convenient and what will benefit them. They don&#39;t care if other people are hurt - <em>at all!</em></p>

<p>You do no one any favors, least of all yourself, by forgiving too easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if they do this that is the only way to keep everything stable at the moment, which I think is the most important thing considering the scary direction she is trying to go down with Russia. Another important thing to consider is if there is extreme turmoil in the political process here, whether influenced or not; other countries will use it to their advantage perhaps in land/resource conquest since we will be too ensnared here at home to care. If the DNC and the inner government agreed about this and used her as the fall person, it would be in everyone&#39;s best interests and the best possible outcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably forgive them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t forgive until they are legitimately repentant, and I mean <em>repentant</em>. It&#39;s a mistake (which some of us have to learn the really hard way), to &quot;forgive and forget&quot; too easily, while there are actual psychopaths out there.</p>

<p>Remember, psychopaths have no conscience. Everything they do is a matter of what&#39;s convenient and what will benefit them. They don&#39;t care if other people are hurt - <em>at all!</em></p>

<p>You do no one any favors, least of all yourself, by forgiving too easily.</p>
