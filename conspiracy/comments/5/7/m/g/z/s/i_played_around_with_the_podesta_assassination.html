<p>I believe he is talking about A bedwetting liberal</p>

<p>Bedwetting Liberal is a derogatory term used to describe people of a political leaning. The term bedwetting is used to denote a hand-wringing, scared, worrisome, pansy attitude, afraid of their own shadows. The term liberaldenotes the love of spending, social programs, handholding and acceptance of such things as illegal immigration and allowance of the same to have all of the social benefits of being in the United States.  </p>

<p>Bedwetting Liberals are generally terrified of Republicans and conservatives. They shriek at the thought of combat operations or allowing the police to do their jobs. They are quick to point fingers, cry to the media and ACLU, and snivel about attempts to maintain US heritage because it might “offend” somebody.  </p>

<p>I think that some were scared that Republicans would question the events and ask questions. Hence, why he called the bedwetters. </p>

<p>Now why is the ledge given (**) well </p>

<p>a small starlike symbol (*), used inwriting and printing as a reference markor to indicate omission, doubtful matter,etc</p>

<p>This is a sign and I believe this email is instructing Podesta that it has double meaning and he trying to be vague and will talk with Poedsta in NH.</p>

<p>His long weekend in NH was the week before the NH Presidential Primaries 
(wmur.relaymedia.com). Which, is no surprise he is a strategist. </p>

<p>2nd email</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:elmendorf@teamsubjectmatter.com">elmendorf@teamsubjectmatter.com</a> </p>

<p>Sounds like it will be a bad nite, we all need to buckle up and double down. I am all in</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com">john.podesta@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard</p>

<p>Both write in cryptic ways and they could still be talking about both the primaries and Scalia. I think Steve&#39;s in straight forward, it means the Dems have to buckle down in NH for Hillary and for the backlash coming from the future assassination. </p>

<p>Yes, Bernie had a pool party in Martha&#39;s Vineyard. But here&#39;s where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>Scalia made headlines in 2015 as read in the story below:</p>

<p>Jerusalem is the Capital of Israel</p>

<p>Scalia was one of three dissenters in the 2015 case of Zivotofsky v. Kerry, which heard arguments that the United States should describe the place of birth of Americans born in Jerusalem as “Israel”.</p>

<p>Americans born in Jerusalem have had their place of birth described on their passports as “Jerusalem” since Israel’s founding. Menachem Zivotofsky, an American born in Jerusalem, had petitioned to have his passport reflect his place of birth as “Israel” instead. The case went to the Supreme Court, and many legal scholars thought the Court would recognize his plea, allowing “Jerusalem, Israel” to describe the place of birth on passports of Americans born in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aish.com/jw/s/Justice-Anton-Scalia">www.aish.com/jw/s/Justice-Anton-Scalia</a> and-the-Jews.html?mobile=yes</p>

<p>So, I bet your asking what does this have to do with anything? Keep reading this explanation of Vineyard from the Bible. </p>

<p>Here the vineyard signifies the Ancient Church, thus the spiritual church, and it is plainly said to be the house of Israel; for by Israel in the Word is signified the spiritual church, and by Judah the celestial church. In Jeremiah:--</p>

<p>Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou deck thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dance of them that make merry again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria (Jeremiah 31:4, 5),</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblemeanings.info/Words/Plant/Vine.htm">www.biblemeanings.info/Words/Plant/Vine.htm</a></p>

<p>Get that? The Vineyard is the house of Israel. Scalia recognized Israel as a State in his dissent and made news about it. Podesta has strong opinions on Israel and Steve E. is Jewish. So, it&#39;s not far-fetched they would get religious reference. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0415/cummings042015.php3">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0415/cummings042015.php3</a></p>

<p>Pool parties seemed straight forward, but what kind? Four years prior the Secret Service was busted for having parties all over the world with prostitutes. Many included pool parties with hookers. 
<a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/03/25/secret-service-prostitution-scandal-one-year-later/amp/">https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/03/25/secret-service-prostitution-scandal-one-year-later/amp/</a></p>

<p>Wet work is a term they using with Bernie for some reason. So, it can be used in this context and they can point to that fact. But it is also known as assassination. </p>

<p>I see a cryptic message </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think wet works (assassinating) meant pool parties (using a hooker to blackmail family, about death) at the Vineyard(Scalia&#39;s retreat).</p>

<p>Most would be stupid to discuss a murder in email. But they had a perfect cover story that allowed them to discuss it, quickly, freely and from a distance. These people are masters of word play. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Were the prostitutes at Scalias retreat also Jewish?
I believe they used prostitutes as a cover for the family not wanting an autopsy. I don&#39;t think there were actually any. I think the pool party reference was to the Secret Service scandal and what it did to upset the families.  </p>

<p>Why does Scalias retreat become the vineyard? 
Vineyard is a code word for Scalias himself, he recognized Israel (The Vineyard) according to the Bible, in his opinion on a ruling in 2015. </p>

<p>His long weekend in NH was the week before the NH Presidential Primaries (wmur.relaymedia.com).</p>
