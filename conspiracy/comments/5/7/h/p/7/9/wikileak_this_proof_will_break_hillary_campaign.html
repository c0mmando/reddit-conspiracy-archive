       They're talking about how Obama had prior knowledge of Hillary using a private server, despite lying and saying he wasn't aware of it right now on Fox news. Actually referencing the specific emails. I think (hope) these wikileaks drops might actually be gaining traction.

       Bernie is just a nice old rich guy that wants to give everyone free stuff. Only problem is he has no plan to pay for it.
Vote for the outsider, he is the only reason all this corruption has been exposed at all. If this corruption stays and escapes prosecution we are all screwed.

       In case anybody missed the context (the link was at the bottom of the email), Clinton was asked at a New Hampshire presidential candidate debate about the FBI/Apple phone encryption controversy. In the email, Teddy Goff and Sara Solow are discussing whether Clinton's answer makes sense— is there something industry could do that's not a "back door", but would still allow law enforcement to have access to terrorists' phones.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MARTHA RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption. FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.
       </p>
       <p>
        You’ve talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?
       </p>
       <p>
        CLINTON: I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they’re not adversaries, they’ve got to be partners.
       </p>
       <p>
        It doesn’t do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don’t know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
       </p>
       <p>
        And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks — to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks — well, if we can’t know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
       </p>
       <p>
        CLINTON: I just think there’s got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind — blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that’s what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.

       Hell, Windows 10 does this very thing and tells you to go fuck yourself for your convenience in the EULA, and people, even those who know, still shill for Microsoft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Windows 10 is the most prestigious piece of spy/malware ever engineered and people love it because it's  "free" and fast. If people are willing to surrender their own privacy so freely, do you think they'd be concerned with something like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Value for personal privacy is at an all time low. Yet, it seems to be a valid excuse to initiate nuclear war with Russia when it is the search light catching the worms of big politics.

       The evidence against the corrupt cabal is piling up, and it will get to a point where the evidence will be overwhelming - a critical mass - and eventually virtually all media outlets and social media platforms will just release the floodgates because they'll want the viewers, clicks [etc] ruling over their own partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't look at the sheeple and think, wow nobody cares, so I won't either. That's not going to affect the change you (seem to) want. We need to keep working to spread the word, even through discomfort and awkward social silences.

       I hope you're correct, but I don't believe you are. Not after that press conference with Comey concerning Clinton's indictment (or lack thereof).

       I've never seen such a bold declaration of compromised corruption even in a Hollywood film. If it were in a film you'd lose interest on the spot because it would be far too sensational to even be believable as a plot piece.
