    <div class="md"><p>In case anybody missed the context (the link was at the bottom of the email), Clinton was asked at a New Hampshire presidential candidate debate about the FBI/Apple phone encryption controversy. In the email, Teddy Goff and Sara Solow are discussing whether Clinton&#39;s answer makes sense— is there something industry could do that&#39;s not a &quot;back door&quot;, but would still allow law enforcement to have access to terrorists&#39; phones.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4156144/democratic-debate-third-new-hampshire-abc-transcript/">http://time.com/4156144/democratic-debate-third-new-hampshire-abc-transcript/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARTHA RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption. FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.</p>

<p>You’ve talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?</p>

<p>CLINTON: I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they’re not adversaries, they’ve got to be partners.</p>

<p>It doesn’t do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don’t know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.</p>

<p>And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks — to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks — well, if we can’t know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.</p>

<p>CLINTON: I just think there’s got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind — blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.</p>

<p>So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that’s what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.</p>

<p>Windows 10 is the most prestigious piece of spy/malware ever engineered and people love it because it&#39;s  &quot;free&quot; and fast. If people are willing to surrender their own privacy so freely, do you think they&#39;d be concerned with something like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, building blocks. </p>

<p>The evidence against the corrupt cabal is piling up, and it will get to a point where the evidence will be overwhelming - a critical mass - and eventually virtually all media outlets and social media platforms will just release the floodgates because they&#39;ll want the viewers, clicks [etc] ruling over their own partisanship. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t look at the sheeple and think, wow nobody cares, so I won&#39;t either. That&#39;s not going to affect the change you (seem to) want. We need to keep working to spread the word, even through discomfort and awkward social silences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re correct, but I don&#39;t believe you are. Not after that press conference with Comey concerning Clinton&#39;s indictment (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen such a bold declaration of compromised corruption even in a Hollywood film. If it were in a film you&#39;d lose interest on the spot because it would be far too sensational to even be believable as a plot piece.</p>

<p>Yet, here we are. They have no reason not to openly flaunt their corruption. NOTHING will happen.</p>

<p>How is the evidence not overwhelming now?</p>
