    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it does matter.</p>

<p>Someone wants to start WW3, to setup a one world nation. </p>

<p>If they cannot have war with Hillary, it will be EMP with Trump, it will cause FEMA to go around USA and take everyone&#39;s guns, most likely imprison anyone seen as a threat (which will be most males), will allow NATO troops to move in, they will likely start depopulation at this point too, a lot of displaced/missing people would happen during this type of event, would be easy to shoot 2/3 of all people you &quot;arrest&quot;. </p>

<p>Wouldnt ctr contribute to other subs to look official if it was new?
Now ill call you out, what led you to the conclusion that im a shill? Because my posts have been critical of and questioned the onesidedness of this sub? 
None of my posts have ever defended hillary, dont get that twisted. The internet is compromised.</p>

<p>They are controlling all of us, everyone who thinks they aren&#39;t being controlled, even people who think they are too strong, etc, are all being controlled. They learnt this through MKultra, yea, a massive part of the program was a failure, the actual physical part of it, when they got into radio signals, extremely low frequencies, etc, they figured it out.</p>

<p>EDIT: I guess this will be considered fear porn? Honest question, did it scare you to realize that you could be manipulated/hypnotized? It scared me to learn that I could be, it is something that can happen that we are completely unaware of.</p>

<p>DOUBLE EDIT: For those who read this and know about hypnotization, what I have submitted works on ANALYTICAL, AND NON-ANALYTICAL PEOPLE, which is a scary thing, as a real hypnotist cannot hypnotize me as I am analytical, but these are able to pass something the hypnotist cannot, meaning it is able to also target analytical people. </p>

<p>(In hypnosis, most people who are able to be hypnotized are considered non-analytical, the ones who cannot be hypnotized, are considered analytical, as they are just too logical, they just think differently, or use a different part of their brain, the true classification between analytical and non-analytical has not been defined really in terms of hypnosis)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are more worried about hiding the fact we are just genetic material used by aliens that have had their genetics damaged through many years of incomprehensible space travel. This entire system is a facade.</p>

<p>We are locked in our physical cages, 666 means carbon 6 electron, 6 protons, 6 neutrons, cutting of the silver cord (seen during astral projection) free&#39;s us from reincarnation, from having our vibrations/energy stolen.</p>

<p>Our souls seem to have come into existence on accident, when these advanced aliens decided they needed to create usable genetic material. There seems to be physical beings that want us for genetic material, but there also vibrational vampires that have every desire to put you into specific emotional states, to absorb your vibrations. </p>

<p>We exist on accident, not our bodies, but our souls. Through this creation we still have the ability to escape to the original source that created it all. First is a distraction from simple physical things around us, the farming, the hybridization (they created us, so in the end they would be implicating their creation into their being, I don&#39;t know if you could consider that hybridization), then the spiritual distractions, heaven, hell, etc. What we know is we have a physical body, that is attached to a body that is vibrations/energy, that is connected by a chain, why is the chain there? The chain could be seen as something to hold you in place, it could be something to make sure you don&#39;t get lost, etc, but the likely hood is that reincarnation is the process of rebooting, rebooting the vibrational being, to be reused like a battery.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy how little we truly know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird, all I know is that Jupiter is a giant chunk of metallic hydrogen, but just like how the sun dictates physical life growth, Jupiter may have affects we cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>Hot plasma hydrogen vs cold metallic hydrogen...</p>

<p>EDIT: Will be using this post as a place holder for info I find.</p>

<p>Ionized hydrogen= stripped of electrons, just think hydrogen nucleus, our sun is mostly this, with the helium collecting in the middle, once it has finished with like 70% of the hydrogen, it will convert into a red giant, letting the insides fight it out to fuse to whatever, etc etc. EDIT: Revision here: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction</a> is what is occuring, it is protium, 1 electron, 1 proton, no neutron. :
The main fusion reaction in the sun is the proton-proton chain reaction, which takes six protons and produces two protons, one alpha particle, two anti-electrons, and two electron neutrinos. Basically protium. </p>

<p>Released: Positrons, neutrino&#39;s, gamma rays, and at the end, 2 protons.</p>

<p>Energy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of the two protons and the 4
2He
 from pp-I reaction) increases the temperature of plasma in the Sun. The suns thermal energy exists due to gamma rays, and kinetic energy, it&#39;s motion. </p>

<p>Neutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and therefore do not help support the Sun against gravitational collapse.</p>

<p>Just like the Sun, Jupiter&#39;s inner core is NOT hydrogen, the other parts are, although different the sun, the first 28% radius or so of sun is where the fusion (this was edited) is in the Sun, Jupiter&#39;s hydrogen sits differently/lower/closer to core, obviously due to a lack of motion, likely. </p>

<p>Basically: sun releases Positrons, neutrino&#39;s, gamma rays, and at the end, 2 protons. Heated by Gamma rays and kinetic energy, and released as the kinetic energy of the particles. </p>

<p>More to come, again. Now onto Jupiter, the failed sun.</p>

<p>Do you know where it is in....... which state?</p>

<p>Do you know the park it‘s next to?</p>

<p>Or the amphi-theater close by??</p>

<p>Shh, just some basic questions. </p>

<p>i won‘t reply to any response that you give me.</p>

<p>I ONLY said this to imply you do not know trump either, so stop acting like you do. </p>

<p>A little frame of reference, leona helsmley. I am old, i may have mis-spelled her last name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird, all I know is that Jupiter is a giant chunk of metallic hydrogen, but just like how the sun dictates physical life growth, Jupiter may have affects we cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>Hot plasma hydrogen vs cold metallic hydrogen...</p>

<p>EDIT: Will be using this post as a place holder for info I find.</p>

<p>Ionized hydrogen= stripped of electrons, just think hydrogen nucleus, our sun is mostly this, with the helium collecting in the middle, once it has finished with like 70% of the hydrogen, it will convert into a red giant, letting the insides fight it out to fuse to whatever, etc etc. EDIT: Revision here: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction</a> is what is occuring, it is protium, 1 electron, 1 proton, no neutron. :
The main fusion reaction in the sun is the proton-proton chain reaction, which takes six protons and produces two protons, one alpha particle, two anti-electrons, and two electron neutrinos. Basically protium. </p>

<p>Released: Positrons, neutrino&#39;s, gamma rays, and at the end, 2 protons.</p>

<p>Energy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of the two protons and the 4
2He
 from pp-I reaction) increases the temperature of plasma in the Sun. The suns thermal energy exists due to gamma rays, and kinetic energy, it&#39;s motion. </p>

<p>Neutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and therefore do not help support the Sun against gravitational collapse.</p>

<p>Just like the Sun, Jupiter&#39;s inner core is NOT hydrogen, the other parts are, although different the sun, the first 28% radius or so of sun is where the fusion (this was edited) is in the Sun, Jupiter&#39;s hydrogen sits differently/lower/closer to core, obviously due to a lack of motion, likely. </p>

<p>Basically: sun releases Positrons, neutrino&#39;s, gamma rays, and at the end, 2 protons. Heated by Gamma rays and kinetic energy, and released as the kinetic energy of the particles. </p>

<p>More to come, again. Now onto Jupiter, the failed sun.</p>
