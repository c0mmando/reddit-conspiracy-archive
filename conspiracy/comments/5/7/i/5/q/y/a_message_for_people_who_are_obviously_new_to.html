<p>Great examples.</p>

<p>We like to discuss constructively events that occur, have crazy theories, etc. Basically, you are here performing a job, and it is painfully obvious, and is ruining reddit in a whole, but more importantly to me, this subreddit.</p>

<p>This has to end, when half of you don&#39;t get payed, I would hope at least a few would respectively divulge everything and apologize for their actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf do you people expect to happen this week?  These Podesta leaks contain a fair amount of confirmations of conspiracy to steal elections, propagandize on Reddit, cover-up political collusion, media collusion, etc.  Just because it&#39;s all revolving around one particular candidate doesn&#39;t mean a single narrative is being pushed.  </p>

<p>If you ask me, the fact I keep seeing dumb posts like this posted two or three times a day tells me it&#39;s folks like you trying to control a narrative and squelch what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about how there is alot of political stuff that does not belong in this subreddit currently, there are email leaks, etc, which are what are wonderfully acceptable here, but when you have shit like this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57h48a/we_cant_lose_here_we_have_to_do_something/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57h48a/we_cant_lose_here_we_have_to_do_something/</a></p>

<p>This is tame compared to some of the other I have seen, basically trying to fish for peoples opinions, trying to give idea&#39;s/try to manipulate their understanding, etc etc. The issue I am having is that what they are trying to do is basically political, it&#39;s fine if you want to discuss trump sucks or hillary sucks, or donkey for president would have saved USA, but do it in the appropriate subreddit (r/politics).</p>

<p>That sub is taken over though, so it is spilling here, it is horrendous. </p>

<p>The hollow point joke was just misleading, was honestly there to just be random. It fit the context of the conversation, but not what I actually ment, lo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a facade, it is something that gives us an illusion to be at peace. The government is political, there are parts within it that are great to to talk about in r/conspiracy, like the recent email leaks, clinton foundation, etc, but the second you start trying to shape people&#39;s opinions, either through bias opinion, asking questions, etc etc, your better off going to r/politics. </p>

<p>What fucking idea am i pushin, that there is a psychological operation with both hillary and trump involved? A FUCKING CONSPIRACY? yes, this shit happens. 
Believe what you want. I have a job and its not on reddit...
You people are jerking off over anti hillary memes while she keeps on cackling on... Trump could have taken her down, but he doesnt. 
She was promised this election. Sadly i dont think anything can stop her. She played all sides..</p>
