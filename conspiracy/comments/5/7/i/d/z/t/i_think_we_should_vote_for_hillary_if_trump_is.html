    <div class="md"><p>The new emblem of the government that rises from the ashes of the old could just be a phoenix instead of a bald eagle. Maybe the people of that nation can look to that emblem every day and remember exactly what that means and they wont have to burn what they made down to start it anew. Where there is crime, and corruption there should be a purging fire. If that means a collapse of what is now then so be it. I am not so sure that it would because the US can be stronger than it seems. It was when it stood up to the great world power that was England. It was when it stood up in world war 2. People talk about this country like it is just some land on a map or just an idea. This country is the people living in it. Together we have strength that has stood strong against the odds before. We are our government not a bunch of corrupt people at the top. Those people can all be replaced and our government will still be here. We the people give our government the power. It will stand for as long as we see fit.</p>
