       Not saying you're wrong just legitimately curious. Why can we not go to Mars (I didn't study a science field and kind of just believe everything NASA says about space travel). Could you give me an ELI5 real quick?

       Everything NASA says is true.

       They definately dont steal money from tax payers and in return give you CGI pictures of missions they fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of your money definately doesn't go towards the rocket fuel and production of an elaborate visual hoax.

       The remainder of the money definately doesn't go towards other things like "wet works".

       No I assumed that there was something shady going on because they're, well, a part of the government so it seems to logically follow that there's some corruption, I just wasn't aware of the specifics. Do you have some links for any of those (you don't have to link each one I'm not calling you on your sources), I'm just interested and want to read up more. What would you think is the most obvious and damning evidence against NASA?

       It makes sense from a financial and military standpoint to fund space exploration and technology. Honestly, what purpose would the government have to make it all up? Math would have to change its fundamental nature in order for the flat earth theory to be correct. According to flat earth logic, 2 would equal 2 at sea level and a thousand miles above 2 would equal 3.57. Otherwise, there is no accounting for the discrepancies in the calculations of light and measurement.

       I would say the parabolic arc the rockets take off and go over the ocean ( it's so you can't see them crash into the ocean )..

       The most damning evidence is how they are caught using pools on "space walks "...

       All space agencies are in cahoots. Things are compartmentalized so there isn't discloser.

       This is why I also believe USA and Russia to be hoaxing this threat. They will war with each other, but it's planned, ultimately for control...

       Sooo, out of curiosity, is there a reason why all these passionate astrophysicists who lie and agree with a cover up of this magnitude? I mean NASA currently employs over 17,000 people and has employed several times that number in the past 50 years. Add to that all the other space agencies around the world, including the Russians who were rivals for most of the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       A cover up that big would be nearly impossible to pull off, and again, what would be the purpose? "Wetwork" can easily come out of the already insanely bloated military budget and wouldn't need NASA as a cover story. Furthermore why would every government with a space program agree to such a coverup? Why would Canada put money in to research for things like the Canadarm if it was all just a sham? Why would the Soviets have gone along with it when it would have been to their political advantage to call out the US as a bunch of liars, I mean its not like the USSR had to justify how they spent their budget to the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I'm on board with some conspiracy theories, they do exist and there is plenty of stuff our governments do that is shady as fuck, but to say every country in the world with a space program is working together for some kind of shadow cabal is paranoid to the point of insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have been infinitely easier to have never started the space race if it was all a hoax, why spend all that money making sham rockets when you can just include it in your military budget in the first place. I mean Fuck, the pentagon lost what? 6.5 trillion dollars it can't account for Why the fuck would they need to fake a space program when that much cash just "disappears?"
      </p>
      <p>
       As conspiracies go I think the faking of space travel is one of the stupider ones personally,  but go on believing whatever you want.

       Well if you are goign to distrust everything they put out, which would include their employee records, then obviously the only way would be for you to go down there and see for yourself. Somehow doubt you'll do that though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you're welcome :P
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: That's the thing with a lot of conspiracy theories, you can believe any evidence that supports your theory, but counter evidence is all just lies to cover up the conspiracy. So it does me no good to give you links to things like their website, or newspapers articles, or univesity presses, because you can just say they are all in on it unless you go down there yourself and count out every person.

       If you use Google Maps at all or any maps for the matter during a busy day or work week, what does this tell you? How can they take images of our world and apply it to something like Google Earth, but they cannot get rockets into space?
