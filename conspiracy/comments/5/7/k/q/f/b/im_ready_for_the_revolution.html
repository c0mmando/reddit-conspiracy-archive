    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but, as has been pointed out many times here, they want you to revolt violently, because violence is the area where they have an absolute superiority. They will crush you unless you can fight them in a non-violent way, like Gandhi did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is kind of splitting hairs, but to be completely honest a full-on revolution at this point is not violent just because it involves killing a lot of people. Violence is technically the unprovoked use of force. When you use force as a means of protecting yourself and your loved ones, that&#39;s called a defensive use of force, and I think it is very important for you to learn the difference. If you engage in the use of force against someone who has done nothing to deserve it, it is violence. If you engage in the use of force against someone who has entered your home with the intention of stealing, hurting, maiming, raping, pillaging, then it is justified use of defensive force. This is an extremely important concept, my friend, that the creators of the constitution understood very well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said.  I don&#39;t agree with killing them.  I think they should be detained in a civil manner, not tortured, but instead held as specimens.  After all, these people <strong><em>are</em></strong> the aliens among us.  Let&#39;s have scientists investigate them and see what makes them different.  Do they have parasites?  Are the parasites &#39;of a spiritual nature&#39;?  How do you eliminate parasites of a spiritual nature?  A: shamanism.  You have healers work with them.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know at the least that they are sociopaths and psychopaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You record everything, methodologies, etc.  You put it ALL on youtube, nothing is hidden anymore.  You put up their MRI scans.  You fix them.  You clockwork orange their shit and you don&#39;t feel bad about it.  If you need a reminder of why you&#39;re doing that because you feel unethical, you read a few top posts of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and then go back to work.</p>

<p>You throw away all laws and all power structures, rebuild them from the ground up by ENGINEERS and SCIENTISTS not politicians.  You build a society of true checks and balances that disallows mutation of our laws.</p>

<p>The constitution is actually good.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re quick to defend it.  We use it and extend it.</p>

<p>The balance of power is good, we&#39;re quick to defend that too.  We use and extend this also, with additional safeguards against being warped by interests.</p>

<p>But who has never been represented are the people.  We need a real democratic republicanism that allows for people to represent themselves if they so choose it, or to volunteer who will be their representation.  </p>

<p>We vote online, securely using something like bitcongresss / a crypto secure, pseudoanonymous, instant-tallyable, peer tallyable / registration validation schema based voting.</p>

<p>We reset institutions with no money in politics, we dissolve their wealth and redistribute it, we clear the parasites and record what we did for future generations.</p>

<p>we start over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though i agree with the assessment of the situation, We The People cant turn to violence w/o being made into insurgent terrorists. A event has to happen that would give a valid reason to revolt. Like assad killimg protesters or provable gov sanctioned  911 event . Police or president would have to hurt civs first or the bad guys are the people. Wait and watch until such a moment occurs. Til then tone down tge violent speech.

    <div class="md"><p>The people would lose in a bloody situation every time. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t control us; we control ourselves. Thinking otherwise is being like that elephant tied to a plastic chair and tricking it into thinking that it&#39;s being constrained. The elite are plastic chairs.</p>

<p>We can only be manipulated if we buy into the mindset of hate. Without hate, there would be no ISIS, or perpetuation of fake wars. Hate is the root of all of our problems right now, and it&#39;s also being packaged and sold to us this election cycle as a tool to get the people to bend to the will of the establishment. Don&#39;t buy into it (not seriously, anyway).</p>

<p>In the usual twisted inversion tricks of those who want power, they&#39;ve tried to persuade people that love is a weakness when it&#39;s actually the strongest tool of reformation. Change never happened as a result of war; it came after the ceasefire in a time of peace. We don&#39;t need a war to get there. Love yourself, love your neighbor, love those who wrong you... and then we will have revolution. We&#39;re all flesh-and-blood humans on that tiny blue dot. Fighting each other is a colossal waste of time and precious energy that could be used instead to advance our species. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a pacifist because hurting another ultimately hurts ourselves in this holographic illusion that we call reality. I look at the events playing out like it&#39;s a tv show akin to House of Cards. My anger towards the status quo is something I liken to being upset when my sports team is losing. I see it as very enjoyable entertainment, actually.</p>

<p>Revolution comes from sidestepping the hate and putting our resources towards what we support, be that a local business, charity, whatever. It&#39;s treating everything, and everyone (including those we &quot;hate&quot;) as being interconnected. </p>

<p>Go in peace. I see anything else as being used as a tool of justification for more war and division. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peacefully. We do not need to fire shots to get our point across, only those who have committed treason should be harmed. After trials. We may question everything, that does not make us savages. If the rest of Americans can stop listening to the programming machine and we were actually United instead of fighting over race and other shit they use to keep us divided , we could take our country back. Peacefully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people feel the way you do. They are just waiting for the opportunity to stand up. Unfortunately, I feel any organized &quot;resistance&quot; will be met with the worst the &quot;authorities&quot; have to offer. It is going to take individuals to make a stand independently from one another. You can really say much more then that or it is considered a &quot;threat&quot;. All good things come to an end and TPTB have been having a good Ole time at the expense of Americans for a long time now. The merry-go-round will break down, it is just a matter of time.</p>
