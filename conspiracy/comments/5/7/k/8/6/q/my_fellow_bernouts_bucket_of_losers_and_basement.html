<p>I implore you future deplorables to go to trump&#39;s site and read every policy he has on there. </p>

<p>I then want you to look at HRC&#39;s rallies during the beginning of the primaries and to watch one now. This women has been shamed into stealing bernie&#39;s ideals, trying very desperately to pander to our vote. </p>

<p>I want you all to remember during the primaries how many of us shared the video of Hillary lying for 13 minutes straight. THIS IS STILL THE SAME WOMAN. </p>

<p>It&#39;s taken me time to realize that trump is the future that America needs. We can not have HILLARY. </p>

<p>AMERICANISM NOT GLOBALISM!!!</p>

<p>Do not throw away your vote to a third party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think anyone who votes whatsoever is wasting their time at best, and supporting all this bullshit at worst. Our votes mean nothing the entire thing is rigged and even if it was legitimate, there is no one to vote for. This picking the lesser of two evils bullshit is insanity on a large scale at its best.</p>

<p>At this point, I feel like partaking in any of this process is just sending the message and supporting the elites and making them think we are still fling for if. Now that it is a well-known fact that American elections have always been nothing but the citizens as a whole getting to feel like they have any say or power over the government. I refuse to have any part in this rotten and corrupt bullshit. </p>
