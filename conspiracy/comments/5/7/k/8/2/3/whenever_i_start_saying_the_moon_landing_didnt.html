    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of being accused of being a shill (especially considering I&#39;m posting more than once in this thread, work in film. I&#39;ve spent summers erasing tapes from an archive so they could be reused back when I was a young intern - plenty of those tapes people didn&#39;t even know what was on them because the machines to read them just aren&#39;t available anymore. Some formats which were once standard now have only a handful of machines left in the world that can read them so people just ditch the tapes rather than check what&#39;s on it. I can absolutely see this happening in a major archive like NASA.</p>

<p>Second, yeah, video acquisition and processing has changed quite a bit, but until the switch to digital tv a decade ago, we were using the same broadcasting tech that very much predated the moon landing stuff. It turns out you just don&#39;t need very sophisticated technology to broadcast analog waves. The tech very much existed to be able to broadcast those images if the landing took place.</p>

<p>The reason why a terrestrial broadcast camera had to record the video feed was because we have two standards for broadcast depending on where you are in the world. These are NTSC and PAL which are fairly similar, but have different amount of scan lines, frame rates, etc. The signal coming from the moon was encoded differently from these standards as it had to be more robust under a very limited bandwidth. This means you couldn&#39;t just capture the signal and broadcast it to any tv, but had to convert it to PAL or NTSC first. At the time, the most common way of converting PAL to NTSC or vice versa was, you guessed it, playing the video on a PAL or NTSC device and recording it with a device that broadcast in the spec you wanted, a sort of crude telecine. It&#39;s totally expected that this is what they would have done with the moon footage.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for holes in the landing, it definitely isn&#39;t in the technical details of the broadcast aspect of it.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I&#39;m a believer in the moon landing if only for the reason that Russia would have had the world to gain by proving it false (as would be the case today or even by China for that matter). All the energy poured into this conspiracy honestly seems like shills trying to distract people from more prescient and real matters.</p>

<p>Funny you should say that, because NASA erased all the original footage of the supposed landings. Oooops.</p>

<p>EDIT: and in case you were unaware...TPTB are not all &quot;American&quot;. They are everywhere. So to say China or Russia would expose them is nonsense. The space programs of the world have been the excuse for billions if not trillions of dollars in taxation for decades now. Money has been a motive, if not the number one motive, for conspiracy since its creation.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a shill, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay because people don&#39;t need to know the truth as much as they need to believe in the lie. The lie is more important than the truth. Even though the lie is a lie, and I hate lying and liars, I know that our world is built upon many lies and many truths.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for me to reconsider the value of truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cool that you think that radio waves can pass through massive fields of radio interference, because... it doesn&#39;t really matter. Shill on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to dig through my post history, but you dismissing me as a shill is no different from someone accepting things at face value. I&#39;ve presented several facts that counter some of your claims. I didn&#39;t even conclusively say everything was real, just that I believed it was and the broadcast ability exists.</p>

<p>EM interference isn&#39;t much of a problem in space except during solar storms which are localized and not constantly ongoing. If it was, it means all of Russia&#39;s, China&#39;s, India&#39;s, ESA&#39;s, etc space missions beyond geostationary orbit wouldn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t just wave your hands around and say &quot;radio interference&quot; when you don&#39;t even understand what that means and how it works. Conspiracy is about looking at facts and using them to deduce what actually happened. This is the field I work in every day and the facts are broadcasts from the moon absolutely were possible from that time. Take issue with the rest of it, but that part is not the place to look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.&quot; - Bertrand Russell</p>

<p>While certainly I am willing to entertain the possibility that I am just too stupid to see that all of the facts and figures surrounding the moon landing somehow add up to something that is even remotely in the realm of feasibility, I am much more inclined to apply occam&#39;s razor and determine that something is, in fact, amiss. Even if I can not identify, with any certainty, the truth behind the highly implausible Apollo fairy tale I still have enough evidence to cast a shadow of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>What I find most endearing about plebeians is how consistently you behave. From an entomological perspective, you are as sturdy and consistent as the ant, always doing your part, always going the extra mile to maintain the integrity of your artificially defined social constructs. It&#39;s like you are of one mind. From an anthropological perspective, you differ little from your ancestors, clinging to the fables and mythologies which contain the elements of self, from which you calibrate and define your collective superego--this idealistic sense of not only who you are as a person, but who all of you are as a people.</p>

<p>I have different goals than you, I am, to you, perhaps an oddity or maybe even a mistake--possibly even something that, according to your mythos, is evil or even bad. But I do not see myself as having a place within the social construct. Rather, I see myself as an outside observer who owes nothing to society, for I was not formed from this society but rather by the ideas and words of those like myself, who exist here and there, all throughout history and who have seen fit to record and preserve their thoughts.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, I am an anthropologist, or sorts, motivated by my own curiosity. My goal is just to drop bread crumbs and watch how the pigeons clamor for them.</p>

<p>If I tell you to dance, you will not do it.</p>

<p>But if I attack your precious mythology, you will go to war, even as the ancient Greeks defended their gods.</p>

<p>You downvote as though it makes any difference, at all, as though somehow you cannot accrue massive amounts of karma easily, by going to one of your many echo chambers and simply toeing the line with irrational exuberance. Although, I suppose that many of you would be incapable of doing this, since you would consider that being treasonous--to pretend to support a cause for the sake of gaining social capital, even though all of your causes are completely arbitrary and from a higher point of view, functionally identical.</p>

<p>Grump on, grandpa. Do your species proud.</p>

<p>I never thought I would see the &quot;no true scotsman&quot; fallacy applied to conspiracy theorists, but there it is.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If a person could simply use a telescope to look at the moon in that level of detail, then that would mean that a basic telescope is as powerful as Hubble.</p>

<p>The rocket that went to Pluto retrieved a tiny black and white image of a far off, distant planet from a distance of 7,800 miles or 12,500km.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of a far stretch to say that we went &quot;to Pluto&quot;.</p>

<p>And even at 7,800 miles we got only tiny, horrible quality actual photos of Pluto, the moon meanwhile is 238,900 miles away from Earth.</p>

<p>To try to help your tiny brain comprehend these distances, a commercial jet liner flies at an altitude of ~7 miles above the earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>A G6 can fly at an altitude of ~10 miles up.</p>

<p>Go grab your telescope and spot a G6 in mid-flight. You should be able to make out the pilot&#39;s face, right?</p>

<p>Cretin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long enough distance that if you actually stopped your retarded shilling long enough to think about it... is a really, really long fucking ways out.</p>

<p>If you see a crater on the moon, you might think &quot;oh, wow, you can see really good detail through a telescope&quot; except those craters are about 185 miles wide, or about 6-7 times the size of the new york metropolitan area.</p>

<p>So, yeah, good luck with spotting the landing gear.</p>

<p>From that distance, you wouldn&#39;t even be able to see the defined shape of a skyscraper. It would just be a dark blob.</p>

<p>You think that a +/- difference 300 milliGals ( 0.3cm/s<sup>2</sup> ) is something that they would be unable to account for while in orbit?  Seriously?  How is this reflected in your comparisons of the trajectory analysis when compared to a gravitational analysis program?  What discrepancies did you find?</p>

<p>No offence intended (I&#39;ll get shit for it anyway) but this is the kind of ignorance that leads to the belief we never went to the moon.</p>

<p>Getting to the moon costs a lot of money, for <em>very</em> little gain. The Moon has a fuck-ton of Helium on it, which in a few decades will be great for cold-fusion, but other than that, we can learn very little from it. Because it was once a part of earth it&#39;s mostly made up of the same or similar materials, and there&#39;s no atmosphere or sufficient gravity to promote colonization. It would literally be easier to colonize Mars than it would be to do so to the moon. At least there you have sufficient gravity, a somewhat dense atmosphere and potential for terraformation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a very simple reason no-one has gone beyond ~500 miles up since the Apollo program: Space is fucking empty. Anything that could be done at 100k can be done at a 100th of that, for less engineering effort and cost. Once you leave HEO, there&#39;s sweet fuck all to see between here and the moon besides the occasional asteroid, which is planned to be visited and would likely be no more if not less interesting than the Moon was. </p>

<p>The Moon was a great place to go once or twice. We learned a lot, but there&#39;s simply no benefit to doing it again and again when you have such high costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is money? If treasuries and central banks can create it with the stroke of a pen, how could there ever be a shortage for any government project? Do you find it funny that they manage the 10 trillion to bail out the banking system, when less than one trillion would have covered every mortgage in 2008?</p>

<p>Hell, a government project to return to the moon would put tens of thousands of people to work in this country. Even if the activity isn&#39;t &quot;economically profitable,&quot; it would go a long way toward making the economy look better; not to mention, it would be infinitely more productive than masking the endemic weakness with &quot;seasonal adjustments.&quot; There are many broke Americans who would gladly participate in such a venture, I promise. We have the resources, I promise.</p>

<p>Like in 9/11, some of the most blatant narrative flaws are in the flight path. Take a look at the LEM and how it engaged/disengaged with the orbiting module.  A vertical launch meeting an orbiting target at 3000 kph, with no inertial guidance system? C&#39;mon, man! And they got this right every time? The video/photo evidence speaks for itself. I would advise you to examine the story a little more closely, if you believe that you are capable of impartiality.</p>

<p>At least check out the video I referenced, the actions of some of the astronauts speak for themselves. Cheers!</p>

<p>*edit- I forgot to mention that the gravity of the moon isn&#39;t uniform (see: mascons, satellite Clementine). How did they get the landings/launches right without the correct gravitational effect?</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s a ridiculous question.</p>

<p>The gravity effect is tiny. They know very accurately where the CSM is. So its speed is irrelevant. We dock things with the space station all the time.

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly wrong and your awesome gravity theory isn&#39;t the smoking gun that you thought would blow the whole conspiracy wide open.  So you do the classic, ignore the fact that you&#39;ve been proved wrong and attempt to question the validity of the source. </p>

<p>I pointed to wikipedia merely as an indication of how freely available this information is.  If you had the mental faculties to do even the smallest bit of research you could have answered your own question.</p>

<p>Just admit that your theory that the LM couldn&#39;t have got back to the CSM is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe me, I have done a lot of research about the Apollo missions, and I am inclined to believe that it did not happen as they say. I would regard the video as the only &quot;smoking gun evidence,&quot; which has, by the way, been debated by skeptics and believers for decades. As far as knowing what really occurred throughout the Apollo missions is concerned, the only people that know are the astronauts themselves. There is no conclusive proof whether or not man has walked on the moon. </p>

<p>I was going to send you a note to apologizing for being smug about Brexit, until I realized the ultimate irony in your situation. In arguing against the banks and the City of London, you are taking up a skeptical view of the information presented by (the most ultimate) authority. The most ironic part of all is that you choose to go out of your way to attack people who doubt the integrity of the information that you hold on a faith basis (on a completely useless topic). Perhaps it is your way of raging against your own sense of futility. Regardless, just like those whom you attack, your only chance of success is to convince people to look at the information with a skeptical eye. Maybe from our correspondence, you can get an idea of the difficulty involved. :)</p>

<p>I served in the US Navy before and after 9/11. Prior to my service, I was a true believer in nearly every mainstream narrative. After getting out, I noticed how convenient certain aspects were for particular contractors and corporations. I tried talking to friends and family and was mostly patronized, laughed off, or ignored. Starting in 2007, I gave up on geopolitical information and focused on the financial/economic. This allowed me to speak of (slightly more) verifiable information with friends and family, and gave me the opportunity to point out how the mainstream narratives diverged from reality. This has had a greater effect; so, I have stuck with this course of proselytizing.</p>

<p>Anyway, you know (perhaps better than I) that Brexit will never be allowed to happen. The British people are have, as a matter of tradition, prostrated themselves at the altar of banking for centuries (just take a look at your housing prices). A simple majority of your lot cannot undo centuries of tradition and structure. If you like winning, just stick to serving your masters in the City and slogging it out with tinfoilers on reddit - at least you have a chance, there.</p>

<p>If you are truly bananas and believe in Brexit, allow me to share two options that sum up all of the possibility therein.</p>

<p>1) Some Black Swan Event will rock the Eurozone and beyond (try Deutsche, Monti Paschi, or Syria/Russia) to the extent that, at this time in 2017, you will be no closer to Brexit than you are today. [Most likely scenario]</p>

<p>2) Brexit is completed, but the results are so bad that it sends the UK into deep recession (and on a trajectory returning to the EU or rEU or EU2).</p>

<p>Remember the nutter who told you so! Cheers!</p>

<p>*edit: I suppose now there&#39;s a third way that you stay...

<p>These things ARE related, Joey. This is true in the sense of the integrity of information. You doubt that things are better since joining the EU... GS has a million charts that say otherwise, plus millions of your countrymen on the dole for free (ProEU) votes. It&#39;s the same story of globalism here in the US... Cloward-Piven style neo-liberal corporate warfare on democracy and small business. Maybe you are just now waking up to it, but it has been in the works for a long time now. Welcome to the party! :)</p>

<p>As to whether I am wrong about the gravity issue, I grant that +/- .01 m/s<sup>2</sup> is not an issue for getting off of the surface of the moon; but, with regards to accelerating upwards to dock precisely with the orbiting module (and no guidance system to correct for this error) I will have to disappoint you yet again.

<p>You are aware that it was sent into orbit and wasn&#39;t just shot straight up to intercept the orbiter right?  Have you done any research into the process whatsoever or do you simply ignore anything that would help you emerge from your ignorance?</p>

<p>Even if that were true, it doesn&#39;t address the main point that there isn&#39;t a lot of scientific interest in the Moon and the effort would be better spent elsewhere.  Ignoring the fact that you apparently don&#39;t know what money is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, a government project to return to the moon would put tens of thousands of people to work in this country. Even if the activity isn&#39;t &quot;economically profitable,&quot; it would go a long way toward making the economy look better; not to mention, it would be infinitely more productive than masking the endemic weakness with &quot;seasonal adjustments.&quot; There are many broke Americans who would gladly participate in such a venture, I promise.

    <div class="md"><p>We can argue until we are blue in the face about the nature of money. It&#39;s not about what I believe; rather, it&#39;s about the experts who &quot;inform&quot; the policies of the US Treasury and the Fed (see: John Maynard Keynes, Paul Krugman, or even Ben Bernanke for evidence). Nice ad hominem, just the same! ;)</p>

<p>With regards to infrastructure and public works projects; I agree that there are projects that could be more useful on earth. Perhaps we differ on these because of the tiny nature of your island. Here, in the United States, we have been known to run MULTIPLE engineering projects at once (crazy stuff, I know). With this in mind, there could be a variety of very solid reasons to return to the moon. Perhaps it could be useful to recognize that your lack of imagination is not the ultimate authority on whether travel to the moon has merit. Possibilities for return to the moon could include, but certainly are not limited to - radioactive waste disposal (because it&#39;s off the earth, duh), resource collection (iron, copper, selenium could be harvested - with no mines to pock the surface of the earth), there&#39;s the scientific merit to permanent research/observation station, and finally, the super obvious military/intelligence benefits (maybe you don&#39;t go there, again, because of your nation&#39;s material insignificance).</p>

<p>The whole point is - just because you lack the imagination or understanding to conceive of the purpose of any thing, it is not necessarily true for the rest of the word. Recognition of this truth makes life more fun and interesting. By the way, I think that was one of the original ideas in the inception of reddit. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, sick burn on the UK there.  Go America!</p>

<p>You know a great way of getting rid of radioactive material? Attach it to a massive rocket/bomb that might explode a mile above earth and scatter radioactive material over half the country. You should work for NASA mate with that kind of advanced thinking.</p>

<p>Far be it for me to argue with someone of your advanced economic understanding. But mining on the moon sounds a teeny bit more expensive that mining on the earth. I mean yes, maybe we could get SpaceX&#39;s next rocket to carry the iron ore.  It&#39;s going to be able to carry 53,000KGs into orbit (granted the moon is about 300,000 km further than that but, whatever).  We mine about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore a year here on earth, so in a mere 37,376 trips  to the moon and back we&#39;d have a years worth of iron ore.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing specifically you could do in your permanent research station on the moon that you can&#39;t just do from the space station or a orbiting telescope, in fact an orbiting telescope or satellite is probably more useful.  The same for military and intelligence benefits.  Unless you think there is a military benefit to being over 300,000km away from Earth? Do tell, I&#39;m sure the military would be very interested.</p>

<p>I think what we&#39;re really struggling against here is not so much my lack of imagination as your inability to think past the first thought that comes into your head.  &quot;Why don&#39;t we just put radioactive waste on the moon?!?!&quot; &quot;Wow passenger_pidgin, you&#39;re so smart, nothing could possibly go wrong.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to be clear, the statement about the material insignificance of the UK was not intended to be an insult, rather a statement of fact. Personally, I think the influence carried by the Empire (past and present) is a testament to the enterprising nature of your people. That history is somewhat valid in this discussion.</p>

<p>Primarily, the UK became a superpower (and for a while, the world&#39;s preeminent power) through the successful administration of law, trade, and finance. Perhaps your inability to imagine debt free currency is due to the strong tradition of debt in your history and thought (loyal subject to the crown, who is a loyal subject to the City). Did you know that the United States used debt free currency to fund its Civil War efforts (see: Greenbacks)? It&#39;s not unheard of, man. Further, the debt based currency system (based on the idea of infinite growth) is wreaking havoc in the REAL and FINITE world where we live.</p>

<p>With the idea of debt-free currency established, perhaps you can then imagine that not every activity needs to be profitable, or in other words, not every endeavor needs to be for the purpose of servicing debt and enriching the banking/ownership class. Maybe that idea is too wild to compete with centuries of tradition; but, I submit that it is a viable alternative/parallel (course of action) to what presently exists.</p>

<p>With regards to the risk of vehicle explosion, again you lack the imagination to even consider a container within the container that would be the rocket. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to recognize that lifeless cargo needs no life support; thus, it can be encapsulated many degrees more securely than human cargo. &quot;I think what we&#39;re really struggling against here is not so much my lack of imagination as your inability to think past the first thought that comes into your head&quot;... Of whom might we be speaking, here?</p>

<p>I know I left out the points about military applications and manned experiments. Just google those questions yourself, and you will find a plethora of ideas (some from military sources, even). A little time spent reading might divert you from insulting those who challenge your core beliefs. Hell, you might even learn some stuff! Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t deny that this depresses me as well to see the world and people around me. I continue to search for truth, as that brings gratitude to me, even it is a disgusting truth that others cannot accept, at least I can try and objectively weigh both sides and try to communicate my viewpoints with like-minded people. </p>

<p>What I also try to avoid is knowing anything for sure. For example, I definitely lean towards the moon landing being a hoax, but I can&#39;t say for 100% certainty. The only thing I know for certain, is I know nothing for certain. Even our senses can betray us. I don&#39;t believe our minds are capable of true understanding, at least not in this plane of reality. I&#39;d like to believe that our consciousness extends beyond this plane though, and higher understanding is eventually achieved through an infinite (as described in this 3 dimensional world) amount of experiences.</p>

<p>Now, with such advancement in tech, pulling off a Mars landing fake would be a lot tougher than the moon hoax.</p>

<p>People also believed in the govt. a lot more back in &#39;69. Since then, Watergate, 9/11, all the false flag shootings (and even the masses who don&#39;t think they&#39;re false flags still know they&#39;re shady in some way). Much tougher to do now.</p>

It&#39;s not as if Cronkite could hop in a news van and drive to the moon to give us a live report.

<p>Unfortunately it is all a lie, and as a result of people buying into the moon landing story, TPTB believe they can get away with any con. They have been using that confidence in their ability to control our perception ever since to milk us dry. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also familiar with the Van Allen Belts. I know they are dangerous because of radiation, but the doses of radiation the astronauts experienced was far from lethal. In lower doses, radiation is non-lethal. </p>

<p>My poor, poor boy... we did go back, many times.</p>

<p>The question is not why didn&#39;t we go back... the question is, <em>why haven&#39;t we gone back, lately.</em></p>

<p>Or perhaps even better, <em>why did we</em> <strong>STOP</strong> <em>going back</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. We could colonize Mars. The moon would be more difficult to colonize due to its lower gravity and complete lack of water. Mars has some water near the poles at least. Mars also still carries a small possibility of alien life. There&#39;s also much more glory in going to Mars as we&#39;ve never been there before. Also the technological innovation it would drive would be immense. We already have the technology to go to the moon, so the technological innovation it would spur would be less than a Mars mission.</p>

<p>I never said anything about a permanent satellite. I was saying that Mars makes more sense as the location for a permanent surface base in part due to its higher gravity. Living in low gravity is bad for humans. </p>

<p>Who said I have zero interest in making communities on Earth work better. I think that&#39;s one of the best things about going to Mars.

<p>Are you saying that they were able to just assume they could do the entire moon mission without ever having attempted anything even close to it, before?

<p>Sure there were risks. The entire crew could have died, and astronauts did die as a part of the space program. But the odds were hardly impossible. The math was well understood and the engineers were able to improve upon their designs over time. They started smaller and built up to the moon landing over the course of a decade.

At the risk of being accused of being a shill (especially considering I&#39;m posting more than once in this thread, work in film. I&#39;ve spent summers erasing tapes from an archive so they could be reused back when I was a young intern - plenty of those tapes people didn&#39;t even know what was on them because the machines to read them just aren&#39;t available anymore. Some formats which were once standard now have only a handful of machines left in the world that can read them so people just ditch the tapes rather than check what&#39;s on it. I can absolutely see this happening in a major archive like NASA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe we have conclusive evidence that DNA or RNA actually exist. I&#39;ve examined the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment that was used to prove the existence of DNA, and it&#39;s filled with holes. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what our genetic information is composed of (or whether or not &#39;genetics&#39; is even a thing) but I am very sceptical of mainstream ideas surrounding genetics.</p>

<p>As for why they would lie about it, I think there are several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide the fraudulent theoretical basis for the billion dollar GMO industry. Even if we assume DNA exists, <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/GE/GE4/DNA-Myth-CommonerFeb02.htm">mainstream science</a> surrounding alternative splicing and chaperone proteins casts doubt on the feasibility of GMO.</p></li>
<li><p>Demoralise the populous, by telling us that our lives are determined entirely by our &#39;genes&#39;. E.g. mental illness is genetic, cancer is genetic and so on. Even though there is evidence that our biological characteristics can be changed through <a href="https://www.brucelipton.com/blog/what-does-science-say-about-mind-over-matter-stuff">&#39;mindfulness&#39;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the false idea of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-matches-in-nearly-all-criminal-trials-for-decades/2015/04/18/39c8d8c6-e515-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html">forensic DNA analysis</a></p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Of 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory’s microscopic hair comparison unit, 26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed so far</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Finally it allows them to hide the fundamental question about <em>where we came from.</em> Evolutionists are the mainstream guys, creationists are the controlled opposition. Neither side is interested about questioning the actual nature of our genetic information.</li>

<p>I agree that 9/11 and the Moon Landings are big lies that essentially hold the American mythology together. I&#39;m not sure how important these stories will be as the &quot;Recovery&quot; continues to erode our situations. From my experience, the easiest approach to opening minds to question long held beliefs is to show the divergence between the real economy and what is reported. If you want to be a real subversive, start producing food/water/other necessities, and trading or sharing with your neighbors. That will get you round-up ready for sure (and not in the Monsanto kind of way).

<p>Talk is one thing, doing things is what will get us done, especially when it is contrary to a narrative and/or strengthens people and brings them together. I think that the downvotes are people who disagree with what you said, how you said it, or the way that it related to the thread. I get them all the time, particularly when I spread my tinfoil beliefs in a square thread. But when I hide my views in well reasoned sentences (and I am lucky enough to squeeze them into pertinent places), I have seen a few upvotes. </p>

<p>Remember that not everyone has the same experience as you, and not everyone examines events the same way that you do. Keeping that (and perhaps some higher goal of challenging peoples&#39; beliefs) in mind in your comments, you may have better success in spreading your ideas.</p>

And digging a little deeper, the telegraph headline is wrong (and the article unclear), further reading indicates the (fairly large) rock was given by the US ambassador privately to Mr. Drees while there was an official (very tiny) sample given by NASA and the astronauts.  Not to champion Wikipedia as a source, but there are plenty of good sources in the reference section of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_lunar_sample_displays">Netherlands Lunar Sample</a>.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like an act of deception, a prank, or an honest mistake from an ambassador acting on his own behalf and not really material for confirming the hoax (when there are plenty of samples in labs that are clearly not terrestrial).</p>

<p>By the way, Netherlands is Holland (roughly speaking), that&#39;s where the moon rocks turned out to be fake</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Testing of the Rijksmuseum &quot;moon rock&quot; in 2009 showed it to be a piece of petrified wood, likely from Arizona. The Rijksmuseum had insured this &quot;moon rock&quot; for ƒ100,000 (€50,000 [$85,000] in 2012 currency) upon its receipt.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think it fits right in line.</p>

<p>All of us on here are very well-educated on the moon landing, and I would bet that between a dozen average conspiracy theorists, we know more about the Apollo missions than any one scientist.</p>

<p>So you know you can&#39;t beat us in an all-out exchange of facts and information.</p>

<p>Therefore, you make an appeal to the audience (the observers reading this conversation) that they should <strong>trust the experts</strong> and turn off their own internal voice of reason, as they have been doing their whole lives.</p>

<p>Par for the course. It doesn&#39;t even disrupt my breakfast, at this point (Bacon flavored spam, eggs, toast and very rich coffee with tons of sugar).</p>

<p>I agree with you that it is important to take a personal hold of knowledge and not leave it to the experts; but, if people can&#39;t have reasonable discourse on their own, then experts become even more necessary (and trusted as &quot;impartial&quot;). I hope this helps. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need a super high-powered telescope to see a faint glimmer of light that is supposedly a reflection off of a piece of equipment that we left on the moon years ago.</p>

<p>There is no optic device on this plane that can see clearly the surface of the moon to a granular level of detail such that you can see the flag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An actual conspiracy theorist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never thought I would see the &quot;no true scotsman&quot; fallacy applied to conspiracy theorists, but there it is.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If a person could simply use a telescope to look at the moon in that level of detail, then that would mean that a basic telescope is as powerful as Hubble.</p>

<p>The rocket that went to Pluto retrieved a tiny black and white image of a far off, distant planet from a distance of 7,800 miles or 12,500km.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of a far stretch to say that we went &quot;to Pluto&quot;.</p>

<p>And even at 7,800 miles we got only tiny, horrible quality actual photos of Pluto, the moon meanwhile is 238,900 miles away from Earth.</p>

<p>To try to help your tiny brain comprehend these distances, a commercial jet liner flies at an altitude of ~7 miles above the earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>A G6 can fly at an altitude of ~10 miles up.</p>

<p>Go grab your telescope and spot a G6 in mid-flight. You should be able to make out the pilot&#39;s face, right?</p>

<p>Cretin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long enough distance that if you actually stopped your retarded shilling long enough to think about it... is a really, really long fucking ways out.</p>

<p>If you see a crater on the moon, you might think &quot;oh, wow, you can see really good detail through a telescope&quot; except those craters are about 185 miles wide, or about 6-7 times the size of the new york metropolitan area.</p>

<p>So, yeah, good luck with spotting the landing gear.</p>

<p>From that distance, you wouldn&#39;t even be able to see the defined shape of a skyscraper. It would just be a dark blob.</p>

<p>These things ARE related, Joey. This is true in the sense of the integrity of information. You doubt that things are better since joining the EU... GS has a million charts that say otherwise, plus millions of your countrymen on the dole for free (ProEU) votes. It&#39;s the same story of globalism here in the US... Cloward-Piven style neo-liberal corporate warfare on democracy and small business. Maybe you are just now waking up to it, but it has been in the works for a long time now. Welcome to the party! :)</p>

<p>As to whether I am wrong about the gravity issue, I grant that +/- .01 m/s<sup>2</sup> is not an issue for getting off of the surface of the moon; but, with regards to accelerating upwards to dock precisely with the orbiting module (and no guidance system to correct for this error) I will have to disappoint you yet again.
