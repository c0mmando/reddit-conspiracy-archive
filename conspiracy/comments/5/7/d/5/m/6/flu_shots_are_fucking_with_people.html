       I've seen 2 people over Facebook complaining that they recently got a flu shot, and are experiencing some pretty uncomfortable side-effects. Stuff like itchiness, feeling exhausted, feeling dizzy and other abnormal ailments. Anyone else see stuff on this, or have any opinions?

       Tradecraft (spy tech) loves two or three part poisons. Alone the substance would be of no import if detected by itself. So you load up the target and when it comes time to terminate the last element is added in the most cleaver way possible, an envelope, an open wine bottle, UPS package. The most diabolical last element can be a
       <em>
        frequency
       </em>
       transmitted over the air. Nano metallic material in the blood and brain would resonate, heat up, you're dead!

       Now, if you authored the Georgia Guidestones, you and your other rich buddies, you'd outdo each other clamoring for the funniest mass extermination you could imagine. You might even put hints in the media and movies, say, zombie movies. What could be better than if the infection makes the victims walking killers (they even have shooter's dummies in zombie configuration). In this way the zombies would do the clean up operation for you, no searching for holdouts or anti-vaxxers (thought we have a list of those just in case).

       A near complete chemically decerebrate person would still have instinct...

       I find it oddly interesting that people are compelled to slaughter millions of people using extremely clever methods. Are they just bored? Maintaining a plan they vowed to uphold many years ago? A religious mission? I just have many questions.

       The religion in question is
       <strong>
        Self Worship
       </strong>
       mutually reinforced with sludge of high sounding talk, impossible to verify anecdotal family history, made up legend, basically all the trappings of Royalty miscegenation with money lender scum, and dubious scholarshit riven with fallacy, pomp and fashion with bookends of blackmailers and extortionists, with handy quick cash and whores, minors, or lady-boys, and video cameras. For the jaded, snuff. Documented by handlers. The problem of having all the money in the world is finding something that interests the jaded, dead inside, leading, finally to willingness to murder, en mas, decent normal people.

       When you give someone a vaccine, you are giving them an illness. That illness is supposed to become an immunity. But not everyone responds the same to receiving an illness, because nobody shares the same immune system. Vaccines single out the 1 in 10,000. The "unlucky ones".
       <em>
        The weaker ones.

       There's a term for that. It's called negative eugenics.

       I haven't seen shit like this but I'll tell you my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids today are messed up emotionally and act crazy because of it. Vaccines in my mind are one of the main causes (plus sugar and all kinds of other crap they pump into our bodies)
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines have mercury in them, mercury is the 2nd most poisonous substance on the entire periodic table. We are literally injecting it into ourselves in the name of science. I don't know if the flu shot has thimerosal or not but you can bet your ass it's hardly any better. Makes me sick, if I got one of those shots I'd puke on the spot because even thinking about it makes me want to throw up!!!! End this tyranny please!

       This is funny to me. My kids are unvaxxed and fed a gluten free organic diet....and my kids are INSANELY active, curious, off the wall energetic. They have zero illnesses though. Like, they don't even run fevers or have runny noses. They are just high energy balls of life.

       Hell yes that's how we're meant to be I am happy to hear that. Completely agree with your way of life. I agree with breast feeding, I just think there is a more optimal diet. My mother never breast fed me, I don't feel behind because of it, maybe behind with grasping emotions.

        In the U.S., Thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Vaccines with trace amounts of thiomersal contain 1 microgram or less of mercury per dose.

       Which means if you are over 6yo there is no control in place to remove the Thimerisol from the vaccines.

       Yeah fuck the vaccines no one even needs them I bet. They destroy our bodies with malnutrition straight from age 0. Why do you think our mothers have breast milk if we can hardly even drink it today!? It's terrible for us. Our parents have malnutrition and so do we. It's been going on for centuries. Enough is enough.

       It's probably the best thing we can drink(as babies) I don't mean to say it's bad. I just mean that to what it normally is, it's bad. Our bodies are being destroyed right now. Everything in food is in there to give us deficiencies in things we don't even know humans need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is bad because since our bodies are in terrible shape, the products they produce are also not in good shape. We then eat it (Breast milk) and it is lacking of many nutrients. We don't know because the entire population has been attacked, we have nothing to compare it to.

       Many women who are intent to breastfeed for extended periods (over a year) actually are very concious of their diet. Example: I breastfeed my 17 month old daily and I still refrain from caffeine and even pork. All of our meat is grass fed (as is milk) and we eat a lot of raw and fermented foods. Not everyone out there is a mindless being. Especially not extended feeding mamas.

       Listen lady you are reading my comments wrong. I see the confusion but what I mean is, many children don't get breast milk. Breast milk from a nutritious person is very good for you. I said in the comment you replied to "It's (Breast milk) probably the best thing we can drink, as babies"
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that, but where you are missing the mark is. You claim you eat a good diet, what I am saying is - They have taken all the good food and taken it away. Everything good is gone, it doesn't matter if you do exactly what you say you are doing. There is better, they control science. You listen to science for facts. The science isn't true. There are foods out there almost guaranteed are better for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally none of this crap is good for us, our entire environment is polluted. Even if you eat a grass fed diet yourself your milk won't be perfect. The bar is LOW. Just like today your kid could be smart, but the bar is low. All children today are literally on the retard side of the spectrum compared to humans hundreds of years ago.
      </p>

       Our entire earth is likely in negative nutrients, as in. If the ground has a lot of nutrients the nutrients will go into the plants as they grow making them more healthy. We are the opposite, as plants grow the ground lacks nutrients so it takes all the nutrients out of the plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what you eat the entire earth is messed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you're mindless. I am saying you trust this thing called "science" and science isn't right. It's the devils illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congrats on your diet and I do agree your diet is good, but what you don't recognize is I'm saying there are things that are better they have purposely hidden away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana is one thing that alters your brain, well many people see that and think it alters your brain and it must be bad. I see it as the reverse, marijuana is something that changes your brain to revert it back to how it should be. There are probably many foods out there that do similar things. (for example, turmeric cleans your mind) They don't want our bodies clean they want them super mucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good job with eating good food but the war isn't over yet. An alkaline plant based diet is the key to perfect health and they are hiding away all the best foods from us on purpose.

       So... Hunt wild food? Which is expensive as FUCK nowadays. Grow your own food in natural soil? Which a lot of people are doing here in the PNW. Or my favorite is to include wild mushrooms into my diet to boost my gut-health. (I think...)

       Ya I incorporate natural mushrooms too whenever I go on a good solid mushroom hunt. Might be a good day for one tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is there were once herbs all over the earth, just like how marijuana likely grew naturally, and they ripped them all out until they were all gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like they have outlawed weed they probably have outlawed other great herbs in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely eat wild mushrooms though, only good ones like Liberty caps and others I find that bruise blue ;) lol.

       Hey I might going hunting tomorrow too! Good luck! I have been studying my ethnobotany and mycology for a couple years now (being blessed to live around an abundance of things to study), and I overall feel healthier/happier. Could be placebo, I don't care, cause it has been positive for me and the circle that I influence.

       I am anti everything, it's a fat massive control system. Vaccines look good, until you realize why we need them. (The food industry and also crooked people who create viruses) If humans have proper nutrition we don't need anything. The proof is how resilient our bodies are right now in this terrible time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other proofs are the fact that GMO foods are bad for us. All the good foods have been destroyed. Everything good is illegal. Everything bad is pushed on us.

       In my opinion weed is good for these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed is a herb so it naturally cleans your body, it's a really good cleanser even smoked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed has never caused lung cancer without cigarettes being smoked, therefore it has never been the cause. Tobacco is a huge cause of cancer obviously and that's why they always label it "Smokers get cancer" it's not true. Weed has never killed anyone it's medicinal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed expands your consciousness, so while people who haven't smoked see people as dumb stoners maybe. From their perspective they may be seeing more than the average person, for that reason it can go either way. You have to be a person who picks up on their crutches as they go and removes them at will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed basically takes someone who isn't happy and makes them happy. Many people say that's bad. I say it's the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the truth is known marijuana would likely be smoked by nearly everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The negative effects are seeing through the veil. Being lazy, maybe because you are seeing through the veil and you realize happiness lies in being. Many others would say being high, but trust me I am happy being, and I don't need to be high to be happy. If I had never smoked weed I would have never uncovered the matrix IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically weed cleans your body and all imperfection, when the imperfections are part of the programming and shared by all of society it can drift you off course. Where we're going I want to go entirely off course.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you smoke weed for some time and let it expand your consciousness, if you go to magic mushrooms they will reveal things to you, especially the veil. The only sad part about it is, there is nowhere to go after you see through the veil. Once you see through the veil you are basically just yourself there is nowhere to go but you want everyone to get there with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good/Evil are subjective and in the end, if everyone understood the world everyone would not care about good/evil. We are living an entirely Sinful/Evil life so that once we flip back to the good side people are not restricted by, evil or negative things. The only reason the evil has conquered us is because we have been restricted from all the good. If we knew and had good cleansing herbs we could probably eat hamburgers and all kinds of other garbage every day as long as we ate the cleansing herbs. If we all knew what we truly were, we wouldn't let others beat us down. If we knew the problems of the world, we would fix them. If we understood how programming worked, we wouldn't let ourselves be programmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is really evil, except the suppression of Good. So once you know what's good and what's evil you are living inside a game. To everything evil there is a counter, whether the counter to it is used for yourself, for others, or for everyone, is up to you and their willingness to believe and try.
      </p>
      <p>
       This got hella side tracked I hope you understand what I am saying a bit lol.

       Thank you for the write-up. And yeah I'd like to think I understand what you are talking about. I've smoked weed for a while now for a few reasons. Have gone pretty deep with mushrooms. I'm not afraid of death, and I attribute that to a wild trip. But I am afraid of suffering and my loved ones suffering, and I don't think any
       <em>
        healthy
       </em>
       drug can help with that immensely bitter part of reality, in fact I wish everyone peace, no suffering, which is not realistic because of the duality with evil/good. I'm rambling, but yes mushrooms had brought me to base-level and kind of helped think at base-level with only small amounts of influence (mostly emotional) and that's something
       <strong>
        everyone
       </strong>
       in today's world needs. Mushrooms and weed. IMO

       Agreed. I want to try ayahuscha because I've never hallucinated to the point of talking to any entities. But I know they exist, I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone like a week after I took them and in the episode Aliens were zapping this random guy and giving him 500x the knowledge of the average human. That's what I feel like happened to me, I seriously left that shroom trip thinking something was up. Then I followed a hunch I had and loaded up conspiracy sites for the first time. Let's just say it was everything I was looking for and I already knew exactly where to look it seems.

       Me too, DMT in both forms (crystal/ayahuasca) are on my bucket list. I didn't talk to an entity, but when I was
       <em>
        deep
       </em>
       on the mushrooms, I hallucinated a goddess of constellations that was there to comfort me, and force me to feel that what's of most importance is family and friends and the circle of influence you have, however large you make it. It was very powerful, but a lot to take in at 19 years old fresh out of highschool. 3 years later and I think I need a refresher.

       I feel you, I broke through when I was 20, am 21 now. I really want to publish everything I know I feel like I've got a lot of keys. The biggest key is I know how to liberate everyone of any emotional suffering. Probably because I made myself suffer so much thinking so low of myself lol. Now I'm the opposite, ego death but think so highly of myself NOTHING CAN STOP ME.

       I guess I just assumed this was common knowledge?  I'm a mom of 2 &amp; I had the very lucky experience of being able to have my pediatrician (as a child) see my children up until they hit around 10 years old &amp; he retired. I was always concerned with vaccinations in general &amp; he was -like a family member - very helpful &amp; straight forward.

      <p>
       He
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       advocated a flu shot unless a person was immune-impaired. I assumed all doctors were like that. Boy, was I wrong!

       I appreciate your comment. It reminds me of a family member who does the same as a medical expert, and I really respect that. We can only hope that more doctors will be questioning how willingly they distribute a company's chosen "medication".

       In my opinion weed is good for these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed is a herb so it naturally cleans your body, it's a really good cleanser even smoked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed has never caused lung cancer without cigarettes being smoked, therefore it has never been the cause. Tobacco is a huge cause of cancer obviously and that's why they always label it "Smokers get cancer" it's not true. Weed has never killed anyone it's medicinal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed expands your consciousness, so while people who haven't smoked see people as dumb stoners maybe. From their perspective they may be seeing more than the average person, for that reason it can go either way. You have to be a person who picks up on their crutches as they go and removes them at will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed basically takes someone who isn't happy and makes them happy. Many people say that's bad. I say it's the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the truth is known marijuana would likely be smoked by nearly everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The negative effects are seeing through the veil. Being lazy, maybe because you are seeing through the veil and you realize happiness lies in being. Many others would say being high, but trust me I am happy being, and I don't need to be high to be happy. If I had never smoked weed I would have never uncovered the matrix IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically weed cleans your body and all imperfection, when the imperfections are part of the programming and shared by all of society it can drift you off course. Where we're going I want to go entirely off course.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you smoke weed for some time and let it expand your consciousness, if you go to magic mushrooms they will reveal things to you, especially the veil. The only sad part about it is, there is nowhere to go after you see through the veil. Once you see through the veil you are basically just yourself there is nowhere to go but you want everyone to get there with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good/Evil are subjective and in the end, if everyone understood the world everyone would not care about good/evil. We are living an entirely Sinful/Evil life so that once we flip back to the good side people are not restricted by, evil or negative things. The only reason the evil has conquered us is because we have been restricted from all the good. If we knew and had good cleansing herbs we could probably eat hamburgers and all kinds of other garbage every day as long as we ate the cleansing herbs. If we all knew what we truly were, we wouldn't let others beat us down. If we knew the problems of the world, we would fix them. If we understood how programming worked, we wouldn't let ourselves be programmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is really evil, except the suppression of Good. So once you know what's good and what's evil you are living inside a game. To everything evil there is a counter, whether the counter to it is used for yourself, for others, or for everyone, is up to you and their willingness to believe and try.

       This got hella side tracked I hope you understand what I am saying a bit lol.
