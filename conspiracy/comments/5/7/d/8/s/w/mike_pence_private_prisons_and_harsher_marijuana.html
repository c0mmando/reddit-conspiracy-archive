No, I don&#39;t have a Polish or Russian keyboard, so I just put various things in google translate, but say it as I comment (pronounced Chesh), lol. Remember, I&#39;m from the US. I think Trump is 50/50, and he reminds me of Putin. I think we need a strong man like Putin to steer the ship around. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Putin is no savior, but he does love his country and turned it around. You know me, my ultimate goal would be no government, but we need less government and over time, we get there... Maybe my nephew&#39;s kids will live in the world that I think is best for man kind....</p>

<p>i like putin too i think he is way intelligent yeah and he thinks about what is best for the people HE SERVES ... i do not think he is as self involved as our leadership has proven to be ....well everyone is greedy but our leadershp only thinks of themselves its obvious or better decisions would have been made....</p>

<p>i do not think TRUMP is as smart as Putin but at least he is not beating drums of war [like the other DEAD horse ;0]</p>

<p>google translate,....this is clever ... ok so now i am learning polish even better </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say a Marxist, maybe an idealist which is admirable (imo). As for Putin, yeah I think he cares about his country and people. He&#39;s shady and probably has ulterior motives (power and such), and I wouldn&#39;t want to cross him, but I think he is doing what is best for his country (and self). He wants peace and not war, that&#39;s for sure. The West wants war (insane). </p>

<p>You are right though, Trump is not as smart as Putin (also not as well trained or ruthless - We are talking about a poor Russian ex-KGB agent who rose up the ladder, to a wealthy man&#39;s  son). But, Trump is smart, brilliant imo and has dealt with mafioso types. All I know is I see similarities between the two men. Putin is stronger, imo. </p>

<p>As for where I&#39;m from, I was born and raised here. Family were immigrants. I grew up in the lower, moved to Alaska ~a decade or so ago. I want freedom, so I left all behind. That&#39;s the Polish Goral in me. </p>

I was raised with US values, my family escaped persecution from many sides. I won&#39;t get into too much detail, but I have a hand full of assassinated politicians in my family. Go figure. All talked about freedom and liberty. Sanders wants something he&#39;s never lived in, I know what that is, my family escaped it. Bernie may be a Jew, but 100 bucks says I know more persecution than he does. Anyways. Na zdrowia!</p>
