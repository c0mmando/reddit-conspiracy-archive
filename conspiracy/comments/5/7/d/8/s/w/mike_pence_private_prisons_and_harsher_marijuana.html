       I don't see too many people here talking about this. Mike Pence received campaign contributions from GEO Group Inc a private prison corporation. The state signed an agreement promising 90 percent occupancy. Pence sought harsher marijuana laws in order to fill up said private prisons in my opinion.

       cześć, chicky. Well, Pence is establishment. If Trump is playing the Putin game, this choice makes sense. The GOP already hates him. Whether it's reverse psychology is a different topic...

       cześć is hi/hello/greeting in Polish, not Russian. No, I don't have a Polish or Russian keyboard, so I just put various things in google translate, but say it as I comment (pronounced Chesh), lol. Remember, I'm from the US. I think Trump is 50/50, and he reminds me of Putin. I think we need a strong man like Putin to steer the ship around. Don't get me wrong, Putin is no savior, but he does love his country and turned it around. You know me, my ultimate goal would be no government, but we need less government and over time, we get there... Maybe my nephew's kids will live in the world that I think is best for man kind....

       agreed we need alot less government [and someone just called me a marxist .... ive never even read karl marx go figure....;0 but dont think i am illiterate ok cuz i have read alot just not enuf time to finish all the books im still reading...] oooo i thought you like came here after the war [or something] so did you grow up near your mountain or you there now .... i have always lived essentially within what 60 miles or so....
      </p>
      <p>
       i like putin too i think he is way intelligent yeah and he thinks about what is best for the people HE SERVES ... i do not think he is as self involved as our leadership has proven to be ....well everyone is greedy but our leadershp only thinks of themselves its obvious or better decisions would have been made....
      </p>

       i do not think TRUMP is as smart as Putin but at least he is not beating drums of war [like the other DEAD horse ;0]

       I wouldn't say a Marxist, maybe an idealist which is admirable (imo). As for Putin, yeah I think he cares about his country and people. He's shady and probably has ulterior motives (power and such), and I wouldn't want to cross him, but I think he is doing what is best for his country (and self). He wants peace and not war, that's for sure. The West wants war (insane).
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right though, Trump is not as smart as Putin (also not as well trained or ruthless - We are talking about a poor Russian ex-KGB agent who rose up the ladder, to a wealthy man's  son). But, Trump is smart, brilliant imo and has dealt with mafioso types. All I know is I see similarities between the two men. Putin is stronger, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for where I'm from, I was born and raised here. Family were immigrants. I grew up in the lower, moved to Alaska ~a decade or so ago. I want freedom, so I left all behind. That's the Polish Goral in me.

       You're welcome. What you said, kinda makes sense. Language cannot be expressed via a translator alone, though, especially if you speak natively and know slang. Anyways. I was raised with US values, my family escaped persecution from many sides. I won't get into too much detail, but I have a hand full of assassinated politicians in my family. Go figure. All talked about freedom and liberty. Sanders wants something he's never lived in, I know what that is, my family escaped it. Bernie may be a Jew, but 100 bucks says I know more persecution than he does. Anyways. Na zdrowia!

       [just now...its very unsettlingly] i really know it must have come across a little insane but word for word should go back into english in order if you had to reverse it up....i just did not know how else to tell you what just happened....that moments over back to idealistic me and almost not native born you..... i dont think bernie ever experienced persecution until they shot at him in nevada dig? they have been persecuting him this entire year and are still [ i am certain they beat him up before the convention he was bruised there are photos and stories told henchmen with bloody fists ... i think that is why it is so overwhelming for him and scary he loves his family he is like the rest of us sickened by how poisoned washington [and everything they touch like thug mentality that just happened] and try to wake us up to it if nothing else there has never been an election like this that i can remember

       Because your fallacies mean nothing and marxism is always wrong.

       The difference here is that you’re actually a marxist and that you actually need to be deported or imprisoned.

       It bothers me that a politician would sell out the people that they are supposed to represent in order to send them to prison for profit.

       You are not the first person who has told me that they don't care. I can't comprehend that type of thinking. I am glad I don't think like that.

       It's not that I don't care, per se, I just don't believe in government (I'm not voting for anyone). So, whether he is or isn't, doesn't bother me. We are fucked if does or doesn't agree/support X, Y, or Z. Make sense?

       There is a bad element that has a stranglehold on this country. They are scary people. For example I would hate to be on Hillary's bad side. A person could end up dead.

       Deep State runs the show, just like the KGB in USSR. Intelligence agencies working with the banks control the politicians. They have dirt on everyone. Dirt/black mail = power. They are the true controllers...

       Seeing as prior to choosing Pence as his running mate, Trump offered Kasich the position and said "you'd be in charge of foreign and domestic policy," I'd be very concerned about Trump's VP and their beliefs.

       P.S. I live in Indiana and Pence is a dumpster fire.
