       I think it will cause her to not be elected. The tide is turning. I've spent a few days on twitter and there is a vibe there. She is done I think. Short of people dying. I think it will be Trump. I'd like Jill. But that likely won't happen.

       <li>
        <p>
         Trump supporters believing Bernie's was rigged but that Trump is prepared to 'do what it takes'.

       Rebellion is a trap.  If Americans could work together well enough to lead a successful rebellion that ended up benefiting the majority, they wouldn't have to in the first place because they would be able to work together and fix the system through the existing governmental framework that we already have.  If enough people cared in the first place it wouldn't even be necessary.  But majority can't even be assed to go vote in their local elections or run for office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any so called rebellion will be instantly co-opted by the MIC.  Just look at what has happened recently in other countries where america has ran secret coups and installed their people.

       What's coming is a planned economic collapse. No one will care about any of this when a loaf of bread is $45.00 and there are no jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it in these terms: Why do CEOs and the Board of Directors of giant Multi-National Corporations get REWARDED when they run that company into Bankruptcy these days? Because the few people at the top siphon off everything until the firm collapses and then move on to higher paying jobs elsewhere. There are no consequences for them. The more they can steal before the company collapses, the more they are respected among their peers.
       <br/>
       They are doing the same thing with this country. They don't care about you, your politics, your beliefs, or even if you live or die. They care nothing for national boundaries or allegiance to anything other than power and wealth. They are siphoning everything off and will let the carrion eaters have the rest.

       Honestly, I think there's a threshold. There is damning stuff in these leaks and it's a real failure of the media that it's not being covered, but I have a feeling that if something truly spectacular was released, the media wouldn't have the ability to avoid it or they would completely lose whatever credibility they have left.

       I don't think it really matters what crimes are revealed. The public has reached such a point of numbness and impotence that, unless the media decides to champion a cause and harp on it on a daily basis for months on end, they will just quickly forget about it.

       Nothing will happen. The powers that be shall remain so lest the American people pull their heads out of their asses. And we all know that's not going to happen. Not when reality is based on the perception of individuals, most of whom look into the eye of Morpheus and see only the veil which is constructed for them, the dream, the muddled and vague slew of information that seems not to be worth the effort to perturb with the power of free thought. It's much easier to accept whatever information that the subconscious enjoys, whatever the personal bias would have, than it is to utilize our ability to think for ourselves. Now let us carry on talking about the new chevy or the next iPhone, and forget about the strings of the puppet master like good, inanimate puppets are supposed to.

       People think the tide will never turn until it suddenly does. I remember being aghast that people went along with George W. Bush for  such a long time when I couldn't even bear to look at him, but it was a drip-drip-drip and then Katrina hit and he fucked that up and lied to us about it and it was over for him. Done.

       The same could happen to her. It would be better if she wasn't running against Trump, though.

       Bush was a two-term POTUS. It wasn't over - he faced no consequences. He was still the POTUS.
Do you really think anyone gives a shit what the American people think anymore?

       No, actually. I don't. It's clear they do what they want and don't give fuck-all about us. But they are nervous that the masses might rise up. That's why the hammer is going to come down soon. Probably.

       Both parts seem to be using so many lies that the truth will just go under because nobody will recognise it any more in the ongoing shitstorm.

       It is clear that there are a great many rich and powerful people pulling the strings to make this election easy for her. Those are the people who need to go down, otherwise they'll do it again in another election and they won't get caught because they'll be more careful about it.

       I would say substantial evidence of Hillary's crimes has come out, long ago, and more and more continues to come out. Considering that Comey's testimony under oath to the House Oversight committee and HRC's testimony under oath to the House Select Committee on Benghazi directly contradict each other in facts, at least one of them made false claims under oath. This is objective provable fact you can see for yourself with about 15 minutes or less on YouTube. If nobody is prosecuting that, they aren't going to prosecute anything unless the people in charge change. There is an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence that the FBI and DOJ is complicit in the cover up of her crimes, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting on them to change their mind. The only way she goes down is if it's to protect a cadre of other powerful people based on sufficient evidence that they would rather throw her to the wolves than have anyone look any farther in to their respective involvement.
