       I'm kinda starting to worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 99% sure my friend thinks I've had a psychotic break. I told him about what's going on and I definitely came off very worried and panicked. He was telling me to calm down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much the leaks themselves as it is the way they dovetail so perfectly with that FBI anon from July.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just has me worried, and I've started wondering if it actually is affecting my sanity a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, guys. What do you think? Has anyone had a similar experience? Weigh in, help me out.

       Your sanity will be fine. Are you new to this brand new world? If so, you're just experiencing an awakening and realization that the world is one big stage with puppet masters. It's a system shock. Especially with everything going on right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the people whom don't believe all of this stuff whose sanity I'd fret over. They are the ones choosing to live in a false reality and ignore confronting the truth because it may lead to an erosion of their precious comfort zone and "reality" television.
      </p>
      <p>
       Word of advice though; be very very careful who you talk to about conspiracies etc. Not many are accepting of the rabbit hole and the truth it contains. And, if you are in therapy, or seeing a shrink, I'd
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       recommend not bringing it up. I'm currently in counseling, and I won't speak a word of my conspiracy knowledge in that office.

       You're in for a major ride. Stick around here, we have a good community. Donuts and coffee on the left, or an open bar to the right. You choose. The right goes deeper, imo. But take it as slow or fast as you want. Just know. There is a lot of shit out there, and no one has the answers. If they say they do, take it with a grain of salt, but ultimately run like the plague. Cheers, and welcome...

       just remember never to BELIEVE in anything that is not factually proven. This will get you nowhere. Instead consider things on a scale from "very unlikely" to "almost certain". NEVER be certain, this is what discredits "conspiracy theories", and gets your head a bit fucked up :)

       Look, don't worry, I was just like you when the San Bernadino so called terror attack went down, I live 30 mins from it and was home all day. I remember hearing the report of 3 athletic males dressed in military garb...then that afternoon all of a sudden it was a dude and his fat wife....also no cell phone videos of the perps? Shit we have cell phone videos for cops fucking people up, doing narley shit, but no video of this attack? Anyway, I came to this sub and it made me think of things in a whole new way, my pops and bros thought and still think I'm nuts, but once you start to connect the dots, things get creepy.

       Dude, I watched, being fully awake, as the towers fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched as 1 million people marched in the streets of London against Iraq II. I knew there was no WMD (many people did).
      </p>
      <p>
       "But there is NO WMD, it's just an absurd pretext" I'd say. "You're fucking crazy" would be the reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They're going to invade 8 nations in the next 10 years under the 'Bush Doctrine', it's about resources, the gold standard and Balkinazation"
      </p>
      <p>
       Again- "You should get your head checked"
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there any WMD? Nope. Did anyone of my peers ever acknowledge that I called it on the first mention?  "you're crazy"
      </p>
      <p>
       Have they invaded 8 nations in 10 years? Actually I think Yemen, today, is #10 in 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       "See, remember 15 years ago when I said this would happen....."-----"You're nut's"
      </p>
      <p>
       20 years I've been at this. It just goes deeper and deeper and deeper. Right back to Prescott Bush.

       People will challenge your views constantly if you bring them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to have solid evidence to back up any claims you make otherwise you will be written off. I have "turned" many people by being very knowledgeable and backing all my claims up with references. extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you do mention some of your "crazy" "conspiracy theories" in public you're likely to find like-minded people who prefer not to talk about it until someone else does.

       had 9/11 not been an inside job designed to start the USA irreversibly down on the path of remaking the Middle East. So many of the very same deep state actors that were involved in 9/11 are now balls deep into what's going on here as well.

       Good call, never do. You'll end up stuck in there because insanity is classified as "Not trusting the government" I wouldn't trust the devil if he was lining my pocket.

       Very wise advice, not bringing such discussions up with just anyone. I've angered a few close friends recently who prefer the blue pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm seeing a shrink, quite literally. We started dating a few weeks ago. She's inquisitive and probes me on every possible topic and idea, and it's tough for me to express myself without delving into these theories &amp; truths. I'm starting to think she'll commit me one day.

       May I add keep your theories some what sane. Or at the least don't throw something bat shit crazy at the end of conversations when you are trying to wake some one up.  There are so many fucking YouTube videos that all add up than end with some crazy shit like Hillary is a vampire count or some shit like that.

       Breathe, mate. Freaking out is normal, but will subside. I'm not the best role model, I drink enough to kill an elephant a night. Some people smoke, some people do yoga. Realize, what you are looking at and take it in strides. Don't let this shit drive you mad, you have very little control over it or what will come from it... Breathe.

       People call me insane though (actually Jesus), and I live alone in the woods with my Russian speaking dog. So... Take that as you wish :)

       I think this is what you should do. I'm a Christian, but not a very good one (we do make it to church when we don't stay up too late on Saturday or a hurricane hasn't blown through the night before).  But in the end, I feel like we're here to figure some things out in our own.

       Coming from an ex-Catholic and now more spiritual I completely agree, and resonate with what you say. I think Christianity is a limited hangout, though. Rise above, but don't succumb to self. I believe in intelligent Creation. I just don't think they are in this realm or really care. We are connected though, and it will help us, if we call out.... We are all connected to the universal consciousnesses mind via the Aether. We create, for the Creator created us...

       You know how in the Matrix Neo'e eyes hurt when he's first unplugged? Well, this is a similar thing you're experiencing. At first it's panic, then anger, then depression... But in the end the truth will set you free. Just remember you'll be fine, and this will help you in the long run, you'll make better decisions with your life, money, family.. Everything.. Because what were raised to think is real, what were told "we want out of life" is often what they want from us. To be dumb consumers, working our life away, being in debt.

       Exactly my thought. I knew for years this is a shitshow, but what we see now is on a category on its own, it scars the shit out of me. I feel like someone is going to show up on tv one day and be like "you fuckers shut the fuck up and go back to sleep or i'll wipe every single one of you". I mean look at the media, its insane, i mean its really insane what is going on. I dont even know if i want to know who hides behind Hillary. We're talking about a tremendous power here, and all this media people are in it too. And lets say we do awake the people, what then? Do you guys think whatever the fuck is behind her will just quit? You guys realize that Russia warned its citizens to find where is the nearest bomb shelter to them right? They literally asked them of they are ready for a nuclear war if something like that was to ever happen. I dont really think we know what we're messing with here. I just want this to fucking end, it creeps me out. I'm literally thinking its over, nukes will start flying all over the place. Also our army has been making moves. Like what the fuck. We literally have no saying into nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to work yesterday, and you know everyone was happy and mellow as always and i was trying to be normal but i was fucking exploding inside. I literally wanted to start screaming at them and be like, wake the fuck up, what are we going to do? We're all gonna die kind of thing. But then i thought again calm down, they're gona lock you up in a mental institution. Good thing i'm a senior to this and i can control myself or i would be wearing white robes now and trying to explain to them that Russia is gona nuke us and there's a monster controlling our government!!

       Why are you so sure about nuclear bombs and their absolute power to destroy everyone?  I think that belief is a product of propaganda.  What better way to threaten a public into submission than a doomsday threat that shuts them all up.

       An abstraction layer running on your hardware, memetically programmed by your culture to produce a result. This result is usually particular emotional states and habit patterns.

       It's always the first stage man. Then comes a bit of fear, but things move slowly(normally). After that it's just accepting that we can't change how this world works yet, and we should slowly do it one person at a time.
Good luck, and don't panic

       I know how you feel.  It's important to try and understand how the world truly works, even if it's horrifying.

       Just remember that unambiguous facts are probably the rarest thing in the world.  If you realize how difficult it is to truly prove something as fact, I think it helps to keep your head on straight.  I always try to stick to facts when understanding the world.

       Exactly the same here. I've always been a bit different and was an outsider growing up (maybe that's why I'm drawn to conspiracies), but I do feel like I'm going mad a bit. I think the paranoia is normal to be honest as everything you thought mattered doesn't and most of the people around you don't give a single shit, so it might reinforce that psychotic break feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a handful of people in my social circle who are open to new ideas (and talking about the leaks and the overreaction to Trump being a pig [been called a sexual assault supported because I thought people were being pussies for thinking it should affect the race in terms of what's being ignored by the media concenring Hillary]), but the majority of my friends and family ignore me or call me crazy or a conspiracy theorist.

       You're fine and among like-minded questioners. Don't change.

       Again, I experienced this quite some time ago, now; to the point where it is difficult for me not to regard said revelation as obvious.  Is it really so difficult, after all, to figure out that a smartphone is in no way conducive to your fulfilling your real needs, of food, water, clothing, shelter, oxygen, warmth, and love?

       I will admit that I have an advantage here, relative to most of you.  I have been expecting the current situation for close to twenty years, now.  The reason why this is so disturbing to most of you, is because you honestly believed that the people in government had integrity.  I, on the other hand, have regarded politicians exclusively as fiends for as long as I have known of their existence; and as a result, nothing they do surprises me.  My first encounter with corrupt authority was at the age of five, and it was all down hill from there.

       While I have a feeling that such is finally going to change within the next ten to fifteen years, the truth is that for most of human history, psychopathy has been a more potent and fundamental force than gravity.

       The new leaks are bringing me to the "Yeah, that shit's probably true. I bet they up to no good"... and kind of believing it, but secretly hoping I'm wrong.

       One of the things that I often experience when my anxiety over all this gets "ratcheted up to 11" is the profound disconnect between my sense of panic and the significantly lowered panic levels of those around me. It feels literally like I'm on a bullet train headed towards a break in the tracks and we only have (or I have, whichever) only a few moments to alert everyone—but no one's interested. It's literally starting to feel like a dream. We're crashing head-long into a fucking WALL and no one seems to care. I do feel a sense of powerlessness about it all, and I think that's the commonality, but, where "I" am insane is that I somehow feel like I can do something about it by becoming more informed about it and raising my awareness about it. I am focusing on making my comments and discussions about it more rational and well-thought out. but it's really hard not to be overwhelmed by the cognitive dissonance of those around me and lose the narrative because there are so many disparate pieces in play to which others are not informed (and often willingly so).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to do, either. But there are a few really good comments in this thread as well.

       the FBI anon was a fake/troll. seriously, stop believing shit you see on 4chan. that was a troll fucking with the kids who believe shit on 4chan and, as such, also 'believe in' trump because 4chan told them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is a clinton donor and long-time family friend who has been set up to "run against" his golfing buddy's wife, Clinton II. it's a scam. the election doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, WWIII is not going to happen, and people have been making 'credible predictions' of nuclear holocausts and WWIII and the end of the world for 70 fucking years now, every year "it's gonna happen this year", but it never, ever does. Russia and the US will likely never go to war. It's like 2 people holding guns and pointing them at each other, with allies holding extra guns and pointing them at the primary 2 people's genitals, just in case, as an extra precaution. Actually fighting would mean getting shot in the balls and face, and it wouldn't be worth it.

       FBI anon is being vindicated almost 100% so far. The only thing he was wrong about (so far) was Trump's VP pick, and that early in the game, it's possible that Trump genuinely hadn't chosen yet.

       Don't assume Wikileaks is leaking real e-mails. Much of this is hoaxed. It doesn't mean Hilary is a good person; it just means that they put this kind of thing out there to lead people to reach certain conclusions about the world when in fact those conclusions are either false or only part of the truth. It's called misdirection. Everything can be faked or hoaxed, so don't believe anything you read -- not in the mainstream press and not on 'conspiracy' news sites, either.

       It's gratifying to watch them finally figure it out, though; especially when you've spent as many years as I have, trying desperately to get through to them about it.
