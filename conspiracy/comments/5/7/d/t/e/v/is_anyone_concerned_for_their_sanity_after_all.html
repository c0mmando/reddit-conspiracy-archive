<p>I&#39;m 99% sure my friend thinks I&#39;ve had a psychotic break. I told him about what&#39;s going on and I definitely came off very worried and panicked. He was telling me to calm down. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much the leaks themselves as it is the way they dovetail so perfectly with that FBI anon from July.</p>

<p>Just has me worried, and I&#39;ve started wondering if it actually is affecting my sanity a little bit. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, guys. What do you think? Has anyone had a similar experience? Weigh in, help me out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your sanity will be fine. Are you new to this brand new world? If so, you&#39;re just experiencing an awakening and realization that the world is one big stage with puppet masters. It&#39;s a system shock. Especially with everything going on right now. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the people whom don&#39;t believe all of this stuff whose sanity I&#39;d fret over. They are the ones choosing to live in a false reality and ignore confronting the truth because it may lead to an erosion of their precious comfort zone and &quot;reality&quot; television. </p>

<p>Word of advice though; be very very careful who you talk to about conspiracies etc. Not many are accepting of the rabbit hole and the truth it contains. And, if you are in therapy, or seeing a shrink, I&#39;d <em>really</em> recommend not bringing it up. I&#39;m currently in counseling, and I won&#39;t speak a word of my conspiracy knowledge in that office. </p>

I remember hearing the report of 3 athletic males dressed in military garb...then that afternoon all of a sudden it was a dude and his fat wife....also no cell phone videos of the perps? Shit we have cell phone videos for cops fucking people up, doing narley shit, but no video of this attack? Anyway, I came to this sub and it made me think of things in a whole new way, my pops and bros thought and still think I&#39;m nuts, but once you start to connect the dots, things get creepy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I watched, being fully awake, as the towers fell.</p>

<p>I watched as 1 million people marched in the streets of London against Iraq II. I knew there was no WMD (many people did).</p>

<p>&quot;But there is NO WMD, it&#39;s just an absurd pretext&quot; I&#39;d say. &quot;You&#39;re fucking crazy&quot; would be the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re going to invade 8 nations in the next 10 years under the &#39;Bush Doctrine&#39;, it&#39;s about resources, the gold standard and Balkinazation&quot;</p>

<p>Again- &quot;You should get your head checked&quot;</p>

<p>Was there any WMD? Nope. Did anyone of my peers ever acknowledge that I called it on the first mention?  &quot;you&#39;re crazy&quot;</p>

<p>Have they invaded 8 nations in 10 years? Actually I think Yemen, today, is #10 in 15 years. </p>

<p>&quot;See, remember 15 years ago when I said this would happen.....&quot;-----&quot;You&#39;re nut&#39;s&quot;</p>

<p>20 years I&#39;ve been at this. It just goes deeper and deeper and deeper. Right back to Prescott Bush.</p>

<p>You need to have solid evidence to back up any claims you make otherwise you will be written off. I have &quot;turned&quot; many people by being very knowledgeable and backing all my claims up with references. extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.</p>

<p>Also if you do mention some of your &quot;crazy&quot; &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in public you&#39;re likely to find like-minded people who prefer not to talk about it until someone else does.</p>

<p>None of what you are reading here would even be <em>possible</em> had 9/11 not been an inside job designed to start the USA irreversibly down on the path of remaking the Middle East. So many of the very same deep state actors that were involved in 9/11 are now balls deep into what&#39;s going on here as well.</p>

<p>Because I do, makes shit fun (Also knows Polish and German - try to break in and command my dog, you cannot. each command is in various languages. We get bored, and I&#39;m smart..). Check out huskies: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNot4iC7K8s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNot4iC7K8s</a>. They be like mocking birds. I miss my pup as a pup, she&#39;s more like a wolf size now. Still cuddles though, every night...</p>

<p>It&#39;s 12 step, sure, but wise words. Really, if you care to know, I ask the Creator to help me find the strength within... Not for external help, per se...</p>

<p>I think this is what you should do. I&#39;m a Christian, but not a very good one (we do make it to church when we don&#39;t stay up too late on Saturday or a hurricane hasn&#39;t blown through the night before).

Rise above, but don&#39;t succumb to self. I believe in intelligent Creation. I just don&#39;t think they are in this realm or really care. We are connected though, and it will help us, if we call out.... We are all connected to the universal consciousnesses mind via the Aether. We create, for the Creator created us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my thought. I knew for years this is a shitshow, but what we see now is on a category on its own, it scars the shit out of me. I feel like someone is going to show up on tv one day and be like &quot;you fuckers shut the fuck up and go back to sleep or i&#39;ll wipe every single one of you&quot;. I mean look at the media, its insane, i mean its really insane what is going on. I dont even know if i want to know who hides behind Hillary. We&#39;re talking about a tremendous power here, and all this media people are in it too. And lets say we do awake the people, what then? Do you guys think whatever the fuck is behind her will just quit? You guys realize that Russia warned its citizens to find where is the nearest bomb shelter to them right? They literally asked them of they are ready for a nuclear war if something like that was to ever happen. I dont really think we know what we&#39;re messing with here. I just want this to fucking end, it creeps me out. I&#39;m literally thinking its over, nukes will start flying all over the place. Also our army has been making moves. Like what the fuck. We literally have no saying into nothing. </p>

<p>I went to work yesterday, and you know everyone was happy and mellow as always and i was trying to be normal but i was fucking exploding inside. I literally wanted to start screaming at them and be like, wake the fuck up, what are we going to do? We&#39;re all gonna die kind of thing. But then i thought again calm down, they&#39;re gona lock you up in a mental institution. Good thing i&#39;m a senior to this and i can control myself or i would be wearing white robes now and trying to explain to them that Russia is gona nuke us and there&#39;s a monster controlling our government!!</p>

My first encounter with corrupt authority was at the age of five, and it was all down hill from there.</p>

<p>While I have a feeling that such is finally going to change within the next ten to fifteen years, the truth is that for most of human history, psychopathy has been a more potent and fundamental force than gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the things that I often experience when my anxiety over all this gets &quot;ratcheted up to 11&quot; is the profound disconnect between my sense of panic and the significantly lowered panic levels of those around me. It feels literally like I&#39;m on a bullet train headed towards a break in the tracks and we only have (or I have, whichever) only a few moments to alert everyone—but no one&#39;s interested. It&#39;s literally starting to feel like a dream. We&#39;re crashing head-long into a fucking WALL and no one seems to care. I do feel a sense of powerlessness about it all, and I think that&#39;s the commonality, but, where &quot;I&quot; am insane is that I somehow feel like I can do something about it by becoming more informed about it and raising my awareness about it. I am focusing on making my comments and discussions about it more rational and well-thought out. but it&#39;s really hard not to be overwhelmed by the cognitive dissonance of those around me and lose the narrative because there are so many disparate pieces in play to which others are not informed (and often willingly so). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do, either. But there are a few really good comments in this thread as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the FBI anon was a fake/troll. seriously, stop believing shit you see on 4chan. that was a troll fucking with the kids who believe shit on 4chan and, as such, also &#39;believe in&#39; trump because 4chan told them to.</p>

<p>trump is a clinton donor and long-time family friend who has been set up to &quot;run against&quot; his golfing buddy&#39;s wife, Clinton II. it&#39;s a scam. the election doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>also, WWIII is not going to happen, and people have been making &#39;credible predictions&#39; of nuclear holocausts and WWIII and the end of the world for 70 fucking years now, every year &quot;it&#39;s gonna happen this year&quot;, but it never, ever does. Russia and the US will likely never go to war. It&#39;s like 2 people holding guns and pointing them at each other, with allies holding extra guns and pointing them at the primary 2 people&#39;s genitals, just in case, as an extra precaution. Actually fighting would mean getting shot in the balls and face, and it wouldn&#39;t be worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t assume Wikileaks is leaking real e-mails. Much of this is hoaxed. It doesn&#39;t mean Hilary is a good person; it just means that they put this kind of thing out there to lead people to reach certain conclusions about the world when in fact those conclusions are either false or only part of the truth. It&#39;s called misdirection. Everything can be faked or hoaxed, so don&#39;t believe anything you read -- not in the mainstream press and not on &#39;conspiracy&#39; news sites, either. </p>
