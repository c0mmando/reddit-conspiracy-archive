       I think his point is that one of the most despised conspiracy theories is topping so people associate "conspiracy theorists" with it, while some of the most important news stories in the US are being shared here on the conspiracy board.
Average poster wouldn't want to have anything to do with the conspiracy board if it's all about Sandy Hook, when in reality people are sharing the email leaks here.

       Then what was the motive? And let's just say you had a motive and wanted the story to happen. Wouldn't it be much easier just to actually shoot up a school while only involving a few people in on conspiracy instead of hundreds perpetrating a hoax? Doesn't make much sense to me.

       If you are claiming false flag I will entertain that. If you are proposing that it didn't happen at all at one of the most public effects in the country that sounds pretty crazy. So what was the motive?

       I'm sorry it doesn't make sense to you. But it's extremely obvious to me. I'm not going to bother with you because if you'd actually looked into Sandy Hook you'd know that nobody died. It's impossible to think otherwise. Boston bombing is just as obvious. And many many many other false flags.

       Of course I have thought about it. I look into every conspiracy theory I run across. They fascinate me. Most are bull shit, but they are still fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just never understood people with this one. I would entertain false flag and all that shit even though is no clear motive, but everybody jumps straight to "it's a hoax and nobody died". That shit is laughable.

      <p>
       It reminds me of people thinking we didn't really go to the moon. It would have been harder to perpetuate a conspiracy this long than to actually go to the moon. It would have been way easier to just shoot up the school than to fake it.

       Oh, I certainly have. Or at least what you consider "research" whim consist of reading shit online. I'll admit there are some inconsistencies and will entertain some theories, but not ones that think no kids died. That shit is just retarded. And what is the motive? To take our guns?

       No one died. There is zero proof that anyone ever died. There is zero proof that "Adam Lanza" ever even existed. No bodies were ever found, no photos have ever been seen, and the pictures of children that they used in the news were pictures of children that are currently alive. The only reason for the Sandy Hoax was gun control.

       Well, that didn't work. Plus, it's not like there aren't plenty of real shootings. And wouldn't it just be easier to really shoot up a school than have an elaborate hoax?

       "Reading shit online." I'll take that with a grain of salt, because yeah, you can in fact find a bunch of factual information that proves that official story directly against itself. I also remember the event in the news very vividly, and how it was constantly changed and portrayed differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the same question everybody always asks. "What's the motive?" Nobody is quite sure, but that really isn't the point of the situation. Perhaps though that event, along with several others in the forthcoming months or years will eventually lead to some kind of gun legislation that will infringe upon our constitutional rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is when a real event has occurred, there aren't countless inconsistencies for the public to easily spot and arise questions over.  A mean a fucking website uploads an article about the event before it happened. What more does anyone fucking need? It's literally direct proof of foreknowledge of the event. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, as far as evidence disproving the event.

       That is pretty normal with any breaking story. There is always false reporting. It's the drawback of the instant news era we now live in. Random tweets count as facts.

      <p>
       Motive is always the most important aspect to me. So one hoax shooting on top of all the other real shootings is going to get them to take our guns? Taken out guns isn't even logistically possible.

       Do you have a link to that and a way to prove it? What website? So "they" were smart enough to organize an event where hundreds of people were involved, and kept quite, but they made a mistake like this? I'll even entertain false flag theories but to say that no kids died is really insulting to the parents.

       I am awake. I've been studying conspiracy theories for over 20 years. They have always fascinated me. I entertain some as plausible, but most don't hold water IMO. Just because I don't believe in one doesn't mean I don't believe in any.

       I'm saying in addition to watching the video, you can find all the information it features online, it's all public data. It is a 2 hour and 50 minute long video, that would take some time, but I could do it. It would probably end up being pointless though, as I'm skimming through this video, everything important that I remember still seems to be there.
      </p>

       I'm telling you partner, something in that video will grab you. Even my girlfriend who
       <em>
        hates

       conspiracy theories can get behind it. There isn't much that can be done, but spreading this information to as many people as possible is a good place to start.

       I just watched about 30 mins of it. I may finish it when I have more time.  I'm pretty sure I watched it a a couple years ago. I'll be honest it seems like complete bull shit. A lot of people who even believe Sandy Hook is a hoax think this video is trash. You have to admit it is suspect when it's a collage of youtubers with blacked out faces.

       I will at some point, but I'm telling you it's bull shit. It's the same people that made the one three years ago that had 10 million views and people picked it apart. Looks like they took it down. I wonder why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So what top three pieces of evidence off the top of your head did you garner from the video?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the first 30 minutes the only piece that I can't readily debunk was the guy talking about the news article that is cached the day before. I do know as far as servers go a one day discrepancy isn't a big deal. And what kind of monster uses Bing anyways? I've never once heard a person say "Bing it".

       I'm sorry it doesn't make sense to you. But it's extremely obvious to me. I'm not going to bother with you because if you'd actually looked into Sandy Hook you'd know that nobody died. It's impossible to think otherwise. Boston bombing is just as obvious. And many many many other false flags.

       I think his point is that one of the most despised conspiracy theories is topping so people associate "conspiracy theorists" with it, while some of the most important news stories in the US are being shared here on the conspiracy board.
Average poster wouldn't want to have anything to do with the conspiracy board if it's all about Sandy Hook, when in reality people are sharing the email leaks here.
