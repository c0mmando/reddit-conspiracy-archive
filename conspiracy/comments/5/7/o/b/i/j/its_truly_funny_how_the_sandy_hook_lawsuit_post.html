Average poster wouldn&#39;t want to have anything to do with the conspiracy board if it&#39;s all about Sandy Hook, when in reality people are sharing the email leaks here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you are name calling. I haven&#39;t been rude. That is normally what people do when they can&#39;t support their claims. They get frustrated.</p>

<p>Boston bombing. Check it out.</p>

<p>Well ok, but we weren&#39;t talking about that. I love conspiracy theories though. I wasn&#39;t aware it&#39;s a believe them all or believe none kind of thing. </p>

<p>If you are claiming false flag I will entertain that. If you are proposing that it didn&#39;t happen at all at one of the most public effects in the country that sounds pretty crazy. So what was the motive? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are getting at there, but here you go with the name calling. You sound the the people who try to convince me that evolution isn&#39;t real and the earth is six thousand years old. </p>

<p>That is pretty normal with any breaking story. There is always false reporting. It&#39;s the drawback of the instant news era we now live in. Random tweets count as facts. </p>

<p>Motive is always the most important aspect to me. So one hoax shooting on top of all the other real shootings is going to get them to take our guns? Taken out guns isn&#39;t even logistically possible. </p>

<p>Do you have a link to that and a way to prove it? What website? So &quot;they&quot; were smart enough to organize an event where hundreds of people were involved, and kept quite, but they made a mistake like this? I&#39;ll even entertain false flag theories but to say that no kids died is really insulting to the parents. </p>

<p>I am awake. I&#39;ve been studying conspiracy theories for over 20 years. They have always fascinated me. I entertain some as plausible, but most don&#39;t hold water IMO. Just because I don&#39;t believe in one doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t believe in any. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen this video before, but I&#39;ll give it another look. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying in addition to watching the video, you can find all the information it features online, it&#39;s all public data. It is a 2 hour and 50 minute long video, that would take some time, but I could do it. It would probably end up being pointless though, as I&#39;m skimming through this video, everything important that I remember still seems to be there. </p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you partner, something in that video will grab you. Even my girlfriend who <em>hates</em> conspiracy theories can get behind it. There isn&#39;t much that can be done, but spreading this information to as many people as possible is a good place to start.  </p>

<p>Edit: So what top three pieces of evidence off the top of your head did you garner from the video?</p>

<p>From the first 30 minutes the only piece that I can&#39;t readily debunk was the guy talking about the news article that is cached the day before. I do know as far as servers go a one day discrepancy isn&#39;t a big deal. And what kind of monster uses Bing anyways? I&#39;ve never once heard a person say &quot;Bing it&quot;. </p>
