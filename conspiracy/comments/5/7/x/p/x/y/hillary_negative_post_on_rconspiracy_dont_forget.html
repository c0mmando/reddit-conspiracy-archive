       as anti Trump, but I am seeing a narrative here in this sub that it is anti-Hillary. Let's not forget that Trump also has dirty secrets. This community has thrived on the fact that we report the truth one way or another, but must not allow them to label us what we are not. So lets start to look at Trump as well and seriously question his end as well.

       EDIT: not even 5 minutes into the post and I am already getting down voted. Really? Am I in the wrong sub now?

       EDIT: folks this is not pro Hillary post, this is a pro Truth post. We are looking for the truth not to pick candidates. I hate the fact that this has turned into a political movement for one specific candidate. Lets be fair in our approach.

       Difference being Trump is merely an asshole, and not really involved in any governmental conspiracies. You find proof that he has been involved in even 1/4 of the corruption and evil Hillary has involved herself with, and I will post that shit myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this point, it appears as if his worst trait is that he is just an outspoken asshole, but not near the level of evil of Hillary.

       The difference is Trump is a powerful businessman who did powerful businessman things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton is literally the icon of political corruption and conspiracy theories becoming fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, nobody cares about all the laws she broke and lives she destroyed while everyone looks past the good things trump has done in his life and focus on individual acts of assholishness over a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton is the physical embodiment of what is wrong with the system.  Trump is just an asshat.

       I totally agree with you. I think you are right. What has taken over the MSM is Trump is bad, but in these subs we are clearly demonstrating the corruption that Hillary is. I totally agree with you. I did not see it in that angle.

       If the truth came out about trump and he raped a village full of school girls and then pissed on a camera man before lighting a Christmas tree on fire, then you could bet that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       might mention it. But the fact of the matter is most of the news that trump makes isn't conspiracy. Clinton is embroiled in a massive conspiracy! She and we people cover this page because the conspiracy is one of the largest that the world has ever known. Trump's shit makes the front of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       when it's also conspiratorial, such as when horribly damning videos of him from a decade ago only surface a few weeks before the general election and not during the primaries or at any other point in the past. Or why only now do women seem interested in accusing him of assualt by the droves? He's been rich for his whole life, if those women wanted money or justice they could've screwed him years ago. So why now? What makes him running for president a more appealing target than him being an idiot playboy billionaire? It screams conspiracy.

       Trump has been promoting Trump.   From the beginning to now,  he has been inside the establishment looking out for number one,  and managing his publicity,  cultivating his brand.    Contrast that with Jill.  You literally just have to put down the kool aid and read Trumps wiki to see that Trump is out for Trump.   The few publicity stunts of "good deeds" compared to the people he walked on and over,  and stomped are nothing.    He wasn't buddy buddy with the Clintons for years because he cared about you and me.

       We all know. Around 80% of the sub knows. Trump shills/Hillary Shills are probably invading this sub. Both are pretty common actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump Shills make Pro-Trump posts and downvote comments that are Anti-Trump, or most often downvoting those noting both candidates are evil (And that is excluding the comments that CTR (An infiltration organization commanded by Hillary) which deserves to be downvoted) while Hillary Shills make numerous Pro-Hillary comments and have no other activities other than in this sub. Albeit there is real proof that Hillary is going out of her way trying to infiltrate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality both sides are two faces of a coin.

       However, i assume that there is still a pretty good deal of people who knows either candidate is evil and nobody on the political ring is a saint.

       Yet another redditor assuming that I am on a side. I am on non one side. I am on the side of Truth, and if we look at truth in all angles this sub would be balanced in post. Like another redditor told me, the fact that Hillary represent what is wrong with the system and it is being reflected here is the reason why Hillary over takes the narrative. I understood what he means and I agree with him on that too. I saw his angle and I agree with it. But what you are assuming is your opinion in which, is wrong, but it is still your opinion.

       It really sounds like to me like you want us to stop talking about Hillary. The MSM is hardly talking about Hillary, while "exposing" Trump. We're exposing Hillary, through these revelations, and you want us to talk about Trump. We've been trying to expose Hillary &amp; Co. for years, and now that we have the ammo, you want us to talk about a guy that doesn't have any government conspiracies surrounding him, and wasn't even relevant in our eyes until he became a candidate. Why are you so dead set on us talking about Trump? What is there to say about him right now? Rape allegations? It's been covered, now, back to Hillary....

       no, no no, absolutely not. I want Hillary to be all other this sub, but I also want Trump to be here if it warrant it. Like a redditor mentioned me in another post. Hillary is over taking this sub because she has the most controversial and conspiratorial behavior. I do agree with that and that is why I am looking at his comment in that angle as to why this sub has been over taken by Hillary conspiray. I see that angle and I agree with it.  Believe me I want Hillary conspiracy all over this place. I do not want it to stop. I think is very important that we expose it.

       Ok, so what conspiracies surrounding Trump should we talk about? I literally have never heard one. Most of the stuff coming out about Hillary, this sub and CTs alike, already knew, with a few more bits of juicy information that's proving us right. What in the hell about Trump could we possibly talk about that's more important than the most controversial political scandal in US history? Do you realize how asinine you come across as?

       yeah maybe I did, but you know what, It got a conversation going. And after a few rounds of post. I realized that the narrative is just moving with the tides and not really bias as I though it was. I started the conversation because I did not want us to be label anti-Hillary. I want us to be labeled Truth seekers and I was clearly looking at it from the wrong angle.

       Has zero bearing on her being a woman, I couldn't care less about the person's race, sex, sexual orientation. Their job is to aid the American people which not a single president in the past 40 years has done. So basically, I'm anti-establishment.
