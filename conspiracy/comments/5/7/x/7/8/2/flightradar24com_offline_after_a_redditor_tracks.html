       Update (21.11.2016)
      </h1>
      <p>
       I have to be honest with you, I dont have any more time to devote to this investigation. I took the trial and spent some time collecting facts and information about the flight:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) FlightRadar24 does ask for credit card info, but they do not charge you until the week is over. You can freely switch subscription levels as you wish and go even as far as 365 days in the past for the flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) First report ever from @Wikileaks about the internet getting cut off, is posted at 8:33AM (UTC?).
      </p>
      <p>
       3) "Official" report with the "official" time when the internet got cut off is posted at 10:27PM (UTC?), declaring it was cut off at 5:00PM (wtf?).
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Flight GLF5 is not a commercial jet, no info is shown about it. It doesn't even show up in search, only when you replicate the times from the screenshots and locations on map.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Flight GLF5 took off from London Luton airport approximately at 7AM-9AM (this is vague, because you cannot physically track the plane flying out of there for whatever reason, but once it approaches the east coast of US, you can track it and see the full route, it landed at Raleigh Durham airport in NC at +/- 14:50 UTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do pick up the trial, i'll save alot of time for you and give you 2 things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/11:20/12x/GLF5/b555ac6">
        https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/11:20/12x/GLF5/b555ac6
       </a>
       is the plane you're looking for, paste the link once you got the trial and you'll be straight on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) When tracking the plane, make sure your link ends in "/b555ac6", that is the unique identifier for it. Once you pay a little attention to the link structure, you'll quickly understand what the rest is. I found out the hard way, randomly seeing another GLF5 lift off from Shannon airport, Ireland -
       <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/14:31/12x/GLF5/b561797">
        https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/14:31/12x/GLF5/b561797
       </a>
       . I spent too much time tracking the wrong plane.. Here's another GLF5 curiously, flying out of Saudi Arabia -
       <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/06:49/12x/GLF5/b555490">
        https://www.flightradar24.com/2016-10-17/06:49/12x/GLF5/b555490
       </a>
       notice how the ending in the URL is different each time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this information leave you with? 2 main things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The GLF5 we all had our eyes on, did indeed take off around the time when Assanges internet got cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Wikileaks fucked up by reporting on this way early in the morning hours and after the alleged "switch" was done, they tweeted out another time, which doesn't make any sense and only marked the start of the Wikileaks weirdness. I hope someone will pick this up from here and good luck to you, if you do!
      </p>

       Another update? (20.11.2016)
      </h1>
      <p>
       Okay, so I have found out a chance to redeem this wacky theory, but I need ALOT of manpower on this one. Basicly, it all started with me tracking the plane on 17.10 via
       <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com">
        www.flightradar24.com
       </a>
       . I am still receiving PM's about this post, which is now more than a month old so I got to thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way, to verify what happened on
       <strong>
        21.10
       </strong>
       is to check the flight history on that day, right? At first, I checked how far
       <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com">
        www.flightradar24.com
       </a>
       goes back with the information, and sadly I only saw that the last 48h are shown.
       <strong>
        Until I found their pricelist.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h1>
       They are able to show you the historical flight information going as back as 7/60/180/365 DAYS!
      </h1>
      <p>
       All you have to do, is either grab a 7-day trial or pay for the subscription. (To see 60 days, it is only 9.99$ per year/1.49$ per month.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/premium/">
         Link to their pricelist.
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has the time and willingness to go through the historical records of flights taking off on the 21st october from London, this is the perfect opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Note:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, to save you time, the airport we should be focusing on is the London Luton Airport (chemical scare and evacuation on 21st).
      </p>
      <h1>
       As before, if anyone can provide factual, confirmable information, I will gladly add it to the main post. If this theory catches any friction and provides more evidence, I might even create a website (I am a web developer) for this whole thing, because this post is already a huge wall of text.
      </h1>
      <h2>
       This is a chance for me to redeem myself for spreading misleading information at the beginning, so I will take on the duty to message everyone who has replied to this post about this beneficial update. Thanks for reading and good luck searching!

      <p>
       I've been receiving PM's about this post and how i'm spamming and spreading false information. So here's an update. It will be the last one regarding this post, because this is just a theory and after attempting to verify each detail listed below, I found that it is not a likely theory. I will honestly say that I have not put time into researching the given facts of this theory, but I will also say that I never promised it. I kept tabs on the information people added, but I did not go out of my way to confirm all of this is factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will end updating this post, by listing all of the dots i've compiled and the factual results of todays research. I also am sorry about possibly misleading a lot of people with this thread. Please consider this closure as my apology and before I will attempt anything like this again, I will make sure to think twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) J. Assanges connection got severed at the Ecuadorian embassy on October 17th.
      </p>
      <p>
       After doing deeper research, the official @WikiLeaks twitter account tweeted that the time of the blackout is
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788099178832420865">
        5 PM GMT
       </a>
       . Weirdly enough, the first tweet from them about the blackout went public at exactly
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088">
        8:33 AM
       </a>
       . Whether thats a timezone difference, or the "official story for the public" after allegedly switching out the original WikiLeaks staff for government goons, made the time of the blackout to be
       <strong>
        5 PM GMT
       </strong>
       , that's open for interpretation. As we all know, after the internet connection got severed, WikiLeaks haven't been the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Evacuation at the City of London Airport happened on October 21st.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official London City Airport twitter account first reported this on
       <a href="https://twitter.com/LondonCityAir/status/789495747544743937">
        21.10, at 6:57 PM
       </a>
       . Honestly, I am not sure, how the dates got mixed up and I am really embarassed for not looking into this earlier. I once again apologize for providing misleading information.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Lift off for a plane titled "Guantanamo Express".
      </p>
      <p>
       The very first screenshot I took, was on October 17th, at approximately 1:18 PM GMT. At this moment, the plane was already on the east coast of the US. It is worth noting, that the plane took off from
       <strong>
        London Luton Airport
       </strong>
       , not the central one. This airport did not tweet anything on October 17th,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/LDNLutonAirport/status/787951375456010240">
        except some ticket giveaway information
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The plane landed in North Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not matter at all anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also delete all of the comments I made yesterday, pointing everyone to this post. ( At this moment, I understood, that I am experiencing overdose from conspiracy theories and I will make sure to cut them out from my daily internet diet as much as possible. )

        this thread
       </a>
       and day by day im getting more and more confident, that Julian Assange was flown into North Carolina on 17.10. It's been a long day for me, so I am signing off. I am trying to get this original post more visibility, because in fact, this is the last propable location and theory of where and how Julian was extradited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr -
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Assanges internet gets cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
       <del>
        2) Evacuation at the City of London Airport.
       </del>
       (Evacuation happened on 21.10, 4 days later)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Lift off for a plane titled "Guantanamo Express".
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The plane landed in North Carolina.

       It seems that this situation is
       <strong>
        far from resolved
       </strong>
       . After receiving a PM stating that this post has been shadowbanned, it isn't, but i've decided to create an offline version of the post, to conserve all of the content from the post itself and comments. The galleries are still intact and backed up to multiple memory devices. While I have not experienced nothing out of the ordinary, receiving a PM of this nature and the current situation, I have no choice but to still keep tabs on this investigation that we as a community made.

      <h2>
       Anything below the next line is of the original post, and everything between the line and this update is the newest information.

      <p>
       After seeing people visiting this thread today (by upvote fluctuation), I have one theory in mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a 50/50, either he is done, or he is staying far below the radar. No questions for the first propability, it is obvious to why, but if he is holding back, then it gets interesting. My point is: Why should he hold back, knowing that his supporters are slowly losing faith? One answer may be confidence, that he is to unleash information, that will plunge the country into complete chaos. He doesn't need affirmation from anyone, just as he doesn't need the world to believe that he isn't dead. All he needs, is to pull the final lever when the timing is critical, to fulfill the milestone of destabilising the current system.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What can we do?
       </strong>
       For one, in my opinion, we must continue to comb through the leaked e-mails. If it has information of Hillary stating such immature things as "Can't we just drone him?" then, of course there is way more dirt to dig for. I do not know how up-to-date are the leaked e-mails, because I haven't taken the time to go through them, but ideally we should find a smoking gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why do I think there's even a remote chance that Assange could be alive?
       </strong>
       Once again, a hunch. Also, Mr. Kim Dotcom,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/793274024537182209">

       It has landed. No information is being updated currently. The first link in this post no longer leads you to the flight details. (It actually glitches out currently, I got

       Okay, getting to the compilation upload. Everyone following this story, try to be as open minded as you can be related to why it landed here, any possible transfers and the current situation at the Ecuadorian embassy. Ill be back in a few.

       <strong>
        Why is this important:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The plane went airborne shortly after internet outages struck the Ecuadorian embassy in London (It is also rumored, that an unnamed crew went into the embassy during the outage).
       </li>
       <li>
        The plane is nicknamed "Guantanamo Express".
       </li>
       <li>
        The political machine of the USA want Assange in their claws asap.
       </li>
       <li>
        The plane has had a history of moving persons of interest for the political machine mentioned previously, to the USA.
       </li>
       <li>
        After livestreaming the embassy entrance, the content from periscope was removed, meaning someone is trying to isolate Assange.
       </li>
       <li>
        All of these occurences pretty high on the shady meter and if you take into account the fact, that all of this happened in a 12 hour span, it overheats the shady meter to the point where it breaks and you know, that shit is currently hitting the fan for both sides.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Outside of the 12 hour span, we have:
      </p>
      <p>
       John Kerry has threatened the Ecuadorian President with "grave consequences for Equador" if Assange is not silenced. (

       If it is heading to Raleigh, that is indeed a little curious. NC has been in the middle of a lot of shit lately, and I feel like Charlotte is an illuminati hotspot if you will, and Charlotte is only a mere 3 hour drive from Raleigh. Let me explain why that plane landing in NC is curious to me ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary, Obama, Michelle, Trump and Pence are seemingly here every week or every other week. Lots of elite money in this town (apparently Soros has also been in Charlotte a few times this year), and each time one of these people come to Charlotte, they almost always end up at a private residence in Myers Park for a dinner, or luncheon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also an absurd amount of masonic/occult artwork Uptown, and in various financial buildings. Mainly the main Bank Of America and Wells Fargo buildings. Both have lots of occult artwork in their lobbies. Not to mention there is a Federal Reserve here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually legit worried that the next big false flag will be here. 2 Nuclear Power Plants within 20 miles of the city. 2nd largest banking city in the US, a large airport, a large Air National Guard Armory, they've already tested the waters here so to speak with the riots and National Guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems Charlotte or NC have been involved in national news a lot this year, which is very out of the ordinary. As if the city is being pre-conditioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I personally believe they got Assange and he is on that plane. We have no proof of that, but the circumstantial evidence all leans that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit; here is a link describing all of the occult artwork at One Bank Of America Center
       </em>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit2 - I also forgot to mention a couple weird (but not necessarily related) events from yesterday. First off, around 6pm I had to go to the ATM (I am with Wells Fargo), and literally every single ATM near my house was "out of order". 6 in total. Also, 2 local news stations suffered "technical difficulties" last night and were not able to air the 6pm local news.

       I usually don't give this kind of stuff credence but this would be QUITE the coincidence if it were unrelated.  Especially since there's that CIA site in NC that I'm just finding out about (i live about an hour from it).

       I definitely think they got assange. He has been adamant about not going to usa to face extradition. It makes no sense that he would fly to NC where the GOP office firebombing took place and where the elite Illuminati liberals are rampant.

       A lot of the attention from the candidates is because NC went strong for Obama both times, and HRC is trying to keep their coalition alive, and Trump is trying to court back the silent majority of boomers and the disaffected millenials who are anti-establishment which HRC exemplifies.

       I feel that the FF will nuke a city viewed by TBTB as being full of "deplorables." It'll come from a port city and will be traced to a container, etc., shipped from the Middle East (Yemen maybe). I worry about New Orleans. That's always been my call.

       I know, sorry about that. But this time, we can't react the way we did last time on 9/11. I was a block away from that and it was pretty traumatic  I have to say. And in the days and weeks following in my mind I was like, come on, let's get this show started, let's get these bastards back. And in the past 15 years I've realized how it all went down and just how much cognitive dissonance there is, it's crazy. And I look at what's being done to other people by our countries and I feel really angry because we have so much energy and potential to be such an amazing Force for good in the world, accept that, it's becoming more and more clear that our government is totally co-opted by some real assholes.

       As a 15 year old on 9-11, I was completely washed by the false nationalism looking back, it was insane. Major publications were putting out infographics on how many more tanks and aircrafts the US had over Iraq. Hard to believe it was just 15 years ago.

       Asheville is THE hub of the
       <a href="http://www.wfm-igp.org/">
        World Federalist Movement
       </a>
       , which is a student version of globalist political movement; and of course it's also considered the 'paris of the south' for being a center for art (and therefore illuminism), but also a center of neopaganism, occultism, wicca and luciferianism. It's also considered the warwickshire of the west, of the states...other than burning man and appogea in colorado, its a haven for wicca and is a sister city of other such occult oriented towns.
      </p>
      <p>
       So charlotte is not the only occult oriented town.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say the following towns are rife with occultism in this area: raleigh, charlotte, asheville, nasheville TN, memphis TN, charleston SC and of course columbia sc baked into its name right there

        It was a Gulfstream V Turbo, tailfin number N379P; its flight plans always began at an airstrip in Smithfield, North Carolina, and ended in some of the world's hot spots.

       I'm a bit lost.  Aren't there a lot of private jets flying out of London?  Why does this one seem to carry assange?

       Mainly because:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The plane went airborne shortly after internet outages struck the Ecuadorian embassy in London (It is also rumored, that an unnamed crew went into the embassy during the outage).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The plane is nicknamed "Guantanamo Express".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The political machine of the USA want Assange in their claws asap.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The plane has had a history of moving persons of interest for the political machine mentioned previously, to the USA.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After livestreaming the embassy entrance, the content from periscope was removed, meaning someone is trying to isolate Assange.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All of these occurences pretty high on the shady meter and if you take into account the fact, that all of this happened in a 12 hour span, it overheats the shady meter to the point where it breaks and you know, that shit is currently hitting the fan for both sides.

       That's assuming that the only way in or out of the embassy is through the exits that the public knows about. Big Brother can afford a whole lot of smoke and mirrors.

       Back in the early '80s the Russian embassy in Montreal, Canada, had a fire, and the Russian diplomats mysteriously appeared in the building across the street. But that's not going to happen in London to the most wanted man in the world.

       Wasn't it also at the same time the London airport had some chemical scare that caused it to be evacuated? Smells like an easy way to load a person of interest on to a plane without too many onlookers.

       Edit: just checked and the London airport evacuation was the 21st so ignore my comment.

       A small jet showed up at their local airport with a private, corporate ID number that corresponds with a plan used for extraditions. Then when the flight landed in North Carolina, there was a plane with a blocked ID number waiting there, which took off a bit after the other landed. After that I've lost track of what's going on, as unfortunately, I'm not able to devote my full attention to all this insanity. If you want more info, just scroll through the comments here, it was others that worked to track all this.
      </p>

       Edit: to be clear this is all still
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       speculative, but that's the circumstantial evidence that people were following.

       Looks like it is landing in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina - Raleigh, Durham

       Edit: I am not savvy with Flightradar.com , but prior to the suspect G550 landing in R-D,NC there were two blocked aircraft , 1 north &amp; 1 south of the airport which appeared to have stalled.

       There are currently 2 planes headed @ 211 &amp; 207 degrees @ 20,000 alt 304 knots airspeed

       <a href="http://www.macdill.af.mil/">
        MacDill AFB

       will be final destination.

       I stand corrected; both planes are headed to SRQ ( Sarasota / Bradenton )

       It was a Gulfstream V Turbo, tailfin number N379P; its flight plans always began at an airstrip in Smithfield, North Carolina, and ended in some of the world's hot spots. It was owned by Premier Executive Transport Services, incorporated in Delaware, a brass plaque company with nonexistent directors, hired by American agents to revive an old CIA tactic from the 1970s, when agency men had kidnapped South American criminals and flown them back to their own countries to face trial so that justice could be rendered.

       Helicopters frequently fly from Ft. Bragg to the Moore county airport and also to a smaller airfield in Carthage a few miles North. The Carthage airstrip has one of the best barbecue restaurants in the state. (One day I watched a group of soldiers chopper in, eat some barbecue and then fly back out.)

Edit: N402RX has a pending N number change to N37327S registered to Rectrix Aviation.

       Ok, how about this. Assange's communication possibilities get blocked. He gets "arrested" (for lack of a better term). CIA looks for planes in London they can use to transport, find out GSK has direct line to international airport near Smithfield. Fly him to US, Rayleigh-Durham, transfer to Smithfield.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think? Or is it just a GSK suit getting to their US HQ?

       So this sort of rules out the theory that plane took off shortly before the internet was cut off, correct? It doesn't take 2 days to fly from London to NC.

       I wasn't criticizing you, I just found it funny ( in a morbid way).  It's like calling a truck heading to a prison with "illegal" prisoners "Soap on a rope moving company", a train heading to Abu graib "the Abu gravy train", or a Saudi Arabian interior decorating firm with a slogan "9 out of 11 of our clients love our inside jobs".  It's the little things that convince me meme magic is real and God is playing a massive game of the Sims with a trollface on.

       I did not. Looks like it landed in Jacksonville at 11:41. I really think it was just a coincidentally similar flight path for a little while. I watched JBU1109 diverge toward FL as Assange's alleged plane continued en route to NC.

       Knowing the situation he's allegedly in, i'd say he is maintaining a low profile. He is trying to suffocate the people tracking him from information, sadly, that involves us observers too. If he's dead, you'd certainly know it, trust me. We're not just talking about a witty solo hacker, who is interested in creating chaos. Assange, judging by how long he has been able to maintain a pulse in these extreme conditions, is highly organised.

       Props to HazyHotDog for starting this and keeping tabs on it during the beginning stages. It seems now that this was a false alarm, but imo it's better to gather the info immediately and verify it rather than come in after the fact and try to gather the scraps. Definitely a testament to the power of community.

       Thanks a lot! Yeah, it was confirmed to be a false alarm by a source from the Ecuadorian embassy, stating that they will keep their word about protecting Assange. I'd like to thank everyone who participated in this story, it really showed the power of a community, where someone keeps tabs on the overall situation, someone else tracks multiple planes and records the activity, someone else is connecting dots on the territory the plane landed, another one talks about info he knows about, because he lives there, someone else does the same but lives relatively close, another one archives all of it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is what communities are all about, individual people pitching in, and with time it amounts to large stuff getting done. It's pretty sad, that out of greed, people have created hierarchies, climbed on top of them and dropped the ladder, ensuring constant leadership no matter how unfair the fruit of the labor gets split. The "You don't like it? Get out, there are others more desperate than you to replace you with." mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       J. Assange is currently manipulating the masses for the better, by exposing what happens at the top of the modern food chain and that is, in my opinion what we globally need and that's why I pitched in. While disintegration of a large piece of corruption is imminent, we are not there yet. So every little thing we can do to unite our society, we must do it and not only when corruption has got us all in a choke hold. Though, instead the majority of us live in our individual shells and provide resistance to corruption only when in dire need. That's how they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough of ranting, those were my 0.02$ about the whole situation and this story. Hopefully, by providing effort, we won't end up in a situation where the outcome of suspicious cases like this is different.

       I am going to need to see a lot more than I have so far.  I certainly believe U.S. government could make it look like it was a false alarm.  Better to not have everyone up in arms over it.  And WL goes on in any case.  I have heard the suggestion that the operation was ,in part, to identify the other members.

       The original confirmation posted 6 hours ago that he was ok had 2 pictures, one of them smiling and one serious.  The smiling picture was the one I linked, time-stamped in june of this year.  The serious picture had the same lighting/setting/clothing, so we can assume that was also taken in june, not today.  So fake.

       My fault, didn't see the times. If you go to
       <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/archive.php?m=krdu_app2">
        LiveATC KRDU Approach / Departure Archives
       </a>
       select Oct 17th then 1430 - 1500Z. Scrub the file to 15:01 and I believe you can here the approach controller call the plane by the callsign to contact the tower and then the pilot reading it back followed by the callsign. I can't really tell what it is, but to me it sounds like "Echo Seven Delta Whisky" or "E7DW". Maybe someone with better audio skills can make it more clear.

       I'm going for full tin foil hat here. Does anyone think that Assange maybe making a deal? Maybe Obama or maybe the FBI will make sure he stays safe if the info he possibly has on them is not released and sticks to just the Clintons... it seems far fetched but if he was actually in danger you would think they would have dump all of the files already.... maybe this is a little more complicated then we are making it out to be??

       If you mean selling out - I doubt it considering he's made it this far. He's been in pain and practically jailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean a trade, well he did offer his future in exchange for that Army whistle-blower a couple of months back, Chelsea Manning but that's a stretch. The US would not allow that, and Assange isn't dumb enough to fall for a trap.

       He has children. That's a powerful bargaining tool. Powerful enough that perhaps he would trade their safety for control of the deadmans switch? He's a compassionate and deeply empathetic man. If nothing else in the world could compromise him, his children's safety might. I don't think even I could hold that against him.

       This is sort of my fear. Except wholly on the they decided to go Gestapo and say "Fuck it." They took him, and are now coercing him to play ball or play dead. Except stay dead. I dunno. I don't think shit will hit the fan in a revolutionary/transparency/the good guys actually ousted the villains but more of a one of the publicly known good guys quietly whimpered in a cell to comply. I think it's FUBAR.

       No. They came out with a lousy explanation that he gave a statement. No proof of life, nada. They did make some curious comments about his failing health and lack of access to doctors, which could be trustworthy or could simply be the groundwork for plausible cause of death. The attorney who spoke to reporters gave no indication that she had seen Assange herself. Not looking good.

       We have knowledge of a flight on Oct 17th, but what about Oct 21st during the chemical scare? Did anyone check to see what flights left On Oct 21 around the time when there were reports of police outside the embassy?

       Well I hope he does.  I hope there is someone out there who is fighting the good fight.  When Assange said he didnt believ 911 was an inside job, I was skeptical.  I hope I'm wrong about him.

       The enemy being the people on the plane with him? If someone wants him dead, he'd already be. If someone wants to track his plane, they're already on it. I'm a redditor, tracking publicly displayed information, in order to close out any random plane dissapearance. Do you think the media coming out this evening saying this full story with their version of it and saying "The plane carrying Assange has mysteriously dissapeared" then the general public is like: "Welp, one of our main free speech crusaders got killed, no clues, no proof, noone watching him, that means I cant be of any help and track any facts, welp back to shitposting I guess, the world will sort itself out, right?"

       The war should not be in Syria, the war should be wherever the hell this plane lands, to rescue Assange IF he is indeed on that plane.

       Knowing the situation he's allegedly in, i'd say he is maintaining a low profile. He is trying to suffocate the people tracking him from information, sadly, that involves us observers too. If he's dead, you'd certainly know it, trust me. We're not just talking about a witty solo hacker, who is interested in creating chaos. Assange, judging by how long he has been able to maintain a pulse in these extreme conditions, is highly organised.

       Thanks a lot! Yeah, it was confirmed to be a false alarm by a source from the Ecuadorian embassy, stating that they will keep their word about protecting Assange. I'd like to thank everyone who participated in this story, it really showed the power of a community, where someone keeps tabs on the overall situation, someone else tracks multiple planes and records the activity, someone else is connecting dots on the territory the plane landed, another one talks about info he knows about, because he lives there, someone else does the same but lives relatively close, another one archives all of it, etc.

       I believe this is what communities are all about, individual people pitching in, and with time it amounts to large stuff getting done. It's pretty sad, that out of greed, people have created hierarchies, climbed on top of them and dropped the ladder, ensuring constant leadership no matter how unfair the fruit of the labor gets split. The "You don't like it? Get out, there are others more desperate than you to replace you with." mentality.

       J. Assange is currently manipulating the masses for the better, by exposing what happens at the top of the modern food chain and that is, in my opinion what we globally need and that's why I pitched in. While disintegration of a large piece of corruption is imminent, we are not there yet. So every little thing we can do to unite our society, we must do it and not only when corruption has got us all in a choke hold. Though, instead the majority of us live in our individual shells and provide resistance to corruption only when in dire need. That's how they win.

       Enough of ranting, those were my 0.02$ about the whole situation and this story. Hopefully, by providing effort, we won't end up in a situation where the outcome of suspicious cases like this is different.

       And then let us know what you found! Could you imagine if this flight showed a second leg to Cuba, or if it showed frequent routes to places like DC, black rendition sites like Pakistan, etc?
