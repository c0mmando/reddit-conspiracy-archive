        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Perhaps during the creation of the Declaration of Independence and the formation of America there were some noted intellectuals who &#39;stayed out of it&#39; believing the arguments between the colonies and crown to be beneath them.  </p>

<p>Who were they?  I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t care.  History doesn&#39;t remember the spineless dogs who fail to use their intellectual gifts for the good of the people.  </p>

<p>It remembers those who have the rare combination of bravery and talent, and use it to pursue truth and change.  It remembers true patriots like Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, and Washington.  These were men who could have easily stayed silent and ensured themselves a comfortable life regardless of how things transpired, but they didn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Because they took a stand, all of the wars of the European monarchy eventually died and a new era was born.  </p>

<p>Do not be silent when you have the ability to affect change in this world.  There are powerful forces which very much would prefer you keep your gifts and opinions to yourself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is vastly different from truth; It IS the reverse of truth.</p>

<p>That said, Intellectuals must pursue TRUTH and try to change the world, but they should never be bound to a politician, or politics in general, because politicans and politics are the reverse of truth. </p>

<p>Instead, they should try to investigate the gears that are behind the politics, because that is the sore and ugly truth that runs the political machine alive everywhere.</p>

<p>Exposing Trump only is pointless. Exposing Hillary only is pointless. They are only a part of an elephant&#39;s skin. The elephant itself is much vaster and much deceptive than the candidates themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Truth, strength, and benevolence.  </p>

<p>If Hillary is guilty of crimes, she should be jailed.  If Trump is legit guilty of crimes, let him face the consequences too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a certain sense he was right.  Money is power and influence represented as a token.  Religion was a massive form of wealth for a long time - if you were God&#39;s designated representative on Earth you naturally commanded great wealth... even if it was hard to quantify.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which to Christians is a direct move against God, since money becomes an idol.  We&#39;re all trapped in sin whether we want to be or not and whether we are aware or not.  Even if it&#39;s all hooplah make belief for control or if it&#39;s actually true; were still stuck....externally. </p>

<p>Our minds can be freed. </p>

<p>Edit: this type of conversation always makes me think of that saying &quot;the greatest trick the devil ever did was make everyone think he wasn&#39;t real.&quot;</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s kind of a cocked argument, but there is obviously duality in nature and we can get really existential and objective about 0s and 1s and make sense of it all.  Love and fear.  We are what we are because of the hold that fears have on us keeping us from being whatever we want.  It defines us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no need to get spiritual about it.  </p>

<p>I am discussing monetary theory that even a staunch atheist would agree with.  Money is an imaginary shared language of debt.  To put oneself as an agent of God transfers a large part of that debt of shame and mortality directly into one&#39;s personal coffers.  </p>

<p>Nor do I ascribe a morality to it.  Humanity is a massive group of billions, capable of both miracles and horrors.  Money is one attempt to create rules for how that mass interacts and directs its resources.  Religion is another.  </p>

<p>Ideally our combined efforts would be concentrated on relieving suffering and progressing into ever more advanced technology, which can then multiply our efforts even further.  The system that allows us to manage ourselves most efficiently towards these goals is the best.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree; except that you said to not get spiritual when my very first comment was about Adams selling out the idea of God.  Hard not to be spiritual.  My whole point was that there were darker motives at play even then.  </p>

<p>The problem we are going to be increasingly facing going forward is the transparency offered by the Internet is going to make much of the corruption and back room deals of yesteryear impossible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics, culture, the health of a society, are all bound up with race and religion. The political system that works for white Protestants may not work as well for white Catholics, and it may not work at all for Hispanics and blacks.</p>

<p>America was founded by white Christians, for the benefit of white Christians. The Declaration of Independence is a white Christian document. Other races have tried to simply lift the American system of government and apply it to their nations. Guess what? It fails.</p>

<p>What works in politics for whites does not work for blacks. It does not work as well for Hispanics, or Asians, either.</p>

<p>It may be that as the percentage of white Christians in America dwindles (due to decades of applied white genocide) that the American system of government will become impotent and irrelevant. We see this happening already, with various groups denying the importance of the pillars of the American system, such as the Constitution, the first and second amendments, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s silly.  The constitution should reflect rules that can be applied to all humanity and create happiness, and it does for the most part.  </p>

<p>Freedom of speech, when actually ensured, creates and environment of progress through debate.  Freedom from unreasonable search and seizure allows citizens to feel secure in their own person.  </p>

<p>Just because the founding fathers were all white does not mean they wrote rules specifically for whites.  And the Christian part is just obtuse.  Jefferson in particular was noted for being outspoken against Christianity.  </p>
