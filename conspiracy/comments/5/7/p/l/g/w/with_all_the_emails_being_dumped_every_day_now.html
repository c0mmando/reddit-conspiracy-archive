    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll go out on a limb and say a *<em>global economic collapse</em>. I believe that&#39;s why the US charged Deutsche Bank $14 billion, to trigger the global economic collapse. </p>

<ol>
<li>There&#39;s a global derivatives bubble tied to every country, and most banks.</li>
<li>Counterparty risk means that all major private banks and central banks around the world are tied at the hip. They&#39;ve insured each other, but when one has debt many times the size of their country, the entire chain is going to shatter.</li>
<li>If the US wins this case, which it would, Deutsche Bank would have to claim bankruptcy or bail themselves in by skimming their depositors. (Merkel has already said a bail-out [taxpayers pay] is not going to be approved.) If they announce they&#39;re going to bail-in, a bank run is inevitable.</li>
</ol>

<p>No country or central bank will be able to save themselves given the massive leverage from the derivatives bubble. Because of counter-party risk, all <em>major private banks and central banks around the world</em> are going to pop, there will be bank runs and many bankruptcies. I don&#39;t know how long this will take, one month, one year[?], but it is going to happen. </p>

<p>OH AND guess who we can thank for what will absolutely by far be THE LARGEST financial wreck in the history of human kind? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation">Bill Clinton said Glass-Steagall Act is no longer necessary.</a>, but that&#39;s what was protecting citizens from banks taking deposits, and <em>gambling</em> our money NOT investing.</p>

<p>Read more, <a href="http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/10649/why-hasnt-massive-derivatives-exposures-at-banks-already-led-to-disaster">for a watered down explanation of derivatives</a>, for <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/five-banks-account-for-96-of-250-trillion-in-outstanding-us-derivative-exposure/27127">US derivatives exposure</a>, and to read up on <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp">counter party risk</a>. Once you put these pieces together, you&#39;ll start to see the cliff in front of us and have your oh shit moment, if you haven&#39;t already. </p>

<p>The key is this massive ponzi scheme can only continue to work if no single bank fails, goes bankrupt or its customers produce a bank-run. (I really need to copy-paste this rant... ugh)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this whole Yemen thing is getting blown out of proportion (no pun intended), some rebels shot a missile at a ship, the ship shot back at a few houthi camps. Either way the Saudis are already involved in a war witt the Houthis, I don&#39;t think the US joining in on an air campaign against them is going to kickstart WW3. I could be wrong, but just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the reason for the missles being shot at our ships is due to the 3billion that just got paid to Saudi Arabia to pay for more missles. The retaliation was on three radar platforms even though the missle never had a chance of connecting to the warship. That&#39;ll show them; or you know, send more civilians to arm and become rebel fighters.</p>
