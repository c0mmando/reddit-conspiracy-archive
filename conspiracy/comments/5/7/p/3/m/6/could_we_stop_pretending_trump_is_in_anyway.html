       The conspiracy group is being played SO HARD by the trump campaign right now. His handlers at Breitbart know what this movement hates Clinton more than anyone else and knows what you want to hear. it is unbelievably clear that couldn't care less about any of this, he is just an egomaniac who wants to win to protect  his ridiculously fragile ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that separates him from the people who run things is that he is a complete and utter moron. He is closer to the puppet dictators put in place, which it was leaked long ago is exactly what he told his VP (that they would run the show and he would be the puppet).
      </p>
      <p>
       To throw the weight of this movement behind someone who has completely redefined how dishonest a politician can be is an enormous detriment to the movement and reaffirms many people's belief that the whole movement is living in a dream world with Alex Jones completely divorced from reality.

       As an outsider (of the US), I don't see how being anti-Hillary means you are pro-Trump. This sub has understandably been much more anti-Hillary recently because of the leaks, but I don't see how that means this sub is throwing their weight behind Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything this sub has just become a more reliable news source considering how skewed the MSM is towards Hillary. Again, that doesn't mean we're all happy about Trump either.

       Yeah I see what you mean. He called out Trump for being a rapist and misogynist so he can't really support Hillary either if he truly stands against those 'characteristics'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this sub because it doesn't feel like it's anyone's personal vendetta but everyone is just searching for the truth behind the mainstream. Accusing the people of here being biased against Hillary just goes to show how despicable and hidden her agenda is.

       I was banned from 2xchromosomes for calling bill clinton out on his rape shenanigans. The problem with the left is that they CAN simultaneously hold two contradictory ideas in their brains and have no problem what so ever with being hypocritical about it. This is why you can't debate the left. Their ideology is not secular.... it is religious. They believe in what they say and hear, not because it's objectively true or verifiable but because they WANT it to be true.

       Donald trump grabbing a pussy? EVIL RACIST SEXIST MISOGYNIST. Bill Clinton abusing his office to rape multiple women? Water under the bridge please stay on topic its not hillary's fault she din do nuffin.

       YES. There are very few policy stances on which I agree with Trump. In fact I don't agree with most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by him hammering his anti-Clinton stance, he is also smart enough to try and rope in the Berners or at the very least, get them to vote third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton completely took this constituency for granted (in fact it's pretty clear she actively hates this voting block), and has merely assumed they'd vote for her once she cinched the nom. She did this even after shitting on the supporters and the delegates in his favor, and holding a dirty campaign. To me, Clinton holding this arrogant assumption that she'd just sweep up Berners post-nom was a huge mistake. Trump is capitalizing on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't want to sound self-important as a Bernie supporter, but they represented almost half of all Dem votes cast (more, if you're cynical and believe Clinton rigged the vote).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're the Republican nom, you'd be blind not to realize that if you can get a chunk of former Sanders supporters to either vote for him OR get them to vote for anyone but Clinton, you stand a good chance of winning.

       His interests as an american businessman are already at risk by the clinton's and their globalist agenda. Who the fuck do you think is going to pay back the 18 trillion dollars worth of debt? The poor family on EBT who don't even own their home or the people who actually have wealth which can be foricbly taken from them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's intentions may not be the purely to 'save everyone', but even if it's just to save himself as long as he saves other people with them that's certainly better than the dystopian nightmare proposed by hillary and crew.

       I despise them and will not vote for either of them. But she's evil and brilliant. He's not. If you put a gun to my head and said "CHOOSE!" I would vote Trump, because he ultimately may be easier to outsmart and obviously has more Establishment enemies.. Fortunately, we're not there yet.

       If Trump was a real threat the media wouldn't be pretending to hate him so much, they would ignore him and focus on some other shill "bad guy".  It's amazing that a population that grew up watching "professional" wrestling can't see the obvious similarities with our modern political voting process.

       Its a reality show brother. Humanity was programmed to have a dualistic nature.  Me vs You. Us vs Them. Coke or Pepsi.. Paper or Plastic.  Its everywhere you look.   Two choices, pick one.  As long as they control the two choices, it doesn't matter who wins.  Alex Jones shilling for him should be enough for most to see beyond the veil.  Consider this:   You can believe in all possibilities,  you do not need to make a choice.  There is an infinite variety in the gray area between.  To vote one or the other is to participate in a corrupted and destructive system that has never represented or helped you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump WAS a threat to the globalist agenda or control structure, he would be ignored and they would put someone in his place tomorrow.  The only reason they didn't like him in the first place is because he was not brought up through the traditional selection process which is darker than most can imagine.  So instead,  they can just control him with some far more advanced MK-Ultra like program the moment after he is sworn in.

       It is a possibility that some of what you are saying is true and what we are watching is something that is scripted on the level of a professional wrestling match. If I found that out to be true I would not really be surprised.

       I think one of the reasons that some people here are leaning towards Trump is because people here are more informed on what a scumbag Hillary is. We know that she is an extremely dishonest and dangerous person.

       We are desperate for real leadership in this country.

       thank you for speaking your mind. I may disagree with some of your points, I may agree with some of your other points. Regardless how your words make me feel, I will defend your right to express yourself, no matter how much I may disagree with it.

       we do not live in the kind of country where a tweet can get you two thousand lashings, but it's getting close.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, you may find it rather difficult to convince other people of your idea's merit if the strongest part of your argument is calling them an idiot for their beliefs. you may find that a lot of us in this community are very open to ideas as long as they're provided with some kind of metrics grasp onto.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen, with my own eyes, the metrics that are in the Wikileaks, for example. I am able to see, and through critical thinking means, realize that I was being played by the DNC. this is coming from someone who has been a liberal all of my Life, voted for Obama twice, voted for Bernie California primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the process of arriving at your reasoning, with regards to 'how hard the community is being played', have you ever considered how maybe your community is being played by the same methods? have you seriously considered why the other candidate needs literal Army of Internet trolls to AstroTurf and correct the record? does that make you feel like you're being played?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am by no means trying to come down on you. I'm legitimately curious about the epistemology of your reasoning.

       Clinton and Trump are horrible candidates for different reasons. I'm for Trump simply because he doesn't have the power the Clintons have and he never will. Any presidential candidate who can do what she does and gets away with it will never have my vote. She's corrupt and corrupts everything she touches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will be effectively neutered if he wins but it will also bring about change in our country because it'll show people are not happy with the status quo of what we have now.

       This is one of the more ridiculous anti-Trump statements I've heard:
      </p>
      <p>
       "He tells you exactly what you all have been saying and that's BAAAAAD!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The flip side is that he acts like every other establishment politician and gets critiqued for not being any different than the mainstream. At which point, you could say "we're getting played" as well. Under your logic, the guy can't win.

       Anything is better then HRC, period. I say give the guy a chance. He is not a career politician, he is not going to play games with terrorists like Obama and Bush. You act like we have a choice. We all know politicians are all corrupt. Some may ask, what does it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       It matters because Trump is independently wealthy and NOT a career politician. That's why it is so important for TPTB make him lose. Well, that and TPP won't pass if Trump is around. The money they are dumping into this election would be a drop in the bucket compared to what they are going to bring in with TPP, TISA and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't the Republican party be putting any money toward Trump's campaign? That's the real, very telling question.

       The lovely thing about theories, they need no proof. Once there is proof, it's no longer a theory. It's the truth. There are very talented and enlightened minds that engage this sub. I am more then honored and humbled to share my thoughts with such people. Thank you all. To call or imply any true contributer to this sub stupid or gullible is telling, OP. Your going to have to work on your subtly.
