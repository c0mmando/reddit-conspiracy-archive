       Just a reminder that this election doesn't really matter. The Israel-First deep state will still try and overthrow the Syrian government, and the domestic situation will continue to deteriorate. Just the same path we've been on for 30 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the media emphasis on these two candidates is to make you look away from what's happening in Syria right now, and ignore that the government itself has been almost completely taken over by banking and military-industrial interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election is akin to an abuser letting you have the choice between getting punched in the gut or slapped in the face. And then making you think you did it, after it happens. "You
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       this!" they will say, as they continue to destroy the middle class. "At least the other person didn't win! Can you imagine how bad it would've been if that had happened?" Trying to make you feel lucky and blessed, as we are being looted. Good cop, bad cop. Look at the right hand so you don't see what the left is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's psychological manipulation of the highest order. It's a distraction. They are playing a trick on us, so we think the important thing is the election, and that we have genuine choice. We don't. They own our political system. They own our media. Until this deep corruption is addressed, choosing our political figurehead means next to nothing. It's a gold star we put on top of a pile of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real revolution comes from self-empowerment through awakening to the reality of things, not from a single binary choice you make once every 4 years. I know you know this, but everyone needs a reminder once in a while. It's easy to get caught up in the emotionally-charged propaganda that is seeping out of every media pore, but keep your eye on the big picture even if it makes you feel alone to do so. You are not alone. The more that wake up, the more that will join, and
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       has to pave the road for newcomers. We are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get distracted by mirages created by the media. Keep your eye on the ball.

       They're both useful idiots, for different purposes. I think Trump being seen as generally unstable could actually give them
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       free reign to start wars. I really don't think one is better than the other except for the PR image it conveys to the world, which is basically pointless

       Sure, I mean they wouldn't have killed JFK if it didn't matter. He does have some influence, it is a powerful position. But they don't let people get that position if they don't already think the person will work for them. Trump has already shown his zionist colors, he's a warmonger all the same

       I guess. But it's not clear one will be better than the other. With Hillary we get guaranteed war in Syria, and with Trump we get guaranteed to look insane to the rest of the world and to probably have riots and on top of that there's no guarantee he won't turn around and sell out even faster than Hillary did. I really have a hard time seeing one as being better than the other.

       As you've said, it really doesn't matter -- Trump has only gotten this far because he's been
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to do so. Ultimately, it's a win-win for the those pulling the strings. I believe he's a plant, but also the ideal Plan B. He's a litmus test &amp; barometer for America's underbelly, and has now exposed it for all the world to see. HRC is a fascist albeit still cloaked, whereas Trump is blatantly open. With each supporter he gains, it allows more openly fascist tones and themes to be introduced versus the usual pony show required. Trump shows there's a contingent desperately
       <em>
        wanting
       </em>
       to be ruled in this fashion. Either way, no "candidate" is allowed if they can't be controlled in some manner. JFK (and his brother) were the last symbols to truly go against the system, and now serve as a reminder to those who forget or are in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember:  The president of the United States is the most powerful
       <em>
        marionette
       </em>
       in the world.

       This is a perfect way to put it. Him winning actually opens some doors for them because they can just go "whoa, crazy trump is dragging us in to this war" while they heat things up in Syria and beyond.

       I wouldn't want to be president, it sounds like the worst job in the world. Everyone is out to manipulate you and get things from you. And you live in this weird bubble of political advisers that you don't necessarily get to pick, sounds very annoying to have to balance all the endless demands and prioritize things correctly.

       Exactly. Trump vs Clinton is lose-lose. They design it this way, to make us think we have options. It's like this:

       the problem with being so certain that the game is so badly rigged and the establishment so almighty is that one can end up overestimating them, bolstering the illusion of power they require to wield control, that one ends up feeling disillusioned and suspicious of any and every possible positive step towards fighting the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       was Brexit really a 'loss' for the establishment or did they want Brexit to happen for some nefarious reason? if we assume the game is so badly rigged that no positive steps can be made, then surely we must be suspicious of Brexit, Wikileaks, and even conspiracy researchers like David Icke and Alex Jones. Perhaps the 9/11 truth movement is simply another tentacle of the establishment, created to mislead and confuse us...
      </p>
      <p>
       Be skeptical and critical - yes. Be skeptical of Trump's anti-establishment credentials but, unless you are absolutely certain, don't dismiss the possibility that he could be 'for real'. You don't have to support him, just be open to the possibility that he could be for real, because like it or not, the Trump phenomenon has exposed the rot of the establishment (of course the rabbit hole goes much deeper, but we have to start somewhere) to a far greater extent in the American public than i have ever seen. Obama said 'hope and change (the establishment)'. Trump is blatantly stating and showing that the establishment (the state department, mainstream media, FBI, justice department, electoral process, etc) is crooked and the electoral process rigged. Conspiracy theories have never been more credible and acceptable to the public consciousness. If this is all part of the plan of the establishment, we should be optimistic about their self-destructive tendencies.

       I agree with you on a lot, this is an awesome post, and a great metaphor that I am going to steal. That being said, here's why I think one is better than the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have the
       <em>
        expectation
       </em>
       of war. Both have the
       <em>
        expectation

       of corruption, and lies. Both have the
       <em>
        expectation
       </em>
       of being controlled by the dark state. Both have the
       <em>
        expectation
       </em>
       of doing things only out of self interest. Both have the
       <em>
        expectation
       </em>
       of generally handing a shittier country and world to the people.
      </p>
      <p>

        One of them already has the track record, and no reason to change course.

       But Trump could sell out even harder than Hillary. The track record reduces the variance, but with Trump we literally have no fucking idea what might happen next and it could be absolutely awful. Just for the sake of the
       <em>
        appearance
       </em>
       of stability, I would probably take Hillary over Trump. Because Trump will probably do everything, but worse, and ham-fistedly, and everyone in the world will be laughing at us, and it may cause a lot of domestic destabilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither option is a win for anyone. I view both as incredible dangers. I wish people would vote Jill Stein. If you want someone who will actually shake things up, and has a track record of doing so, why not vote for her? Why gamble on this billionaire madman?

       Think outside yourself a little bit. The world is a lot bigger than your meaningless opinion that will decide your meaningless vote between meaningless candidates one time every four years.
