    <div class="md"><p>But, I think thats where its interesting.  Trump was selected specifically, I think, because he was the only candidate Hillary could beat, on the republican side.  She&#39;s so unpopular, so many scandals, so universally seen as a liar and corrupt, let alone the e-mail scandal.  </p>

<p>I think the bankers felt it would be easier for her.  And that Trump possibly thought it would be over within a month, or quicker.  But because people are so fucking pissed off at the world, politicians, the government and everything else, and thats everything Hillary represents.  </p>

<p>Seems the bankers miscalculated.  </p>

<p>Its clear to me that if Hillary was a &quot;normal&quot; candidate, she&#39;d have been able to win 20 times by now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious... </p>

<p>How does Donald get compensated for this supposed fake candidacy? How much is the time of a billionaire worth?</p>

<p>How much damage will be done to his brand when he loses? After all, his whole existence is his image. He&#39;s spent his whole life creating it.</p>

<p>His image is worth more to him than all of his money. </p>

<p>Donald Trump would never agree to purposefully losing. It&#39;s going to damage his image &amp; self esteem forever.</p>

<p>If he loses I doubt he&#39;ll survive long enough to see the next election. It&#39;s kinda like when one of the partners in a long time married couple dies. The survivor can&#39;t live without the other. If  Donald looses his carefully crafted image of himself he&#39;ll die. It&#39;s that important to him. </p>

<p>Edit - Wording </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I believe this to be true myself, but I thought about it the other day.  I think trump ran, for publicity, to get some jabs at Obama, and he didn&#39;t like the direction of the county.  I do t think he planned on running AND winning.  Once he won the primary he decided well fuck, I am super duper great aren&#39;t I, and I want to spread my greatness to all the people who helped me get here.  Then they further continued to beat the hell out of his character and worth as a person and billionaire.  That&#39;s when be lost his shit, decided to to say fuck all you mother fuckers; you think I don&#39;t know how this works?  I&#39;ll show everyone how this really works.  Because then even without a win which he wants, he can at least fuck them over too.  The MSM has many reports on thier tv shows saying he&#39;s trying to build his own media empire, but I think that&#39;s TPTB trying g to relay to him what his consolation prize can be if he settles down.  but I think once he ditched his campaign chair and got bannon and kellyanne in there,  that&#39;s when he flipped the script in his head and knew he could win it.  I think he still can win it, and I think if bigbusiness is telling me how terrible of a guy he is, they must be really in oh shit mode and know it also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are both right. The election is rigged and they needed a candidate she could beat. I think they just needed a candidate that people would believe that she did actually beat. They knew how much damning information was already in the public domain about her and that any win would be tough to explain. Rigged or not they don&#39;t want 60 percent or more of the country saying &quot;there is no fucking way she won!&quot; Like with Bernie Sanders and all of the questions after the primary. Another good reason for using Donnie boy, his larger than life, don&#39;t give a fuck style gives the msm plenty of fodder for distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Im worried. It seems that some major change is going to be implemented and soon. The more I watch the news in general and the election in particular, I feel like they are hiding less and less. Like they don&#39;t care who knows what they are doing because TPTB believe it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that she is going to win, but I&#39;ve been wrong before. Also, I think they would still enact any plans they have regardless of the winner.</p>

The government has a history of manipulating foreign elections for years, what makes you think they don&#39;t have the power to manipulate election in domestic soil?  Trump and Giuliani are Hillary&#39;s friends for years, it&#39;s not even a secret. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. My sentiment and comments regarding him are basically represented here. Not sure how I missed your post, maybe I was chillin&#39; in the hot tub. But, ultimately, I agree with you. Which is why I say what I say about Trump. I think he is 50/50, and hopes he is playing the long game and pulling a Putin. I don&#39;t give away too much, but I have experience with this. Putin was a god send to Russia. I&#39;m not going to get into how I know, but he was. Savior of the the world and people? Fuck no. But did turn things around, for Russia. I&#39;d vote for Trump. Just haven&#39;t decided if I wanted to vote at all. Because I despise this whole system, much like some of the Founders would if they lived in this day and age....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad we&#39;re on the same page. I agree, the founding fathers are rolling in their grave watch the corruption, and much worse watching the people not stand up to take what is rightfully theirs. I&#39;d say most Americans are not even close to aware of all the corruption, the owned media, the shit food, the corrupt medical system and synthetic drugs they push on people, the horrible education system, the rigged elections. I have great respect for Putin, he speaks the truth. Much more so than the western leader. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not perfect eitherX lots of corruption there as well, but it still feels better than what we have here.</p>

<p>You definitely peaked my interest as to how you know what you know about Putin, but that can be a conversation for another time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that if Trump was ever a plant he has since gone rogue.</p>

<p>Basic timeline:
1.(A bit hazy on the exact order of events in #1 but you&#39;ll get my point) DNC/establishment has been speculating potential candidates against Hillary for months. Field looks weak, excellent for Hillary. They realize email scandal will break, and will not be able to be contained. Massive and unprecedented corruption and fraud as you&#39;re aware. In order for Hillary to have any shot at wining, she needs to run against an unprecedented candidate...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enter Trump. Energetic, lively, and able to slay career politicians in debate. Clean enough past to get the nomination (with enough DNC elbowgrease of course). However, he&#39;s inexperienced, and prone to being somewhat of a loose cannon when correctly provoked. The Clinton&#39;s <em>know him well</em>. They know his weaknesses, his friends, all of the dirt that has ever existed on him is in their hands. They don&#39;t need to do anything with it until after the RNC. </p></li>
<li><p>As a matter of fact, not only will they not do anything with that dirt... The Clinton campaign has had to work very very hard. Understand that. Not only did they have to take the primary (scrupulously or not) over Bernie, but they also had to coax Trump to a primary victory as well. Now maybe he won the primary fair and square, but there are definitely back room deals going on to make sure this thing lands. <strong>The Clinton campaign&#39;s goal was to win not only one, but two primaries before the presidential election.</strong> They have so far succeeded.</p></li>
<li><p>Donald Trump is now right where the Clinton campaign wants him. Experts of the American Culture that has been created over the last how many years, his complete and utter destruction is the next small step between another establishment presidency.</p></li>
<li><p>Donald Trump has massive popularity, and is exponentially more prepared for a real race than the Clinton campaign expected. At whatever point Donald realized it could be for real, is when he went rogue. I think this probably coincides with his learning of the scope of the email scandal. She won&#39;t make it through that. Maybe that was before the primaries. I don&#39;t know. But he&#39;s trying to win now.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rather than using tools like an upstanding, capable, thoughtful, patriotic candidate; the Clinton Campaign is using the tools they do have at their disposal. Lies, and soap opera-esque state media. They know people can&#39;t resist this shit. But they did not count on Trump gaining popularity like he did, and it is going to be their downfall. Surely some insiders feel that Hillary&#39;s defeat is THE END, so they are going to go to insane measures (read: war, rape accusation, murder(Hyper radicalized leftist goes in the left&#39;s books as a martyr and hero for taking out &quot;The evil racist Trump&quot;. I have no doubt this is how it would be printed in our history schoolbooks. Our education system is an establishment of the left, but that&#39;s another post. ))  to put roadblocks in the path of Trump. </p>

<p>Who knows how this will all pan out. Like I said, there are certainly people of massive worldly power who see Hillary&#39;s loss as &quot;The End of The End&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this a fascinating idea for sure.  Do you think, as I do, that if Trump wins that, an attempt will be made on his life by a Russian man?  Muslim man seems likely, but the fact that they keep talking about Russia, makes me think thats where they want to invade next and need a reason to start the war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought this was a possibility for a while, but no longer believe it.
I thought that his history of supporting Hillary and donations, and friendship with Bill combined with the crazy shit he was saying and lack of platform was fishy.</p>

<p>Now after the leaks and his second debate I know better. He was pushed by the Hillary campaign because, as said in their emails, she was a flawed candidate and their best bet was with Trump, Cruz, or Carson. Also we see from the emails that the Dems had left leaning people working as right leaning talking heads. So basically she focuses her attacks and attention to Trump and legitimizes his campaign. Her focusing on him builds his support as do  the people on the &quot;right&quot; working on behalf of the dems.</p>

<p>So in reality he is an unwitting &quot;plant.&quot;</p>

<p>I was just explaining what I believed and why I no longer believe that way. I personally have been a long time third party supporter, an I don&#39;t think Trump has a chance in Hell. Hillary has been chosen for over a year to continue whoevers agenda in Syria and the middleeast.</p>

<p>I have to say though, I love Trumps latest final approach of no games just telling everything about hillary. It is really refreshing since the media is censoring the email leaks.</p>

<p>Expand on that if you will.  What specifically do you mean?  </p>

<p>That we as a culture get all bent out of shape over Trump saying pussy, but dont flip out about Hillary leading the charge to nuke Iran or vaporize brown people in Syria via drones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course. Our media is 100 percent focusing on speculative stories about Trump possibly being a sex offender while ignoring evidence that show long term corruption, lies, and criminal activity that would have ended any other politician at any other times career.</p>

<p>Look who pushes the PC culture and how volatile they are. I am in political groups for the left and right, and I have only ever been banned for disagreeing by the left. The right will gladly allow the left in and argue all day. They don&#39;t expect a safe space. The left has made any minor offense an ostracizing worthy, unforgivable offense. Completely unforgivable. They are willing to accept war as an alternative. Trump saying something sleazy in private is now a worse crime than Hillary pushing for the bombing of a country, violating election laws, rigging the election, planting fake controversies, and antagonizing Russia and pushing for war.
These PC movements don&#39;t get this extreme organically. That is why you see Billionaires pump money into them (like black lives matter).</p>

<p>An organic PC movement is like this: There is a real problem, there is a push for change that over reaches and then compromise. A terrible analogy would be like the gun lobby asking for grenade launchers when in reality they just want people to agree to let them keep their guns.</p>

<p>This movement started out as transgender awareness, and it worked, people were more aware and there were discussions and it opened minds. However it is intentionally being kept alive to manipulate people and it has morphed into something absurd. It is now actually an offensive parody to true activists and trans people, but that&#39;s not the point of it anymore. The radical left has co-opted it. Sorry it&#39;s late and a hard concept for me to articulate because I am still working it out (not making it up, but just saying it). It is becoming about freedom of speech, and hate speech (look at Uni of Toronto) and keep a fire burning in liberals that make them much more aware of words than actions.</p>
