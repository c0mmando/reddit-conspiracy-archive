       No matter what the shills say remember OP, EVEN IF a human could tolerate the base level of radiation emitted by the VA Belt, solar flares amplify the strentgh,duration and range of the VA belt by 5 and 6 figures multiples. Since there is no way to predict the strength and timing of the solar flares no one without a death wish would go into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also during the first moon landing the sun was experiencing RECORD solar flares, which surely would have fried any humans in a craft.

       now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The new study, in rodents, shows that astronauts could suffer from a phenomenon called "space brain" during the long trip to Mars, as cosmic radiation bombards their bodies and damages their brain cells.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Researchers exposed the laboratory-bound rodents to a level of radiation similar to that expected on a six-month one-way trip to Mars. They found that the radiation caused significant long-term brain damage, including cognitive impairments and dementia, a result of brain inflammation and damage to the rodents' neurons.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The researchers said the new study revealed a far greater extent of brain damage than what was hinted at in their shorter, six-week study, conducted last year.

       Or maybe what we learned was how to make a butt load of money off of designing stuff for NASA and they decided to throw the moon, Werner Von Braun, and the Apollo program under the bus for that.  Of course, I'm a whack job even among the tin foil hat crowd, so what would I know?

       The space shuttle was not supposed to be the end of manned space exploration. It was supposed to be the next step. What do you think happened when it wasn't? Do you think they all planned on heading to the bar that night for drinks and a laugh? And after NASA showed the defense contractor community how lucrative it could be to make a profit on the development of a vehicle do you think these companies wanted to go back to risking their own funds?

       If the mission was succuessful as they claimed than there is no risk. Also there were no private ventures into space until very recently and as usual they all have failed, so profit is a non issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask rocketdyne, the company originally contracted to build the shuttle what they think about the viability of the moon landings in the 60's/ Ask the nasa employee who filed a 1500 page report about the flaws in the shuttle(of which only 500 exist today,though no one can find them anymore) and than mysteriously died.

       If what mission were successful?  Are you referring to the 30 unmanned or the 7 manned lunar missions that occurred through 1972?  And for your information there were the today's equivalent of billions of dollars spent on the manned exploration of the Moon and billions more spent on the development of the space shuttle.  And you're going to tell me that profit wasn't involved.  That's straight up BS and you know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Rocketdyne, they make rocket engines.  Always have.  You don't know what did happen, and you claim to know what didn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rockwell designed and built the shuttle.  They made a fortune doing it too.  So much for "profit is a non issue."  They designed the shuttle on a contract that reimbursed them for their costs and paid them a profit on top of those costs.  That's the first time any aerospace company had ever made a profit on development work.  They pioneered the way for the waste, fraud, and abuse that is our current day military procurement system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a system that offers the contractor $1.15 for every $1.00 they spend.  It's not even so much a contract as it is an invitation for a company to spend themselves rich at the taxpayer's expense.  Once the rest of the defense corporations saw how much profit could be made from designing a vehicle or weapon, they were all in.  As far as most defense and space contractors are concerned now, there's no reason to ever build anything as long as they can make money on designing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you catch any of that while you were analyzing your Apollo moon walk footage?  Of course not!

       So what do you think NASA did when they found out the shuttle was inadequate to continue our manned exploration of the solar system?  Do you think they started pumping out news about the exciting discoveries they found examining the rock samples returned to Earth with the astronauts?  Right, because that would make them look like total dicks.  What actually happened?  All of the sudden they started pumping out the propaganda about how there was nothing to be found on the Moon. It was a useless rock.  Funny how foreign countries like China and Russia picked up on that theme too.  Clearly they didn't want America to have a 50 year head start on mining the Moon.  Nothing to see here.  No money involved at all.

       The obvious reason to send men to the Moon is to exploit its resources.  It's made of the same stuff the Earth is made of.  That means there is gold there.  There is platinum.  There is titanium.  Lots of aluminum.  Lots of iron.  Uranium.  Plus there is no life, so no ecosystem to protect.  The resources of the Moon are our birthright. We were there first.  Don't give it up.

       It is difficult to have any sympathy for someone who is denying a major accomplishment of the United States of America by furthering a propaganda story concocted by the failed Soviet Union originally and is currently being perpetuated by shills for NASA and the contractors who own them.  The 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing will be celebrated on July 20, 2019, less than 2 years from now.  Which do you think NASA would rather do, have the world believe that those 6 successful Moon landings were faked, or answer questions regarding why we have been unable to repeat that that accomplishment for the last half century?  I'll bet those shills will be working overtime for the next 21 months.

       Hell, we wouldn't want to ask any hard questions like where the $#!^ has all our money been going for the last 50 years?  You do realize that NASA's current funding in real dollars (an oxymoron) is the same as their average funding prior to and through the Apollo program, right?  Rockets aren't new half a century later, and SpaceX pretty well proved they don't have to cost as much to develop too.

       Yeah, but banned? I don't have to talk about conspiracies in that sub. I didn't know there were rules against discussing such because there's no explicit rule. Also, I was never asked to just stop questioning it, which isn't a problem for me. I've repeatedly asked if I could be unbanned while respecting these
       <em>
        implicit
       </em>
       rules, but I've yet to get any response explaining why I should remain
       <strong>
        permanently
       </strong>
       banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... spin it however you like -- they're secretly censoring that sub.

       I'm not spinning anything, but I'd have to say that is excessive.  Ideas don't die because they are repressed.  It only lends them credence. The fact of the matter is, there is a conspiracy involved in the Moon landings, it's just not the one you think exists.  You should follow the money.  That quote didn't originate with Woodward or Bernstein.  It originated with people who want to know the truth.

       Did you ever wonder why Werner Von Braun's position at NASA was retired with him?  That's a significant question.

       I believe the moon landing and Apollo missions were faked. But, after reading
       <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">
        this analysis,
       </a>
       I am no longer certain that the Van Allen belts pose an insurmountable obstacle, and so I no longer include it when discussing the Apollo hoax. I do not have adequate scientific background to find holes in the analysis, but I am open to revising my opinion if somebody tell me why it's bupkis.

       Couldn't get the link but do a Google search on scientific american 1959 van allen. They sent geiger counters into the belts back then and the radiation is indeed lethal. Since Nasa is still lying their ass off about the moon landings its hard to know, but I'm pretty sure the Mars rovers are real. Machines can be sheilded to cope with the radiation and it seems implausible its fake. They should come clean about the moon landings however

       Have you ever wondered what will happen to these "radiation belts" when the Earth's poles flip?  AAAAAHHHH, run for the hills, the sky is falling! Or maybe not.  Maybe the real conspiracy is all the crap you've been fed about the "horrible evils" of radiation.  How kooky is that?

       It's usually presented as an either or proposition, but I think it could be that both the van allen belt and the moon landing are fake. From a flat earth perspective, the belt may have been made up initially to explain why we could never travel out into space but then the moon landing was faked to solidify the heliocentric view without accounting for the earlier lie. Hope that helps.
