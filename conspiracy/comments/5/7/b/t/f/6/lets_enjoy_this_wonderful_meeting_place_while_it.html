        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If HRC becomes president, which is highly likely, places like this will be shut down.  She already controls the corporate media (TV, Cable, Newspapers), social media (FB, twitter and most of reddit), and her sympathizers control education and entertainment.</p>

<p>The last few bastions of free speech for free thinkers critical of the establishment will be very easy to shut down.  CTR already controls the political content on reddit.  When HRC has the budget of the federal government at her disposal, it will not be hard to made reddit censor everything.</p>

<p>4chan will probably just get nuked (metaphorically speaking).</p>

<p>So, my friends, lets raise our glasses and enjoy the last few months we have and be glad we were here to witness all of this.  And good luck in the years to come.</p>

<p>She already controls the corporate media (TV, Cable, Newspapers), social media (FB, twitter and most of reddit), and her sympathizers control education and entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She doesn&#39;t control any of that, they are working with her and that&#39;s it, it&#39;s the owners that are in control and shilling for Hill. Politicians are the puppets the wealthy are the puppet masters, learn your power structures. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>CTR already controls the political content on reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No Reddit already has a liberal bias and majority, CTR just gave people like you something to further divide yourself from the rest of us, and it also gave people who have trouble thinking critically an easy out for any tough argument by calling out &quot;triggered!&quot; oops I mean &quot;shills/CTR/etc.&quot; Divide and conquer/poison the well is completely in effect with this, whether by accident or by design.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The only thing nuking 4chan is the new owners lack of funds and the steadily declining quality of content now that every edgelord and autist drifts there. There are still some pretty good content but nothing like it was back in the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is probably mostly accurate. I think reddit as a whole is probably left leaning, and they&#39;re probably more anti Trump than anything. </p>

<p>I consider myself a libertarian, but I&#39;ve always voted Republican (because sometimes they actually win), and I have a list of things I don&#39;t like about Trump that I append things to daily.</p>

<p>So I imagine independents who are not opposed to voting for a Democrat would lean toward her.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just not a Democrat. Maybe it&#39;s growing up in a military family, maybe it&#39;s just the way I&#39;m wired.  I&#39;m not trashing the Democrats. It takes all kinds, this is why they make many different flavors of ice cream. I&#39;m also very liberal socially. So I don&#39;t feel well represented by the Republicans either .  This all might add up to me liking Trump, if he could keep his mouth shut.</p>

<p>People give those in power too much credit, in the end of the day, they&#39;re just human and capable of being stupid just like you. I don&#39;t see them fully controlling anything, they have centralized power, but still. If people start rioting after the Hillary election, you&#39;ll probably start seeing people from the military/police start defecting. </p>
