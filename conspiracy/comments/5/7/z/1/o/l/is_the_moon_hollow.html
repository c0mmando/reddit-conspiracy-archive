    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the theory alright, except it&#39;s not a theory that holds much water.</p>

<p>Logically it shouldn&#39;t be there according to our theories. If it broke off from the earth it would spin faster than it does because angular momentum is conserved. Yet the moon rotates once every 27.3 Earth days. You know what&#39;s funny too, that the sun rotates at the same rate as the moon, if you track sun spots, then the sun rotates once every 27.3 days. If the Moon was captured, it&#39;s orbit would be much more elliptical, so that&#39;s not it. Also the moon doesn&#39;t orbit Earth along the equator it&#39;s actually ~5 degrees off relative to the equator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current most-supported hypothesis is that the moon was formed during the early days of the solar system when a small (Mars-sized, approximately) planet collided with the earth. Much of the debris that was created didn&#39;t escape Earth&#39;s gravitational pull and eventually coalesced to form the moon.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that angular momentum is conserved, so <em>at the time</em> the moon - and the earth - would have been rotating much faster due to the collision. However, due to tidal forces the Moon&#39;s angular momentum was sapped by the Earth over time, resulting in its current state of being tidally-locked to the Earth.</p>

<p>That being said, that particular hypothesis isn&#39;t foolproof either, it&#39;s just the one with the most supporting evidence right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, exactly my point, there&#39;s a lot of peculiarities about the moon that our current cosmological model has trouble explaining. If the moon was really a spin off from the Earth, there would be similar elements in the Moon as found on Earth, only they&#39;re isn&#39;t. There isn&#39;t much iron or other heavy elements, obviously there aren&#39;t many oxides as there&#39;s no oxygen rich atmosphere like here on Earth.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the collision hypothesis is that the composition of the moon and Earth are similar. It also explains why the Earth has so much iron and nickel near the surface. According to our current best models of planet formation, heavier elements would sink toward the core over long periods of time, which doesn&#39;t explain why Earth has such a high concentration of them near the surface. If Earth collided with another planet with a nickel-iron core, it would end up being scattered across the Earth&#39;s crust. It also explains why the moon&#39;s density is so low - the lighter elements would be most likely to remain in orbit to coalesce after the collision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t downvote you.</p>

<p>And the equation follows: g = G(m/r<sup>2)*.</sup> The moon&#39;s mass, m, is 7.347x10<sup>22</sup> kg; the moon&#39;s radius, r, is 1.737x10<sup>6</sup> m; and the gravitational constant is 6.674x10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-2</sup> . Therefore, the gravity of the moon is 6.674x10<sup>-11</sup> (7.347x10<sup>22</sup> / (1.737x10<sup>6</sup> )<sup>2</sup> ) = 1.62 m/s<sup>-2</sup> . You can do the same for Earth if you want. </p>

<p>In addition to that, you obviously don&#39;t think we&#39;ve landed on the moon. What do you say about <a href="https://youtu.be/_loUDS4c3Cs">this</a>? How does a hollow moon not collapse in on itself? How did this moon come to be?</p>

<p>*using this equation because m2 is negligible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re trying to say here. First of all, earth&#39;s gravity is 9.81 ms<sup>-2</sup> , not 8.7 ms<sup>-1</sup> (also acceleration =/= velocity. Believing crackpot theories about the moon and not even knowing what gravity is. Not a good look). </p>

<p>Second of all, the moon was created by a Mars-sized planet crashing into Earth. This impact stripped the outer layers of the earth, but left its (very dense) iron core untouched. The moon does not have this iron core, so its density is far less than that of Earth. It&#39;s still a solid sphere.</p>

<p>You might want to revise that statement. While we haven&#39;t been back as often since the Apollo missions as we were before they occured, there have been a number of missions to the moon in the last couple of <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunartimeline.html">decades</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it takes a lot of effort and fuel to get into a polar orbit. Due to the spin of the earth, all rockets (and hence all satellites) are moving west to east, rather than north to south. To change the orbital inclination enough to get into a polar orbit means changing your momentum to a completely different direction - which requires a lot of fuel. Therefore, if a near-polar orbit is sufficient for a satellite&#39;s needs, there is no reason to change it so that it directly passes over the south pole. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was thought for some time that Mercury was in synchronous rotation with the Sun. This was because whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, the same side faced inward. Radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that Mercury has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in the same positioning at those observation points. Modeling has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin–orbit state very early in its history, within 20 (and more likely even 10) million years after its formation.[9]</p>

<p>Venus&#39;s 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian solar days, making approximately the same face visible from Earth at each close approach. Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.[10]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At which point is enough enough? We&#39;re arguing <strong>theories</strong> not facts. Ones which you have clearly not been educated on, you&#39;re reaching for ways to disprove or undermine my statements, and failing miserably. And for what purpose? No one will read this thread, this is between you and me right now, so what&#39;s the point? Are you trying to have a discussion in order to broaden our perspectives on the matter, or are you just trying your hardest to prove me wrong, and offer no alternative point of view? Because if it&#39;s the latter you are a half assed intellectual. You&#39;re even worse if you accept a <strong>theory</strong> as fact, and feel antagonized by someone proposing a different <strong>theory</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, you&#39;re dense. Tidal locking is not up for debate. It has a very clear and concise definition. You&#39;re saying Venus could be tidally locked to Earth BUT BY DEFINITION OF WHAT TIDAL LOCKING IS, that&#39;s not possible. Sorry, &quot;kid.&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need evidence to explain a definition. Tidal locking is what tidal locking is. If I pointed to a chair and called it a television, you&#39;d think I was fucking crazy. That&#39;s essentially what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>I know perfectly well what the definition is. But <strong>you&#39;re not considering the facts,</strong> you are imposing artificial constraints on a definition to suit your needs. You are not explaining anything, you are not furthering this discussion, and I refuse to be drawn into a pissing match.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also why are you responding to a old ass post that I don&#39;t even care about any more. I don&#39;t even think there&#39;s such a thing as flat Earth, we don&#39;t live on a fucking pancake. The whole point of this thread was some guy asking if the Moon is hollow, well, maybe it is, who the fuck knows. It has no magnetic field, no heavy iron core, it&#39;s density is 1/3rd that of Earth&#39;s hence why it only has <strong>1/8th</strong> the gravity, despite only being 1/4th the size. Maybe it is hollow, and has an outer shell and tunnels similar to an ant colony. </p>

<p>Even Mercury has a strong magnetic field because it&#39;s almost as dense as Earth and has a solid metalic core, no such luck on the moon, why?</p>

<p>We have no clue how the moon got there, we have theories, but all the accepted theories have glaring holes in them. So no kiddy, we know fuck all about it, we send some rovers to take pictures, and get some dirt samples, but we haven&#39;t explored.</p>

<p>If we really knew the moon intimately there&#39;s be more than a few pictures and the vast majority of them wouldn&#39;t be artist&#39;s renditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I believed anything. More assumptions on your part. The OP asked if the Moon is hollow, I said with it&#39;s low density relative to its size and lack of magnetic field(which would require a heavy magnetic metal core) we can&#39;t really be sure. It also doesn&#39;t help that we haven&#39;t been back since the 70&#39;s to carry out more experiments with newer more advanced instruments.</p>
