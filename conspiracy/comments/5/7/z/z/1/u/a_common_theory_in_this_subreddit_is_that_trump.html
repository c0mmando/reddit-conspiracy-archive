    <div class="md"><p>That was my suspicion, the emails imply the DNC helped to get him there as his old friend Hillary would lose to literally anyone else who wasn&#39;t certifiably insane, maybe Trump realised after winning the nomination and being popular despite talking out of his arse most of the time he could be in with a shout. Why not? People voted for George Bush after all, stupidity is clearly an asset to some voters. Still a slightly better choice than Hillary. </p>

I also have my sun in 8 &amp; Saturn is up in the party makin me too serious to be a real Gemini. Yanno Mercury wants to be whatever he&#39;s surrounded by &amp; in my chart, he&#39;s always hangin with the Mars &amp; Pluto boys - so he&#39;s the pensive side of the coin. I think the hubs&#39; easy breezy Venus is offset by his Aquarius bit. He&#39;s punk-rock luxury (haha like that could exist.) it&#39;s a pretty fun mashup. And lol at your hub&#39;s Gemini yelling.

    <div class="md"><p>Hehe yeah. I&#39;ve had enough alarming developments to know I don&#39;t want none. </p>

<p>Now that being said - I threw away the horary chart on Assange, but I did get the 29&#39;s on an island (or pretty much surrounded by water). 29 degrees  - as you know  - is finality. That being said, I&#39;ll say what I wouldn&#39;t yesterday. His time in the embassy is definitely at an end or soon to be - I think he could be dead. (8th house from the 8th house.) the uk is an island, but idk if he&#39;s there - could be Cuba, could be Florida, etc. </p>

<p>The horary charts are never wrong. I, as an interpreter, am often wrong. And like I said - I may have cast my net too wide, but there you have it. I love Julian, have supported him for years, and I hate to even propose it. At this point, I feel like it&#39;s buried enough to spill. :((</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uff. It&#39;s so a different thing. It&#39;s a chart of circumstances cast at the time of the question (not related to birth) which has signifiers to explain what&#39;s up. The moon is the main deal - her interactions within her current house tell the answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow this is really fascinating do you hand cast or do you use a program its got so many components ...and do you know where they explain the 29 [is that being last to 30 degrees where the sign would shift] or is there more to it i would love to read that TY again so much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you Trump sheeple will just have to wait and see. Trump won&#39;t even fart without first asking Israel for permission. And even then, he employs a whole team whose sole goal is to advise him on which direction to fart, so that he never lets out a fart, unless it benefits Israel.</p>

<p>But as with Obama sheeple in 2008, into whose head you could in no way beat any sense, Trump sheeple in 2016 are just as helpless. So as with Obama, Trump sheeple will simply have to wait until he takes the office to understand who he really is. Trump was (s)elected a long time ago. Hillary is just a distraction, much as John McCain was for Obama.</p>

<p>You may remember that before Obama was put in the office, there were posts all over the internet saying he was the anti Christ. This was part of the plan, much as Trump is portrayed as racist woman hater.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ruling out that he is a plant by any means. I&#39;m just interested in figuring out why they want him to expose all of this.</p>

<p>I remember there was a comment when Obama won on Reddit, someone snapping going, &quot;You fools. You think he is going to bring change but he is just part of the system... Nothing will change etc. etc. &quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna try to find it.</p>

<p>Trump is different to me. I feel like he&#39;s an American and we all know him. He&#39;s been in the spotlight and he has raised one hell of a family and corporation. Now he&#39;s at the end of his life running for president why? Cause someone told him to? Cause he wants more money, power, and fame? Seriously why is Trump a plant?

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. That is interesting. I do remember circa 2008 the &quot;Obama Deception&quot; video and other docs of the like.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ruling out that he is a plant by any means. I&#39;m just interested in figuring out why they want him to expose all of this.</p>

<p>I remember there was a comment when Obama won on Reddit, someone snapping going, &quot;You fools. You think he is going to bring change but he is just part of the system... Nothing will change etc. etc. &quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna try to find it.</p>

<p>Edit: OP delivers </p>
