        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed many people who have never posted before, suddenly popping up, it is obvious who they are, although they all have different intents to distract, they are all performing the same duty. </p>

<p>I have noticed something VERY odd though. </p>

<p>An abundance of them are 4 year members, which is questionable.
Most were also very active 5 months ago. Which is odd. </p>

<p>No one is being named here. </p>

<p>Take notice yourself, as I have been checking nearly every user who makes a thread that I want to read, but half the time it turns out they have 37 upvote karma, and -17 comment karma.</p>

<p>The weird thing are these 4 year old accounts, they always sit near 200-500 post karma, and 500-1000 comment karma, and if you try to look at their activity, it is also extremely evident.</p>

<p>The weird part is this: did they (either people payed to be distractions, political parties, new corps, etc) have those accounts setup early, 4 years ago sitting and waiting for when they would need to be used to distract/persuade? </p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Did someone create a bunch of accounts and somehow make it say they are older accounts than they really are, as most of these accounts don&#39;t have post history beyond the 5 month mark. </p>

<p>LMK what you guys think.</p>

<p>So your saying they were made beforehand by some people who just made a ton of accounts just to kinda have, and they found a way of profiting off of selling old used reddit accounts? </p>

<p>Still leaves one question though, many of these accounts do not seem to have anything beyond 5-6 months ago, posts or comments, or am I missing something there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that they were legitimate accounts at one point that had been hacked over the years. I remember seeing something about how a lot of the accounts being used by CTR had been inactive for months-several years. Then all of a sudden they are just Hillbot CTR users every post over the past year. This is all speculation over my own and a few others observations.

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain to you, why you are wrong.  </p>

<p>Take the low-carb / ketogenic movement. Despite <em>mainstream</em> media and medicine claiming that neither are healthy, the movement possesses the following:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>A substantial global collection of anecdotal evidence, comprising of MILLIONS of individuals who have used the dietary intervention to lose weight and / or control (or reverse) their type-2 diabetes.  </p></li>
<li><p>A collection of highly qualified medical and scientific practitioners, advocating on behalf of the dietary intervention. These individuals are able to debunk conventional wisdom, and have made great strides in providing the scientific foundation to support the low-carb movement.  </p></li>
<li><p>It has become known that there has been a massive conspiracy against many of the proponents of the low-carb diet.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Where does Urine Fasting stand? Nowhere.</strong>  </p>

<p>People who are ill and dying, are desperate. God knows, if I were dying of cancer or AIDS, I may be tempted to try urine fasting. So it goes without saying that as urine fasting has been around for decades, that thousands of individuals have surely tried it by now.  </p>

<p>So where are all the anecdotal accounts of how it works?<br/>
Where are the doctors of patients who cured themselves?  </p>

<p>Doctors of patients who cured themselves of type-2 diabetes, are now some of the most ardent supporters of the low-carb / ketogenic diets.  </p>

<p>So why are there no doctors, of patients who cured themselves of cancer or AIDS, out there screaming about this cure?  </p>

<p>Because there is no cure.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re just a sad, lonely, delusional individual, who derives some kind of sick pleasure, from spreading misinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am well aware of the end game, all of this is a distraction, they want a one world government, they could do it without WW3, but Russia stands in the way of that scenario. The treason, the mass surveillance that the United States performs is so massive that they would not be able to defend it if it were to be truly unmasked, this is why they try to distract as much as possible.</p>

<p>If Russia is in the picture: WW3, if they succeed in eliminating the Russians, they can then setup their one world government, pretty much martial law at all times, censored everything, etc. </p>

<p>If Russia wasn&#39;t in the picture: EMP, False flag terrorist event, or something else obviously pre-meditated would occur, leading into martial law, confiscation of weapons, leading to a unfathomable police state, leading into their one world government.</p>

<p>If they ignore Russia: Use Russia as a pawn/scapegoat (once again, this includes EMP, False flag terrorist event, cyber hack, etc), leading into martial law, leading into conscription, for the war that would still likely take place to attempt to annihilate Russia. Before this though, we would likely cut off Russia from trade after we blame them for whatever, causing them to pretty much have to go to war. </p>

<p>Soo many distractions available, at this point, this is their endgame. One world government.</p>

<p>By they, I did not mean trump, hillary, or obama. Doesn&#39;t really matter, they could void the entire election, find a way of disqualifying both candidates (doesn&#39;t shit like that happen during times of war?), and keep obama, and the situation I referred to above is still likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t posted long, fairly new account, but I made it to post in unresolvedmysteries. I started checking the news pages and politics, then when the emails dropped those pages went crazy and i was eventually led here just to find out about the good leaks.</p>

<p>I would say though that some are definitely shilling, but a lot are just people who may feel like they should make an alt account to comment on certain things and/or conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>I used to get my alt news fill from ATS but it its meh now. I have noticed some of my original memes I made for ATS popping up on FB and other places though. Its wild seeing an illuminate meme you made years ago on ATS in the wild on fb.</p>

<p>But anyway, yeah some shills, some socks, some curious.</p>

<p>Did someone create a bunch of accounts and somehow make it say they are older accounts than they really are, as most of these accounts don&#39;t have post history beyond the 5 month mark.</p>

<p>I think this is a more likely answer.</p>

<p>If you think you&#39;ve spotted a shill, or just some asshole and you want to access a detailed analysis of their account history... check out the link to this little gem.</p>

<p><a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/">http://snoopsnoo.com/</a></p>

<p>I had someone make a comment in reaction to something I said. They said &quot;strong words for a dentist&quot;. Only 3 possibilities, one is that they dug through a hundred pages worth of my account history, two they somehow know who I am (Some agency, surveillance etc.) or three, they used snoopsnoo.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good for spotting shills. But it cuts both ways. Someone can easily use this to scope you out as well. Just keep that in mind.</p>

<p>EDIT: Snoopsnoo does not work on shills, gives a server too busy, they are already shutting it down.</p>

<p>EDIT: try eFF_Dragon, does not work for me, many others. They are hacked accounts or something, there is no way they cannot be searched. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen accounts where the user posts away about only one or two topics  and they have a 5 year old account. Use snoopsnoo and it shows a dead account with a sudden spike in activity in the last 6 months.</p>

<p>Yep, shill confirmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>:o, I have yet to be able to pull up anyone (shills(I can pull up myself and you and normal people, but not them)) on Snoo, it always says server too busy, try again in a few minutes, but my computer suddenly stopped playing mp4 files, gifv, etc for some reason, youtube still works fine, but it makes no sense as everything is up to date (chrome edition, etc etc).</p>

<p>I think they are NSA/CIA linked, there is no way for them to be able to be this secretive and shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, I will say this. This kinda applies to me. I come and go out of this sub because sometimes it gets overwhelming. The last time i left was during the flat earth and jade helm situation. I couldn&#39;t just couldn&#39;t take the fact that people just stopped researching and folks would post garbage. I returned about 4 months ago and starting commenting and re posting a weeks after. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in this sub for 3 or so years. Check my post history and clarify what I am saying. The trend that I&#39;ve noticed with this sub is, people will do research and prove it right or wrong. Then some time will pass and then when you don&#39;t agree someone you are ultimately a &quot;shill&quot;, then the garbage posts start coming and that&#39;s when people take a break. </p>

<p>This community used to be based off of, do research, provide sources and discussions. But now it just goes through different phases. </p>

<p>Edit:
My account age is 1162 days which is 3.18 years old. My post karma is 5897 and my comment karma is 2731. </p>

<p>You cannot delete my comments, lol. Only the moderators/admins/reddit final/mini bosses and the Watchers may delete my comments.</p>

<p>Some people have nothing to hide though, what about them? What about those who TRULY have nothing to hide? Are they Karmatards for having 5 year old accounts?</p>

<p>Just like when your out and about, you pretend like their is a camera on you at all times, when your on the internet, you should assume someone has an eye on you at all times as well.</p>

<p>The internet profiles you as well coincidentally, those ad&#39;s that try to sell you things you were looking at? etc etc. </p>

<p>People buy WOW accounts, people buy fake currency in video games to purchase data, data that they don&#39;t truly have possession of. </p>

<p>What is so crazy about the possibility of people buying reddit accounts? </p>

<p>Shall we discuss this constructively?</p>
