        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is clear to anyone with half a brain that despite Trump&#39;s idiotic moves and retarded behavior, he is still a lesser of two evils. Hillary will simply leave the world in ruins once she leaves the office. It is quite scary. I beg of you, especially those in swing states...register to vote, and vote Trump.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is rude. That&#39;s nothing compared to what Hillary has done. There are real problems in the world (many caused by Hillary), but people only care about Trump being rude and hurting people&#39;s feelings. No surprise there as Clinton and her friends own all the media. Hillary is EVIL.</p>

<p>She receives money through her foundation while in office from greedy megalomaniacs who execute homosexuals. She is a neocon warmongering imperialist who has been instrumental in undermining the stability of Northern Africa and the Middle East. Is this incompetence?... No, even worse, it&#39;s much more sinister than that. She has bullied women who dared speak out about her husband&#39;s sexual misconduct (not just threats of such). She lies about everything nonstop, from Benghazi to Haiti to the e-mails, and I can keep going and going. It doesn&#39;t get more evil or corrupt than Hillary.</p>

<p>Trump is no JFK, and with him we are probably doomed. But with Hillary, being doomed is a certainty.</p>

He has already accomplished so much, and no matter how bad shit gets he would 100% be fine because he has the money and the status to protect himself and his family. He could&#39;ve have sat back and relaxed and enjoyed the fruits of his labor for years to come and let the corrupt establishment continue to eat away at us.
But he&#39;s not doing that. He&#39;s going out there every day fighting for us regular Americans that are being squeezed out. It&#39;s extremely commendable and I really hope he is given the opportunity to make this country prosperous again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that Clinton is basically a complete fraud, a monster even. But that being said, I do not believe that Trump is merely &quot;rude&quot; and that his problems boil down to &quot;hurting peoples feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>If Trump is elected, his views -- his racist, sexist, classist, views -- will serve to further undermine people of various statuses, those who are not considered up to standards in accordance to hegemonic ideals. His &quot;rudeness&quot; is more than that, it is repugnant. If his beliefs become further embedded into the system, it will become even more &quot;us vs them,&quot; (e.g. xenophobia, discrimination, harmful social policies, etc). If these views occur, then the country will become even more stratified, and different groups of people may arise to protest, resulting in the potential for an epic cataclysmic event to unfold. </p>

<p>There are no lesser of two evils in this situation, they are both evil. I don&#39;t want either elected, but the way I see it, BOTH of them have the potential to spell out the end for our society. And frankly, maybe this is a controversial opinion, but I don&#39;t care -- I think it&#39;s time to start anew, whether that means rebuilding the government or literally a cleansing from nuclear war. I&#39;m just losing hope for humanity, and I think we&#39;re better off taking the risk and letting the illusion we call &quot;civilization&quot; collapse. </p>

<p>Is there a preferred way to let this occur? I don&#39;t know, there never really is, as this would of course and inevitably entail violence and struggle. But we&#39;ve had thousands of years to figure our shit out and just haven&#39;t -- things just get worse, even when there is one step forward, there are steps backwards as well. This goes beyond Trump and Clinton, this is global catastrophe in the making. And from my postmodernist leanings, it seems as though &quot;if you think you are part of the solution, you are actually part of the problem.&quot; Both the Trump and Clinton supporters are in essence, imposing their own narratives of truth upon the world, shunning all those who disagree, further perpetuating conflict. No matter who wins, it&#39;s the same: Humanity slips into chaos gradually over time as the billionaire elite make a mess of the world. </p>
