<p>Trump is supposed to symbolize a nonviolent revolution. And like I said, the info just being out here seems too easy. Obviously Trump seems to be fighting an uphill battle. Maybe that&#39;s the intent.</p>

<p>What if he&#39;s an insider, sent out to achieve the trust of angry Americans so that if/when he wins the election as the underdog,Reagan-style, he successfully opiates the public back into trusting the government as Hillary takes the fall.</p>

<p>With that, the fake revolution ends and the establishment fully retains all of its power and dives back under the radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>”we had him and we were robbed&quot;. Talking about Bernie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t get it twisted, bro.  Bernie’s part of the problem too.  He was the single and lone figure that killed the bill to audit the The Federal Reserve corporation.</p>

<p>That alone right there should tell you a <em>loooot</em> about where his true loyalties lie and who he really works to protect.  He’s an Ashkenazi Zionist Khazar Sayanim in <em>super</em> deep cover through and through.</p>

<p>Doesn’t matter what nit picky legislation he makes a public show of working on “for the little man!” (making so many people go “See???  <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/64/38/a7/6438a76000f8de425240ba1a0e156b6b.jpg">He works for us!”</a> lol smh) if, behind it all, your main objective is to protect that corporate, multinational, fractional reserve lending corporation that’s responsible for the majority of the planet’s woes in the first place and that’s kept this nation under veritable slavery for so many decades now.</p>

<p>Think about that for a minute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wish we had a million person presence on the steps of DC and the white house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This and having a sustained, multi-million person presence all across the nation is what will indeed cause change.  Correct.</p>

<p>You know what that means though?  It means that we the people would have to do things <em>ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>…and we’ve been taught and indoctrinated into NOT wanting to do that.  We’ve been taught and indoctrinated to not want to do things <em>on our own</em>.  We’ve been taught and indoctrinated to want <em>others</em> to do things for us - “representatives” that we “elect” to do things “for us” (pshh).</p>

<p>We pick people to do shit for us that we need to be doing <em>ourselves</em> and then we wonder why these people we elected turn around and fuck us royally and not do a single things we asked for the moment we elect them.</p>

<p>It’s <em>our damn fault</em>.</p>

<p>We need to get up and <em>do things OURSELVES</em>.  We need to all come together and create the right kind of country and society for us, BY us - and that’s not going to happen so long as we continue allowing ourselves to believe that we “need” these “elected” pieces of shit to do things for us which they never do at all anyway.  We need to realize that they never work for us in the first place.  They work for the establishment which does NOT have our best interest in mind.</p>

<p>It’s pretty much all on us as a citizenry and our unwillingness to STOP being lazy fucks.  We need to stop with the “It’s gonna be too HAAAARD to do things on our own!” mentality that we have.  That’s part of what’s keeping us from doing what we <em>need</em> to do together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who are tired of the partisan BS they feed us to keep us divided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  And there it is right there, sir.  Correct.  This system keeps us divided amongst ourselves and convinces us that the only way that this country and this world will work is by giving all our power away to these faux leaders so that <em>they</em> can “do it for us and protect us!” since they’ve convinced us that we can’t do shit on our own.  “You’re useless, citizen!  You can’t do anything unless you let <em>us</em> do it for you!” - when the fact of the matter is that all they’re doing is actually ensuring that things actually <em>remain</em> corrupt and broken and imbalanced and working only for the elite and against everyone else/us.</p>

<p>This is the mentality of the people we are entrusting to “help us out”.  We need to stop and think about this fact long and hard.  We are sheep that are literally entrusting evil wolves to protect us.</p>

<p>What the fucking <em>fuck?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Joined in arm and hand with every intention of running off all the crooked politicians from their positions never to return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, is definitely a big part of what we need to do.  Yes.</p>

<p>I never said they were the same.  Matter of fact, I specifically pointed out their differences, so I don’t know where you got the idea from that I said or thought they were the same.</p>

<p>Bullshit.  Look in the God damn fucking mirror.  This is the kind of defeatist shit that we as a citizenry have allowed ourselves to be convinced of by TPTB - that we have “no power” and the only possible say we can have any hope is through the piece of shit “representatives” that we cast our shit ballots for.  Give me a fucking break.  Little could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>No real sane human being should want Clinton to win.</p>

<p>But Donald sucks big time as well.</p>

<p>You’re essentially taking the knife and sticking it deep in your gut because you don’t want to take the gun and blow out your own brains.</p>

<p>I understand the sentiment, and wouldn’t entirely disagree.  Things, of course, <em>will</em> be fucked if nukes get dropped.  Certainly.</p>

<p>Don’t get yourself thinking that everything’ll be fine under Trump, however.  That would just be straight up insane thinking.</p>

<p>Yeah, man.  You definitely <em>are</em> the problem.</p>

<p>I’M THE PROBLEM.  We’re all the problem because we’re not coming together and standing up TOGETHER and as one against the bullshit corruption.</p>

<p>I understand that Clinton seems to be about the <em>worst</em> candidate possible.  Yes.  Trump definitely sucks too though.  So long as you and me and all of us are kind of sitting on our asses and not doing <em>enough</em>…then I think this country’s gonna go down regardless of who’s president.</p>

<p>It’s not up to the government to fix this country.</p>

<p>It’s up to <em>us</em> - the people.</p>

<p>And we’re not really doing anywhere near enough, man.  :/</p>

<p>While I do appreciate  his noninterventionist  stance regarding Russian and Syria I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call him nonviolent.</p>

<p>As the bible says Beware of false messiahs, and Trump is certainly one of them even though i do not believe in the bible.</p>

<p>i&#39;m including almost all of them. i think most people that make it to the ultra-rich club had to do something or give up something to get there &amp; they don&#39;t give two cents about anyone/anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, Trump isn&#39;t exactly known for his strategy. To be unfair I get where you&#39;re coming from. Trump has said as Paul Ryan put it, &quot;textbook racist&quot; things. But I don&#39;t look at his as a virulent racist as much as I do a careless person with prejudices that he lets slip sometimes. Obviously not a good PR personality, but word on the street is we&#39;re going to hear a lot of that from Clinton in some new video tapes from James O&#39;Keefe.</p>

<p>And I know Bill and Hillary are malignant, confederate-level racists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love for a leak to have Hillary saying something cringeworthy level racist, but like I said a while back, I just don&#39;t buy it.  It&#39;s too perfect.  I wish it would happen but I doubt it will.  If it does I&#39;ll eat my hat.</p>
