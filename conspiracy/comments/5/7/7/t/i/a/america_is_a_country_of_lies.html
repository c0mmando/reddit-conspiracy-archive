        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry, I just don&#39;t believe the mainstream media anymore, they have lost ALL credibility with me... My theory is that in reality Trump is leading, and winning big, which is why all of these false flags seem to be culminating less than a month from the election... Especially since according to all of the drive-by media that we are now on the brink of nuclear war with Russia... I believe that those on the inside are willing to do WHATEVER it takes to hold onto their power, at ANY cost... There is no lows they won&#39;t stoop to. Including war... Even if it meant millions of dead Americans... They don&#39;t care about you, you are but a bug to be crushed... They take their orders from the likes of george &quot;satan&quot; soros, the rothschilds, goldman sachs, wall street, etc, etc, etc... These are the folks that want to bring about the destruction of AMERICA, the only nation which truly is standing in the way of their satanic new world order... While they keep us divided with hate for one another, it is very simple for them to accomplish... While Trump may be a misogynistic bumbling moron, he does not hate America...I can promise you that if my theory holds correctly about Trump winning, or being ahead in the polls, there will not be an election this year... Look for a false flag event between now and the election... Possibly a phoney Russian attack... A former naval officer has claimed to have suspicious photos taken within the last few days showing American F-18 Hornets being painted to look exactly like Russian MiG fighter planes... Our leadership or &quot;LACK THERE OF&quot; is deliberately trying to force Russia into WW3... Putin does not want war... These are very scary times...</p>

Tune in from time to time, see what kind of fear mongering they are pushing. Like you said, they are really trying to ramp up the anti-Russia hype back from the Cold War. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, what is happening right now is just unreal, they are going to extreme lengths to get Hillary elected. They dont even cover their manipulation, i just can&#39;t get why people are not snapping out of their illusion. This is like a dream, you see that the whole planet is turning on us, they dumped the biggest load of evidence into us to make us wake up and people are in deep sleep. Cnn is talking about Trumps women accusations literally all day today. I just wana know how many people out there are awaken, i know polls are fake so dont know how to find out. Meanwhile our navy ship were attacked today, and all major leaders basically declared this is the end of the line and they will not tolerate any more of Hillary and the group she works for. We&#39;re screwed, our people are in deep sleep, we&#39;re basically jumping from the cliff at this point.</p>
