        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why are people ok with or oblivious to confirmation bias? Why is critical thinking not a thing? </p>

<p>I remember being a bit younger and having so much respect for CNN, priding myself on my good judgment in being a news consumer. It&#39;s such a terrible tabloid now. Was it aways that way? </p>

<p>Will things ever get better, or is society just doomed to be an association of lemmings? </p>

<p>Is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> the appropriate place to despair??? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bertrand Russell quote On the paradox of fools and wise men:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more news you read the more you realize how shitty the news is. You read news from different sources and see whats added and removed and learn what agenda is pushed. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think old media can compete with the rest of the internet. The information monopoly has been broken. There is more sources that Reuters now.</p>

<p>The only way not to become a follower is not getting spoon feed news from the same source. If you only read <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> the confirmation bias here is going to corrupt your critical thinking for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On TV, all but Fox have become official members of Hillary&#39;s campaign. Same for most major print newspapers and magazines. The movie studios are all left. There is no middle ground.</p>

<p>On the radio, the syndicated talk programs like Rush, Hannity, and Savage are conservative and there is still some middle of the road reporting. PBS is far left. </p>

<p>Blogs and online news runs the gambit but Obama wants to create some sort of truth clearinghouse so there&#39;s only an official version of the truth. </p>

<p>Generally it&#39;s all a cesspool</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That 100%. Megan Kelly went rouge a long time ago from the agenda of that network, Bret Hume is back for a bit, but I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s a robot.  the morning show is an odd parody of morning joe, but less like-able, hannity is full retard for trump, it should honestly be just him and sherif David Clark shoving guns into real dolls of Hillary for the entire hour.  And Shepard smith is about as capable as a seven year old who just ate an a 32oz bag if m&amp;ms at reporting the news.  The editorial teams, I think lays out the best conservative content you&#39;ll find from MSM, but it&#39;s a joke like the rest.  Reuters used to be a good place to read about news, but they jumped to a computer AI to phish news, and you get camped up shit through them too.  Honestly, what I do more than not, is find out where news is happening, find the police scanners and live streams from that area, and listen.  I&#39;m not so dumb I need to have someone tell me what I&#39;m watching and what I&#39;m hearing.  But I watch the news channels sometimes too, cause know your enemy.  </p>
