<p>It&#39;s hard to know what sources and numbers to trust.</p>

<p>With that being said, they are doing all they can to paint Trump as the bad guy, and it&#39;s working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If what the polka girl is saying is true, it would mean the whole &quot;East vs West&quot; dichotomy is contrived. It would mean Trump is a psyop to make people so disgusted by the system they&#39;ll turn on each other. It would mean those who have encouraged the child abuse for the purpose of blackmail might have decided to make everything public. That&#39;s how they&#39;ll destroy America, that&#39;s how they&#39;ll bring in the NWO. In their plan, most will cheer the NWO when it comes.</p>

The person who wrote this submission and the whole conversation didn&#39;t give much info as of how a new world order would play out with how events were going, whereas your statement actually gives an actual conspiracy to talk about. Thanks, let me know if you know any more details as I truly do love talking about this shit and I miss these conspiracies that make you think.

As crazy as that sounds it fits the ridiculous piles of wtf happening on every level pre election and post. What is happening is the outcome that Soros&amp;Co are said to want and Putin believes he is getting. People thinking HRC was the plan are at wits end lollying about wtf DT is doing now. He is setting the stage for US to be saved from ourselves. While we tear apart our own country to scream for them todo so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its arguable, unfortunately, that even that won&#39;t stop it, as whoever has their hands in it will just sit back and back whichever side is poised to win, anonymously, and then take control when the dust settles and the resulting winner is weakened from the fight.

The only way we could do it is to destroy the interested parties, which would be an international war started by an internal revolution, with a lot of surgical executions.</p>

<p>Yup, let&#39;s ban people with green cards because we don&#39;t understand the constitution.  Great.</p>

<p>How could he &quot;get rid of it&quot; when it wasn&#39;t even in place?  TPP hadn&#39;t even received Senate approval?</p>

<p>Sure he didnt necessarily &quot;get rid of&quot; TPP but he didnt allow it to pass, when a majority of the government were pushing for it, including Gary Johnson. Also, Mexico has no choice but to renegotiate. We hold most of Mexicos economic power.</p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;lobbied for him specifically&quot;?  He&#39;s appointed numerous lobbyists to cabinet positions, that&#39;s the point. Now he&#39;s trying to prevent others from doing the same after the fact.</p>

<p>This is exactly my point, billionaire lobbyists are now part of his administration so he makes this executive order (which can easily be reversed by the next President) in order to create the illusion of transparency for people who buy into his sound-bite politics.</p>

<p>He literally said that he doesn&#39;t read the lease agreements that he signs, his lawyers and handlers have conducted the vast majority of business that led to his financial success.

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure there are lots of people worried about conflicts of interests. But owning a golf course in another country by itself is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Trump sold all of the stock he owns, so as much as a global businessman might have conflicts of interest, hes doing a fair job in trying not to have any. And you have to think, Trump is one of the first presidents to ever be an existing real estate mogul. </p>

<p>As for the 2nd amendment, its specifically designed so that citizens, if need be, can defend themselves against a tyrannical government. Just because most modern governments more than likely would never get to that level, its a proper precaution. Just like if Trump was restricting gun righs and than invading on peoples other rights, i want the ability to fight back. The whole point is that you never know when a tyrant will be put in power.

<p>Are you talking about foreign or domestic armies now?  Why are you bringing up completely different points.</p>

<p>The fact that the 2nd Amendment exists in the form it does is a testament to the long-lasting distrust that Americans place in their government.  Trump is doing nothing to quell these fears.  You don&#39;t see people in countries that are actual functioning democracies be clamouring for the right to bear arms to protect themselves from the government do you?</p>

<p>You literally said citizens in Mexico can&#39;t own firearms.  Now you&#39;re backtracking?</p>

<p>Try and stay on point, it makes it easier to have a productive discussion.

<p>Yes i agree, the 2nd Amendment exists because of Americans distrust in government. Thats the whole fucking point. Are you saying a citizenry should put full support and trust into their government?</p>

<p>Look at other countries where either you cant own firearms or firearms are extremely regulated, their governments or criminals take supreme advantage over its citizenry. Most of these places, in example, European countries or places like Mexico. Firearms are  regulated to the point of just a small percentage owning them.They have lost their culture, been indoctrinated and their governments dont listen to anything a large percentage of what the population actually wants. Why? Because there would be no militia to fight the government. Just like if our forefathers didnt own firearms, we would still be apart of the British Colonies. No form of government is perfect, im sure we can agree on that, yet it seems like you would much rather have people bow down to their leaders under any circumstance rather than them having the ability to defend and fight back.</p>

<p>The historical precedent that our forefathers set with the 2nd Amendment is not somehow useless because we live in modern times. It seems that you believe Trump is a possible tyrant. So why would you not want to fight against that regime if it became tyrannical?</p>

<p>I agree that Mexico has to become somewhat of a prosperous nation, but as long as cartels run the state, it will never happen. </p>

<p>Also, Trumps plan is to make it easier to become a legal citizen. Albeit not perfect but the U.S can only do so much from our side of the river.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but what does that have to do with Trumps policies?</p>

<p>I am for a more state and localized form of government, but it doesnt mean the federal government has no part in it.</p>

<p>I believe in the constitution, and i believe there is a purpose for the federal government. And obviously, its taken over too much power from the states, but when i see federal officials advocating for certain issues i agree with, im going to support them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of the federal government is to extract the wealth from the people. to pay the bankers that purchased it. Its a corporation, thats it. the constitution is a document to put limits on what government can do, but it changes nothing about the federal government since its not answerable to the people. It exists outside of law. You are putting faith in a corporation, its president, the trustee and vp and all of its actors to act for the interests of the people when its designed to profit off the people.</p>

<p>Where is the logic in that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you have said is speculation on the Trump administration.</p>

<p>He hasnt done really anything yet to force me into not wanting him to do better.</p>

<p>Local and state governments can be apart of the same network you are speaking of. They all tax citizens for their own interests. And ill concede, local and state governments are less corrupt. But they all are virtually the same thing. It doesnt matter if it is local, state or federal, all three can or can not be corrupt and unjust. Thats what the balance of power is, thats why citizens need to be agressive in criticism.</p>

<p>The feds were not always the extreme enemy, JFK wouldve been considered one of  the greatest president had it not been for his assassination.</p>

<p>I do believe in nation states. Realistically, they are no different than say communes. </p>

<p>I wish that no countries existed, because that would mean we as humans have evolved to a point where culture and religion and all of our differences have been pushed aside.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the world is not like that, especially with the major differences in various countries compared to others. Im just being pragmatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are buying into it because they are uneducated, dismissing it as a facade ignores the real and present danger that Trump presents.  This isn&#39;t &quot;reverse psychology&quot;, he&#39;s taking advantage of the rampant cultural and general ignorance that currently permeates American society.  He outright lies to people about what is going on abroad, preying on their inability or unwillingness to do their own research while simultaneously telling them that any party that disagrees with him is outputting &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

<p>He is a terrifying and ignorant human being, to simplify how dangerous he is by claiming that it&#39;s some kind of &quot;reverse psychology&quot; with the intent of a military police force rounding up the believers completely detracts from the true menace he is.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t find it interesting that the party that supposedly prides itself on the idea of fiscal responsibility doesn&#39;t seem to care about these potential conflicts of interest?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I expect that under the vast majority of modern democracies I should have to worry about defending myself from the government.  The fact that people worry about this in the United States speaks volumes about how ineffective the government has been in terms of making people feel safe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are completely allowed to own a firearm in Mexico.  I think Afghanistan has other issues beyond gun ownership.</p>
