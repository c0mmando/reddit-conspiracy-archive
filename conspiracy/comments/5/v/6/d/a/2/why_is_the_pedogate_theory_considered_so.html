       One thing I find bizarre is that pizzagate, which has huge amounts of circumstantial evidence supporting it, even on this sub it is often considered to be a leap too far. But, I think it's probably one of the least implausible conspiracy theories I can think of. We know about the Dutroux case, we know about the Catholic church, we know about Savile and the BBC's cover up, there are allegations and official investigations regarding endemic paedophilia in British politics, we've heard celebrities come out and say that there is a paedophilia ring in Hollywood... so why is it suddenly so crazy to think there is a similar thing going on in American politics? People always say "if there was just ONE solid bit of evidence I might find it credible". A solid piece of evidence? This is a conspiracy forum, none of the theories discussed on here have any "solid" pieces of evidence, but pizzagate sure does have far more compelling circumstantial evidence than the vast majority of other conspiracy theories, so why are people singling it out? I see flat earthers and chemtrail believers on here getting no flack, but the idea that politics draws in narcissistic psychopaths who love to indulge their insatiable hunger for power and control? Oh yeh that's really crazy isn't it. History is riddled with psychopathic and evil politicians, because psychopathic and evil people are drawn to power and are very good at getting it. It was stupid of us ever to think that this sick kind of stuff doesn't inevitably happen when you get a bunch of these people together and they have huge amounts of power to do whatever the hell they like.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could share one piece of evidence that you think is very odd, what would it be? For me it would be this:
      </p>
      <p>
       On the US government’s Californian secretary of state site (
       <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/">
        http://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/
       </a>
       ) can be found a “LIST OF ELECTED CANDIDATES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2, 2004 GENERAL ELECTION”. See it here:
       <a href="https://archive.fo/C8LxP">
        https://archive.fo/C8LxP
       </a>
       . Go down to page 2 to find Nancy Pelosi’s contact details. Her email address is listed as “
       <a href="mailto:PHILIP@GOATHILL.COM">
        PHILIP@GOATHILL.COM
       </a>
       ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does “goathill.com” take you? To a pizza joint. Supposedly run by a Mr Phil DeAndrade. Why the hell would Nancy Pelosi have a pizza joint owner's email listed as her own in her contact details on a public government document? Why would all these top level politicians have such strong links to pizza joints?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what a weird site it is... the black goat, a common signifier of Satan or Baphomet, the pictures of kids all over it... It's very similar to the Comet Ping Pong site: occult imagery and children. When you add up all the circumstantial evidence, the strange imagery, the weird way so much of it seems to align itself neatly with occultism and paedophilia... do you not think that perhaps there is something going on?

       I think resistance to anything pedophilia related is that it's one of the worst things most upstanding adults can possibly think of.  Because that's so awful to them, they can't comprehend how anyone could be like that.  They take solace in the capture of pedophiles, but
       <strong>
        willfully
       </strong>
       ignore the fact that criminal minded people tend to work together to pull off their criminal bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen statistics that state that 800,000 children go missing PER YEAR.  That's staggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do they go?  Are they all dead?  If not, how are they surviving?  Who is caring for the still alive and yet missing children?  They have to go SOMEWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the truth is, but I know for a fact that criminals tend to group together to more easily pull off their criminal deeds.  Why is it so hard to assume that groups of people trade children (and adults) for their own perverted and devious needs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The average citizen only sees what the news states on these things, and because the general feeling of something as awful as a pedo ring sounds so horrible and outlandish, it's easy to dismiss.  Denial is powerful.

       I mean, those children may only be reported missing for a day or two. I'm sure it happens loads that kids get separated from there parents in cities, or when they try and run away, or it may even happen when a separated parent takes the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree with the sentiment. We know it can happen with a major establishment like the BBC, we know it can happen with the Catholic Church, why is it so implausible that it happens in US politics? You have to be in denial to think it is.

       They don't even collect federal figures on missing kids, you gotta add that up yourself. Missing cars? Yeah we got a federal total for that. Missing kids? Good luck adding up individual state records...

       I heard that 800,000 per year number, too.  It is staggering.  It is unacceptable, too.  They spend more time and energy going after people who smoke plants than they do trying to find missing children.

       Whats the source on this info? The best I could find was FBI missing person statistics
       <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2014">
        like this one
       </a>
       . These stats only show 332 abducted by strangers in 2014?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dismissing the 800k number but I'm curious where it came from because I've seen it a lot and the difference between the numbers is so great it's got me wondering if we are citing accurate stats.

       The stats are from a 2002 study funded by the US Justice Department. They are accurate, but
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v6da2/why_is_the_pedogate_theory_considered_so/ddzlo9b/">
        as noted
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       800,000 kids do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       disappear every year. 800,000 kids get
       <em>
        reported
       </em>
       missing each year, according to the study, but the study also says that statistically speaking, almost none of those cases are actual children who have gone missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of kids who actually go missing, as in they've disappeared, is about 2,500 annually. The majority of those are abductions by family members, usually resulting from custody disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still too many, but a far cry from the huge 800,000 number that gets thrown about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, when you think about it, that number doesn't even make
       <em>
        sense
       </em>
       . That's 8 million kids disappearing in just 10 years.

       Agreed, the number is a little mental, even at 2500. 2200(ish) are abducted by non-custodial parents and 332 by strangers. That's almost 1 per day!
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we need to consider the total number of children in a sex trade
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       reported missing. I've read enough reports by this point to realize that a

        lot
       </em>
       of these children are put up for abuse by their own parents.

       To start with, an optimistic way to look at it is almost one per day in a nation of 350 million people is actually quite good. It would be much better if it were lower, but it's certainly not horrendous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also add though that, if I'm not mistaken, the majority of children put into systematic abuse are not abducted, but instead taken from orphanages or given off by uncaring parents.

       <p>
        I've seen statistics that state that 800,000 children go missing PER YEAR. That's staggering.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also misleading. The figure is based on a 2002 study that has been misinterpreted in many quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The figure includes kids who didn't come home on time and were reported missing, kids who ran away, custody issues (a parent without custody takes the kid and does not return them home when they are supposed to), and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the study, fully half of the reported cases are what they call "benign missing," meaning the kid's parents reported them missing but in reality they were just late reporting in or some such. They get logged if the police were called, but ultimately it's not a missing kid, it's a panicky parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast, vast majority of other cases in the study are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       children who are actually disappearing. Some 99% of them are returned home safe. Most are issues like those mentioned above. Only a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction are actual missing kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the actual study itself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "it is important to recognize that nearly all of the caretaker missing children were returned home alive or located by the time the study data were collected. Only a fraction of a percent (0.2 percent or 2,500) of all caretaker missing children had not returned home or been located, and the vast majority of these were runaways from institutions who had been identified through the Juvenile Facilities Study"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That 2,500 is too many, but it's REALLY DAMN FAR REMOVED from the 800,000 number people keep throwing around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the pizzagate sub on Voat keeps knocking down this number as being misleading BD:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1435600">
        https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1435600
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, stop passing around this nonsense.

       This is 100% true.  When something horrible, and so antithetical to general human empathy, most people subconsiously find it easier to deny its existence than to consider the ramifications of such things if they were true -- as they are, in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember how you felt when you first realized the legitimacy of these kinds of things.  If you were in your early 30s, like I was, your worldview was flipped upside down.  It's a very disturbing mental event, and there are plenty of psychological mechanisms that protect you from such an experience.  And that's exactly what these scum rely on.

       Savile was known to brag about touching up dead bodies and he was a pretty explicitly creepy guy. These people often hide in plain site. Moreover, most people aren't going to assume that a pizza joint is a front for a paedophile ring, it's only because of the context that was obtained after the Podesta emails were released that some people worked it out.

       Isn't it? That seems to be what believers retreat to when a piece of 100% solid evidence is debunked, "But, but literally all the elites are at it and have been for thousands of years, it's global. We moved on from Comet Ping Pong months ago."

       Kid friendly could just mean that it's ok to bring children. Their menu doesn't have a kids menu on it. The place seems very industrial looking too, not exactly Chuck E Cheese. Given all the other evidence and how many news sites, both liberal and conservative, are clearing Comet Ping Pop, it just doesn't make sense to me.

       Ok so it looks like the place is welcoming to kids in the day time but turns into more adult themed at night. Painting in the bathroom may not even available to use by the patrons, could be a private bathroom, I haven't seen any actual evidence that it's out in the open. Nor have I seen any of their commercials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it funny that none of the parents seem to complain about the artwork being provocative or harmful to their children? Why is that? I'm sure there's not a vast reaching conspiracy for that either, is there? Even if I am wrong about it being kid friendly, it's still also rather strange that there's no kids menu.

       I'm just saying all of it's strange to me. As an individual, I have the right to find it strange. You don't have to share the same opinion, and neither do any of the non-complaining parents.

       I admit I am not too impressed with the quality of the artwork.  It is more the occult subject matter that is interesting in a weird way.

       Have you ever seen that subject matter displayed anywhere else?  I am still not sure where they got the idea from.

       Because people are adults and can do what they'd like? I mean looking at the pictures, the place looks like it's for adults but kids are welcome. Sorta like some bars don't allow kids in. Not exactly some huge conspiracy. Their menu doesn't even have a kids option.

       The upper echelons of any criminal organization generally aren't the ones bragging or talking about their behavior in public. It's usually the lowest peons that do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imho, the people posting the pics you are discussing are low level people who got sloppy and arrogant. I truly believe that if pedogate wasn't getting the attention it currently is, those low level people would likely "go missing" or "have an accident". However due to all the attention people like Alefantis are getting, the upper tiers can't simply eliminate the sloppy low level peeps without generating too much attention.

       I don't understand this logic either. If they were truly upper echelon, like they say Hillary is, and how many murders has she committed apparently, there wouldn't be an issue whacking someone.

       Well, the closest allegory we might have to an operation like this is the mafia. If someone is under extreme scrutiny (and possibly police observation) they aren't just going to whack the guy willy-nilly. And, if the mafia allegory holds true, once Alefantis becomes too dangerous he'll disappear, or when the dust settles and no one is watching any longer he will disappear.

       You're underestimating the attention this subject is getting at the moment from a very vigilant and diverse group of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can whack people when nobody watches, but right now it's damn risky business. Seth Rich was on nobody's radar prior to his death because nobody had their radar turned on yet then. Then the emails came out and more and more people tuned in and noticing all the sloppy mistakes that were made in arrogance before anyone was paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots has changed in the game since the emails came out, a lot more people paying attention. We may not have the full picture of the scandal just yet, but if we're certainly gonna notice more folks going missing.

       I hate to sound dismissive but it seems like the vigilant group of people don't really have any concrete evidence if this is happening. I also think that if these people are super powerful, a missing person wouldn't matter. It's almost like a Catch-22. "No one is murdered so they must be getting scared we're on to them" or "So and so's 3rd cousin twice removed was murdered, we're close!"

       That's alright, I have my own doubts about it. You are right in the fact that there is not a single individually conclusive piece of evidence that proves pizzagate at this point, although the recently leaked torture videos of a man singing "I'm John Pode- SING IT!!" as well as another video featuring Podesta's alter-ego nickname "Skippy" do come damn close to proving it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The videos could potentially be forgeries, but if they can be proven to be authentic through image and voice analysis (something the FBI would be more than capable of doing if they wanted to or were allowed to) this whole thing would be blown wide open. So far there is no indication leading us to believe they are forgeries, so the working assumption is that they are authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, coupled with a pinboard the size of D.C. itself, filled with clues and red strings surrounding the case make it the unlikely conclusion that there is really nothing to this story and it's all "fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       Beginning from strangely coded sentences, over known symbols used by pedophiles, to a whole host of cases providing precedent for similar networks, while at the same time having the means of trafficking and money laundering proven in revelations about the workings and dealings of the Clinton Foundation, their immoral and ineffective behavior in the Haiti during the "relief effort", a long history of conspiracy, corruption and sexual deviancy following the Clintons around like their literal shadows, everything paints a rather clear picture. Again, not legal proof of anything, but an undeniable case.

       No problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just read the Wikipedia article about it again which references the suposed debunking arguments used by the New York Times and parroted by the rest of MSM. I find them to be mostly nonsequitors, misrepresentations of facts and proceedings, and invalid arguments. I'll point out a few:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The theory claimed "cheese pizza" was code for "child pornography," since the term had been used in this context previously on the website 4chan. This was extrapolated to other mentions of food in non-political emails. However, as the Times pointed out, the "Podesta brothers were famous in Washington circles for their Italian cooking and big salon and fund-raising dinners, often cooked by their mother."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The fact that they cook well does not exclude the possibility of using food terms in other contexts. Does John call his wife "Honey", or "Sugar"? The fact that most of the mentions of food in the Podesta emails make little sense in a literal reading, but can be correlated with known pedo codes remains and warrants suspicion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theorists linked the conspiracy to Comet Ping Pong, through similarities between company logos and symbols related to Satanism and pedophilia. However, The Times noted that striking similarities may also be found in the logos of a number of unrelated companies, such as AOL, Time Warner, and MSN.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Similar deal. Symbols, like code, are contextual. They can mean a variety of things in different contexts. A V-shape can symbolize a letter, a downward arrow, a stylized bird, a vessel, all depending on the context. Similarly, a triangular spiral or a butterfly can mean a host of innocent things, but it has previously been correlated with other pedo networks and therefore also warrants suspicion. Not debunked. Still not proven.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A photograph was circulated purporting to show President Barack Obama playing ping pong with a child inside Comet Ping Pong. The original picture hangs framed in the White House, where it was taken.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not sure what this is supposed to prove. Nobody to my knowledge has ever claimed this to be proof of anything. Should the general claims of pizzagate hold true, an image like this would certainly warrant further investigation into Obama's involvement, but other than that, an uninteresting tidbit. Not debunked.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theorists claimed an underground network beneath Comet Ping Pong; however, the restaurant actually has no basement, and the picture used to support this claim was taken from another facility.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It was a suspicion that turned out to be false. It has, however, lead to further investigation in the nearby Pegasus Museum, also owned by Alefantis, that is not open to the public, has a room tagged by Alefantis as #killroom (brazen if true, I realize that), and a hidden wall. The fact that CPP has no basement does not negate the general claims of pizzagate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theorists claimed to have a picture of restaurant owner Alefantis wearing a T-shirt endorsing pedophilia. However, the image was of another person entirely, and the shirt, which read "J’ ❤ L’Enfant," was actually a reference to the L’Enfant Cafe-Bar in DC, whose owner was pictured in the image, and which itself was named after Pierre Charles L'Enfant, designer of much of the layout of Washington, DC.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Like some more overimaginative findings often presented by the opposition as proof that pizzagate is crazy (seeing spiral triangles and pizza references all over the place as significant, when they are really not), this was never seriously claimed to be proof of pizzagate. If PG is true, the mentioned cafe could potentially be part of the network, it could be entirely unrelated, it really doesn't matter. It was a potential lead that so far led to nothing and has basically been abandoned. Like all other cases, this does not negate the larger theory of pizzagate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theorists claimed John and Tony Podesta kidnapped Madeleine McCann using police sketches which were, in fact, two sketches of the same suspect taken from the descriptions of two eye witnesses. Furthermore, the claim that the brothers were in Portugal at the time of the kidnapping was sourced only to the conspiracy website Victurus Libertas, notable for, among other things, suggesting that the Queen of England was a reptilian alien.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Whose to say she isn't? I jest, of course, but the theory of John and Tony Podesta being involved in the taking of Madeleine McCann is a lot more convincing than you might think at first. The sketches are intriguing by themselves, and the statement about the eyewitnesses is debatable, as I've come across conflicting accounts of this. Beyond that, there is the whole story with Freud, a known pedophile who hosted John and Tony Podesta at his house in Portugal before, who then let the McCann parents stay at his place too while they were looking for their girl. That's a stunt maybe someone like Hannibal Lector would pull. Something isn't right in all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, to my mind this is still a wide open case. Lots of evidence of nasty business, very little proof and a serious resistance to officially investigate the case, all accompanied by a falsely confident dismissal by supposed "debunkers" in the main stream news who really only plead to the reader's confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know this has happened before, many, many times. From Jimmy Saville, to Jeffrey Epstein, to the Finders and the Dutroux affair and the whole entire catholic church, we know this sick shit happens everywhere. All indications point towards at least two more vast networks of sex slavery and pedophilia in Hollywood as well as D.C., spreading out like a spider web of blackmail and influence across the whole of the globe. We would be naive not to take our suspicions seriously in light of all precedent.

       This is why I can't believe this. There's 7 billion people on this planet, eventually you're going to find some weird but not necessarily illegal shit going down when you keep digging on one person. I find it really hard to believe someone would be as dumb as Alefantis' to have all this shady shit out in the open but still not be charged with a crime or even have someone else snitch on him at this point. Or keep doing shit without getting caught.

       Of course. I was just trying to illustrate that the fact that they love to cook doesn't mean that every mention of food terms have therefore be meant literally for some reason. The fact that they are passionate cooks does not mean they do not use food terms as code to hide more nefarious meaning.

       It may have been another person tagging it, and I am not claiming to know whether it was purely meant as a joke or an arrogant reveal by someone in the know, but in the broader context, it is suspicious.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM">
        A Youtuber by the name of Ryan O'Neal
       </a>
       did a video about some curious connections he drew from the available material concerning the Pegasus Museum and was subsequently threatened by Alefantis (at least that is what he claims) to take down the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there is always a slim chance all the circumstances surrounding this topic are purely coincidental and only produce the mirage of a crime syndicate through our preconceived notions. I realize it could be a very strong case of public hysteria. I really, really wish that was the case, but precedent is what causes me to trust my suspicions, to follow my reasoning as far as it leads and no further, and the conclusion I would draw from this at this point, is that George Webb is as close to the truth of all this as is possible at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       That there are secretive, globalist networks of influence peddlers in all the highest ranks of the world, trafficking in secrets, sex, weapons, slaves, and anything else that's illegal. And that one of the most powerful of these networks surrounds the CIA, the Deep State, the Military Industrial Complex, the Clinton Foundation, Dyncorp and a network of other agencies who may or may not realize what they're actually involved in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the conditions of the theory, Alefantis would be practically untouchable for his high-level connections in politics and law enforcement, combined with the typical treasure trove of blackmailable offenses caught on video, be it the consumption of drugs, engaging with prostitutes or... worse.
You have to wonder how it is possible for the D.C. police to declare the allegations to be unfounded, only to later admit they never investigated the joint.
You have to wonder how it was possible for Jeffrey Epstein to be out of jail after 18 months I think it was, after being jailed for fucking a 13-year old.
Blackmail. The majority of high-level politicians and think tanks in Washington are compromised one way or another, which is why nothing ever seems to be done about this issue. That's why it's being ridiculed and branded "debunked", when it is anything but.

       That email sounds perfectly normal to me. What's the beef with it? It might be worded weird to you, but it's obvious they're pretty good friends and John has a tradition of sending them pasta and they rec'd cheese. I have a family friend in the Nederlands who sends my family cheese, cookies, and butter every year. Very weak evidence to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't see how if the people you mentioned get arrested, who are way more important than Alefantis is, but Alefantis is untouchable. Maybe he's not in prison because there's nothing actually to arrest him on. Epstein was found guilty of soliciting, not fucking a 13 year old. Big difference. He's still a sick fucking pervert and I don't doubt that he did actually have intercourse with a minor, but he wasn't charged with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have with all of this, is that is based on "research" that gets touted as fact when 2 minutes of counter-research quickly disproves the rumors. People make this goofy ass collages, and most people just assume it's fact but then you actually look into, even if briefly, it can be dismissed. There's been too much bad information posted by pizzagateists(?) for me too take it seriously. From the basement in CPP, to the Besta Pizza logo, to them confusing the owner of Besta with another person, them going on Alefantis IG and taking private pictures of kids and passing them off as being some kind of victim, the constant hate boner most of these people have for HRC, and above all else, the glancing "research" of something that can be dismissed just as easily.

       Its all of the pizza, pasta, cheese, and handkerchief emails when looked at together. They are all worded funny. Why is it that so many emails with thise words are written oddly when other emails seem to have perfectly normal sentence structure. Then from btw here you see hes personal friends with Dennis Hastert, and so on and so forth. Theres a lot to explain but you have to look at the big picture. If there was one email that mentioned pizza im an odd way no one would care.

       You are right. It was getting late and I was getting too loose with the facts. I appreciate the correction. To my mind, Alefantis is the current lightning rod and potentially a scapegoat, should there ever come arrests that high up the chain. He seems to be an important cog in the wheel of this machine to be sure, but by no means a kingpin or in any way irreplaceable. From what I understand, he's a kind community organizer of a group of people who indulge in some rather sick phantasies, as well as a provider of CP via a hidden and encrypted directory on his website. Regardless of whether his case turns out to be true or not, even if he's fully exposed and locked away, the larger syndicate remains.

       Those goofy ass collages are simply the result of trying to piece together a very complex puzzle. Some are entirely off the mark, I agree and see how it tanks any sort of credibility of more convincing findings. Others, like those created by George Webb actually illustrate and support his conclusions rather well, so they certainly can have value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that many leads have proven wrong, dead ends, inconclusive or misleading, but many leads remain highly suspicious. The recent torture videos I mentioned earlier, for instance, are highly incriminating, should they be proven to be authentic. An array of other weirdly worded emails remains suspicious (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/duplicates/5ubgwt/john_podestas_connection_to_the_mysterious_death/">
        such as the supposed movie script that was sent to Podesta, very shortly before Scalia's sudden demise
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bh289/wtf_is_this_after_speaker_denny_hastert_was_found/">
        or the one saying Denny (theorized to mean Dennis Hastert) should flee to Japan, following renewed scandals surrounding his child abuse
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or take the $65.000 worth of Hot Dogs delivered to the Obama White House for a party. Even at a ludicrous price of say, $100 per hot dog, it would mean 650 of them were ordered in from Chicago, despite the White House supposedly having an absolute ban on outside foods. It's not unthinkable that it was indeed insanely expensive Hot Dogs (which should still make taxpayers angry), but in the larger context, it's plenty suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, those suspicious details are just that at this point. They neither confirm the pizzagate theory, nor can they be said to be entirely innocuous coincidences with any degree of certainty. That's where I stand, and where I would say most pizzagate "researchers" stand. We find it all highly suspicious and demand closer inspection of it all, but get stonewalled and ridiculed at every turn. Ironically it's the powerful and largely unfounded opposition that convinces many of us that there is truth to our claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all want this to be nothing, nobody wants this to be true. But everything surrounding this case begs us to keep looking, so we will.

       Even with those links, they get discredited pretty quickly in the comment sections. I've already stated my disdain for image collages, they're meant to be confusing but look factual. The image of stating this is where Podesta died and the movie takes place are the same exact place, is actually like 150 miles apart. Texas is really fucking big man.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like target fixation to me, because it sounds weird to you, it must mean something nefarious is going on. They don't even know if Obama actually spent $65k on just hot dogs. And I've never heard of hot dogs meaning little boys in this sense. Sounds like another fabrication. Looking at e-mails and then inventing codewords for those e-mails could make anything sound nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the other main issue I have with this. People are just making shit up, like the hotdogs = little boys, so now an email talking about a hot dog stand is actually codeword for a fuckshack for Podesta in Hawaii that Todd Stern wants to visit. If you read other e-mails from Stern to Podesta, sounds like they have a pretty close friendship, which in that context, makes the hotdog stand seem completely innocent and something again dreamed up.

       No it doesn't. That's a photo of a walk-in refrigerator, and it was at a property being viewed according to a spokesperson. It was never proven to be anywhere, just speculation and a video with crazy leaps (was that the t-shirt seller who fakes the threats?). Occam's razor dude... I believe the werewolf joke more myself. Elites shapeshift and kill every month.

        Who's to say she isn't? I jest, of course, but the theory of John and Tony Podesta being involved in the taking of Madeleine McCann is a lot more convincing than you might think at first. The sketches are intriguing by themselves, and the statement about the eyewitnesses is debatable, as I've come across conflicting accounts of this. Beyond that, there is the whole story with Freud, a known pedophile who hosted John and Tony Podesta at his house in Portugal before, who then let the McCann parents stay at his place too while they were looking for their girl. That's a stunt maybe someone like Hannibal Lector would pull. Something isn't right in all this.

       Do you not get how this makes PizzaGate ‘investigators’ look like 100ct idiots? For a start it was trying to tie PizzaGate to the very few instances of child abduction they had even heard of which is obviously dim.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in more detail the e-fits were based on two separate descriptions given to private detectives almost a year after the sighting. The e-fits only look like the Podesta’s via confirmation bias, and the actual descriptions are way off. The descriptions came from an Irish holidaymaker and his wife, and they didn’t even mention this to police until two weeks after she went missing. The husband actually believed it was Gerry McCann for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clement Freud did not host the Podesta’s at his house, that was made up by someone on 4chan. He did host the McCann’s, which seems off, but he was about eighty at the time and the posthumous allegations were from the 40’s and 70’s. It’s not like pedophiles are cartoon villains who do evil 24/7.

       If people wanted to do research into the articles possibly could be some leads. It at least shows that they are likely to be left leaning, as the articles linked seem to be pro democrat, which means the article would be biased toward the left. I'm not pro democrat or pro republican, so I'm not shilling for either side.

       Go re-read the emails you mentioned. Those people were in press clips, which read just like small briefs. I don't see how you could think they are connected at all to the Podesta leaks because of an email that mentioned 5 or 6 other articles too.

       You're unsure why I would find it interesting that the writers of an article trying to disprove a hot topic such as pizzagate would be mentioned in the leaked emails that started pizzagate? It's interesting to me. It doesn't have to be to you, but don't try to insinuate that it can't be for someone else.

       I never said it was because they worked for NYT. I meant that if they have a history of writing pro democrat articles, as mentioned in the email links, then it could meant that they are anti pizzagate because of their political bias, and that would bias their NYT article.

       You are right it makes zero sense to make it so obvious, as long as given the right context the meaning becomes clear. We are not supposed to know what it is. But the moment you know things take on new meaning.  A perfect example being this mural in San Francisco.

       As a card carrying skeptic (subscribed to Skeptical Inquiry for a time) admittedly reevaluating things now:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: FBI records vault seem to indicate with that first big dump that a lot of the allegations against HRC are true and have been covered up. this lends credibility to those allegations and allows one to consider that she may be a complete criminal sociopath that will do anything for money and power. In fact that seems to fit the data well.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: Elite pedophile rings are real. There are many documented cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: The human trafficking black market is huge and well documented
      </p>
      <p>
       4: Haiti specifically has a terrible human trafficking problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       5: the Clintons are very much mixed up in the Laura Silsby case and Haiti in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hang around skeptics long enough you are likely to hear the term prior plausibility. It's a term from Baysean analysis and basically is a way of determining the standard of evidence for a claim. Well as I've laid out, It is not implausible at all to think that a high profile person who has multiple ties to black markets in general and human trafficking particularly would be guilty of profiting from said human trafficking.

       Anyone who is Secretary of State is going to get emails from and about US organizations working in foreign countries... explain to me why a Secretary of State getting such emails means they're "very much mixed up" on a personal level, beyond what the job would entail?

       I should say that the #5 is a description of my thought process rather than an iron clad argument. ButI would say the frequency and tone of the emails belies a deeper relationship. Also just the fact that Bill and Hill got involved personally is a bit odd.  Plus they have quite a few instances of overlapping of their networks of connections which are often intriguing. Now this is a crap argument if I was trying to convince you; I'm not. I don't have time or endurance for that at this point. I am more so laying out my thinking on the subject, per OP's request. I wish I had been able to commit to memory every detail that has convinced me but I haven't. I do hope to have time to make that case in the future.

       Commenting on your pizza gate plausibility. ..
Pizzagate is the perfect example of "extra ordinary claims require extra ordinary evidence"
 until then , I think there is nothing unique about pizzagate from a historical context, we see countless examples of one political group (or racial) demonizing the other with  claims of specificly moraly outrageous criminal behaviour around the times of elections and class warfare against those evil"elitists" who are in league with the devil himself......it happens so often in history its predictable...

       Yes there are pedophile rings, and yes, the very rich (and the very poor, and the very middleclass), have been known to participate in them.  That said, the human brain is hard-wired for pattern-seeking, so when we get "onto" something outside our range of normal, we tend to look for clues to order it into something explainable. And suddenly, those "clues" are
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is one such example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there was some very disturbing (to some), artwork there and an (OOOOhhh), mysterious backroom where private parties met.  Yes, the proprietor was a well-known DC powerbroker who also owned a popular eaterie/hangout frequented by the DNC elite. Yes,
       <em>
        Bill
       </em>
       Clinton was once an associate of Jeffrey Epstein-- but then again so was Donald Trump-- who referred to him as his longtime bff. Yes, there were
       <em>
        words
       </em>
       in emails that may or may not have indicated sinister intent-- or, they could have just been references to friends' and acquaintances' kids. Or pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where you choose to
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       a certain construct, there will inevitably
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       a certain construct-- whether or not it has any actual basis in fact. More to the point, the only now-adult people who've come forward to accuse anyone (anywhere on the planet) after all these years, have accused Mr. Trump-- and that was on Epstein's private sex island. Surely of the hundreds of cannibalized, sodomized, hideously abused children,
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       might have escaped to tell the tale?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, consider the source of all this: the son and namesake of twice-disgraced National "Security" advisor, Michael Flynn-- a loose cannon who got it so wrong, so often, Obama fired his ass as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm as open as the next person to a good conspiracy theory, but I'm also a big fan of common sense. People as well-connected and private as the Clintons --and their uber-powerful cronies-- would hardly be the sort to use a public restaurant as a clearinghouse for their secret pedophilic activities.

       I think you nailed it, especially the part about people seeing what they want to regarding constructs.  I've been on this sub arguing against this bullshit for months now because it boils down to demonizing people you disagree with politically and I believe that's a very bad trend we are seeing more and more from all sides of the political spectrum.  I've been called a shill and a pedo by the people who have swallowed this lie and it only proves the point that certain types of people are willing to accuse you of the worst kind of bullshit if you disagree with them.  Obviously every sensible person abhors pedophilia and those that commit heinous acts against kids, but the notion that such a widespread conspiracy was going on and it so happens that every democrat in DC was in on it is ludicrous.

       Well, I disagree with you regarding the evidence, most of what I saw was people assigning meaning to the content of the emails with weird code language.  However, in the spirit of what I was saying, because we disagree doesn't make me hate you and I'm not going to accuse you of being some sort of sexual deviant, odds are you're a cool person.

       Trump flew on a private jet with Epstein once, within two US cities, didn't he? Then he cut all connections with Epstein suddenly? Then he kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-lago personally after he was hitting on little girls?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton flew on those planes
       <em>
        to the island
       </em>
       26 times. Epstein claimed he started the idea behind the Clinton Foundation, and we now know it's literally a sexual blackmail slush-fund - he came up with that for Clinton. Then he got convicted and Clinton continued to associate with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a big fucking difference. One flight and a torn up connection, with personal intent from Trump, particularly after being close for some time before a drastic change (Epstein tried to lure Trump and he caught on?), you are really missing the context of Trump and Epstein's relationship. Trump tore up those ties with malice, long before Pedogate was a thing.

       At least one of Epstein’s underage sex victims was recruited from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago — which Epstein frequented often and for which Trump was supoenaed.

       here's my reason why I don't think pizzagate's real..
      </p>
      <p>
       1) all the evidence seems to be interpretations and not hard evidence, symbols, pictures, weird emails. All in itself doesn't make sense until you apply interpretation which in itself is biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the fact that people are doing this at the public restaurant that regular people goes to is laughable.. they have the means to do this at a secluded place.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) all the implicated party are mostly democrats, and anytime the other side is implicated, it's general ignored. this screams agenda and political attack
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly, pizzagate is only real if you have made up your mind already, otherwise it's just a bunch of evidence that doesn't make sense, from the symbols, to the pictures, to the email. No real solid hard evidence like eyewitness, victims, bodies, there's no way something involving so many people, at a public place would go on.

       Eventually even the Catholic abuse came out, and they tried really hard to cover it up with the amount of resource they have.

Sure some of it is a stretch... But I cant say its impossible enough to dismiss it... Republicans and democrats are involved... Sure it sounds mostly about democrats but I think that's cuz of the hillary ties to it...

       Pizzagate is real and Milo Yiannopoulos is by his own admission at the center of it (at Hollywood parties where "unspeakable things" were done involving "very young" boys). What does he know and when did he know it and why has he not denounced but rather instead defended it?

       Because people don't investigate it. They rely on and trust news organizations to do the analytic work, and the freedom of these organizations has been compromised by media interest groups who spin the story and connect with powerful hosts/writers. The word 'pedogate' comes to mean two different things: 'Ridiculous fabrications' through mass media, and meanwhile for those who look solely at the concrete facts, it means a ton of circumstantial evidence that totally points towards a highly intelligent dark conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, it took WW2 to expose the nazi death camps. Before the actual troops on the ground and their commitment to expose the enemy, there was no real insight into the nazis' crimes beyond the official propaganda story.

       There's no circumstantial evidence though, we're still where we have been for weeks not one major arrest that confirms this case. It seems to me that people are doing a lot of mental gymnastics now to say what we have currently is 'circumstantial evidence'.

       What financial connections are there? The closest "evidence" I have seen is that besta pasta sounds like besta group which is slightly connected to some company that is partially held by another company in which some lady who was convincted of child abuse is an investor. That isn't circumstantial evidence, it's connect the dots.

       Well, except for that one time when JA threatened to kill an investigator's family, and wrote "Everything they say about me is true, except I don't like children".

        Remember, it took WW2 to expose the nazi death camps. Before the actual troops on the ground and their commitment to expose the enemy, there was no real insight into the nazis' crimes beyond the official propaganda story.

       That's simply not true. The Allies were aware the Jews were being systematically exterminated in Germany by 1942.

       You are trying to draw a parallel between Pizzagate and the Holocaust, but you have missed the major flaw in your comparison in that there was a lot evidence and eyewitness testimony for the treatment of the Jews, but no victims, no evidence and no eyewitnesses with Pizzagate.

       I can see how you slipped up, subtle distinction.

       I would agree to an extent. I absolutely have no doubt there is international pedophilia, organ harvesting and drug trafficking among very powerful people. It's known that the CIA were and probably are still big time dug dealers. Does anyone believe it's coincidence that we go to war in the opium production capitol of the world and the worldwide supply grows exponentially? Why would we put it past them? And obviously it's not everyone but it's enough and i believe it's unspoken common knowledge.

       Both the Savile and the Catholic church affairs had substantial evidence supporting them and they took years to come out, literally decades. The UK chief of police just came out and said that he is certain that a prime minister from over 40yrs ago was a serial child abuser. There are powerful people that sweep this stuff under the carpet. Case in point:

       As a guy who doesn't believe it, but not dismissing the people involved totally, here is why I don't believe it:
      </p>
      <p>
       It broke right before the election with democrats and Hillary clinton eating babies and having satan dinners. Getting that in the news could absolutely be a strategy to swap religious voters. The timing is super suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accusations are super super broad. Every other celebrity is a pedophile on this board. Are there pedophiles? Yes, probably lots, and there are elite pedo rings all over. Does that mean the democrats have an underage sex club at a pizza parlor? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely all evidence is shaky at best. Lots of stuff is creepy, etc, and should be investigated, but all this is being over propogated by the trump crowd and the accusations get broader. The evidence is circumstantial AT BEST (referencing pizza to a pizza shop owner is not at all suspicious).
      </p>
      <p>
       The govt probably is looking into this, but they won't be feeding details to conspiracy boards. There is just too much benefit to certain parties and it seems to be a distraction to me if anything.

       I'm with you. Occam's razor breaks pretty heavily against this theory. That said, there's a lot of weird circumstantial evidence that something is going on... but the current narrative seems to be the explanation which require the most assumptions, rather than the least.

       It's a mix between the fact that it's true (why else would it be so heavily censored) as well as the sheer nature of the subject: something this horrific and earth shattering is difficult for people to wrap their heads around. It is more comforting for most to stick their heads in the sand regarding this issue. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil (probably the wrong order)

         The orgins of PG and still to this day are partisan related.  The early days focused 100% on dems only and seemed to be a concerted attack against HRC and her cronies.  Her cronies happen to control most of MSM so they were able to soil peoples perceptions pretty easily. Humans are pack animals that subscribe to a team mentality the immediate reaction from the dem team was one of defense.  The dems online went into mother hen mode to fight off all attackers.  Had PG started as a true non partisan investigation it would have met resistance but more people would have been willing to consider.

       My reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's EXTREMELY partisan in who is implicated. I find that extremely suspect and entirely too convenient.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Places with established reputations of being Child Porn hubs: 4chan (pol and /b/) are the ones "leading" the "investigation". Lol that one makes me roll my eyes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Flimsy evidence. And i say flimsy at BEST. Some of the evidence requires me to literally use my imagination to connect the dots. It's all seems waaay too
         <em>
          forced
         </em>
         . Which again, leads me back to
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       PARTISAN.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but notice it's been mainly pro-trump people pushing this narrative and, that's not necessarily a bad thing.... except all this conveniently never touches trump. The guy partied and had a (close?) relationship with THEE pedo party planner for elites... but somehow trump is immune from scrutiny?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah... that's pretty fucking convenient. That right there chops the credibility in HALF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have Milo Y coming out and defending pedophilia and - you guessed it - the alt-righters/Donald/Pro-trump crowd is defending him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, these people have no actual interest in fighting child porn, pedophilia and abuse. This is a group of hyper-partisans using a VERY powerful and emotional allegation to try and drive their agenda/narrative against their enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally ANYONE can see this if you just do one thing:

       the problem to me is that the theory is one of those "omnipotent conspirator" level deals where there is near complete level of control of governments, media and authorities doing some evil thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       so this giant worldwide thing that has somehow never leaked even though it involves all sorts of suspicious behavior ect. ect. suddenly becomes known after anonymous heroes read leaked emails containing casual conversation between officials, or coded messages about child trafficking....
      </p>
      <p>
       and even though its a conspiracy everybody is in on, oddly it only strikes one side of the political landscape in the leadup to an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       conspiracy theories are in large part beliefs since any fact or argument counter to what you want to belive can be dismissed or even added as evidence of paid opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can see why it works and i would not be surprised if there are some pedophiles in politics, but the big all encompasing conspiracy theories always struck me as the land of fantasy to sell your latest book on reptilians.

       The stats are from a 2002 study funded by the US Justice Department. They are accurate, but

       800,000 kids do
       <em>
        not

       disappear every year. 800,000 kids get
       <em>
        reported
       </em>
       missing each year, according to the study, but the study also says that statistically speaking, almost none of those cases are actual children who have gone missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of kids who actually go missing, as in they've disappeared, is about 2,500 annually. The majority of those are abductions by family members, usually resulting from custody disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still too many, but a far cry from the huge 800,000 number that gets thrown about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, when you think about it, that number doesn't even make
       <em>

       To start with, an optimistic way to look at it is almost one per day in a nation of 350 million people is actually quite good. It would be much better if it were lower, but it's certainly not horrendous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also add though that, if I'm not mistaken, the majority of children put into systematic abuse are not abducted, but instead taken from orphanages or given off by uncaring parents.

       I'm with you. Occam's razor breaks pretty heavily against this theory. That said, there's a lot of weird circumstantial evidence that something is going on... but the current narrative seems to be the explanation which require the most assumptions, rather than the least.
