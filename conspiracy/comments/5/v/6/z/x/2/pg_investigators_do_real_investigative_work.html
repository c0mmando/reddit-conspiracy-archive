       The key to busting up a Global Pedo Ring (PizzaGate) is to start heavily investigating missing children reports both in the US and Abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of wasting time looking at IG accounts and loosely related pieces of so called evidence focus your energies on the missing children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest pedo scandal in the history of the US was uncovered by ONE WOMEN who refused to quit looking for her son Johhny Gosch. Her relentless pursuit to find her son was the only reason Boys Town / Franklin scandal was exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to bust this open you MUST become her. This will take real investigative work but the keys will be found by digging through the missing person cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both unsolved and Solved cases hold clues.  For the solved cases it would be amazing if we could get our hands on reports or interviews and see if any of those convicted mention something larger than a regular kidnapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those still missing getting more information from parents on what they think actually happened vs what police say happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to put together a map of all kiddnappings over the past 25 years then start looking for any similarities of both victims and suspects for example, a certain look for the victim (frail, blonde hair blue eye, wears glasses etc.), police sketches of suspects, descriptions of vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for an official investigation to start we need irrefutable proof a crime has taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF YOU CARE ABOUT PG YOU WILL FOCUS ALL ENERGIES ON THE MISSING KIDS.  FIND THE CRIME THAT FORCES THEIR HANDS TO A CRIMINAL PG INVESTIGATION.

       its a good thing I have you labeled as a CTR Disinformation agent or I would waste time responding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you are labeled I will say this.  It's obvious you are pushing this milo nonsense for one of two reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are doing to milo what many PG investigators have already done to innocent people by attacking them and making false claims over obvious nonsense and then presenting it as truth or breaking news. ( If this is your goal I'm with you. Also i think its a masterful way to get people to think.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is a much bigger disinformation psyops mission being utilized to discredit both Milo and any real investigation into the elite pedo ring we KNOW exists.  By posting this info you are ruining one mans life while at the same time having those that believe explain the milo conspiracy thus discrediting our investigative skills. (if this is your goal shame on you you are a horrible human)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Quickly I will address your question.  If Milo is involved then let him rot with the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions to you now.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you not believe there the Elites can Have a Pedo Ring?  If so watch Who Took Johnny, Conspiracy to Silence and listen to Sword &amp; Scale Ep 4&amp;5.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Are you able to sleep at night knowing you are purposefully spreading lies that affect peoples lives and possibly worse allowing the pedo rings to operate by spreading disinformation.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Right now this is me appealing to you as a fellow human.  Is the money you are getting paid really worth.  Sit and think on that.  Regardless your beliefs or affiliations I want you to know I love you and we are stronger united.  This may not even make sense to you right now but eventually it will hit you and you will realize what youve done is wrong.  You dont have to continue doing this you can just quit now.  Im pleading to you and anyone else you know that is apart of this group to stop doing what you have been paid and programmed to do.  Question why are you being paid to do this.  I want you to question every single thing about who you are right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY DID THEY CHOOSE YOU. ANSWER THAT HONESTLY.  Was it because they view you as weak and unable to see truth? Was it because you are easily led and manipulated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think back to that contract you signed.  Why did it have all those stipulations?  You are likely thinking about it now and wishing you read such stimpulations huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna be real honest with you.  Your not safe if you continue doing this.  You MUST walk away ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing I just want to say this.  At the end of the day we all want the same thing. Love, health and happiness. We are not different I'am u and u are me.  I appreciate you for your contribution because its needed.

       I think Milo Yiannopoulos could be the key to opening the pizzagate investigation wide open, it is now clearly bipartisan and both the seething masses of this subreddit can get involved in the detective work.

       I know you read the whole thing. You likely feel like queezy inside because facing reality is hard even if only for the briefest of times.  Its far easier to say "didnt read that", "not reading that", as a means to discredit my effort and information then it is to type a reply at that when both your mind and body dont want to because it realizes its not being true.

       You're missing the fact everyone is already investigating Republicans AND Democrats, all the establishment neo-cons and neo-liberals are involved in this. Can you point me to all of the evidence linking Milo to abusing kids? All the proof anyone has is that he was abused as a kid and did not regret it. Does that mean he is abusing other kids? Point me to any kind of proof connecting him, personally, to abusing other children, and you will have your own branch of the Pedogate scandal you uncovered yourself!
