    <div class="md"><p>The best argument to your point would be to address the few posts made here that were brigaded to the frontpage. They were upvoted more than some of the most interesting content on this sub and in no way reflected the views of this sub&#39;s user base.  It was scary, as the posts served to detract from the credibility of the sub.</p>

<p>While it doesn&#39;t bring anything to the table to question whether something is a conspiracy, it helps to keep irrelevant content out, which does a lot to improve the credibility of the sub.</p>

<p>Asking where the conspiracy is isn&#39;t necessarily a dismissal of the post either. What if someone genuinely doesn&#39;t understand and wants the OP to elaborate? </p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I think differently. With the amount of disinformation increasing, I think the importance of constructive scrutiny increases in kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy sub. I&#39;m not advocating for the removal of political posts, or any posts for that matter. Censorship is wrong. This is however a sub specifically for conspiracies and there are other subs devoted to more political content that lacks that conspiracy vibe. </p>

<p>The argument that irrelevant posts are down voted or good posts are up voted isn&#39;t as valid as it may have been a year ago or more. We&#39;ve seen fake news voted to the top of r/all as a result of brigading a couple times in just the past few weeks. Those actions don&#39;t reflect the views of this sub&#39;s typical user base. </p>

<p>I agree with you that people who don&#39;t see conspiracies in politics (however small), probably aren&#39;t looking hard enough at all. I agree that posts shouldn&#39;t be deleted for lacking a conspiracy element. The part where we differ is that I no longer believe that relying on votes to distinguish good posts from bad is an entirely safe method of information validation.</p>

<p>As for who I am to question any of this?</p>

<p>I&#39;m no one. That&#39;s the whole point of an anonymous user name. I have really enjoyed reading what people think on this sub the past few years. I&#39;ve noticed a trend towards more dem vs. repub posts since a bit before election time and they have made a point to let us know that they are here to stay. </p>

<p>Tldr would be, I agree with you on all but one point. </p>
