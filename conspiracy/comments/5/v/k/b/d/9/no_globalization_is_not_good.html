        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Who are these people who honestly believe that globalization and centralization of power and currency are a GOOD THING? What have you been taught?</p>

<p>People are misinformed to believe that nationalism equates to isolationism and no trade between countries. They tell me this. This is a misnomer. Nationalism in no way stifles trade. If anything, our current macroeconomic policies are destroying things, such as the petro dollar system and one sided trade deals.</p>

<p>Global ideals, free trade, working together for common goals can COEXIST with nationalism and sovereignty. They are not separate entities. It&#39;s a philosophy of cooperation and individual empowerment while maintaining universal goals.</p>

<p>Why the truth movement has a disdain for globalism is simple. You cannot have a planet run by a central banking system and blanket legislation that applies to everyone. A one world government is not the answer. It will only lead to a global dictatorship. Even in USA, the Feds have too much power and control. Hopefully Trump will remove much federalization and give power back to the states. And the same in Europe. I hope I see more nations inclined to pull out of the EU and create their national currencies once again and return to national legislation.</p>

<p>I could write forever about this, but i doubt it&#39;s  going to change anyone&#39;s mind. If you have been brought up to believe that globalism and one world government is a good thing, then please take the time to learn the geopolitical and macroeconomic history that got us to this juncture, and what in fact the globalists have planned for the masses. It&#39;s a level of totalitarianism that is nothing short of nightmarish.</p>

If I don&#39;t like the laws in one nation, I can move somewhere else to find more laws congenial to my philosophy. Under a one world govt, I don&#39;t have that choice at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think EU disassemble could be the answer to European problems, for example. Actually, as an european inside EU but outside my country, the EU ending would lead to more bureaucratic procedures and getting more visa programs, besides of losing money when exchanging currency.
Although, globalism isn&#39;t the answer as it helps multinationals to get empowered and actually ending up being more powerful than some countries, it&#39;s not a wrong path ass it seems. None of the globalist-nationalism could work well without their opposite. We cannot agree with any 100% of times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep this is our doom, you are right. It took time for me to realize this, I was blind with globalist propaganda (as a french my country was forced inside the EU).</p>

<p>Any politics operate on a specific area. An area is defined by frontier, which does not mean wall at all, on the contrary, it is a door, a filter : select good produced (from child labour? GMO? whatever?), money in or out (influence, tax evasion, getting more rich by removing factories and building them accross the border even if it&#39;s profitable), people (will they integrate well with the group, do you have job available, etc.), etc.</p>

<p>If you remove frontier, then you have no politics or a global one, a centralized one. The farther, the less democratic, the most prone to corruption and to totalitarism (where will you run when you expose government secret? There will be no more russia or equateur). </p>

<p>Furthermore the current system is a fucking total disaster: money sovereignty has been robbed from people and given to private banks (#1 problem), law (parliament) are overruned by lobbies, justice is being bribed by the powerful, weapons are being build and war decided for and by private interests, media a pillar for democracy are also subject to private interest. And this is from this system that we start from and want to expand, giving the key to the current uttely corrupt elite to reproduce and furthermore worsen the situation. If you plan to build a wall out of bricks, start with clean brick otherwise the result you will end up will look like the bricks or far worse.</p>

<p>A frontier is a membrane as any cell does, you can make your own ecosystem in it. It does not mean anything to say nationalism leads to war because a nation-state is a tool, it can be good or bad, but it is quite neutral and represent at least the possibility that something emerge out of it, like an embryo of democracy - on the contrary to capitalism which is a pyramidal structure formed by private capital, and private initiative. Multinational guided by greed have perverted the state and leads global war for oil and money.</p>

<p>This misconception is a total and complete plague because it is killing one of the best hope to have a more equal, relaxed, truthfull and free society. </p>

<p>We should wake the FUCK up and stop the globalism movement by all means or we are doomed  (multibillionaire, owner of mega corps pretending to care for the planet, yeah right). Take money (although not obvious money can be build from scratch any time), media, politics, democracy, justice, law making, weapon back from tyrant and from this whole system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that might be interesting: I interviewed a former, fairly senior US govt. employee (tech governance related) in the Whitehouse under Obama (as well as having previous significant roles in other well-known globalist organizations), who had a strong left-wing political orientation, on the topic of smart cities for an article I was being paid to ghostwrite. Before speaking to him, I had anticipated that I&#39;d be hearing all the technocracy claptrap, and just decided I&#39;d have to grin and bear it.</p>

<p>However, I found his opinions here to be fairly level headed. He reckoned that the biggest problem going forward was people&#39;s distrust in government, which he blamed on an out of control top-down approach to governance and the disengagement in civic matters by the citizenry on account of it.</p>

<p>He said that the only approach they see working is to empower citizens to participate in the governance of their local communities via crowd-sourced governance platforms. The failure of a single set of rules is evident to them, as was the need for citizens to determine the rules under which they live at a national, state, and local level.</p>

<p>He was of the opinion that the existing political structure was unsustainable and that the solution wasn&#39;t globalism, but empowerment of the individual. I was pretty surprised to hear that coming from someone in his position.</p>

<p>So, obviously, that&#39;s just one man of many, and he&#39;s probably not an &#39;insider&#39; – whatever that means – but I think it&#39;s important to remember that for the globalists to push their agenda, there&#39;s a lot of people who will need to be convinced out of the now very much justified opinion (on the back of brexit, etc.) that the problem now facing the civilized world is that governments have become too big, too distant and too disconnected from those they govern for the kind of progress (political expediency) necessary to achieve the &#39;sustainable mega-metropolises&#39; that they see emerging over the next 30 years as we all get more urbanized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe extreme nationalism and patriotism can be used to manipulate
people e.g. &quot;YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU, kill other humans in a world war so the elite bankers can profit and push an agenda.....&quot;</p>

<p>But also globalism is what can lead to a one world government (Fascist New World Order / NWO.......some think it&#39;s communist but I think it&#39;s fascist since we&#39;re currently in NEOlib/NEOcon territory which is only a little to the left of fascism.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m neither a nationalist nor a globalist.
You don&#39;t HAVE to be either. People always think they need to be
one extreme or another (e.g. OVERLY politically correct VS ANTI-politically correct....why not the damn middle??)</p>

<p>In terms of nationalism,
I mean, I got nothing against my country per se....but I won&#39;t die
for a stranger hundreds of miles away mang....(especially not bloody corrupt bankers)
Logic should override bullshit ideology.
Ideology should be CONSTRUCTED with logic,
but who constructs ideologies? Sometimes people who you cannot trust.</p>

<p>I care for the world, but am not a globalist.
I care for the people of my country, but am not a nationalist.
I care for the community I&#39;m surrounded by. :)
Just a human being with logic, yo.
No ideology bullshit.</p>
