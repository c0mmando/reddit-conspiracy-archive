       It's obvious (to me at least) that the real power is not Trump, but the generals he was forced to hire. Even the media is silent on the subject. Like it's not even a possibility! I say we take down mattis and his cohorts. I've got my pitchforks. Who's with me?

       The thrust of the argument is that it has not even been talked about as a possibility. It's bizarre in the extreme. Maybe so bizarre, it must be true. Are those hamsters running around the cage in your brain?

       Sorry, but source is needed. Even McCain is slobbering all over the generals. The left complains about billionaires, not the generals. And I'm just arguing the possibility. Deal with the argument... yours is adhominem.

       Do you really want a reputable news source to just speculate and throw out theories all day? Because thats the definitive opposite of credible news. THATS why they dont talk about conspiracy theories on the MSM. How dangerous do you think Trump would be if Fox and CNN just sat around talking about 9/11 and the moon landing? Oh wait, he already watches InfoWars.

       It's not even a possibility? Look closely, it's a chicken and egg question. They're on the same team, so which came first is semantics. But to answer the question, the generals came first.

       Here is what I don't understand about the fanaticism about Trump:  Most people seem to be on board with the US government being controlled by an outside force.  And at times, that thought seems fairly obvious.  So, why then, if the US government is controlled by said outside force, would that force allow a 'non puppet' into the presidency.  I for one, think that it is the perfect ploy.  Put someone in office to make a number of changes that are viewed unfavorably.  It seems that the more right of center people have put their faith entirely in Trump.  These people are the same that have viewed every other president in recent history as a puppet.  They are falling for the charade.  The world is a game, and we are not players.  Trump is a show; a figure put in place to appease the minds of the masses.  This 'Trump is going to make changes for the better' outlook is part of a plan.  Its a very clear sign of thought programming successfully at work.  And before the responses start: No, I am not a liberal; No, I did not support Hillary; No, I did not support Sanders.

       I believe in dark and light forces. If Trump is not part of the light, I will blow my fucking brains out. 30 years of conspiracy darkness is all I can take. Not an argument, granted. But in your world, where is the light? Is it all just black?

       There is no black and white. The world is grey. That's one of the fundamental truths it helps to realize if you don't want to have a bad time as a conspiracy theorist. To believe otherwise means you'll likely fall into that dangerous trap; where everyone you disagree with is a villain and everyone who you support a saint.

       Cheney and Soros are the blackest souls on the planet. There is no grey in psychopaths. Sorry, but it's true. That said, I get the point. I would even say It's what makes the game go round.... Duality.

       He might be a Russian puppet. Guess what, if so, I don't even give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the media that has lied to us for YEARS hates him, the establishment that has ignored us and only catered to their campaign donor lobbyists for YEARS hates him.. tells me everything I need to know and outweighs the possibility of him being a puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a NeverTrumper until I saw the massive zeitgeist against him. It's a the enemy of my enemy is my friend situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have more hate for the media and the traitors in our political system than I do for Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if he lost.. I do know that Hillary would also be a puppet, just for the very people and their geopolitical agenda that I despise.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hear the media and neocons and now the liberals whine about Putin being a thug and a dictator, but then when you actually listen to Putin talk things don't add up. His statements are intelligent and he comes off as meaning no harm to us, but those statements are never reported in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does represent a threat to our geopolitical ambitions and to that I say good. He typically is aligned with the countries we like to fuck with and bomb the democracy into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump being a puppet president means we stop fucking around in the Middle East with Putin's trade partners, GOOD! If it means pipelines go through Iran and Syria to Europe instead of Saudi Arabia, why should I give a fuck?

       That song was for you. You can't always get what you want, but if you... anywho, don't worry about the Russian bear. They cleaned house awhile back. That's a new Putin and all brand new high ranking generals. Add to that, our military boys have been making allies with not only Russia. Still a scary world, but damn, it was looking black as hell for awhile there.
