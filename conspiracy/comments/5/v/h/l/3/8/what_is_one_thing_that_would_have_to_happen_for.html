<p>How about those who choose to be neutral?</p>

<p>In many martial arts there is a great emphasis placed on awareness of balance... both your own as well as that of your opponent. Being off balance leaves one vulnerable.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my point? </p>

<p>My point is that &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;hating&quot; someone (like Trump) is the emotional equivalent of being off balance. Too much emotion in either direction leaves you vulnerable to being manipulated because emotion interferes with rational thought.</p>

<p>So when I think of anyone important or famous, I try to stay neutral towards them. Someone who seems bad right now might turn out to be a hero in the future. Someone who seems like a hero might eventually turn out to be an asshole.</p>

<p>As for President Trump? He&#39;s definitely a polarizing figure. Most people seem to either love him or hate him. The MSM has definitely got it in for him in a big way. So even though I&#39;m neutral about him, he&#39;s still a very interesting guy.</p>

<p>To change that? Quit dealing with Israel. Retain diplomatic relationships but funding stops, influence removed and then get the fuck out of the Middle East.  Full stop. No more wars and no more arms to Saudi and the UAE. Solid trade agreements with Iran and if Israel or Saudi spit the dummy so be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no single thing he could do honestly.  He has decades of past economic activities that have run against and successfully overturned democratic decisions in the US and abroad.  He&#39;s the same plutocratic con-man he&#39;s always been.  Nothing short of divesting himself of all his ill gotten wealth, living a life of proud austerity, working to reverse the damage he&#39;s done in countries where he&#39;s developed beyond the means of their infrastructure, abandoning the histrionic soap box of twitter, losing enough weight not to be an eyesore, strengthening the FoIA and directing it toward its original purpose, and ensuring that his appointees don&#39;t hold the mission of their appointment in contempt.</p>

<p>The man is a garish disappointment of a man.  The only reason why he&#39;s in anyway preferable to Clinton is because the other governmental bodies will actually attack him for his crimes.</p>
