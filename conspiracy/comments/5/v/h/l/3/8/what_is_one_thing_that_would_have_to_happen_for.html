      <p>
       What is one thing (decision or event)  that would make your either lose your faith in Trump or make you a new supporter?

       Given their penchant for being whiny bastards, I'm not so sure the summer heat would do them any favors. Fuckers would probably plan a protest against the sun...

       Open Healthcare/insurance across state borders. If he did that, I'd strapped up in his defense. This is the only reason our healthcare is so expensive shit in the country. A more significant bonus, would be teaming up with Ron Paul and his Son in Auditing and phasing out the FED, and returning back to sound money and the gold standard. Oh... Oh, shit this is little known, but reversing homesteading acts. Plenty of acres in the US for people to settle and prosper on (Putin is doing this). Fuck me, I could go on and on.... I like Trump, but I'm not holding my breathe....

       If he stopped sucking so much Israeli cock, got rid of basically his entire cabinet (especially Mnuchin), and completely distanced himself from his son-in-law I'd probably start to believe he was genuine.

       How about those who choose to be neutral?
      </p>
      <p>
       In many martial arts there is a great emphasis placed on awareness of balance... both your own as well as that of your opponent. Being off balance leaves one vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's my point?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that "loving" or "hating" someone (like Trump) is the emotional equivalent of being off balance. Too much emotion in either direction leaves you vulnerable to being manipulated because emotion interferes with rational thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I think of anyone important or famous, I try to stay neutral towards them. Someone who seems bad right now might turn out to be a hero in the future. Someone who seems like a hero might eventually turn out to be an asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for President Trump? He's definitely a polarizing figure. Most people seem to either love him or hate him. The MSM has definitely got it in for him in a big way. So even though I'm neutral about him, he's still a very interesting guy.

       My opinion on him is 'Thank Fuck it wasn't Clinton' but that ultimately he is just quit her piece on the chess board. He was put there by the elitist players.
      </p>
      <p>
       To change that? Quit dealing with Israel. Retain diplomatic relationships but funding stops, influence removed and then get the fuck out of the Middle East.  Full stop. No more wars and no more arms to Saudi and the UAE. Solid trade agreements with Iran and if Israel or Saudi spit the dummy so be it.

       There's no single thing he could do honestly.  He has decades of past economic activities that have run against and successfully overturned democratic decisions in the US and abroad.  He's the same plutocratic con-man he's always been.  Nothing short of divesting himself of all his ill gotten wealth, living a life of proud austerity, working to reverse the damage he's done in countries where he's developed beyond the means of their infrastructure, abandoning the histrionic soap box of twitter, losing enough weight not to be an eyesore, strengthening the FoIA and directing it toward its original purpose, and ensuring that his appointees don't hold the mission of their appointment in contempt.

       The man is a garish disappointment of a man.  The only reason why he's in anyway preferable to Clinton is because the other governmental bodies will actually attack him for his crimes.
