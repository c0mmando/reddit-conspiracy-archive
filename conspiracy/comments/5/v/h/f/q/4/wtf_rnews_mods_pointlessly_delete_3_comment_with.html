       This comment made it all the way to #3 and all of the responses under it were people saying "oh yeah wow, this doesn't really seem that bad then".

       mods couldn't have that because it was redpilling their users and betraying the fact that basically all of this was made up. They deleted it
       <strong>
        flat out because it was going against their narrative
       </strong>
       even though it was literally the most relevant and informative comment a human being could probably have posted on this topic.

        Edit
       </strong>
       : I also don't want people thinking I'm racist or anything and want to point out that I only made this account and user ID over a year ago to troll some random race bait thread that popped up on the front page about white tears. I'm really not into racial discussions or race bait but whatever, this is the ID I have right now and most subs have all sorts of unwritten rules about how old the account must be and how many times you must have posted before they let your comments and posts show up without shadowbanning them so it's with me for the foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit 2
       </strong>
       : Looks like the comment was restored sometime after I went to bed last night. Good, nevertheless it was probably only after the post left the front page :(

       Of all the reasons I've been called a shill before, I think being interested in a topic is probably the dumbest I've heard so far.

       People that accuse others of shilling are almost always morons, pathetically inept at arguing their position, incapable of coming up with a better argument than an ad hominem that is impossible to prove or disprove.

       People that call others shills actually do think that. They think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and whatever garbage threads on Voat are just so dangerous to the establishment that there's an active agenda to discredit them by paying people to call them out on their nonsense. They think they're these golden champions about to bring down the man with the sharing of information, but everyone else sees them for what they are; weird, pale, pseudo intelligent little creatures, huddling in a corner trying to link stupid bullshit around the globe to Democrats, with the occasional outbursts that consist of "HURRLARY CLURNTON" and "BILL CLINTON IS A PEDO BECAUSE EPSTEIN, BUT NOT TRUMP EVEN THOUGH HE'S FRIENDS WITH BOTH BILL AND EPSTEIN."

       Most shill accusers do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling someone a shill adds nothing to a discussion, does not further one's argument, derails the conversation, and is a distraction from the real talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH, calling other people shills is probably a great strategy if someone is actually a shill, themselves.

       Milo isn't a pedophile. What he said was wrong, and he should face consequences though. I think claiming he is a pedophile though isn't helping the situation, when he isn't one.

       Not only that, but what you said has nothing to do with this post. A comment was removed posting the full transcript of Milo's press conference. No opinion at all made on it, literally just the transcript, so it could be discussed. It was removed by

       Innocent until proven guilty. He himself has said he isn't a pedophile, so unless real evidence comes out suggesting otherwise, I'm going to say he isn't. Just because he said something a year ago, about gay boys finding support in older men, doesn't make him a pedophile. I find what he said to be wrong and very disgusting, but it doesn't make him a pedophile.

       What? When has he intended a party where pedophilia occurred and he didn't report on it? If you have proof of that, please post it. If it's true then yeah I would say that's pretty fucking sick, and I wonder if there are laws against doing such a thing? Like I said I'm not defending him but I'm fair at the same time, but with proof I'd easily change my opinion on him protecting pedophiles that's for sure and maybe even himself being a pedophile if the facts add up.

       He talked about it on the Joe Rogan experience. Do you want me to link you to it? I'd rather not have to go through the whole thing and find the time but I can tell you the exact quote because I just watched another video that cited it (and I watched the Joe Rogan video where he said it yesterday, so he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       say this):
      </p>
      <p>
       "Y'know, I lived in Hollywood a while ago, briefly, and I went to other people who I won't name of a similar stature in Hollywood [this is in reference to the Xmen director, Bryan Singer, accused of molestation], and I went to their boat parties and their house parties. And some of the things that I've seen have beggared belief. I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people because I think it's going to be- yeah, dangerous. But I can tell you the truth without dropping anybody in it. I mean... some of the boys there were very young.
       <em>
        Very
       </em>
       young. And when- I don't remember... no no, I don't... 8 years ago? I don't remember whether I ever met Bryan Singer, or if I even knew who he was then, but I knew people of similar stature, as I say, and there were some
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       young boys around at that time. There was a lot of drugs, and a lot of... a lot of... twinks, taking drugs, and having unsafe sex with older men. And some of these boys were
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       young."

       Before you go interpreting it in defense, if you haven't watched the actual videos, go watch it. And then go watch the Drunk Peasants one. In full. Until then, you're speaking without researching. He's quite clear that he thinks there are exceptions to the rule of appropriate child-adult sex relations, and that he is one of them, sure.

      <p>
       No, but the fact that he never reported about these (plural) parties he went to to the police, and he refuses to name names... shows that he defends pedophiles. The fact that he praises his own predator and calls him hot shows that he in fact sees nothing wrong- in principle- with pedophilia. He can say that the consent age laws are "about right" but when he follows that up with making exceptions, it's the exact justification that pedophiles
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       make.

       I agree, that's why I was asking for the videos. I was saying what he said in the youtube video doesn't make him a pedophile, just wrong and he should face social consequences for what was said. I didn't even know about what you are talking about till just now.

       He admits to attending parties where there was pedophilia occurring. Where extremely young boys were getting fucked without condoms. Tell me... how would he know if they were getting fucked without condoms?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't evidence, but you also asked for speculation so here's a train of thought that might make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that he admits to liking it happening to him as a boy, and not only justifying it- but he actually did praise it. He can walk back whatever he said now, but on the JRE and the Amazing Asshole's podcast he was very clear his views.

       I think he commented on something he shouldn't have when the age of consent in UK is 16. It makes it a different ball park. They wanted to take him down! The guy was molested himself. Taking down his press conference if it was the problem becomes he was set up then silenced.

      <p>
       I watched him on Joe Rogen pod cast and it seamed like he hinted many times that they will come for him and Joe eventually too. Milo likes to shock people. Like he gets a rise out of it and this 2 years ago BS is weird cause he says some crazy stuff all the time and this is what they bring out? I don't know if I can just buy into it mainly because the "set up" was sloppy and in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo just started becoming popular so for those that think he's part of the Elite and a pedo I just can't yet. First they try to shut down the pedo issue but when it doesn't go away they play it to their advantage it seams IMO. I could be wrong but that's what this situation looks like to me.

       The man defended pedastry. That is not OK with me. I will never be OK with a 33 year old man saying that a "sexually mature" 13 year old should have a relationship with an older adult.

       His apology is an extension of the classic conservative logic of, "I have a black friend, therefor it's not possible for me to be racist."

       Milo says things like, "I'm gay, so it's impossible for me to be a bigot" or "I like to fuck black men, so obviously I'm not racist."

       I think many people assumed it was Milo doing the molesting, so he probably wanted to clear that up. It seems to me he was a victim when he was young and talked about how he mentally got through it (acceptance). People making him into the bad guy in his situation are the kind who say that women shouldn't wear short skirts if they don't want to be raped.

       I strongly disagree.

       I think he is morally and ethically in the wrong for his viewpoints on pedastry, but I do not victim blame.

       A more apt comparison would be battered wives who defend their husbands right to physically abuse women. They are a victim, yet still hold unethical views.

       Not only that but these people are assholes, they're the same type to cry about pedophilia and then protect them if they're on "their side".

       Prior to this election, there was nothing abnormal about people discussing conspiracy theories regarding the president of the united states

       oddly enough our very own current president liked to believe many such theories... typically those from alex jones regarding children being fake murdered to take guns away

       SMN - All tech companies run by people who spent the last 20 years playing video games and watching porn. They are young, rich and want to stay that way. They are worried that child sex traffickers will give child blood traffickers a bad name.

       No no no, not evil enough. And your using to much of that logic thing. Occam's razor isn't allowed here, it ruins everyone's government fan fiction. (Really a creative writing guide would improve a lot of post in this sub)

       I really do think of it as government Fan fiction. Just with stupidly overpowered opponents and unbelievable luckly/ smart hero's. Its Mary/Gary sues all around. I don't think writing prompts would like these stories very much lol :)

       Yup.  It appears that way to me now too.  It appears to have been removed, then restored, then removed again.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone else pointed out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe a shit ton of people reported it, automod removed it, moderator approved it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or if you wanna believe a more sinister angle, maybe it was removed, then restored to avert drama after OP's threads were created, then removed again (dunno why they'd do the last part though).

       Possibly had to do with the fact that the user edited the quote from Milo instead of copying it verbatim.

       But then again, who knows?

       I don't really think it "goes against their narrative," either, because, well... we all watched the tapes. Pretty undeniable that Milo was defending pedastry.

       I mean he hand transcribed it. I think it's not even possible to suggest that the mods were trying to protect Milo from smears lol, especially over a few minor insignificant transcription errors.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me I didn't think Milo was defending pederasty at all. I think he specifically said age of consent laws are good in the US (where they are higher than they are in the rest of the world) but that some occasional consensual statutory relationships can be beneficial. Yeah. I mean this is factually true. If it were a boy banging an older woman everyone would be like "Yeah! Fuck yeah bro! Lucky little dude!" but when it's a gay boy everyone goes "OMG PEDERASTY!". Yeah well, it's  a double standard and even though I never cry homophobia this one is genuinely based in homophobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is because so many young gay boys find themselves cast out of their families, out of their homes, literally on the street mixed up with crime, drug addiction, and facing the very real possibility of starving to death, freezing to death or being stabbed in a gutter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty stupid IMO to suggest that a boy like that, who is living an adult life (moreso than the overwhelming majority of most adults) and dealing with very adult themes (moreso than the overwhelming majority of adults) and making very adult decisions (moreso than the overhwelming majority of most adults) cannot benefit from a romantic relationship with someone older who will mentor them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody suggesting that the older party should not be held accountable nor that shouldn't be prosecuted to the full extent of the law nor that they aren't predators. Some people just speak the intellectual reality of the fact that in certain outlier cases, because of the nature of what happens to so many gay young men in our country, they end up benefiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And last but certainly not least (because this is actually the most relevant point) Milo was speaking only about his own personal experiences as an abuse victim. This is very clear when you watch the FULL video rather than the edited 5 minute clip.

       I believe they use automod to autoremove comments that have X number of reports. People that know this manipulate automod by  massreporting certain comments, therefore triggering a removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a moderator, its also really easy to mindlessly blow throw the modqueue. If that was reported, they might have just thought it was some wall of text spam, and deleting it without bothering to pay close attention to what it is was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it was removed to hide anything, and they restored it as soon as they realized it was wrongly removed.
