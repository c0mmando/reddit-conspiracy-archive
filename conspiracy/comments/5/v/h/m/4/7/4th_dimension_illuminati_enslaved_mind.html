I have experienced some trips in astral world but thats nothing big. 
Also they poisoning our food and mind so we cannot see the world as we shoud,  we judge each other by race, popularity, how much money we have etc. 
Why are we not trying to grown spiritualy ? Enjoy the nuture and help each other ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there is far more to this world than what we perceive with the 5 senses and beyond visible light. I believe it all comes down to a war on consciousness. All these things they go through to attack us emotionally physically and mentally, through food, drink, programming, they have to hold us in an unnatural state, kind of like holding a ball underwater as soon as you let go in returns to it&#39;s natural state. There&#39;s also a positive side to this being that everything they have to go through to suppress us and hold us in servitude tells us something about us, it tells us of the true genius and magnificence of who we are. We&#39;re spiritual beings having a human experience, infinite awareness, everything there ever was, is and ever will be. That&#39;s our true nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be a bit of an idealistic notion, but I&#39;m almost under the belief that the last 12 thousand years of human development have been detrimental. We&#39;re meant to live in smallish groups where instead of working 40 hours a week to survive, we go out and gather food for a few hours a day and the rest of the time is spent socializing, which would include music, art, spiritual ritual, etc. As I said, very idealistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. We spend more than a decade being indoctrinated in school. Then the majority go out and work some shit job that we hate in a cubicle somewhere. In order to live a decent life on the average salary of $50,000 per year, people get in so much debt to keep up with the Jone&#39;s. School doesn&#39;t help the individual grow to their strengths, and the brightest people sit in a class that can only move fast enough for the slowest individual to keep up. </p>

<p>I realized all of this a long time ago, so I started borrowing the elites money and using it to make money, in the form of rental properties. But I could care less about money. What I care about is having the time to do what I want. I wish this is what all of society could do. I wish we really had free will, rather than the illusion of free will. </p>

<p>They want to be able to chip each and everyone of us so that they can watch us like augmented FACEBOOK STATUS UPDATE.</p>

<p>Trump will push this soon as it&#39;s already clear that he is pushing bio metrics for the immigrants. </p>

<p>Once it is accepted by society, then it can be pushed on minorities and finally the majority. </p>

<p>Their plan is to believe that they can <em>play God</em> but this plan will naturally fail as the real God comes back towards the earth to wage war on it (UFO&#39;S, Chariots of Israel). </p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t try to grown spiritually is because they push so much wickedness into the world through our favorite shows, sports, events, music and purposely teaching the Bible wrong (Dogma), most of the people the planet are spiritually blind. </p>

<p>This in turn makes the people who see the wicked code in the matrix look <em>bat shit crazy</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an entire story taking place and here you are talking about ignoring all the signs and to <em>Zoom out</em> into whatever reality is where you can simply ignore these things. </p>

<p>That is not a perspective I would like to participate in. I believe in the truth because it is universal like math. Nowhere in the world can I go and say 1+1=5 and someone not correct me because they know it is a lie. </p>

<p>You wish to tell me that 1+1 = <em>more numbers</em> but I cannot follow that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care for simple beliefs. That is just like organised religion, a mind control mechanism and everyone pick a (few) day(s) to meet up in a giant echo chamber or online forum. I want evidence, and the experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth. The Cabal has a co-dependent relationship with parasitic archons. That is what all the pedophilia and cannibalism is about... it&#39;s what all violence and trauma is about. This is not the true nature of man. We have been manipulated by these inter-dimensional beings for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Take a deep dive into the subject of Archons from David Icke. There are many teachers with good information, but this subject has been around long before any of the word&#39;s major religions. This is ancient Gnostic knowledge. </p>

We did not choose this reality for one another and I refuse to believe this reality is anything close to our true purpose.  We have handed over our free will to false idol politicians and wake up every morning to give them our money, our freedom, our choice.  There is without a doubt more out there for all of us and it absolutely pains me to see this sub flooded with political spam...I think that alone should tell you the greatest conspiracy is outside the realm of politics.</p>
