       Loads of these Reddit Mods are little Marxist tin pot dictators on power trips and they seem to think we are living in the USSR pre 1989.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mod, sent me a message saying "you seemed to have confused this sub reddit with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . I told them they have no right to hide the truth from the Swedish people, and sent them a link to the Bilderberg Wiki page and their own website. Anyway, at least the fool gave me an introduction to this sub, so I can inform people.

       I love how 'sweden' randomly launched a huge anti-trump campaign midprimaries. Felt
       <em>
        soooo

       natural for 30+ high quality anti-Trump memes to get kicked out in like a day or whatever.

       In a typical sub OC is like once a week. But lo, if it's anti-Trump 'all the sudden' Sweden becomes the powerhouse of OC. Yup, real believable.

       , I can see people from this community participating it seems to migrant bashing. I saw also that a paper often quoted is the

       I have trouble understanding what's going on and separating truth from lies. Could be that they are at the center of this and that they play both sides, minimizing on one hand, maximizing on the other hand, the pressure increasing until..?

       I try to be levelheaded abot this. It seems you'll have the socialist cencoring certain events, on the other hand you have the right wing exaggerating claims, and using outright propaganda.

       That's a good way to pull on people's emotional strings if anything.

       I wouldn't buy into it. There's that divide and conquer again, and I wish there was more scrutiny on this sub.

       The claim was that there was a terror attack, yet there was no attack. So what of it really? I thought we were seeking the truth around here.

       no he did not claim there was a terror attack in Sweden, if you understand English in no way does he mention a terror attack in Sweden. Hes just referring to the crime and disorder that unchecked migration has brought to that country.

       As you can see, I can both read and write coherent english, but I see people think being smug gets them a long way. I was under the impression "that something happened in Sweden in some particular night (past tense.)"

       no he didn't he said 'looking whats happening in Germany, and even last night Sweden, can you believe it Sweden, they took in huge numbers' The media assumed he was on about terror attacks, but look into it and he has for months gone on about Germany and Merkel, referring to general crime and chaos not solely terrorism. He is the same about the US when he talks about Chicago and other inner cities.

       Don't forget the Islamic state of Iran. Iran was a secular nation that resembled the US in its culture. Then, we got involved. It's almost like they are trying to fulfill biblical prophecy or something.

       Iran is fine, it stands on Islam but it fights terrorism. We have way bigger problem. Yep, I believe there is a biblical prophecy taking place along w/ other stuff (battle for money, oil, geopolitical stuff). Some rabbis themselves say it. Israel hasn't been made in any part of the world, they are accomplishing and living the "book".

       Can you clarify your allusion regarding Israel? In the potpourri of today's eschatology, that could mean so many things. And yes, Israel intends on fulfilling prophecy, and there is plenty to suggest that the temple will be rebuilt soon. It's clear that the Palestinians are prophetically Judah, and that has some interesting implications. Ahmadinejad, as well as many other Muslims believe the final war (jihad) is quickly approaching. Ahmadinejad even claims to know the Mahdi, and he was not shy about his Mahdism to say the least. It is possible that we may see prophetic fulfillment of various belief systems which will include an Islamic civil war, the exile of Palestinians, and the building of the third temple. You may not be aware of Zion Oil, but you may want to give it a look-see. Check out where they are drilling. Coincidence? I believe that company to be a fraud, but who knows anymore.

       I'm not well versed in religion, zionism and all, I have just came accross several people being zionist or analysis from christian etc. that say they are on a messianic, self-fulfilling prophecy. And the book states that several wars and catastrophies must happen (so they will make it happen) for the prophecy to come true. This is atrociously vicious, comitting massive war, crimes etc. so that their happy end come, fanatism at its best.

       I am illitterate regarding what you say about Palestinians, Iran etc. they obviously are being put on pressure, embargo, massacred or threatened by israelis and their USA/NATO puppet, so I'm not sure what they can read from this. Where does it say that an Islamic civil war must take place? This is being engineered to me, every difference is used to divide and conquer your ennemy.

       Where are they drilling exactly? Is this supposed to be the exact area for the temple?

       They are drilling in Meggido-Jezreel. This is a valley that is referenced as a staging ground for the final conflict. You may have heard of it- Armageddon. The third temple will go on the Mount in Jerusalem. Most believe that the Dome of the Rock must be removed, thus causing a huge problem with Muslims. However, according to Ezekiels vision and measurements of the third temple, the outer-court will not be constructed. It has been reported that this temple can be built without destroying the Dome of the Rock or the al-Aqsa mosque (third holiest site in Islam).

       Here is Mahdism eschatology that will help you understand how things unfold prophetically (Shai theology).

       Those European subreddits are shitshows. I don't bother visiting them anymore, let alone posting. They're under total control. I think the stakes are very, very high for letting the mass immigration go on. It's depressing.... the situation is dire.... and most people don't even know.
