<p>Loads of these Reddit Mods are little Marxist tin pot dictators on power trips and they seem to think we are living in the USSR pre 1989.</p>

<p>The Mod, sent me a message saying &quot;you seemed to have confused this sub reddit with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I told them they have no right to hide the truth from the Swedish people, and sent them a link to the Bilderberg Wiki page and their own website. Anyway, at least the fool gave me an introduction to this sub, so I can inform people.</p>

<p>I subscribed to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/279528999133185/">facebook chan</a>, I can see people from this community participating it seems to migrant bashing.

<p>I have trouble understanding what&#39;s going on and separating truth from lies. Could be that they are at the center of this and that they play both sides, minimizing on one hand, maximizing on the other hand, the pressure increasing until..?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good way to pull on people&#39;s emotional strings if anything.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t buy into it. There&#39;s that divide and conquer again, and I wish there was more scrutiny on this sub.</p>

<p>The claim was that there was a terror attack, yet there was no attack. So what of it really? I thought we were seeking the truth around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran is fine, it stands on Islam but it fights terrorism. We have way bigger problem.

    <div class="md"><p>Can you clarify your allusion regarding Israel? In the potpourri of today&#39;s eschatology, that could mean so many things. And yes, Israel intends on fulfilling prophecy, and there is plenty to suggest that the temple will be rebuilt soon. It&#39;s clear that the Palestinians are prophetically Judah, and that has some interesting implications. Ahmadinejad, as well as many other Muslims believe the final war (jihad) is quickly approaching. Ahmadinejad even claims to know the Mahdi, and he was not shy about his Mahdism to say the least. It is possible that we may see prophetic fulfillment of various belief systems which will include an Islamic civil war, the exile of Palestinians, and the building of the third temple. You may not be aware of Zion Oil, but you may want to give it a look-see. Check out where they are drilling. Coincidence? I believe that company to be a fraud, but who knows anymore. <a href="https://www.zionoil.com">https://www.zionoil.com</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not well versed in religion, zionism and all, I have just came accross several people being zionist or analysis from christian etc. that say they are on a messianic, self-fulfilling prophecy. And the book states that several wars and catastrophies must happen (so they will make it happen) for the prophecy to come true. This is atrociously vicious, comitting massive war, crimes etc. so that their happy end come, fanatism at its best.</p>

<p>I am illitterate regarding what you say about Palestinians, Iran etc. they obviously are being put on pressure, embargo, massacred or threatened by israelis and their USA/NATO puppet, so I&#39;m not sure what they can read from this. Where does it say that an Islamic civil war must take place? This is being engineered to me, every difference is used to divide and conquer your ennemy.</p>

<p>Where are they drilling exactly? Is this supposed to be the exact area for the temple?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are drilling in Meggido-Jezreel. This is a valley that is referenced as a staging ground for the final conflict. You may have heard of it- Armageddon. The third temple will go on the Mount in Jerusalem. Most believe that the Dome of the Rock must be removed, thus causing a huge problem with Muslims. However, according to Ezekiels vision and measurements of the third temple, the outer-court will not be constructed. It has been reported that this temple can be built without destroying the Dome of the Rock or the al-Aqsa mosque (third holiest site in Islam).</p>

<p>Here is Mahdism eschatology that will help you understand how things unfold prophetically (Shai theology).</p>
