The need for insiders to have children (so that their kids can survive). Human trafficking as a fundraiser. Selling packages (seats) for Clinton campaign donations. The stall tactics of the mainstream media, when they know eventually every one is going to get wise to the blatant lying. I&#39;ve been trying to avoid this line of thinking for months, but it&#39;s the most plausible reason for the charade. </p>

By the time that humanity can teraform another planet, the elites of today will have come and gone like the kings and queens of the past.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope that is the case, but think about how much money was shifted from the middle and lower classes to the wealthy, and how much government funding is going to private research. We are talking trillions of dollars, not to mention what they can make from human trafficking, and the CIA drug trade, and hedge funds wagered against disasters that they themselves create. So much money being generated while existing problems are either ignored or exacerbated. What if the ship is already here and just needs repairing. That might be far-fetched, but shit, there&#39;s most definitely been intelligent life on this planet before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That goes without saying. It just seems like the game they are playing, they had to know they would get caught eventually. I mean Clinton cheated and it was obvious that it was going on, but even before that; why run Clinton? She was this worst possible candidate that the Dems could have ran. It&#39;s not like she was the only Dem-for-hire they could install, but she was the only one capable of losing. They needed their best criminal fund-raiser because the election was only part of their concern. The bigger issue was generating boatloads of dirty money, and to do so quickly. And if it was just about greed, I think the media would have gradually tried to settle back towards credibility. Their hate and fear-mongering cannot sustain itself indefinitely. Even the echo chamber needs to be powered down from time to time or else it loses its effect. They are desperate, and they are guilty, as are thousands of other people. Maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands. But there have been hardly any whistleblowers calling them out. What could keep that many people so committed to a lie?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a theory that there is solid mercury at the poles (considering it&#39;s been found underneath every major pyramid in the world. In really cold temperatures, mercury becomes a super conductor. As it thaws, it loses almost all of its magnetic charge and reverts to its liquid state. This would explain why mercury levels have increased 6 fold in just over a decade and it would explain the EM field dispersal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth rings like a bell electromagnetically at 7.83 Hz, our atmosphere is an ocean of noise powered by EM activity like lightning, which regularly self-organizes into standing waves and solitons.  </p>

<p>(Only recently did I put this together with the speed of light:</p>

<p>Earth&#39;s circumference = 40 000 km</p>

<p>speed of light = 300 000 km/s</p>

<p>300 000 / 40 000 = 7.5</p>

<p>So if we could curve light and send it around the Earth, it would go around 7 and a half times in one second. This period is strikingly close to the Schumann resonance because we are talking about an electromagnetic phenomenon.  It&#39;s Geoelectromagnetism.</p>

<p>If someone says &quot;the Schumann resonance just went up&quot;, the statement can be a little misleading.  The properties that establish the fundamental period have not changed (the speed of light and the size of the earth).   We haven&#39;t established a new baseline frequency.</p>

<p>If they wanted to be more specific, they could say something like: &quot;harmonic solitons of a higher frequency than the fundamental are currently propagating throughout the magnetosphere&quot;.</p>

<p>Do our self-generated electromagnetic signals interact with it?  They can&#39;t not interact with it.  To what extent?  Few can say, without a transparent audit of our capabilities and how they might be deployed.  </p>

American and Russians boath did this this barrels  are only rated 50 years and they were faulty and soviet barrels really poorly made.  Iceland is currently very upset cause America dumped alot of radioactive waste thr deep in the ice and that is all thawing out and making a mess.

<p>&quot;The term “Breakaway Civilization” was coined by Richard Dolan after his exhaustive and extensive research into his books UFOs and the National Security State Volumes 1 and 2. He came to the realization that the deep secretive black budget world had actually become a civilization on its own with its own exotic technology, a different view of the cosmos, our place in it, and a different version of Human history. This is a new avenue of research that will delve into the Occult, secret societies, Central Banking, UFO secrecy, the Military Industrial Complex, and the Secret Space Program comprising this Breakaway Civilization.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>. .  but here&#39;s the thing: do you think that &#39;man&#39; would create AI that would turn on him? at least we&#39;ve haven&#39;t reached that point <em>yet</em>. why create something that could ultimately destroy you? </p>

<p>see what I mean? we create all the time not knowing that our creation can grow up and snap, and kill us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. As a physicist i can tell you HUMANS space traveling is impossible but computers could...If say the ruling elite could upload themselves to a super data composer they could in theory live forever and travel space. Time would not be an issue. The sheer entropy of carbon based matter would be their only limitation and in a vacuum that means little. This is why they want the matrix.</p>

<p>But they&#39;re so fucking autistic they don&#39;t realize how easily that can go wrong...look at all our computation problens now. Let alone something that complex. Also the existential crisis. What good is a man&#39;s memories inside a robot? What even is a man without his bio chemistry to give him emotional cues?</p>

<p>A physicist would never say that- Krauss, Hawkins, nor Sagan. </p>

<p>Space-time would like a word with you. </p>

<p>AI does not require a &quot;robot&quot; in the traditional sense. Terrible allusion. Man will become a cyborg. </p>

<p>He will become a god. That <em>is</em> the goal. This is well established. So you are a neurophilosopher too, stating,&quot;without biochemistry?&quot; You are underestimating omniscience, pal.</p>

<p>Yeah? I have Asperger&#39;s. Here are a few other assholes with the same problem:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Westward from my house theres been a steady appearance of multiple UFO&#39;s for the last couple weeks. Usually one, sometimes two. They warp or whatever it is they do into that particular patch of sky and park themselves there for hours on end. Watching, like little sentinels. To tell you the truth it makes me a little uneasy. I cant see any good reason they would want to make contact. We have nothing to offer them in return that would be mutually beneficial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A small airport is about 45 minutes away, but its not military. The very first time I witnessed them however a jet was scrambled after it shortly after it showed up and managed to chase it off so their might be one close by that Im not aware of. I also dont think theyre ours because of that, although another jet has never been scrambled. I checked out the internet to see if anyone was reporting similar sightings and theres been a number throughout the US, all with the same MO. </p>
