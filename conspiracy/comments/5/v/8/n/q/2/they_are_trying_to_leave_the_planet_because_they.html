       It's the only explanation that makes sense. The private sector investing in space travel. The need for insiders to have children (so that their kids can survive). Human trafficking as a fundraiser. Selling packages (seats) for Clinton campaign donations. The stall tactics of the mainstream media, when they know eventually every one is going to get wise to the blatant lying. I've been trying to avoid this line of thinking for months, but it's the most plausible reason for the charade.

       Think about how much the geopolitical landscape of the world has changed in the past 1,000 years. By the time that humanity can teraform another planet, the elites of today will have come and gone like the kings and queens of the past. There's literally no reason for any cabal to conspire to leave the planet when it's so much easier and faster to fix our current issues on Earth.

       I hope that is the case, but think about how much money was shifted from the middle and lower classes to the wealthy, and how much government funding is going to private research. We are talking trillions of dollars, not to mention what they can make from human trafficking, and the CIA drug trade, and hedge funds wagered against disasters that they themselves create. So much money being generated while existing problems are either ignored or exacerbated. What if the ship is already here and just needs repairing. That might be far-fetched, but shit, there's most definitely been intelligent life on this planet before.

       That goes without saying. It just seems like the game they are playing, they had to know they would get caught eventually. I mean Clinton cheated and it was obvious that it was going on, but even before that; why run Clinton? She was this worst possible candidate that the Dems could have ran. It's not like she was the only Dem-for-hire they could install, but she was the only one capable of losing. They needed their best criminal fund-raiser because the election was only part of their concern. The bigger issue was generating boatloads of dirty money, and to do so quickly. And if it was just about greed, I think the media would have gradually tried to settle back towards credibility. Their hate and fear-mongering cannot sustain itself indefinitely. Even the echo chamber needs to be powered down from time to time or else it loses its effect. They are desperate, and they are guilty, as are thousands of other people. Maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands. But there have been hardly any whistleblowers calling them out. What could keep that many people so committed to a lie?

       Don't know. Could be an asteroid, could be the Earth losing its magnetic field, could be the ice caps, could be an alien apocalypse, or earthquakes fueled by over-drilling, or a planetary collision (though I think that's least likely simply because we would see that coming).

       I've got a theory that there is solid mercury at the poles (considering it's been found underneath every major pyramid in the world. In really cold temperatures, mercury becomes a super conductor. As it thaws, it loses almost all of its magnetic charge and reverts to its liquid state. This would explain why mercury levels have increased 6 fold in just over a decade and it would explain the EM field dispersal.

      </p>
      <p>
       Earth's circumference = 40 000 km
      </p>
      <p>
       speed of light = 300 000 km/s
      </p>
      <p>
       300 000 / 40 000 = 7.5
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we could curve light and send it around the Earth, it would go around 7 and a half times in one second. This period is strikingly close to the Schumann resonance because we are talking about an electromagnetic phenomenon.  It's Geoelectromagnetism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone says "the Schumann resonance just went up", the statement can be a little misleading.  The properties that establish the fundamental period have not changed (the speed of light and the size of the earth).   We haven't established a new baseline frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they wanted to be more specific, they could say something like: "harmonic solitons of a higher frequency than the fundamental are currently propagating throughout the magnetosphere".
      </p>
      <p>
       Do our self-generated electromagnetic signals interact with it?  They can't not interact with it.  To what extent?  Few can say, without a transparent audit of our capabilities and how they might be deployed.

       For sure. The way it has been handled makes me wonder though. If the MIB or whatever had their hands in it we wouldn't have heard shit. I wonder if whoever made the find notified too many people outside of the secrecy loop for them to sweep it under the rug.

       Idk how close to the melting ice the stores are,  but i heard they used to dock the nukular  subs up in secreted ice tunnels in the poles and dump alot reactor waste in thr, idk how true that is but they did dump alot just str8 into the ocean from these subs. American and Russians boath did this this barrels  are only rated 50 years and they were faulty and soviet barrels really poorly made.  Iceland is currently very upset cause America dumped alot of radioactive waste thr deep in the ice and that is all thawing out and making a mess. So if musk offers you a seat to go to mars colony shud prob take him up on that.

       "the breakaway civilization". i've also read that other beings won't 'allow' them to leave. i have no idea if either of these are true. but i think it won't be so easy for them to just zoom off to wherever, without dealing with "whatever".

       "The term “Breakaway Civilization” was coined by Richard Dolan after his exhaustive and extensive research into his books UFOs and the National Security State Volumes 1 and 2. He came to the realization that the deep secretive black budget world had actually become a civilization on its own with its own exotic technology, a different view of the cosmos, our place in it, and a different version of Human history. This is a new avenue of research that will delve into the Occult, secret societies, Central Banking, UFO secrecy, the Military Industrial Complex, and the Secret Space Program comprising this Breakaway Civilization."

       This is true. As a physicist i can tell you HUMANS space traveling is impossible but computers could...If say the ruling elite could upload themselves to a super data composer they could in theory live forever and travel space. Time would not be an issue. The sheer entropy of carbon based matter would be their only limitation and in a vacuum that means little. This is why they want the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they're so fucking autistic they don't realize how easily that can go wrong...look at all our computation problens now. Let alone something that complex. Also the existential crisis. What good is a man's memories inside a robot? What even is a man without his bio chemistry to give him emotional cues?

       Westward from my house theres been a steady appearance of multiple UFO's for the last couple weeks. Usually one, sometimes two. They warp or whatever it is they do into that particular patch of sky and park themselves there for hours on end. Watching, like little sentinels. To tell you the truth it makes me a little uneasy. I cant see any good reason they would want to make contact. We have nothing to offer them in return that would be mutually beneficial.

       not to get 'nosy', but do you live near a military base? near Area 51/52?

       you have every reason to feel uneasy, anyone would.

       A small airport is about 45 minutes away, but its not military. The very first time I witnessed them however a jet was scrambled after it shortly after it showed up and managed to chase it off so their might be one close by that Im not aware of. I also dont think theyre ours because of that, although another jet has never been scrambled. I checked out the internet to see if anyone was reporting similar sightings and theres been a number throughout the US, all with the same MO.

       very interesting, is there a large body of water nearby? you're correct about them being chased away, however there's always the chance the UFOs are black op, so authorities wouldn't know.

       have a feeling sightings will increase.

       Well shit, they probably have sold large underground settlement lots to the super elites who can't quite get on the flight. Doesn't really change their motives or the ramifications whether its out in space or underground.

       I agree. Everything seems to be very short-term, like they don't care anymore. They don't even pretend any longer. The conspiracy is becoming overt, the masks are falling. This means their coming final move is already baked in the cake.
