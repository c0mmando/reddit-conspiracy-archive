<p>The &quot;migration crisis&quot; is a socially engineered attack on Europe. The EU kleptocrats who have been pushing war in the ME are the same ones who say Europe must take a billion immigrants.</p>

<p>Even though they admit they can stop the migration at any time if they had to, and meanwhile the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbIc1LZqIAw">big name NGO&#39;s actually are the human traffickers who funnel migrants to Europe under the guise of &quot;rescue operations&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>I respectfully and completely disagree. Your statement falls apart when you consider that the opposite is true. I don&#39;t see Angela Merkel or any other EU head of state lusting for a war in the Middle East, and they&#39;re the people who are taking in the most refugees. Conversely, The people who got the U.S. into Iraq (the GOP and Blue Dog Dems), as well as those trying to provoke the U.S. into attacking Iran <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-vows-any-iranian-ship-that-makes-rude-gestures-to-us-well-blow-it-out-of-the-water/article/2601459">(may I remind you that our current president said that he would blow an Iranian ship out of the water for looking at us the wrong way)</a> absolutely do not want millions of refugees in our country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the groups you just mentioned, with the exception of maybe some of the rank and file GOP, are pushing the war in the ME and immigration. The Democrats (Gabbard aside) have become the war-mongering party. Many of them will claim they are not, or will lament the &quot;unfortunate crisis&quot;, but if they are not opposing it, they are supporting it.</p>

<p>Others will be very public about the doublespeak:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20141215-france-president-hollande-hails-immigration-museum-sarkozy-islam-national-front/">http://www.france24.com/en/20141215-france-president-hollande-hails-immigration-museum-sarkozy-islam-national-front/</a></p>

<p>You&#39;d think Hollande would have wanted to stop the war, not instigate it, if he really cared about migrants.</p>

<p>Funny how the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/wef-boss-schwab-warns-commodities-rout-could-spur-more-migration">Davos elites are hoping for a billion more migrants to Europe</a>, yet there&#39;s never any mention about stopping funding for rebel groups, or actually helping the countries in crisis. Those in power could choose to help these people in their own countries, something that would be better for everyone, but they choose to present mass migration as the only option. Mass migration, historically has been a recipe for mass death. The people pushing this want disruption, division, tension and death.</p>

<p>As for your article about Francois Hollande, I fail to see how he is wrong. It&#39;s not a conspiracy that Assad has been firing on his own citizens, meaning that supporting Assad is supporting a destabilized region prone to producing refugees. Stopping ISIS won&#39;t stop the civil war in Syria, and any reasonable person will agree that Assad has lost his popular mandate to lead. </p>

<p>Your posted article says nothing of the sort. Klaus Schwab (the Davos Elite at the focus of your article) was talking about a hypothetical &quot;substantial social breakdown&quot; if the economies of the developing world collapsed and caused a migration crisis. Schwab is actually arguing that we should be doing everything we can to prevent a collapse because it&#39;s impossible to relocate billions of people.</p>
