And, tuuh, frankly, there&#39;s no money in free energy and greed is impossible to overcome.  So I&#39;m afraid logic dictates we&#39;re stuck with perfectly safe nuclear meltdowns forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of human history has happened without nuclear power. It&#39;s not 100% necessary.</p>

<p>The plants cannot be moved away from water supplies, so therefore there is no &quot;minimal risk,&quot; especially if you subscribe to theories of climate change and water wars.</p>

<p>The fact is, governments and societies collapse and when they do, who will have the resources to maintain the waste, so it isn&#39;t a danger? Japan is falling over itself trying to reign in Fukushima and they have a fully functional government and economy. What happens if the nuclear shit hits the fan in some rebel-run republic or a country reeling from a recent war?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Molten salts are pretty unique in the sense that, yes they can passively cool themselves, without water. I assume that&#39;s what you mean, but a reactors whole job is to generate steam, and that&#39;s done in a closed loop system. </p>

<p>Is all the waste fuel used? Like 100%? No, and i believe that type of efficiency would only come with fusion reactions. Fission will always produce radioactive by products. But we are talking about fuel burn up rates of currently around 5% to upwards of 50%, with the original Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Transatomic, MIT startup, using a MSR, talks about burn ups of 98%, using strictly waste fuel. </p>

<p>Available information talks about MSR needing to pull fission by products from the salt, and thats its downfall, some isotopes are easy to recapture, some not so much. The way I understand it is, the big upside is that they can utilize the already &quot;spent&quot; fuel, which is available and better utilize existing fuel.</p>

<p>Seaborg Tech, is developing a MSR that never changes fuel, and after its life cycle, is able to be converted into a thorium breeder, which is able to produce its own fissile fuel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK, most nuclear power plants are designed to use water as the heat transfer to turn the turbines. The core heats the water to steam, the high powered steam turns the turbine and the turbine runs the generator connected to the power grid. This requires a big body of water traveling through it. Especially if you wish to keep the cost and contaminants down. Kinetic energy from water seems to be the only way to do this. </p>

<p>See the similarity between Chernobyl and Fukushima is that in both cases the plants themselves have terrible ratings. Which mean they weren&#39;t upkept and made out of &quot;cardboard&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no big nuclear guy, and I agree we need better alternative energy sources... But at least momentarily, these idiotic mistakes could be solved if plants were treated with the same level of safety as most modern cars. </p>

<p>The issue is the the public has no idea, so under table deals are made... And terrible oversight occurs. Much like in any other industry. We are fucked by corporate heads... Every single time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP but the too long did not read is: development of nuclear power was payed by tax money and as the cost of a nuclear disaster are so high that the company can not get insurance for if something happens the potential costs are also shifted to the taxpayers.

    <div class="md"><p>In Germany we basically only have 4 large power companies that are operating nuclear power plants and they are mandated to put aside a part of their profits from nuclear for the eventual dismantling. I predict though that once they would have to pay the sub-company that would have the money will go bankrupt and not pay.</p>

<p>Nuclear is not even very cheap compared to others here, it is just a way to make the companies a shit ton of money. They make 1 Million per day per reactor (profit).</p>

<p>Right fucking on. This is the loophole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, right on. Nuke takes long to build, long to dismantle, costs a shitload to build <em>and maintain</em> and there is no good way of taking care of the waste it produces (which is also costly AF). </p>

<p>Solar and wind FTW, you just pop them and they start generating energy with minimal maintenance, no waste and no hidden costs. Matter of fact, the only continuing costs regarding solar and wind are the installation costs which equal to more jobs. Renewables are a silver bullet for a lot of our current problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word. I&#39;m not a nuclear engineer but I understand science and technology. I was having a discussion about Fukushima with an actual nuclear engineer at a party over three years ago. I was trying to either get him to either agree that yeah, we&#39;re fucked, or explain why we&#39;re not fucked. He wasn&#39;t having it. He was just &quot;Bullshit, bullshit, blah, blah, blah, I&#39;m sure they have it under control.&quot; And I&#39;m saying &quot;But it&#39;s making millions and millions of gallons of contaminated water that we don&#39;t know how to clean! And we&#39;re just storing it in ponds! And they think they&#39;re going to somehow freeze the ground to contain it! While it makes more and more uncleanable contaminated water! This is ludicrous!&quot; He just nodded his head and smiled. I think this must be how you get to become a nuclear engineer.
 Interestingly enough, My wife later told me that his wife told her that he really enjoyed talking to me at that party. He was really impressed that I was so interested in technology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had very similar discussions with &quot;scientists&quot; and other people whom I view as very well educated and intelligent.   I don&#39;t understand really, other than the fact that if they do agree with you or I that we are fucked.  It would shatter their entire perspective about the world/government/media.  Which can be very unsettling.  So rather than go through that huge amount of mental workload.  They just smile and say &quot;bullshit, bullshit, blah blah blah.&quot;</p>

<p>But to me the most startling deal is the fact that RadNet, which used to monitor all sorts of radioactive data, from water, air, rain and milk.  Conviently stopped either testing or reporting the tests sometime around April 2011.    I point this out and no response.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An ionospheric heater heated the atmosphere above Japan before the underwater earthquake and tsunami caused the radiation release nightmare at Fukushima.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a copy paste from an older comment. Very relevant.</p>

<p>HAARP would search for weak places in the earth&#39;s mantel and exploit them. That&#39;s a way of saying they can cause earthquakes.</p>

<p>The ionosphere heated unnaturally over Japan for several days before the tsunami that caused 3 nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/</a></p>

<p>HAARP was searching the earths mantel for weak spots and could interact with those weak spots.</p>

<p>&quot;HAARP Detection and Imaging of Underground Structures Using ELF/VLF Radio Waves&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm</a></p>

<p>They had the ability to send ELF and VLF frequencies through the earth to &#39;communicate with submarines&#39; causing a very widespread earth vibration of roughly 10 hz.</p>

<p><a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites">http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously they were sending high frequencies into the ionosphere which I believe bounced down to concentrate the ELF signals to any position desired such as the weak spots they had located exploiting signal harmonics I believe they exacerbated the VLF shaking of the weak underground cavities, thus inciting them to collapse.</p>

<p>Evidence of the high frequency signal bouncing down from the ionosphere to stimulate the low frequency signal in a particular position is seen here. There is a cover story about how these formed but somehow the physics only ever work when an ionospheric heater, such as HAARP is in operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, HAARP is not the only ionospheric heater in existence worldwide. Jet streams and ocean currents bring radiation directly back to the US, kind of shooting ourselves in the foot, no? Im not debating that sources.

    <div class="md"><p>The guy explaining things can barely construct a coherent sentence, it really made the videos unwatchable. Oh, and <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/technology/fukushima.asp">Snopes</a> also proved the map image that conspiracy theorists have been using as evidence of radiation spreading has nothing to do with radiactive water coming out of the reactor.</p>

<p>It&#39;s videos like these that really do the alternative news community a disservice. I have views on things that are deemed by the MSM as conspiracy theories and when non-fact checked videos like these come out, they just further make people who dare question official narratives seem crazy.</p>

<p>I did some Googling and every site I came across that claimed that the ocean is contaminated with radioactive waste from Fukushima was an alternative news website.</p>

<p>And if you think that this is being covered up, we are talking about an entire ocean. Not only are governments monitoring the water, but third parties are as well. Before Fukushima, the ocean already contained contaminants that can be bad for our health in large amounts. There are definitely radioactive nuclides in the water, but currently in such small amounts that they aren&#39;t detrimental to our health. The ocean is a great dilution mechanism.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly that radioactive material pouring into the ocean is horrible. Absolutely horrible. But let&#39;s not scaremonger here, the guy making this video is just an armchair investigator picking and choosing information that fits in with his narrative of us all being doomed.</p>

<p>If you want to spark a depopulation event, this is a lot of work to do it. Why wouldn&#39;t you just trigger an eruption of something like Yellowstone which is overdue? I think humans with our unhealthy lifestyles are killing ourselves without the government needing to do a thing.</p>

<p>maybe if you use DuckDuckGo you&#39;ll get a better result, i searched for &quot;fukushima 2017&quot; and got a bunch of hits from a variety of decents sources, like this one. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-02-scorpion-robot-mission-fukushima-reactor.html">https://phys.org/news/2017-02-scorpion-robot-mission-fukushima-reactor.html</a></p>

<p>Bottom line is **<em>we have no fucking *idea</em> let alone way to clean up this mess, there are about 1200 fuel rods still in the other 2 reactor cores and iirc another 4,000 spent fuel rods were in storage pools surrounding the containment vessl, but these were damaged in the earthquake to and are leaking, which is part of the reason they&#39;re pumping hundreds of <em>tons</em> of seawater in to &#39;keep things cool&#39;! They then are &quot;storing&quot; this <em>huge amount</em> of irradiated seawater into huge plastic &quot;temporary holding tanks&quot;! I&#39;d love to know what TEPCO&#39;s considering for &quot;permanent&quot; holding tanks, and the amount of tanks being filled and &#39;stored&#39; is growing by a crazy amount daily! </p>

<p>Another earthquake like the last and most of these &#39;temporary holding tanks&#39; will fail and <em>millions of tons of highly irradiated water will be released into the immediate enviroment! This would make Tokyo instantly unihabitable, and *suddently</em> Japan&#39;s looking for &#39;temporary housing&#39; for 20 Million people, who are only just the first wave!</p>

<p>TL:DR: we simply do not have the technology to even <em>begin attempting any type of</em> &#39;repair&#39;. --- For staters camera&#39;s and robot&#39;s electronics quickly fry in the super high/high energy radiation surrouning the reactors ,, they&#39;ve been lucky to keep a robot operating for more than a few hours before it dies a highly radioactive death. Plus these &#39;scorpion&#39; robots can&#39;t seem to navigate the terrain about the reator very well, so half it&#39;s useful &#39;life&#39; is used  up simply getting to the core!</p>

<p>FTL:DR: We&#39;re pretty much fucked in the long term! This isn&#39;t just quietly going to stop! It&#39;s <em>far worse</em> than Chernobyl was and <strong>we&#39;ve got no fucking clue what to Do about it!</strong> ,, except to Ban all Chinese media from reporting about the situation, so even a few words written about Fukushima, good, bad or indifferent can land you 10 Years jail! The Chinese don&#39;t fuck around with such things!</p>
