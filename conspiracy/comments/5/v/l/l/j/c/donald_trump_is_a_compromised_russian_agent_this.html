       <strong>
        We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Soon we will be at war.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Our President has been compromised. Our election has been tampered with. The government is rife with foreign agents. Most of our government representatives are likely being blackmailed by Russia (and are DEFINITELY being bribed by corporations).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's treason is only just the beginning. How many people around him know about his Russian puppet strings? How many people around him also answer to Russia? How deep does Russian interference in our government go?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole hellish situation is likely going to end in fire for the co-conspirators and
       <del>
        Good
       </del>
       Men Who Did Nothing. A large chunk of our government is going to get carved out by the inevitable corruption investigations. We could see big handfuls of Senators and Representatives resigning and/or going to jail for their role in this debacle. That's going to create crazy power vacuums.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make literally everything worse for everyone:
       <strong>
        this is a war-worthy offense by Russia.
       </strong>
       They tried a sort of soft coup for political and financial gain. It might be the most devious and destructive thing that's ever happened to our country (definitely the worst crisis the executive branch has ever seen). What form the war will take is beyond my guessing, honestly. It makes my insides too cold to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, instead, let's think about something just as dire, but less physically destructive: the line of succession.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our existing rules for the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession">
        Presidential line of succession,
       </a>
       there are 12 candidates ready to take up the mantle of the President, should a crisis require it. The problem is that we don't know who to trust anymore. Who's a Russian agent? Who's enough of a corporate tool to be a traitor to their country? Because of the Russian element,
       <em>
        can we even consider this Presidency (and thus its cabinet) as valid?
       </em>
       Does Russia's meddling and manipulation invalidate Donald Trump's Presidency? When history looks back at this period, will Donald Trump not count as an official President?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a very, very real chance that we're looking at the first invalid Presidency. If that's the case, does that make his entire administration invalid? Does the line of succession fall apart because we can't trust anyone currently in the administration? Even Paul Ryan and Orrin Hatch can be considered guilty by association, and would probably be forced to resign themselves, caught up in the Russian shitshow.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the President is invalid, and the cabinet is invalid, and the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore are too guilty by association to be trusted, then we have no line of succession.
       <em>
        Who is in charge?
       </em>
       How do we pick a new President?
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that the military will probably take control, forming a junta. Ideally, they'd maintain power only long enough to run a new election. So minimum one year, probably two, of a military government running the US while new candidates campaign for the top spot in the executive branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, there's a thousand little twists and turns that are possible at any given time. We'll probably be at war with Russia for fucking up our government, so we could all die or be drafted or whatever, I don't even know at this point. It's the What Ifs that keep me awake and make my mind race with all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus. I don't even know what to do anymore.

       Why do you guys do this? You'll piece together an entire narrative about pizzagate using emails and codewords and coincidences (to be clear: I'm not sure one way or the other if it's real), but when the writer of the Pissgate dossier turns up dead in his car under suspicious circumstances, you somehow can't put two and two together?

       You have no evidence and just sounds like you're repeating the MSM narrative. Really? They still haven't provided ANY evidence that Russia played a roll in influencing our election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you even listened to a speech by Putin? He's the one pointing out he doesn't want to go to war. Your "war is coming" sounds exactly what I think TPTB want, and that's the next American civil war!

       Well if they weren't lying then they would provide the evidence they claim to have and dispel this rumor for the entire country. Wouldn't THAT be something? I remember once upon a time when IC said saddam had WMDs and we took them at their word. That turned out great.

       You could be right. And if concrete evidence comes out I will be one of the first to condemn Trump. But based off of the hours upon hours I've spent researching this topic, I'm led to believe that this Russia narrative is all a big political game by both the liberal and conservative establishment to turn the public against Trump.

       I think the plan is to delegitimize Trump's presidency and eventually push for his impeachment. They can't do it without mass public support. What better way to do it than tying him with Russia and claiming that he didn't legitimately win the presidency? Hence the  very vauge "Russia HACKED the US election" narrative. Hacked is the keyword here. What does that mean? That is such a vague claim. I was a Bernie supporter. Didn't even vote for Trump. But ever since the election I've started to see how threatened the establishment really is by him being president. When you see people like John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Mitch McConnell buying into this narrative you know something is up. They want Trump out, and establishment Pence in.

       Well, they could release the evidence tomorrow. Or even today, and start the impeachment process tomorrow. Of course the hardcore Trump supporters would deny it all, but for me- looking at it as objectively as possible- I just don't buy it. One thing is for sure: there is more to this than the public knows. There are secrets, and information is being withheld from the public. I don't think that Trump is our lord and savior like many claim. But I do think that he broke through and got elected against all odds. The establishment was never planning on Trump being elected. And in that sense I think he is the real deal. The rest remains to be seen. 2017 is going to be an interesting year that's for sure.

       I think there is no connection because there is no evidence of a connection. Also I think putin cares about the russian people and does not want to give the USA to start slaughtering them for corporate profits just like we do so many other countries.  The establishment has been beating the wardrums for russian blood or at least conflict with russia for a while now.  They want americans excited and giddy about war with russia any way they can, them hacking our elections would be like throwing rocks at a 5 year old with an uzi at this point no way would putin do that.  He has such a high approval rate because the russian people love him, not because they feel threatened for saying they dont approve.

       You know, with the Left having a god damn temper tantrum over Russian influence, how come no one ever brings up the influence Israel has over our government and our political processes. Or the Saudi influence. Trumps ties to Israel should be more concerning than any alleged ties to Russia. Plus, Russia isn't even that bad, certainly the lesser of evils we could partner with, and Russia could help us out with our Soros problem. Send that fucker to Russia, let Putin deal with him.

       I've noticed many on the right or alt-right feel that Jews are controlling our government and are in some sort of conspiracy but seem to not push the matter directly.

      <p>
       Even t_d was reported to hide any topics concerning anti-jewish tendencies and that's met with silence aside from those critical of t_d.

       Nice line up of deep state talking points you have there.  So you're justifying a miliitary take over for the good of the country.  Huh. The CIA has done this in so many other cpuntries; why not here?  Maybe next time Hillary will keep her legs together on classified information and unethical election practices. But I seriously doubt she'll ever have an honest shot at an election again.  It was her election to lose.  Mission accomplished.

       See, I'm not CALLING for it, I'm just explaining how situations like these have gone down in the past. The ways that nations can be twisted into war is absolutely fascinating. The fuck-up we're currently dealing with is a lack of backup procedures regarding succession. They thought to put in place laws against profiting from the office of the president and receiving foreign funds, but didn't anticipate the entire federal government being so corrupt that it's infested with people loyal only to personal gain, many of them bending the knee to their Russian masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the entire government can't be trusted, the military has to step in, because it's sworn to the country
       <em>
        and the constitution,
       </em>
       which stands at the core of our country. The military defends the constitution and attempts to enforce it to maintain peace and stability, becoming a de facto government--a junta. It's just how these things
       <em>
        go.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard procedure for a junta like this is to run a new election while the military serves as an interim government. Simultaneously, we'll probably be at war with Russia, since they're the ones that corrupted our government to the point that it's been declared illegitimate and usurped. They collapsed our government and threatened to throw our country into anarchy. That's not a jab, that's a mortal blow. They're attempting to destroy us by creating chaos and eating ourselves.

       I'm not calling for war, I'm describing how these things have happened in the past. When the government collapses, the military steps in, becomes a junta. Then, either the country turns into a military dictatorship, OR the military serves as an interim government and new elections are held. There's historical precedent for situations like these.

       I understand your thoughts, but you are being very presumptive. You might get a better response by asking "if our president and gov are colliding with Russia and have committed treason..."

       This is a conspiracy sub and everyone welcomes conspiracies, but you kinda jump to a conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       If you relate this to the ongoing pizza gate stuff, it's like me saying "Now that the Clintons are satanic child sex slaves, what prison should we put her in?" You might get some people that are emphatic about convicting her, no one can say they are ready to believe it 100%. Much more conclusive evidence needs to come to light and many more facts need to be proven.

       This is fucking stupid. But even if true, so what? Better to be allied with Russians than Israelis who have been dragging us into their bullshit in the Middle East for way too long. Plus all these dual citizens in powerful positions in our western governments and finance have been way too corrosive.  If things go south here soon we all know who's to blame.  If I were a Jew in the US I'd be planning on making aliyah cuz shit will not be safe.

       See, the problem is that we don't actually have any rules about this kind of thing. We don't have laws that cover the president being blackmailed by a foreign power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you see? There aren't any RULES about this. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO. That tight-lipped meeting with Comey &amp; Co. is clear evidence that moves are being made to try and figure out what the next steps are. We're watching serious fucking history happening right now. We are setting precedent for how to deal with a fully-compromised President, and figuring out how to respond to a soft coup and subsequent collapse of government.

&lt;At the federal level, Article II of the United States Constitution states in Section 4 that "The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors."

       Why would the entire government get impeached?  Not everyone is being accused of Russians dealings. Is pence?  So from my understanding it would go to pence then if pence was found guilty it would go to the speaker of the house. There are rules set up for this scenario. If there is no government then who is paying the military and why are they intervening?  You seem to be getting all doom and gloom about this when if it does turn out true then the worst case is we remove them and other people take over.  The whole government shut down in 2014 due to lack of funds because of the affordable care act and we were just fine but like I said before I believe there no reason to assume the whole government will be shut down and chaos will ensue.

       That is a huge if. You really haven't presented any evidence to back up these claims only questions. I would be more inclined to follow you down the rabbit hole if at least they could prove this was true which they have not been able to do.

       Even if there was some nefarious connection to Russia - which we have not been shown... it shouldn't be a scandal. It's complete brainwashing to make people think Putin or Russians are the 'enemy'.
Neo-libs have become Neo-cons... They hate Trump so much they'd risk a world war just to be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble is many people that won't let these Russian lies go, have ZERO knowledge of world history, and no business telling conspiracy/real truth-minded people what to think. Telling us to trust the CIA/NSA is absurd when you take into account what they have done. And yes, they are assassinating Russian diplomats to provoke Putin - Just like they murdered anyone who could tell the truth about the joke of scandal they tried to push against Trump. They murder anyone and everyone who gets in the way of Establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who won't let this go are starting to look transparently dishonest if not mentally ill. You do not pick a fight with a superpower that wants to be allies because your candidate did not win the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has meddled in affairs of every country in the world. Assassinations, drug running, one scandal after another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian helped defeat the Nazis... and have been the only ones making progress against US-FUNDED, US-CREATED ISIS... the Cold War was all fake to begin with. It was a plot to fund an arms race because $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only think I'm worried about right now is that these people who can't accept a democratically elected president would sooner have another civil war then behave rationally.

       I don't know whose quote that is but that is not even a remote possibility. People should know better in this sub... all major conflicts are manufactured. Allies are better than enemies.
