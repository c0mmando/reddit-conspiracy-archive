       If you believe that Milo resigned from breitbart because the liberal media deceptively edited videos then that must mean breitbart is a liberal schill. We all know that's not the case. So why did Milo resign?
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo was hired by brietbart to be controversial, brietbart feeds off of that energy, they feed off of the media overreacting. So if the videos of Milo talking about pedophilia were deceptively edited to make Milo look bad then why did he resign? If anything this would play into brietbarts narrative that the liberal media is untrustworthy. It would seem like this is exactly the kind of story they feed off. So why did Milo resign? A person who was hired to make controversial statements was fired because he made controversial statements? Not likely .
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Milo hired by brietbart in the first place? Were they not aware of his views? Unlikely since Milo was chosen specially for his controversial views. The conservative narrative has long been that conservatives do not hate gays they hate flamboyant in your face gays. Who's more flamboyant than milo? Brietbart couldn't find a less in your face homosexual who shared their views? Milo must have brought something else to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's look at his thoughts on pedophilia. Milo has stated many times that pedophilia cannot occur between a sexually mature child and an adult and that age of consent laws are arbitrary and oppressive. So as long as the child is sexually mature then it's fair game.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with trump? Trump has been accused by several miss teen USA contestants of walking in on them while they were changing. Remember this is miss TEEN USA not miss USA or miss universe, Miss TEEN USA. Now on it's own the conservative media and brietbart would say this is fake news or a fake controversy, that trumps duties would have brought him to the changing room and that there's nothing nefarious about him walking into a changing room while several teenage girls were undressing. Maybe for your  daughters that's ok but if it was me I wouldn't want a 60 year old man in the changing room with my teenage daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is unless you believe that pedophelia cannot occur between an adult and a sexually mature child ( the contestants or miss universe must be no younger  than 14 and and no older than 19 years of age).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that Milo did not resign from brietbart because of controversial statements he made or editing of videos by the liberal media. If that was the case that would directly play into the narrative that the media cannot be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo resigned to protect Steve bannon and Donald trump. Milo attracted young confused boys for the sexual gratification of Donald trump and Steve bannon and once his statements on pedophilia were made public it became too dangerous for them to continue associating with milo. in order to protect trump,  bannon and the rest of the deviants at brietbart, Milo had to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: paid brietbart commentators will attack this theory because it hits too close to home and they know that trump, bannon and breitbart will soon be exposed for the degenerates they are. They fear the truth coming out but we cannot let their fear stop us from getting to the truth. That's why trump must release his tax returns, the evidence is all in his tax returns. Hence his refusal to disclose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/the_donald is out in full force trying to suppress the truth. But the truth bends for no one. The struggle continues.

       Trump on Jeffrey Epstein, obviously he said this before the truth came out but...
      </p>
      <p>
       "I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

       Almost sounds as if he knows how Epstein blackmail works and is sending a threat to JE.  Like "hey fuckers, I know about your pedo blackmail scheme and if you try it on me I'm not afraid to out you"

       Maybe that's why he ran for pres.  I doubt it, but obviously the DOJ and Comey were not going to prosecute any pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you are aware that Epstein likely works for Mossad right?  Exposing him and saving the kids might not be as "simple" as you'd think.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all just conjecture though.  I could care less who is the pedos in govt as long as they are rooted out.  Team trump OR team podesta, though team podesta is clearly more suspicious.

       That truth has been out since august dipshit.  We know trump might be a pedo.  If he is let's take him down too.  But if you want to ignore all the pizzagate evidence then you are a pedo apologist.

       This is solidly within the realm of possibility considering the charges filed against him and known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which she was pressured to drop in the days leading up to the election. Nice to see someone on this subreddit not riding Trump's jock, literally or metaphorically.

       To all the Cambridge Analytica bots in here - this sub is about conspiracy theories, and this is a theory. Don't automatically dismiss it. Surely, if you can believe pizzagate, you can believe this. Or at the very least, entertain the thought and rebuke it with some logic.

       Trump on known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein 
I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI also found that Epstein had 14 different contacts for trump as well as phone numbers for his maid and security.

       Milo works for brietbart which was run by Steve Bannon, it's not just boys it boys and girls. It's no coincide that participants in miss teen USA must be between the ages of 14 and 19 and suddenly a tape comes out of nowhere from supposedly right wing sources of milo condoning sex with children over the age of 13 he even tries to use the scenario of a guy seeing a good looking 15 year old girl on the street. It's an attempt to soften the blow if more evidence gets out.

       This is littered with inaccuracies. Its baffling anyone can actually get behind such nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo resigned because Pedophilia is a no go for everybody. Period. Breitbart staff was threatening to quit if he wasnt fired. Has nothing to do with the establishments false dichotomy two party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you believe that Milo resigned from breitbart because the liberal media deceptively edited videos then that must mean breitbart is a liberal schill. We all know that's not the case. So why did Milo resign?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Im still trying to figure out the mental gymnastics behind this opening. How does Milo resigning due to public outrage (not a political party, everyone) have to do with Breitbart being a "liberal schill"?
      </p>
      <p>
       There isnt a single tangible thought in this entire post. Im left only to believe you just dont like Trump. News flash: lots of us dont, myself included. That doesnt mean you go on recklessly claiming hes a pedophile and that conservative media personalities scapegoats on stand bye.

       People who are frightened of the truth will alway refuse to see it, even when it stares them right in the face. You expect us to believe that brietbart the anti-pc website had milo resign because he made some poltically incorrect statements? Lol Not likely. Breitbart feeds off of this kind of controversy, they have cultivated it for years and hired Milo specially for his controversial views. We know that trump went into the changing room while participants of miss teen USA where changing ( miss teen USA participants must be between 14 and 19 years of age) kinda messed up when you think about it. Unless you believe like Milo does that pedophilia can only occur if the child is not sexually mature and that age of consent laws are arbitrary and oppressive , then it's perfectly acceptable for a 60 year old man to loiter about as teenage girls undress. And notice that Milo was specifically talking about 13 year olds. What is the minimum age requirement to enter miss teen USA? 14. What a coincidence that contestants for miss universe must be one year older than what Milo believes is the acceptable age of consent for sexually mature children.

       How do you explain that Trump was loitering around teenage girls, but you claim that as evidence Milo brings him gay teens?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was hanging out in the locker room of a basketball team or something I could see how you got to that. But right now I don't see how this supposed behaviour of Trump makes him a gay pedo.

       Truth is a scary thing for people with minds too little to receive it. Trumps days of feasting on the flesh of young innocent children will soon be at an end. It's no coincidence that a tape of milo justifying sex with children older then 13 years surfaced it was all part of plan, miss teen USA contestants must be between the ages of 14 and 19.

       And yet trump refuses to reveal his taxes. I guess that's just another coincidence. Couldn't be all that money he gave Jeffrey Epstein he doesn't want you to see. its not hard if you try sweetie.

       the only ones crying about the taxes are the ones that hate him and want to sow discord.  His taxes wouldn't say who he paid for, you think if he releases his taxes that he is going to release every little receipt he has?

       This doesn't even qualify as conjecture. You literally have
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       factual premises upon which your "belief" is based.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a tip. First, go buy a book on critical thinking. You can do this from your parent's basement, which is surely where you posted this from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't come out until you have learned how to evaluate evidence, and how to draw conclusions from that evidence using logical reasoning. It will take several months, but I'm sure your mom will bring you Mountain Dew and Cheetos to keep you going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, punch yourself in the face, which is certainly what you will want to do if you successfully follow the previous advice and then re-read this post that you've made.
