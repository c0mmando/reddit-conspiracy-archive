        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Donald Trump is a lying, sociopathic, narcissistic establishment puppet who does not care about anybody but himself and his rich friends. His cabinet is the exact definition of cronyism. He has appointed no one but corporate executives, all members of the establishment. There are countless Goldman Sachs executives in it and the combining net worth of the entire cabinet exceeds $13 billion. These are all people that have been in on the social and economic problems we face in not only this country, but all over the globe.</p>

<p>If his cabinet isn&#39;t bad enough, look at his failure to keep promises. He has explicitly stated that he will NOT pursue an investigation against Hillary Clinton. End of discussion. He said that ISIS was created by Obama and Clinton, then retracted this statement and called it a joke. He said he would reveal the truth behind the 9/11 attacks. I could go on and on for days, the point I&#39;m trying to make here is that he&#39;s a lying, manipulative, shady, underhanded, demagogic bullshitter. Everything I stated about his promises and administration is a fact. When are Trump supporters going to get it? Not only are you incontrovertible to Trump&#39;s grandiose and illusory persona of being infallible, but you have effectively become shills for the government. Trump hasn&#39;t revealed the truth on anything, nor has he acted on anything. He is instead going along with the fictional narrative of an imminent Muslim terrorism threat by trying to enforce a travel ban. Trump is just another mask on the same face. </p>

Those shills ruin it for everyone.</p>

<p>Trump is hated by the cabal and so they are trying to brainwash the population into hating him. Don&#39;t fall into his trap. At least don&#39;t judge until end of year. We will have hard data by end of year to see how much America has improved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, I really do. I don&#39;t trust the media either and if Obama was doing the same thing it would have a different spin. The things they are not reporting on is concerning to me. The things they are outraged about are distractions anyway. </p>

<p>Since you seem sane compared to others I&#39;ve interacted with on here maybe you&#39;ll read this article about the establishment and trump. Trump has surrounded himself with the dream team of the establishment, they use advanced AI on social media to control the narrative. Google Cambridge analytics if you want to read how effective that is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is I know how minor stories are thrown purposefully out of proportion which totally fake news is also pushed on trump every day. This is why I can&#39;t take them seriously anymore. </p>

<p>Keep in mind. Not a peep from msm about pedophelia, Hillary selling out America, banks dominating us like slaves, federal reserve stuff, Satanic worship among the elite, etc...  </p>

<p>This is because they are hiding it while trying to dump as much as they can on trump to take the attention of themselves. There are so many devils in power, it&#39;s sickening and people like me see trump as a grave and witty man who is using the ideals of a happy people to motivate him and shake up the country. He&#39;s literally risking his life and his families lives. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s a war between the established, treacherous cabal who controls mass media vs trump and his supporters. One controls very effective propoganda machines while the other holds the hearts of the people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally a battle over winning minds right now because the cabal is shitting 2 ton bricks right now. They are so afraid of the people seeing them for who they are and now it has happened. Trump did help us unmask Hillary and Obama but the people put in a lot of work. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole shitstorm in D.C. Because of this. McCain is shitting bricks, CIA is splitting into 2 parts (1 for trump, 1 for cabal), the military and cops love trump, FBI is pretty for trump, obama is running a parallel government I think, and NATO is melting before our eye sees. Israel is going to eat some massive shit as the word spreads that they did 9-11 and they also tricked many politicians into having sex with 16 year old spy girls with fake IDs. There are full blown pedos that are under Israeli control, and people who confused a 16 year old with an 18 year old under Israeli control. This is really going to give Israel a bad reputation. Hell there were Jewish attacks just yesterday I think. </p>

<p>The Americans are sick and tired of all this bullshit. The cabal is exposed and weakening, the people are starting to hold politicians accountable, and the internet is the people&#39;s new town square even though David Brock actually hired real shills to manipulate the public using our tax dollars. </p>

<p>I knew 2017 would end up being a hell of a year but I have high hopes about the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, right on with Cambridge analytics </p>

<p>Here is a decent article on how well it works. It works so well that the designers say it&#39;s dangerous because of how affective it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well going by Trump&#39;s standards, he would&#39;ve finished everything on the first day, so yes. You guys are killing me. He&#39;s a demagogue, so those of us that know the truth knew he would never fulfill this promise, and Trump supporters know that he&#39;s a blowhard. They don&#39;t take what he says seriously either. </p>

<p>So again, yes he was supposed to do it by now. So far he has done nothing relating to 9/11 truth but as a matter of fact, this was a year ago, so I&#39;m sure this just got buried with countless other forgotten hopes. </p>
