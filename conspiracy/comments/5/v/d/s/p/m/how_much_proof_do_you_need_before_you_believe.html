        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel so many of us don&#39;t look at the big picture enough by getting caught up in the daily chaos of trying to figure out what is true and what is false information and miss the point that our system has been corrupt and controlled by a small group of elite (old rich families) for a very long time. </p>

<p>We have to realize we all deal with varying degrees of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>.</p>

<p>We know the government lies to us:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/KRTOB8JPwa8">Bill Clinton on CSPAN apologizes for 1000&#39;s of government sponsored radiation experiments that were unethical and without consent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJCPcYCupY">Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld all lied about WMD&#39;s in IRAQ</a></li>
<li>This list could be massively long but you get the idea...</li>
</ul>

<p>We know they <a href="http://www.infographicsarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IllusionofChoice.jpg">own the Media</a> and <a href="http://angrybearblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Corporate-connections-by-brand.jpg">most corporations.</a></p>

<p>I think there is more than enough proof... we need to unite our minds and build a new system that can not be controlled by an elite few or any particular group for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They lie all of the time, but your average american is oblivious.</p>

<p>Another way to look at your slavery is this: I ask myself all the time why it should take more than 30 years of your life to simply own a modest home.  You&#39;re fortunate if both spouses working multiple jobs can do it today.  Thirty years is a short estimate, since you have to build credit, etc.  Why should it be so difficult to simply put a roof over your head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A great perspective to keep in mind! ... Another one is every time I enter a supermarket (one of the many scattered about in my city) I take a moment and realize how much food each one has and how easy it would be to take a tiny percentage of it and feed the hungry. No one should be hungry with our current abundance of food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  It fills me with some happiness that someone else recognizes that.  Look at how much life we really miss being wrapped up in jobs we don&#39;t like, just to put a roof over our head.  I think that&#39;s why movies like Fight Club aren&#39;t really talked about very much.  There are some profound moments about consumerism, capitalism in that movie that don&#39;t benefit the machine.</p>

<p>Except this strange, inhuman thing labeled as &quot;real life&quot; gets in the way all the time. Artificial scarcity.... Our planet has more than enough resources and methods to gather them, which doesn&#39;t take as much time as we have to work. It&#39;s all an illusion to keep us in invisible chains.</p>
