       I feel so many of us don't look at the big picture enough by getting caught up in the daily chaos of trying to figure out what is true and what is false information and miss the point that our system has been corrupt and controlled by a small group of elite (old rich families) for a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to realize we all deal with varying degrees of

       .

      <p>
       We know the government lies to us:

      </p>

       I think there is more than enough proof... we need to unite our minds and build a new system that can not be controlled by an elite few or any particular group for that matter.

       We can not rely on Trump for anything. You have to see that he is absolutely a part of (and proponent of) the status quo. He may have questioned certain controversies during his campaign but he is now falling into place just like Obama did.

       Its barely been 30 days. I understand your suspicions and you should always be cautious but judge him at least at the end of 60 days and later 100 days and finally end of year. This way you can track everything plus see if your life has improved at all.

       Another way to look at your slavery is this: I ask myself all the time why it should take more than 30 years of your life to simply own a modest home.  You're fortunate if both spouses working multiple jobs can do it today.  Thirty years is a short estimate, since you have to build credit, etc.  Why should it be so difficult to simply put a roof over your head?

       A great perspective to keep in mind! ... Another one is every time I enter a supermarket (one of the many scattered about in my city) I take a moment and realize how much food each one has and how easy it would be to take a tiny percentage of it and feed the hungry. No one should be hungry with our current abundance of food.

       Does the US grow the most food in the world? Seems like we have the land and climate to really take advantage of food shortages.. If more people grew their own gardens and learned to bypass the big grocery stores like they used to at farmers markets and the like. Think, help, grow local and less reliant on big companies and government for help maybe?

       Exactly.  It fills me with some happiness that someone else recognizes that.  Look at how much life we really miss being wrapped up in jobs we don't like, just to put a roof over our head.  I think that's why movies like Fight Club aren't really talked about very much.  There are some profound moments about consumerism, capitalism in that movie that don't benefit the machine.

       I was lucky I was very sensitive to this growing up... I always thought "why the hell do I have to be in school for 8 hours a day.. plus homework..." I loved real life itself... so much to explore... so much to do....
      </p>
      <p>
       Except this strange, inhuman thing labeled as "real life" gets in the way all the time. Artificial scarcity.... Our planet has more than enough resources and methods to gather them, which doesn't take as much time as we have to work. It's all an illusion to keep us in invisible chains.

       I get to ski in the winter, wake board and mountain bike in the summer.  I get to eat great food, drink delicious wine or whiskey, date beautiful women, drive nice cars and enjoy great health.  It could be a lot worse.

       I think that's our purpose, is slavery. It's sad but true. And the best way to do it is to through not telling us. Them maintaining control even though we think we have control.
