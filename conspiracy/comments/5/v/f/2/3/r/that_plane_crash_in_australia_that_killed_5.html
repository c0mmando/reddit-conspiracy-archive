       No way to know at this point if it was some kind of a hit, apparently the pilot had issues in the past, but I'd be real interested in the background &amp; recent dealings of that particular group.

       Was reading the insider on 4chan and he said something akin to people being "removed" in multiple ways. If they release the names looking for links to CF et al would probably help. Not sure because one gets the feeling that there's a LOT of people not even on the radar but who are "part of the problem."

       I wish i could kick back, but i worry too much - but I will say, i absolutely do believe that there is a 'Boondock Saints' or 'V for Vendetta' modern-day type organization that does exactly this: realizes there are some people who are too powerful for the courts, so takes matters into their own hands and executes righteous justice upon them.  There HAS to be some good people out there in positions of power/intelligence

       Right after the election I had told some friends that we dodged a bullet. If it had been Hillary we would be at war with Russia. A war we cannot possibly win, and perhaps by design. (Obama decimated the military and the leadership.) By electing Trump we were still going to have "war" but it would be internal, and as a society asleep at the wheel happily and blindly consuming but conveniently ignoring the actions of our government, it was time to clean up our act and pay the piper. I told them that "THEY" would not go quietly into that dark night as there was too much at stake. They laughed at me then. They're not laughing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not a person is on the Trump train, there is plenty of freely available information to expose to anyone who actually cares to look, what a vile POS our government is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can be a proud American as a person, and still be faithful to the values that helped make us a formerly free country, have faith in most of my fellow Americans..that they too would want the corruption exposed, our war mongering and perpetual interference to be ended. For us to actually BE our words. WOW was I wrong. I'm witnessing people so devoted to tearing things apart that the truth has become revolutionary. Up is down, black is white, good is evil. I feel like I've entered into Bizarro World.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter our personal feelings we should be working together to solve this instead of attacking each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot honestly (and I've tried) find anything Trump has ever said or done in his entire life, that will ever come close to be as evil as the email telling Hillary to embrace the murder of Qaddafi and destruction of Libyia all the way to the White House to prove she's tough.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF? We have destroyed Libya, for what? What was our right to do that? They've been playing games with our lives and getting away with it for much too long and our gullibility in blindly following where ever they told us to go is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       What possible excuse can anyone offer for hating Trump more than they hate the lies we've been fed?
      </p>
      <p>
       We had the "left" screaming about rape culture, slut shaming, body shaming,..who then turned around and attacked Melania Trump for having been a drop dead gorgeous super model, marching with "Rape Melania" signs..now rape is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had the "left" publishing VERY pro pedophilia articles, no one said a word when Lena talked about sexually abusing her sister, no worries, no shame...then Milo talks about being sexually abused in a way that's easiest for him to express it, and suddenly he's a dangerous pedo and they hate pedos.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what it is, no matter if it's true, it will be attacked and retrofitted because someone hates Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched Tucker try to get this Nevertrump protest guy to actually explain why he's afraid of Trump. I'm still waiting to hear why people are choosing to be terrified of Trump.  Trump got elected because he promise to enforce our immigration laws. This is a good thing. If that pisses people off, so be it. I wouldn't get any "mercy" being illegal in Mexico. Open Borders? How is it open borders if the traffic is only one way? The last thing Mexico wants is open borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political asshattery is off the charts. The mayor of my city went public stating we were a sanctuary city. That's a lie. They're nabbing illegals left and right. I was SO happy to discover that the 2 times deported felon that robbed me and a friend was caught..and immediately shipped out. This time he won't be coming back. I'm happy about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       California spends 25billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. They rioted, screamed, made plans to exit the union. And have had the NERVE to blame the flooding on Trump and demand federal dollars. I realize the bulk of the area flooding is red zones, which does cause one to wonder if the neglect to that area was purposeful. They don't need a high speed train. They need to fix their infrastructure and clean the trash out of their crime ridden ghettos. I heard a Senator the night they evacuated Orville the first time, actually turn it into Trump's fault. He said something like "Well Mr. President, instead of deporting immigrants maybe you should be building us a new dam". I about dropped my teeth. I'm MORE than pleased our President has not said a word about California. He released FEMA funds, but I surely hope he never says another word. The destruction alone that California has committed upon itself needs to rest firmly on the head of Californians who got all cozy with the way things were, and just let it all ride. Now is the time to pay the piper for being asleep at the wheel. And the nerve of that state threatening the rest of the country because like petulant children they didn't get their way. Good riddance.

       Did you notice the factored in the 3.7 billion paid in taxes? I didn't find the site to be biased. In fact that number has been spoken of almost everywhere when referring to California's welfare expenditures for illegals.  Are you asking ME to provide YOU with a source that feeds you numbers you can be comfortable with? Perhaps CNN has different numbers.

       Illegal aliens are not disenfranchised Americans. They are illegal aliens and citizens of other countries and one can tell that because they are continually waving the flags of other countries and demanding their rights. For the unschooled, Illegal Aliens have NO Constitutional rights. They have "human rights' which means we can't roll them up in cement and toss them in the ocean, but WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA=citizens. Period. You want open borders? Nice. Please enter into negotiations with both Mexico and Canada on how they need to open their borders. Maybe Americans can pop down to Mexico and make it great...for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not my responsibility to clear up Mexico. My responsibility was to vote for a candidate that is going to clean up MY country.

       They're right, President Trump is NOT their president.

       I love the truth. It comes from having swallowed too many lies in this life, given too much of my hope away to ideologies that are fantasy. It's a great day that you're willing to just STFU and say, yep, that's the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open those borders. I'm happy to buy up some primo land at rock bottom prices and settle in Mexico. I'll start a business and put some Mexicans to work. No one ever really wants to go to Canada. Look at all the Hollywood stars who picked that as their lessor of two evils and still didn't go :( Too damn cold, plus it's ruled by Castro's son.

       For non melinated persons you are exactly correct, those are the immigration rules. However those same rules do not apply to persons with brown skin and whose name is Jose or Mohammad...it is what it is. If they applied those rules every person fleeing the US to Canada would have been stopped and taken into custody. Trust me the people fleeing to Canada, are not "our best".
      </p>

       Canada is taking them to make us look bad. Don't care, it's your funeral. We told our government enough and it's over. It's up to Canadians to decide if they want to Sharia or not.

       You didn't say anything of any note. I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings but "dwarfed by corporate tax breaks" still doesn't decrease the crowded classrooms, clean up crime ridden neighborhoods or perhaps it was the "probably because I've seen reports" LOL. I bet you Nancy Grace. She's always "seen reports Larry".

       If your befuddled, confused and disjointed comment was something I was intended to address, I completely missed your point. Likely because it was lazily communicated or, maybe, I've heard all that tired old crap before.

       corporate tax break are a different arguement  altogether. You can introduce all the it's not fair strawman arguements you'd like, it doesn't change the facts. illegal immigration is illegal , we need to know and regulate who's coming into our country, and we need Voter ID. Like he said , open borders is not reality, the traffic only goes one way.

       An estimated 3 million illegal aliens voted in California alone. LOL i watched an Aussie register to vote in California via his phone. OMG of course they voted. Why are people acting so stupid? I about died when that illegal deported 6 times complained she didn't do anything illegal. Oh, peanut, I dunno, how about driving? I hope this spring is full of illegal alien garage sales. Once you get caught and deported you cannot come legally :) So best to deport yourself and try legally. That's a better chance than nothing. :D Plus, think of all the family reunions!

       Great write-up. I would say, in response to the "people choosing to be terrified of Trump," I would say the public/youth response would be far less volatile had the media taken one single fucking measure to rationally explain the state of the world to people instead of whipping everybody into a fucking frenzy for ratings.

       I don't even. I don't understand how AMERICAN women can cheer Linda Sansour who is an unabashed Sharia law advocate and a BFF to Hamas, and ALLAH AKBAR at the tops of their lungs (then bitch b/c Melania read the Lord's Prayer) and have that monster Donna Hilton, who murdered a man by shoving a metal pipe up his ass and claiming it was justified because he wiggled when it went it therefore he must be gay. And marching about wearing vaginas? WTAF? Oh hey gramma can you tell me about the time you wore a vagina and marched against human and women's rights and cheered a murderer?

       Resonant disconnect...and if you bring it up, they only retort is OMG ur so raciss, bigoted, xenophobic Hilter.

       Look, the media surely did whip things up, but I'm sorry, I've never in my life let the media dictate what I do. People are responsible for their own behavior. There's way too little of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you afraid? BECAUSE TRUMP....because what? I wouldn't have voted for him if he were antigay, but I'm damn pleased he's set the bathroom issue straight. Mentally ill persons do not have the right to drive policy. They need help, not encouragement. And no one should ever bully or harm someone who is mentally ill. We've got an entire generation of kids raised in day care by harried workers whose only interest was in creating calm cooperative collective behavior.

       I have had enough of the racist shit. 2% of white Americans owned slaves, but 17% of blacks who could, owned slaves. Africans sold their captives into slavery. I'm sick of idiot academics who haven't left their office in 20 years dreaming up asshattery like "it's racist to read to your kids",

       Stop making excuses for people who fail their kids and who are not intelligent enough or don't care to learn to speak, read and write proper English and know how/when to use it. If it puts them at a disadvantage so be it.

       All of this ^ ! 
I have tried and tried to get people I know IRL to explain why they are afraid. Why they are outraged. I get nothing but the excuse "if you don't get it you are part of the problem". I can't fathom what happened from Nov. 7th to Nov 8th that turned me from a close friend/good neighbor/co-worker to mortal enemy #1 overnight.

       I've found that people need to be afraid &amp; angry. It gives them purpose in an otherwise mundane life. Got to see what the latest outrage on Facebook or twitter so they can get that blood boiling. Got get that daily online argument in so they feel smart &amp; included. This fear is fabricated, only the ones that are afraid don't know they are being made to feel that way.

       I have been around long enough to understand if they are in the White House, they are somewhat dangerous. And I've also been around long enough to know there's not damn thing we can do when the shit hits the fan. 
I don't think Trump is anymore dangerous than Clinton would have been. They all suck.

       What people are missing about pedogate and all this stuff is that the real power players wont be caught. Instead, all the links to them will. Thus providing them with immunity from public condemnation. There is a reason the floating eye over the pyramid is their symbol. The are knocking out the bottom pegs so they can float freely above the public.

       Peekay is an Australian national treasure. Good bloke who only want to make people aware of what is really going on in this world. The Melbourne Car Attack on Flinders St was a hoax as well and poor Peekay got silenced for it. Psychopaths run the world.

       Greg Reynolds De Haven is the name of the former FBI Agent who died in the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't been able to find any references to him that are not about the crash. I'd say there is a high probability that he was considered a high value target, possibly as a witness. It would be worthwhile to see if anyone can track down any information that would connect him to past FBI trafficking cases.

       I still haven't seen any follow up since this first broke in terms of conspiracies.  The only person who was being investigated was the pilot because of a near collision in 2015 but he was also well experienced.  It is odd, according to Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner, that his final words were only Mayday Mayday Mayday and the commissioner states that this type of twin engine plane should have still "glided" during engine failure. Maybe there is something fishy.
