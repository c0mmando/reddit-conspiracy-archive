I don&#39;t mean to say even half of you support him, but support for him pops up on this thread more than even for Bernie and other candidates/politicians.</p>

<p>Why do you think he&#39;s any more credible or honest or on our side than a Obama, Clinton, Theresa May, etc? Even if he brings up issues that others won&#39;t, ones that point at conspiracies, what makes you think he&#39;s in it for you guys, for us?</p>

<p>I should have added: I don&#39;t trust other politicians more than him, though given his position, I ESPECIALLY don&#39;t trust him.</p>

Say what you want about you, you CANNOT deny that he red pilled a lot of people in this country. And you CANNOT deny that that is fucking awesome. Whether he&#39;s a pawn or not, he was a great tool for the American people in this revolution against TPTB.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump is obviously not your typical politician. His unorthodox ways during the campaign won over many hearts of those who despise the ilk of capitol hill. You cannot deny that he&#39;s broken the mold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really can&#39;t comprehend how many people can actually trust a 70 year old man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, so far, I think he&#39;s on track to completing his list of campaign promises (<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/</a>), displaying more energy than any 70 year old man I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>You can continue to disparage Trump and his supporters for the next 4-8 years, with your privilege of free and unfettered speech, but when he manages to get things done and be an effective president, amid all the opposition and fervor aimed his way, you&#39;ll eventually have to give him credit. Or you can just continue being an asshole. Isn&#39;t America great?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and his supporters think he is anti- establishment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they do. While at the same time his opposition claims he is a fascist dictator. What a nation of contrasts.</p>

There are allegations against Trump, most of which can be objectively dismissed as misinformation by anyone possessing a modicum of critical thinking. Obama and Clinton, the mainstream media, and the establishment, on the other hand, have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have betrayed our nation time and again.

    <div class="md"><p>Most people have not experienced the joy of steady human progress. In reality we can sit here hitting one massive homer in after another for a very long time to come but the problem is presidents either don&#39;t want this since it goes against the cabal or they are too afraid and concede to them. </p>

<p>The cabal makes claims that we can lower the debt by 2% over the next 8 years and they think we will be satisfied by that. They only throw bones to appease us. </p>

<p>If trump is real and lightning fast, then he will hit one grand slam after another while the people experience the positive consequences which will motivate them to help the process. Many are helping already. </p>

<p>The snowball effect has taken place and now we are like a small ball rolling down a hill and getting bigger and better as we go. This is how a good business is run and the country should start feeling the effects but just barely by end of April. After that, it only gets better and better so if we can feel these daily improvements gradually, and so we will become a grateful people and then help those still stumbling around. </p>

<p>Trump even said it&#39;s going to get better and better so rapidly that we can take the excitement and we almost wish for a vacation. This happen in booming businesses where bosses are experiencing such a rush that it&#39;s almost unbearable. He did promise this and I can literally see it just barely budding since it&#39;s only 30 days in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I believe Trump is a moron, but I voted for him because he is not a politician.  If he was he wouldn&#39;t keep making these incredibly simple stupid gaffes.  He is an ego maniac and that trait alone is what is driving him to keep his campaign promises so far, which he has (whether you agree with the promises or not).  He believes if he does what he said he would do, the people will love him.  His ego needs this.  He has money, so he is not necessarily in it for the money.  That doesn&#39;t mean that he secretly doesn&#39;t want more money, but at this juncture I think he wants to prove to &quot;his&quot; voters that he is a man of his word.  I would have voted for a rock over Bernie or Hillary.  Turns out Trump is that rock.  Until he does something seriously suspect I am going to support him.  I hope he succeeds with all of his campaign promises.  Every one of them is good for America.  If he does that he will go down as the greatest POTUS to date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate this shit.</p>

<p>The conspiracies that surround Clinton are thousands of feet of quick sand deep. Why are all these shills getting on the sub pretending like the Clintons are the fucking knees bees.</p>

<p>Trumps biggest conspiracies running right now are pissing hookers, ties to the mafia, slight ties to Russia, a definite Jew tie (Rothschild and Feinstein), and Israel ties.</p>

<p>God fuck come on, attached is an image of the suspect list of people the CLINTONS HAVE KILLED. Wanna know how many people trump is suspected of murdering, 0. </p>

<p>This sub is about conspiracies. </p>

<p>The Clintons live eat breath piss shit conspiracy. They are a conspiracy. People think their fucking reptiles. </p>

<p>Come the fuck on. This sub has a hard in for the Clintons because they are the biggest most corrupt pieces of shit EVER. EVER. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/G4BKlJQ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/G4BKlJQ.jpg</a> </p>

<p>The idea that Clinton or Obama are more trustworthy is miles off base. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how I feel at this very moment but don&#39;t think I am not cautious and observant. I disagree with people calling him god emperor. He&#39;s just an equal to us and is capable of mistakes down the line so we have to keep him honest but I think he has massive self control of himself and can&#39;t be duped into following the dark path like Obama did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, if he doesn&#39;t get the US into another war, bankrupt the economy, create record high unemployment, I&#39;ll be surprised. Hell, I&#39;ll even start supported the old spoilt prick!  </p>

<p>He is the elite. Mark my words. He does not care for the common man.  </p>

<p>P.S. where are his tax returns?</p>
