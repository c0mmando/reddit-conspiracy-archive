Beyond just making shit up he speculates all the time and gets stuff wrong. I remember during the Ebola outbreak he said that Obama was bringing Ebola patients to the U.S. so cause an outbreak and force people in FEMA death camps. Of course, this never happened. </p>

<p>Half of them think he&#39;s paid for and controlled, and the other half don&#39;t like him &quot;taking advantage of his listeners&quot; by sustaining themselves on the paranoia paraphernalia they sell in their store.</p>

<p>These people are more often than not 100% distrustful, and wouldn&#39;t accept the fact that anyone with any weight is on their side no matter who it was.</p>

<p>Really, the people not running their mouths crying &quot;shill!&quot; see the same &quot;signs&quot; that everyone else does. Instead of going on some insane crusade to &quot;expose&quot; him based on some subjective evidence that he&#39;s COINTELPRO, they just listen to him and take what he says with a grain of salt, and verify the things he&#39;s saying themselves.</p>

<p>Taxes are probably going down (including the death tax-to 0% even if that applies to the &quot;rich&quot; 6 million isn&#39;t that much. Also that could have been lowered to affect most Americans.); markets up; he hasn&#39;t pushed for war (we&#39;d be in war if Hillary was president); He can&#39;t do much for the currency itself. Ron Paul who predicted the housing market crash; has also predicted that there will be a crash in the dollar. </p>

<p>I believe china has slowed down on American currency; I heard some news of the Saudi&#39;s and Chinese dumping dollars. The market for bonds is changing I think from a bull to a bear market. All of these things are coming together along with interest rates going up that are sure to cause great strain on the dollar.</p>

<p>I also think it will soon be rejected as the currency for trading oil in favor of a stronger fiat currency or gold. That will destroy it. Along with turmoil in Europe from a failing euro.</p>

<p>Go ahead and lookup Ron Paul&#39;s prediction on the housing collapse and dollar. Some of this other stuff is my opinion and not fact; but if all these things are planned to some extent then I&#39;d say I&#39;ve heard and thought so myself; that the dollar has about two years.</p>

<p>The only thing you can do is listen to what they have to say and how they feel. Then and only then should you share your opinion and thoughts. If you believe something they say is factually wrong you can offer to provide evidence of these claims.</p>

<p>This should only contain factual information and not biased or opinion. That way they can see your not pushing an agenda and allowing them to draw their own conclusions. </p>

<p>Most people just want to feel wanted and that their opinion and existence matters. The reason they usually end up in hate groups, cults or gangs is because &quot;normal&quot; society let them down. </p>

<p>They felt they rejected by society and sought out other&#39;s who felt the same way. If we were more caring and less judge mental and hypocritical in the first place we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess.</p>

<p>Although I think that&#39;s by design. As long as we are divided by race, religion, politics, class etc. we will have someone to blame instead of focusing on the real problem which is those in power. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a military, president, congress, dictators, CIA, NSA, FBI, police etc when everyone gets along. Their entire existence is due to unrest and us hating one another. That&#39;s the one truth they don&#39;t want getting out.</p>

<p>---Just want to add a disclaimer this is all my crazy opinion and possible projection. I&#39;m sleep deprived and this sounds crazy now that I&#39;ve read it aloud but I&#39;m posting anyways.</p>

<p>In most cases, yes. Not so when existential threats are thrown. A number of Trump&#39;s claims can be seen as existential threats, especially his total ignorance of the Judiciary Branch. On the other hand, if something is regarded as existential threat, no evidence or reason can ever change one&#39;s idea. It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s morally right if the situation is life or death.</p>

<p>Sometimes you don&#39;t have time to offer evidence to persuade, such as the case of the #MuslimBan exec order, or the final FBI letter from Comey.</p>

<p>Sometimes you are not in the environment appropriate for an engaging debate. Such as a forum like reddit.</p>

<p>The division of people is by nature. Politics always arises from human nature. We all tend to guarantee our own survival at the cost of others, and define &quot;others&quot; whatever if necessary. The subject of politics is to harness this nature, with various methods, to the benefit of different groups of people (at the cost of others), or the populace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7v_Hsd2KmY">CNN&#39;s Don Lemon gave us a decent definition of &quot;fake news.&quot;</a> He says fake news is when you intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong. He then later said &quot;I don&#39;t know of anyone who has put out a story in the mainstream media to intentionally deceive.&quot; </p>

<p>This link has two separate examples, one from 1992 and a relatively recent example. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvBQDHqdCck">In 1992, NBC fabricated a news story entitled &quot;Waiting to Explode,&quot; claiming that a line of trucks produced by General Motors can explode on impact. They ensured that a fire would occur by using a planted incendiary device to cause the fire, used the wrong gas cap, and overfilled the tank. Video also includes recent example of MSNBC caught cropping video to make black guy with a gun appear white, then fabricates a whole narrative about white people possibly shooting the president. [4:33]</a> </p>

<p>The first example is obviously fake news. In the second example, it is very difficult to imagine the video cropping to be accidental. This is something I would expect from a fake news website, using things like pictures from one country and spinning a story about a large number of protesters in another country.</p>

<p>Example from MSNBC:  <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/09/a-clinton-fan-manufactured-fake-news-that-msnbc-personalities-spread-to-discredit-wikileaks-docs/">A Clinton Fan Manufactured Fake News That MSNBC Personalities Spread to Discredit WikiLeaks Docs</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s one from CNN: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/16/cnn-edits-out-milwaukee-victims-sister-sherelle-sm/">CNN edits out Milwaukee victim’s sister calling for violence in ‘the suburbs’ making it seem that she advocated for the opposite of what she actually called for.</a> (2016)</p>

<p>In this story, CNN focused on the first half of the quote and wrote a story that was the exact opposite of reality. I would also call this fake news. It&#39;s pretty obvious that the reporter knew the full quote, but decided to downplay the real story.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another example. Here, I suppose Washington Post can get away with claiming it was an accident, but this story is so fake that it&#39;s worth mentioning. They use a tiny piece of information, then make wild and paranoid assumptions in an apparent attempt to scare the public. As The Intercept reports- <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/">Russia Hysteria Infects WashPost Again: False Story About Hacking U.S. Electric Grid</a> (2016). A small part of the story is correct, but much of the article is simply false. Keep in mind that many fake news articles published by fake news websites are based on a small truth that is surrounded by assumptions and lies. </p>

<p>There is also a difference between &quot;fake news&quot; and a &quot;fake news website.&quot; Mainstream media outlets are not &quot;fake news outlets,&quot; but they have published fabricated stories. The main difference between a mainstream media outlet and a &quot;fake news&quot; outlet is the <em>frequency</em> of fake news. If they post fabricated stories half the time (or all the time), then they are considered to be fake news. If they publish 5% intentionally misleading stories, 35% true stories, and 60% mildly biased stories, then they are considered to be a regular media outlet. As you indicated, mainstream media reaches far more people and has a reputation of being reliable. These fake news websites can be outed and their stories debunked within hours. That makes mainstream media more dangerous because they can spread half truths, lies, and omit information when it really counts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don Lemon is such a tool. He didn&#39;t even let the guy finish and walked off as if the guys committed a thought crime by stating the wrong opinion on CNN.  Its such a shame this is what passes as news in this country. News is supposed to be unbiased and report the story, not become the story. Also, didn&#39;t CNN popularize the fake news agenda and now they are the only ones allowed to say it??
The whole run up to the Iraq War was fake news. Judith Miller and all. That shit set us back forever.</p>

<p>Talking about Trump&#39;s travel costs in comparison to other presidents is not fake news. Call it yellow press stories or something, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask to keep the term fake news for news that are actually fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then again here they are exaggerating these costs and not providing any context to Obama&#39;s rather expensive costs including private parties and paying Beyonce to perform over Tuesday night dinner.  Is Trump&#39;s security expenses for his family really more than the Obama family?  How can we say for sure this soon?</p>

<p>And ignoring actually important news happening like say the dam in California. Or the million other more important things than a fiscal expose 1 month in just because they couldn&#39;t find any more dirt that morning.  The guy maybe had a point... which is why Lemon wouldn&#39;t allow him to make it.</p>

<p>I agree with this. However, most news does try to deceive. To make it seem worse than it is, take things out of context ect. I think people should be aware of this and question everything. Do your own research. This isn&#39;t just CNN either, but FOX, Breitbart, every MSM, news organization, media outlet, ect. </p>

<p>But they mix it with lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;ve gathered watching Alex. He&#39;s an eccentric person that is a narcissist but doesn&#39;t like that about himself so he constantly trys to come off like he isn&#39;t but even narcissist can do good if they&#39;re not trying to look like a narcissist. Or he&#39;s is fully just wanting his ego stroked and his empire satisfies this. Hard to tell when you don&#39;t see how people act alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright here is my issue with the &quot;Trump and Hillary are friends&quot; thing; </p>

<p>So think about any sort of competition from high school elections to being chosen first in gym or any sport in general to getting a promotion over your coworker who&#39;s your work/friend. Do you not fight tooth and nail to win? Yes. Do you actually <em>hate</em> your opponent? No unless you&#39;re taking it wayyyy too seriously. 
The world of Politics doesn&#39;t seem to be that different. These people have all be involved in this shitshow for years and while they may have <em>wildly</em> different opinions and will say anything to discredit their opponent, yea at the end of the day they&#39;re going to have to deal with each other and wtf would you expect them to do? 
Trump and Hillary not clawing each other&#39;s eyes out every time they see each other and getting together socially to help their image isn&#39;t all that insane. They&#39;re grownass-adults and are handling it the way they should be, doesn&#39;t mean they agree and they may end up killing each other somehow lol, but it&#39;s not guna happen at a press event or something. </p>

<p>Candidates say all sorts of things during campaigns and they can be very extreme, that&#39;s a tactic. If politicians couldn&#39;t get along in public they wouldn&#39;t get anywhere because that would mean they&#39;re honest, come on now. </p>

<p>Yes you should question why pizzagate supporter is important to the reporter along with the phrase assault rifle. These are used to push their narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t mean that every piece of information that they report is false, though. The point is, don&#39;t take anything at face value. If you want to actually know what&#39;s going on, then you must verify, verify, and re-verify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with that though, is the majority of people do not have the time to sit here and research every single thing that comes out. So it comes down to, not believing any of it, or believing all of it and being very misinformed. </p>

<p>It scares me how many people in this thread are basically saying &quot;well it&#39;s just an opinion piece&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s okay that they are biased&quot;. Forgetting that these MSM stories, that are taken out of context, lies, or adding biased, have ruined communities, normal people, started riots, made people scared, ect. I don&#39;t think imo this is something we should just let go on. I honestly think there needs to be better laws to hold the media accountable. I&#39;m 100% for freedom of the press, but there needs to be some easier form of accountability. </p>

<p>And before you say they can take them to court or something, majority of people don&#39;t have the time or the money to do that, against billion dollar companies. Hell, even Hulk Hogan was having issues doing so against Gawker, and luckily Peter Thiel helped him. So imagine a normal person taking let&#39;s say NYT or WaPo to court. </p>

<p>I really believe it comes down to making the laws easier for normal people to hold the media accountable for lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I am all for the FCC reinstating the Fairness Doctrine (or something akin to it in the cable/internet era) and/or adopting further measures intended to break up media monopolies, you being properly informed is nobody&#39;s responsibility but your own.</p>

<p>Any media outlet is currently allowed to give any information that they so choose. The Fairness Doctrine would require them to present a dissenting opinion of the story, and yes... we need that back. </p>

<p>Opinion pieces and bias <em>are</em> ok. That&#39;s freedom of speech. From Rush Limbaugh to Rachel Maddow, Tomi Lahren to John Oliver, Bill O&#39;Riley to Cenk Uygur, Sean Hannity to Anderson Cooper, all of these &quot;news&quot; outlets are based on opinionated commentary surrounding factual information. All of these outlets sometimes get their &quot;facts&quot; wrong, ignore other facts, etc. It&#39;s on you to be aware of that.</p>

<p>If a media outlet has proven to consistently deliver inaccurate facts, then simply stop getting information from that media outlet. That&#39;s on you, too. You don&#39;t take them to court for misinforming you, because they are not legally required to properly inform you. </p>

<p>So you hit &#39;em where it hurts... stop giving them your eyeballs to sell to advertisers. Stop watching/reading/consuming. Take it one step further and write a mass email to all the companies that advertise with them letting them know that you&#39;re not watching anymore. Take it one step further, boycott and protest against them in the same ways you boycott and protest the government.</p>

<p>Enacting laws to &quot;hold the media accountable for lying&quot; means that the government would dictate what is true and what is false. They&#39;re already doing this, to some degree ( <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5181/all-info">H.R. 5181</a>, or the <em>Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016</em>, or as I call it, the <em>Establishment of the Ministry of Truth</em>... thanks, Obama). This flies in the face of the First Amendment, so we must be very cautious and vigilant to uphold the sanctity of free speech, and a free and independent press, for without them our democracy is done.</p>

<p>Even if you trust Trump and Co, and especially if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s a dangerous precedent to set.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - There&#39;s a fine line between legally enforcing journalistic integrity and infringing upon the rights to free speech and a free press. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They all have at one point. So like I said before, it&#39;s impossible to inform yourself on every piece they release because there&#39;s just no way to check all the facts. No matter who you are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t take them to court for misinforming you, because they are not legally required to properly inform you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s my point, we should be allowed to do so. They get paid, from views, companies, politicians ect. If a company lies to us, we can take them to court for misinforming us on their product, we should be allowed to do the same to the media. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take it one step further, boycott and protest against them in the same ways you boycott and protest the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I want to take it further. Regardless there is still a lot of people that are going to watch this shit. It hurts lives. It hurts people. It&#39;s becoming disgusting at a level I don&#39;t even know why anyone doesn&#39;t want new laws. There should be better laws that allow normal people to hold the media accountable for their bullshit. I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with that. We have laws that hold companies accountable. The MSM are companies if they get paid. They are just selling information, and sometimes that information is false, which is a big problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>means that the government would dictate what is true and what is false</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I think that if there is opinions it should be said they are opinions. Or &quot;Facts&quot; should just be correct. There is no the &quot;Government can decide&quot; with facts. It&#39;s either true or not. For opinions or added opinions in stories that should just be unbiased facts I think they should have to make it clear that it&#39;s an opinion piece. Like I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so bad, and I&#39;m willing to listen to you.. why we can&#39;t have the media put &quot;This is an opinion piece&quot; on the title, if it has anything other then facts. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying they should be arrested for messing up. I&#39;m just saying that it should be easier for people to take them to court for outright lying. If the government for example claims they are lying, they would still have to take them to court and prove they are lying. I&#39;m just saying that process should be easier for normal people to do, and they should be allowed to do it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This flies in the face of the First Amendment, so we must be very cautious and vigilant to uphold the sanctity of free speech, and a free and independent press, for without them our democracy is done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then make it so they can&#39;t be paid by big companies, politicians, us ect. Companies can&#39;t out right lie to consumers like this. Sure they can make the food or item look bigger and prettier, but they have to say &quot;size doesn&#39;t represent the image&quot; </p>

<p>Like my whole point is not saying that they should be told what to say. I think if they want to make opinion pieces they should still be allowed to do so, but it needs to say that in the article, if any opinion is put in the article it should say so. If they lie then it should be easier for people to take them to court. They are basically a company now. They get paid from us. We pay for cable, they get money from views, they get money from companies, politicians, ect. So they should be held accountable for lying to us. </p>

<p>So honestly, I think either they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take money from politicians, big corporations, ect.. like we would expect from politicians and push for new laws, or new laws need to be brought up to make it easier for normal people to hold them accountable. I really don&#39;t see the problem with this. Especially since it&#39;s IMPOSSIBLE for anyone at all to sort through all the articles the MSM puts out now, and they do hurt people, communities, and average people badly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that opinion pieces should be required to blatantly state that this is what they are, and I would opt for a big bold banner across the screen indicating as such. We already do it in &quot;print&quot; journalism by announcing it&#39;s an Op Ed, but we could even be stricter on requiring that. </p>

<p>However, here&#39;s the thing... other than receiving facts in bullet-point style with no conclusions drawn, nor any personal context, you&#39;d almost always have an &quot;opinion&quot; label on the media. &quot;The media&quot; is someone else drawing conclusions about what facts are important and reliable enough for you to know, and what conclusions those facts might lead us to.</p>

<p>As far as the first amendment issue, and the &quot;government can&#39;t decide with facts&quot; thing... consider the Climate Change debate. As we stand right now, if given the people&#39;s trust to dictate what is and is not considered &quot;truth&quot;, half of our government would disavow any research that shows humanity&#39;s effect on the climate, and the other half would disavow any research that shows the other causes of climate change. We&#39;re too polarized (and so overwhelmingly unaware of our own confirmation bias) to allow anyone to dictate which facts are &quot;truth&quot;. Allowing a government to dictate what should be considered the &quot;truth&quot; does not necessarily mean that you will receive <em>all</em> the facts. GMOs, foreign affairs, military actions, etc. The facts we received might be accurate, but the ones that they wanted to keep hidden from us would be deemed &quot;untrue&quot;, and they would not be allowed to be reported on. The bias would only slide from the corporate owned media to the corporate owned government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then make it so they can&#39;t be paid by big companies, politicians, us ect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that&#39;s something you can do. You&#39;re the product that the media is selling to the big companies and politicians. The fact that you are watching is why they get paid. Stop watching and they can&#39;t be paid. Stop paying for cable tv and put your monthly bill into a donation fund that you spread across the viewer supported media outlets that you trust. Support those that do investigative journalism instead of those that just report on &quot;the news&quot; and regurgitate &quot;the message&quot; that we&#39;re all supposed to follow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>new laws need to be brought up to make it easier for normal people to hold them accountable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The laws are there, and you can sue a media outlet for any suffering they may cause. Legal fees would be astronomical to do so effectively, but that&#39;s an entirely different discussion about the legal system.</p>

<p>What we shouldn&#39;t do is infringe upon freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in a vast, sweeping blanket of regulations on what the media can and can not say. What we should do is bring back the Fairness Doctrine, break up the conglomerates, require disclaimers for opinion pieces, and look into passing laws that simplify the avenues/reduce the cost for citizens to hold these media companies (and any other corporation) accountable for any suffering they may cause. </p>

<p>This right here is what I mean. When Hulk Hogan sued Gawker, he needed the help of a billionaire to do so. So how is a normal person supposed to go about suing a place that literally ruined their life, community, or just straight up lied to them? </p>

<p>This is what I mean, I mean I don&#39;t know how really, and I want to read more into it to learn.. but there has to be a way to make it easier for the normal every day person to go about suing places that completely lie about them or their community, or take things out of context and hurting them. </p>

<p>I agree with this and understand. I just think there is more that can be done, that maybe people haven&#39;t thought of yet, and I don&#39;t see the harm in trying to find out. I&#39;m just sick of it, and I&#39;ve been making a huge file of blatant lies all the media have made. I&#39;m working on making a blog about it and before that posting them all here. It&#39;s honestly just made me sick how they can deceive so easily, and that they are allowed to do it with no repercussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, something needs to be done. But I think the point I&#39;m trying to emphasize is that any legislative actions are going to have to fall within the construct of the first amendment. Again, that&#39;s a thin line, and crossing it has a lot of negative consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>All journalism is biased and that is not the same as fake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is, when they produce fake stories to push their biased agenda. Which is often the case. All MSM have been guilty have producing straight up lies too. I can link a folders from Fox, CNN, NYT, ect. This isn&#39;t nothing new and has been going on for decades.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think every news story should be researched and questioned. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s all fake, made up, or even lies, but I say the majority of them, take things out of context, edit stuff to look one way, lie, will add in their agenda talking points to actual stories to push one side to be more believed, take truths and add lies to push their agenda, straight up fabricate stories, will use bad sources just to push stories, will go after people just for a headline, will use clickbait titles that are just lies which is all most people read, companies paying for good stories or bad stories on their competitors, politicians paying for good stories or bad stories on others ect. </p>

<p>This has been going on for decades and decades, however it has become a lot worse. MSM, journalism, has really just become one big polluted system. We ask that lobbyists be taken out of politics and want to push for laws, and I think we should do the same for media. I&#39;m for Freedom of Press, but I think opinion pieces or anything with opinions in it should be marked as such. I think any real story should produce facts and nothing else. I think most people agree with me too. I just think there should be some accountability. </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s all well when its a celebrity or a politician that&#39;s on the bad end of the stick, but what happens when media stories start wars (like the incubator fake story), hurt communities, start riots, hurt normal people ect? At some point we need to say enough is enough and push for laws where Freedom of Press is still there, but at the same time people are able to hold them accountable easier for their wrong doings. </p>

<p>If you are a giant radio host, and constantly leak (or talk about semi-unknown) conspiracies, or plans for such conspiracies, and millions of people listen to you, don&#39;t you think the very people who you&#39;re constantly exposing might <strong>alter their fucking plans</strong> sometimes?</p>

<p>Fake news is a term applied to a story (or a group) that intentionally makes up stories in order to deceive. An example would be </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump is the founder of NAMBLA&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;Fake news&#39; is NOT an actual news story with a ideological slant on it. </p>

<p>Don Lemon however has zero say on what news he is told to cast. He just casts the news with whatever information his boss wants. Don Lemon just wants to get paid and keep getting paid his millions of dollars a year salary.</p>

<p>Alex is a different beast for sure he technically is his own boss so he is making executive decisions on his content so he is accountable.</p>

<p>I also think whitewashing everything as &quot; Not to be believed &quot; is not intellectually sound thinking. The real conspiracy users actually gather ALL sources of information ranging from FOX to CNN to Whistleblower accounts to rumors and even 4Chan and makes his own mind up from experience of their time here.</p>

<p>Please dont make &quot; real r/conspiracy users &quot; be a tagline that catches on because its elitist bullshit and rather demeaning to the rest of us who have lurked here for a long time.</p>
