<p>True, God&#39;s mysteries aren&#39;t worthless. It&#39;s God speaking there in that quote. He&#39;s speaking to the treasonous angels who taught humankind the very esoteric (and technological) knowledge which the elite learn and use. He condemns those things they have taught humanity as &quot;worthless mysteries&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alien gods of ancient times are real and Lucifer is the real god, whereas Jahovah is the real devil. Morals and Dogma, Nazi philosophy and Madam Blavinski (sp?) all push this agenda. I believe it is a lie, twisting the truth and morally condemning those who believe and follow it by making them do reprehensible things. The gods of old are fallen angels according to the Bible which has much more to say about conspiracies than a lot of people realize. Hypocritical Christians don&#39;t help the rest of the people see the truth easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite, but you are not far off. Yahweh is the evil god, but Lucifer is just another fallen angel (probably Ra or Osiris). Yahweh was probably Zeus/Jupiter (YHWH/JHVE became Jove; Yoh-Weh to Jo-veh) or Thuth (The &quot;H&#39;s&quot; in the proto-Hebraic YHWH went through a consonantal drift; it would have been pronounced I-thooth). Jesus is not the son of Yahweh though, he is the son of El, who is the one true god above all gods. Jesus is also known as Jizo of Buddhist mythology, the final boddhisatva. They are one in the same. All of our sacred texts connect with one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the Earth IS flat and the Mystery Schools have devised systems of science and media and education to indoctrinate us to false truths so that we never find out what&#39;s really going on?  Insofar as much that we actively socially ostracize anyone with non-conformist beliefs ?  The goal of course is maintaining power over the masses via hidden mind control.  I&#39;d assert that if there are truly any hidden secret knowledge, our very location in the cosmos would be the greatest secret of them all.  With that in mind, have you noticed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/science/trappist-1-exoplanets-nasa.html">NASA and The New York Times have teamed up to &quot;educate&quot; us about discovering new planets</a>?

<p>For one example the giant storm on its surface. We see it move around the planet then come out on the other side. Im not sure how that would work if it were flat like a coin. Same deal with moons, we see them move behind the planet then at the exact same speed come into view on the other side. </p>

<p>Also if you believe that all planets are flat and that only the perfectly flat side faces us then there are some very severe issues with how that universe works. All planets would have to present their flat side to Earth at all times. Its like saying the Earth is the center of the universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of which, and to further elaborate on OP&#39;s inquiry, a general (however incomplete) overview of the grades within the A∴A∴:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Initiatory structure</p>

<p>The initiatory structure of A∴A∴ is based on the Qabalistic Tree Of Life, its grades following the sephira up the tree in reverse order. The A∴A∴ is sub-divided into three orders: The S.S., being the governing body (Third Order) and comprising those grades that are above the Abyss; The R.R. et A.C. (Second Order), comprising those degrees that are below the Abyss but above the Veil of Paroketh; and The Golden Dawn (First Order), comprising the grades below the Veil of Paroketh. A complete description of the tasks of the First Order is given in Liber XIII vel Graduum Montis Abiegni: a syllabus of the steps upon path, in The Equinox Volume 1.</p>

<p>Two additional &quot;grades&quot;, the Dwellers on the Thresholds, link the orders: Dominis Limnis in Paroketh, and Babe of the Abyss in the Abyss.</p>

<p>Members of the Third Order can generate their own variations of the First and Second Order teachings as reflections of their own Understanding, contemplating systems of attainment not compassed in the curriculum of the main system.</p>

<p>Student</p>

<p>A student&#39;s business is to acquire a general intellectual knowledge of all systems of attainment, as declared in the prescribed books. At the end of a fixed period, the Student takes a written examination to test his reading, after which he passes through a small ritual involving the reading of the History Lection (Liber LXI), and passes to the grade of Probationer.</p>

<p>The Order of the G∴D∴ (Golden Dawn)</p>

<p>Probationer</p>

<p>(0°=0□): The Probationer&#39;s principal business is to begin such practices as he or she may prefer, and to write a careful record of the same for one year.</p>

<p>Neophyte</p>

<p>(1°=10□): Has to acquire perfect control of the astral plane.</p>

<p>Zelator</p>

<p>(2°=9□): The Zelator&#39;s main work is to achieve complete success in asana and pranayama. The Zelator also begins to study the formula of the Rosy Cross.</p>

<p>Practicus</p>

<p>(3°=8□): Is expected to complete the intellectual training, and in particular to study Qabalah.</p>

<p>Philosophus</p>

<p>(4°=7□): Is expected to complete the moral training. Is tested in Devotion to the Order.</p>

<p>Dominus Liminis</p>

<p>(The Link): Is expected to show mastery of pratyahara and dharana.</p>

<p>The Order of the R∴C∴ (Rosy Cross)</p>

<p>Adeptus Minor (Without)</p>

<p>(5°=6□): Lesser Adept (Without). Is expected to perform the Great Work and to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>

<p>Adeptus Minor (Within)</p>

<p>(5°=6□): Lesser Adept (Within). Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Adeptus Major</p>

<p>(6°=5□): Greater Adept. Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick, though without comprehension.</p>

<p>Adeptus Exemptus</p>

<p>(7°=4□): Exempt Adept. Completes in perfection all these matters. He then either (a) becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or, (b) is stripped of all his attainments and of himself as well, even of his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of the Abyss, who, having transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother. It then finds itself a Master of the Temple.</p>

<p>The Order of the S∴S∴ (Silver Star)</p>

<p>Magister Templi</p>

<p>or Master of the Temple (8°=3□): The principal business of this grade is to obtain a perfect understanding of the Universe. The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that personality which limits and oppresses his true self. The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that is, his Understanding is entirely free from internal contradiction or external obscurity; his Word is to comprehend the existing Universe in accordance with his own Mind. This grade corresponds to Binah on the Tree of Life, and to the Secret Chiefs in the old Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Crowley also linked it with the experience he called &quot;Shivadarshana&quot; and with the Four Formless States of Buddhism, although he cautions against treating these criteria as sufficient for the grade.</p>

<p>Magus</p>

<p>(9°=2□): The Magus seeks to attain Wisdom, declares his law, and is a Master of all Magick in its greatest and highest sense. His will is entirely free from internal diversion or external opposition; His work is to create a new Universe in accordance with his Will. This grade corresponds to Chokmah on the Tree of Life. It also bears some resemblance to Nietzsche&#39;s &quot;new philosopher&quot; who creates values, although with more focus on self-transcendence according to Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin.</p>

<p>Ipsissimus</p>

<p>(10°=1□): Beyond the comprehension of the lower degrees. An Ipsissimus is free from limitations and necessity and lives in perfect balance with the manifest universe. Essentially, the highest mode of attainment. This grade corresponds to Kether on the Tree of Life. Ipsissimus is quite hard to translate directly from Latin to English, but it is essentially the superlative of &quot;self&quot;, translating rather approximately to &quot;His most Selfness,&quot; or &quot;self-est.&quot; (c.f. generalissimo for the same superlative form in use for a grade from same Latin root.)</p>

<p>Crowley named as a condition of this grade the trance Nirodha-samapatti, which reduces heartbeat and other life functions to the bare minimum. Theravada Buddhist monks traditionally attain nirodha-samapatti by producing the aforementioned Formless States one after the other, and perceiving in each what they call the Three Characteristics of all existence: sorrow or tendency towards sorrow, change or unreliability, and insubstantiality or lack of self. Crowley and the A∴A∴ however seek to replace this threefold view with the quest for balance as both a motive for discipline and the means of achieving their end goal. In Liber B vel Magi they urge the Magus seeking further progress to identify the Buddhist Three Characteristics with the opposite states. &quot;Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness is Self.&quot; Crowley&#39;s version of nirodha includes &quot;seeing first the truth and then the falsity of the Three Characteristics&quot; according to his published theory.</p>

<p>The Ipsissimus should keep the achievement of this final grade secret, even from the rest of the Order, and continue with the work of the Magus while expressing the nature of an Ipsissimus in word and deed.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that Azazel and Shemhazai were said to be the leaders of the 200 fallen, and Uzza and Shemhazai were tutelary guardian angels of Egypt with both Shemhazai and Azazel and were responsible for teaching the secrets of heaven as well. The other angels dispersed to &quot;every corner of the Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Here there is the idea that God&#39;s heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil – i.e., it is &quot;shared with Azazel&quot; (Abr. 20:5), again identifying him with Satan, who was called &quot;the prince of this world&quot; by Jesus. (John 12:31 niv)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure of the excat secrets, but this gives some insight to where this comes from.

<p>Sometimes all one can do, is point to that which we are not aware of. This is the sole job of a teacher, is it not?</p>

<p>We have nothing to learn that we do not already know. Teachers help us to realize the truth that already is- the peice pf the puzzle we are missing; the information we need to make a choice...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is that all things are happening at once. We are simply conciousness aware of itself and experiencing what we want to experience. We have individual identity, but we are also all connected having a shared experience. The closer we get to our true identity, the higher vibrational rate we exist at. Right now we are at a low frequency and must deal with duality, but as we all come to love and accept each other our vibration raises. Nobody can give us this power. We have to take control of our own conciousness and realize we have the power already within us. As long as we keep looking for others to save us then we give away this power. That&#39;s what the Illuminati know, so they keep us at war with each other so we never claim our own power.</p>

<p>There are other mysteries that are held by elites that are just about what is going on with the Earth. The elites work with unscrupulous ETs to control us. So the ETs share secret knowledge to make these elite fools feel superior to the peasants. That way they can be tricked into selling out their own species. The fools are controlled by nested secretive hierarchies where each level is told it is the special one, better than the fools below it and given secret knowledge. They are all fools, putting the shackles on their racial family before the shackles are placed on them. It&#39;s astonishing how much they can trust such off world beings that teach them betrayal is a virtue. </p>

</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The secret of Masonry, like the secret of life, can be known only by those who seek it, serve it, live it. It cannot be uttered; it can only be felt and acted. It is, in fact, an open secret, and each man knows it according to his quest and capacity. Like all things worth knowing, no one can know it for another and no man can know it alone.</p>
