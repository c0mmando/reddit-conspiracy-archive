        History has shown that there has been a history of pedophilia ring cover ups,

       My question is, what is the theory as to why all of these powerful people are at least accused of this ritualistic, satanic, pedophilia?

       Why do we see some good men/women change suddenly when they get immense wealth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I want simplest explanation, I'd say human greed. The thirst for power and money and feeling of being above the law and living as gods. They might very well be taught from early age to be greedy, immoral, unethical?

       Yeah I believe that the archons are real. No one really knows for sure what they are. Some believe they are reptilian. Some believe they are half reptilian half something else that I can't remember, annunaki maybe? And now I'm currently reading a book that hypothesizes that the archons are the gods of olympus. Interesting stuff.

       First poster/top reply pretty much covers it. Though, it would be really awesome to find out these sick fuckers aren't human (to some extent, they aren't) and are actually ETs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't figured out quite exactly what the deal is with the adrenochrome. Surely there is more to it than just a high?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the name of the game is just power (and they are completely obsessed with it) and the idea to become immortal while the rest of us are just seen as expendables. This would explain why they are so obsessed with tracking and herding us like cattle (or attempting to), pushing trans-humanism with machines, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it may not be prevalent to public, I think science has made some pretty big strides in terms of prolonging life with organs from harvesting and such. Along the way though, since people and youth are just cattle to them, some of them are twisted enough to also engage in rape, sex and cannibalism - among other things - with victims during the entire process.
      </p>
      <p>
       War, human trafficking, organ harvesting, the sex trade and bio-warfare are huge business.

       Because if you're rich to can't get away with that but if you're rich AND powerful you can. Maybe it's a way for the rich to flex on each other by saying if we can do this, what makes you think we wouldn't get away with doing that!

       I think it has to do with a good amount of those in power are fucked in the head. They are unable to feel anything so they can only get off in this way.

       Real answer: Same old business, new resource.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia in general aside, as that's a course in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rings stuff is used for many reasons. Blackmail and brownstone ops are a big one. You get your targets drunk, go to a party, and tape em, since the parties are always at these special locations run by the epsteins of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have actual clients, like the saudi's, but you can blackmail em too since the rest of the world doesnt think like them. And of course your run of the mill podesta's and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the grooming aspect. You can use a kid and essentially raise them to be procurors of kids, or operatives if they get the good old mk uktra for the multiple personalities. They can spy, kill, sabotage, and cant confess if they cant remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally the organ harvesting. Kids are a fucking goldmine. From marrow and stem cells to young blood and healthy organs. You can live for ever and make bank off them. Idk what started first, the satanic sacrifices and blood drinking/etc or the harvesting and the cult shit is a cover/delivery agency. We know cults were used to collect kids, as well as run drugs to an extent. But idk if young blood and its great effects on health were always a part of that.

      <p>
       So essentially, there are clients for kid rape and murder and torture. But the kids are also a goldmine financially.

       And blackmail is way more powerful than an affair or a gay fling or w.e. else we've used for decades prior. Plus you cant just get naked in a coffin and jerk off telling your sex secrets for initiation to the elite clubs. You fuck a kid and youre in, cause that bond is fucking strong. Cant be falling out of line with that dirt.

       Oh and people in power are often narcissistic  psychopaths and preying and dominating and abusing is their pornhub.

       The answer is because they will never get any form of sexual gratification; they ultimately end up pursuing alternative avenues of pleasure. This leads to many of them being hard working and determined in pursuing their non-sexual desires, in order to achieve some form of self satisfaction. Some of these people make it all the way to the top.
