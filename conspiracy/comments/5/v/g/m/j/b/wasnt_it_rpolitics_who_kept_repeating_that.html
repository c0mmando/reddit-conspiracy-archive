    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  R/politics became a wall of the narrative that Bernie had no chance, Trump was Hitler and should be feared without question. and no matter what Hillary did she was our only choice and inevitable president.  There was a lot of interest in Bernie but after all the corruption of the DNC and Bernie jumping on the band wagon I gave up on that section of reddit.  It was garbage and the mods had a narrow definition of acceptable sources for submissions, which choked out some of the discussion.  I found this sub to be much more engaging, rational (surprise), and open to debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am open to hearing what Trump is doing wrong.  I know he was friends with Epstein, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that he was pulling strings to get him a lighter sentence, like the Clinton&#39;s did for Silsby.  Shills generally have the same talking points.  I don&#39;t believe I have directly called anyone a shill, it doesn&#39;t really further the discussion, but there is no denying that shills brigade reddit and social media.  David Brock and George Soros run businesses dedicated to this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only bet twice in my life - I put money on Brexit and on Trump for President. So that worked out.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary basically had no real supporters. She was going to be the lesser of two evils candidates. And the media was going to portray Trump as literally the next Hitler, throw in some racism, sexism, homophobia, rapist, Russian spy, you name it, they threw it at him. But they failed because people are turning off the shite known as MSM and were instead getting their news from the internet, including alternative news sites. It feels like now they are stepping up the propaganda and are flooding online news/social media sites with again anti trump rhetoric to try and basically topple the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situation with r/politics is very instructional and should be understood by every sub on Reddit.  When you create an echo chamber it&#39;s impossible to get an accurate read on what reality is. The r/pol crowd not only deluded themselves they created a conversational vacuum that effectively destroyed any chance they had of actually being effective. The Donald sub is entering the same dangerous territory. If you refuse to tolerate dissent you effectively eliminate any pushback and become the very thing you are trying to avoid--delusional. It is a Fascinating dynamic. I just hope the conspiracy subs don&#39;t get ruined by the same shit. </p>
