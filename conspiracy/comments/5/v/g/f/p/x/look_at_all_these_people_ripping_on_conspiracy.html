       Alex Jones, some love him some hate him, great. There are multiple issues going on I think that isn't just AJ. He is being used as a catalyst for propaganda against the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       They shit on 9/11 and other conspiracies. Belittle the conspiracy community, and look at the comments that have gold. Why the fuck do these comments have gold? As we all know r/politics is a completely engineered subreddit. The posters there are either CTR/Shareblue and the like (propaganda agents/bots in general), or people who have succumb to TPTB.

       this is it.  you are witnessing the total take over and psyop.  its subtle but you can feel it.  fake threads, faked top comments, all bandwagon posts rally everyone around the idea that we all just agree with whatever the top comment is, and it must be considered the popular view.

       Mate, in what reality does r/propaganda have any shred of credibility left. It has been stripped of any substance as soon as the take over occured. Even with the CTR/shareblue take over, they still havent done shit. They failed to get that cunt into the whitehouse and they are failing to dismantle trump. Dont give into the artificial division. Its not working no matter how much money they throw in.

       Pedophile Brock and his sick minions haven't done shit. They lost the election, they've not been able to stop people from talking about pedophilia, all they can do is keep throwing more and more money against the truth and they're STILL losing the public debate.

       The Truth continues to percolate. The Bad Guys are getting louder because they're getting more desperate. But the more you squeeze water, the faster it passes though their hands.

       I agree and IMO I think that's where the Milo situation came in. I could be wrong but we all know 1 thing. It was a set up. They can't hush the PGATE issue so they are twisting it to fit their narrative.
