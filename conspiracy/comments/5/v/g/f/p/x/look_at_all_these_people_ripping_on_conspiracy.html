<p>Does this not fit the bill PERFECTLY with the top post in r/conspiracy right now? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5vbgrf/til_in_1967_the_cia_created_the_label_conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5vbgrf/til_in_1967_the_cia_created_the_label_conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>Alex Jones, some love him some hate him, great. There are multiple issues going on I think that isn&#39;t just AJ. He is being used as a catalyst for propaganda against the conspiracy community.  </p>

<p>They shit on 9/11 and other conspiracies. Belittle the conspiracy community, and look at the comments that have gold. Why the fuck do these comments have gold? As we all know r/politics is a completely engineered subreddit. The posters there are either CTR/Shareblue and the like (propaganda agents/bots in general), or people who have succumb to TPTB. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mate, in what reality does r/propaganda have any shred of credibility left. It has been stripped of any substance as soon as the take over occured. Even with the CTR/shareblue take over, they still havent done shit. They failed to get that cunt into the whitehouse and they are failing to dismantle trump. Dont give into the artificial division. Its not working no matter how much money they throw in.</p>

<p>The Truth continues to percolate. The Bad Guys are getting louder because they&#39;re getting more desperate. But the more you squeeze water, the faster it passes though their hands. </p>

<p>Keep pressing. Keep pressing. Don&#39;t give up. Don&#39;t even think about giving up. These fuckers are guilty as sin and their sins are roaring up behind them. Fast. </p>
