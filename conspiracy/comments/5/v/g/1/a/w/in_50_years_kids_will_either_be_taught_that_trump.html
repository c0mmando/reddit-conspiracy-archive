<p>Not surprisingly, the AM Litigation Daily described the Katie Johnson case as 2016&#39;s &quot;Biggest Dud of a Lawsuit.

<p>This outcome was not unexpected as media outlets across the political spectrum, including Jezebel <a href="http://archive.is/RpRuy">http://archive.is/RpRuy</a> and the Huffington Post <a href="http://archive.is/vWkgm">http://archive.is/vWkgm</a> , repeatedly called Johnson&#39;s civil case nothing more than part of a &quot;smear campaign&quot; towards then-presidential candidate Trump.</p>

I&#39;d be interested in sharing that if it&#39;s credible, because it&#39;s my understanding is that Trump never flew on that jet even though many prominent people like Bill Clinton are known to have done so many, many times.</h1>

<h1>2: I&#39;m sure there are many, MANY straight men out there in the world who would love the opportunity to get away with seeing girls who are under 18 changing, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re sexually attracted to <em>children</em>. What Trump did to them is REALLY FUCKING SHITTY, but it&#39;s not the same thing as pedophilia. Conflating them doesn&#39;t do your cause any service. Call attention to Trump being a scumbag at every opportunity, yeah, but don&#39;t please don&#39;t be deceptive.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>History is written by the winner. If the people backing Trump &quot;win&quot;, it would be reported that he&#39;s stopped massive pedophile rings. There have already been more arrests for human trafficking in the month he&#39;s been in office than there would be in a full year under Obama. This fact is either because of that or it can easily be suggested that it is because of that.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not totally trying to discredit you, but all the arrests that have happened recently, do you really think all of that was set in motion in the last 30 or so days? You really think Trump has anything to do with all that? It likely takes months, if not years to gather all the info needed to bust those things up and you think Trump some how ordered it all to happen in the last 30 days?</p>

<p>One possibility is that its all been in the works and hes just executed the decision for them to act on it (if thats even how it works which I doubt), but lets be honest, Trump is not out there rounding up pedos. The authorities are. The dear leader may think that he IS the ultimate authority in this country, but that is what checks and balances are for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory is that law enforcement has had their hands tied by higher ups. Kind of like how the FBI was stonewalled by the Obama administration with regard to their investigation into Hillary&#39;s illegal email server. With a new administration that actively wants to end human trafficking (and Trump has definitely said this), they&#39;d be able to act on information that they previously were forced to sit on. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure what to think though. I wasn&#39;t even arguing what you think I was, I was just trying to make op&#39;s point that history is written by the victors and that reality has no bearing on what people will be taught decades from now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  Hear a lot, especially since Alex Jones on Rogan, about how Trump is gong to do a bunch of things like nailing high up pedos.  Never heard him talk about it, never heard any  headway being made.<br/>
Can&#39;t keep praising and suggesting Trump has already done something he basically never talks about and hasn&#39;t done anything.  It&#39;s the same with Jones saying Trump will lower taxes for middle-class and lower and keep it the same with the rich(without opening up loopholes).  He doesn&#39;t talk about it and hasn&#39;t done anything to suggest he will.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the way op uses future history (of 50 years from now) as a way of pointing out how &quot;history&quot; is made.</p>

<p>We&#39;re here and we have personal knowledge of the situation right now... what is true and what <em>might</em> be true. But 50 years from now, a whole generation of people will have grown up. The only thing they know about 2017 will be some stuff that got recorded. The things they believe will be the things that were saved in print, TV and maybe online.</p>

<p>We know that some (or most) of the things from these sources can be disinfo, propaganda or outright lies. Now keep that in mind whenever you look at the history of the past.</p>

<p>&quot;History is a set of lies agreed upon.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason I find the evidence of pizzagate to be pretty bogus is that I have pictures from my own friends instagram posited as proof. I know this person, I know the context of most of their stuff, and I know they are not part of a pedophile ring. I know what these people are saying is 100% factually not true, the stuff they are trying to insinuate is kind of hilarious when you know the context. I have that going for me, if people don&#39;t believe that is on them. </p>

<p>I also think some of the evidence and the way it is presented is bogus. For instance there is a lot of talk about &quot;Meeting up for some pizza&quot; for an hour, or in an hour-- I don&#39;t recall. The point is, that while cheese pizza is a code for cp on the internet, everyone is overlooking the fact that pizza is delicious, lots of people like pizza, and pizza is a meal and people meet up for meals. </p>

<p>Pedophile rings are real. This one seems to be, less so. </p>
