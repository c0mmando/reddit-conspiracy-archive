I saw today many others feel the same way. I even found a webpage around that Mandela Effect. I was in kindergarten in the early 80&#39;s, that&#39;s when I recall that number being instilled in my mind. Was Puerto Rico being considered then?</p>

It&#39;s a Sovereign Nation, and it&#39;s debatable, based on the Treaty of Paris, if the United States of America truly won it&#39;s independence from the Crown.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE ORGANIC ACT of 1871</strong></p>

<p>from Wiki:</p>

<p>“Formally An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia, is an Act of Congress that repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown and established a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia. Though Congress repealed the territorial government in 1874, the legislation was the first to create a single municipal government for the federal district”</p>

<p>The new government consisted of an appointed governor and 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works charged with modernizing the city.[7] The Seal of the District of Columbia features the date 1871, recognizing the year the District’s government was incorporated</p>

<p>….that created the (All Capital Letters) “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” thereby creating a private U.S. corporation which is its own city-state of its own country with its:</p>

<p>Own mayor, police force, constitution, post office pays no taxes and is not beholden to any other country.  Just like the City of London and the Vatican</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in all capitals, represents a fictitious corporation. Your birth certificate, drivers license, SSN, bank statements, are all written in capital letters, which means you have registered, submitted and/or applied to be a part of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, corporation as a fictitious character.</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is located in the District of Columbia.  What is the District of Columbia and what are the other Districts? (Vatican, City of London)</p>

<p>The Owners of the private corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, are the City of London and the Vatican.</p>

<p>When we pay taxes we “voluntarily” submit our tax returns to Washington, D.C. yet pay our taxes to the UNITED STATES TREASURY; A private corporation registered in Puerto Rico! </p>

<p>Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner, and every treasury secretary since 1913 are appointed but not as cabinet members.  The Secretary of the Treasury is as a corporate “governor” of what is known as “The Fund” or “The Bank” and several other international organizations.  The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury is not sworn in and speaks no oath of loyalty or defense of the United States.  The obligation of this secretary (governor) is to the International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.  All employees of the IMF governor are paid by the Fund directly, or out of funds supplied to the Governor of the Fund specifically for that purpose.  The IMF governor is not paid by the US government as he/she is not employed by that government.</p>

<p>The current President is the CEO of the foreign corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, named Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>The United States of America is written in small cap letters and represents the original constitution of America.  One must not “join” the U.S. corporation if they wish to have the rights of “Free” people but by registering, submitting or applying, we are unwittingly joining the U.S corporation, which for most of us starts at our birth (see below).</p>

<p>Global Government Entities are corporations registered and incorporated in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in Washington, D.C.,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets old people justifying their shitty memories with the Mandela effect. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a great series on Netflix called Brain Games. One episode specifically deals with people who witness crimes, and then are asked to describe the perp. They swear up and down the shirt was this color or the hair was that color, and then others enter the questioning and deliberately enter misinformation to throw the witnesses off, the witnesses then convinced it went duenna certain way. By the end of he episode the video is shown if what happened and the people are literally baffled it went down the way it did. </p>

<p>The reality is the conscious mind only picks up so much. Maybe one billionth of the environmental stimuli. So it&#39;s extremely easy to miss detail. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t doubt the Mandela effect, the ratio of people with shitty memories using it as a scapegoat for them missing details is too high.</p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes people just miss shit right in front of their face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And the reason why is because reality is created in the present. Each second is a slightly different angle of the present moment. When you recall a memory it is done from a different time from when the experience happened. So you are viewing the experience from a different perspective, that in itself will alter the memory. Even if the alteration is slight or barely noticeable, it is still an alteration.</p>

<p>The past is not set in stone. It is actually somewhat an illusion. It&#39;s held together by memory which can be altered. Doing so also alters the present past and future. Don&#39;t be alarmed though we do this constantly. Generally we don&#39;t alter major choices, but one could do that and shift Into another parallel reality seamlessly and not even be aware they have altered the past present and future timelines. The new memory would override the previous.</p>

<p>Altering a group memory takes more people to agree to the memory shift. Even if two people had an experience and one wanted to alter the memory it would still take cooperation of both people. </p>

<p>It gets old people justifying their shitty memories with the Mandela effect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. </p>

<p>You wanna know what truly gets old? People like you dismissing so many people and saying it&#39;s shit memories and comparing it to witnessing a crime.</p>

<p>Witnessing a crime, depending on circumstance is a very traumatic event to go through, and make sense that your memory is not working as precisely as it should, because the fight or flight kicks in and primitive mental actions supersede normal actions, not too mention the adrenaline going through the body, it&#39;s almost a high (or a buzz), if you will..</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so quick to write shit off, especially if you do not know completely what you are talking about...</p>

<p>So then why did you add that, directly after? Sounds like a typical good cop bad cop ploy, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good cop bad cop? How does that even apply? Are you trying to say sounds like I see it from two different points? Which is not even close to good cop bad cop, by the way, lmfao.</p>

<p>I do see it from both perspectives. People using the Mandela effect as an excuse fir their shit memories doesn&#39;t negate the fact the Mandela effect. No point explaining it to someone looking to want to argue. Have a good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE ORGANIC ACT of 1871</strong></p>

<p>from Wiki:</p>

<p>“Formally An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia, is an Act of Congress that repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown and established a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia. Though Congress repealed the territorial government in 1874, the legislation was the first to create a single municipal government for the federal district”</p>

<p>The new government consisted of an appointed governor and 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works charged with modernizing the city.[7] The Seal of the District of Columbia features the date 1871, recognizing the year the District’s government was incorporated</p>

<p>….that created the (All Capital Letters) “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” thereby creating a private U.S. corporation which is its own city-state of its own country with its:</p>

<p>Own mayor, police force, constitution, post office pays no taxes and is not beholden to any other country.  Just like the City of London and the Vatican</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in all capitals, represents a fictitious corporation. Your birth certificate, drivers license, SSN, bank statements, are all written in capital letters, which means you have registered, submitted and/or applied to be a part of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, corporation as a fictitious character.</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is located in the District of Columbia.  What is the District of Columbia and what are the other Districts? (Vatican, City of London)</p>

<p>The Owners of the private corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, are the City of London and the Vatican.</p>

<p>When we pay taxes we “voluntarily” submit our tax returns to Washington, D.C. yet pay our taxes to the UNITED STATES TREASURY; A private corporation registered in Puerto Rico! </p>

<p>Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner, and every treasury secretary since 1913 are appointed but not as cabinet members.  The Secretary of the Treasury is as a corporate “governor” of what is known as “The Fund” or “The Bank” and several other international organizations.  The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury is not sworn in and speaks no oath of loyalty or defense of the United States.  The obligation of this secretary (governor) is to the International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.  All employees of the IMF governor are paid by the Fund directly, or out of funds supplied to the Governor of the Fund specifically for that purpose.  The IMF governor is not paid by the US government as he/she is not employed by that government.</p>

<p>The current President is the CEO of the foreign corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, named Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>The United States of America is written in small cap letters and represents the original constitution of America.  One must not “join” the U.S. corporation if they wish to have the rights of “Free” people but by registering, submitting or applying, we are unwittingly joining the U.S corporation, which for most of us starts at our birth (see below).</p>

<p>Global Government Entities are corporations registered and incorporated in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in Washington, D.C.,</p>
