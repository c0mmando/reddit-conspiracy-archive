        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kyrie was trending on twitter after posting flat earth tweets. 
I have two videos about the twitter posts and about a post- game interview regarding his thoughts, respectively.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh5wiP19O5F0fX03Wf">http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh5wiP19O5F0fX03Wf</a></p>

<p>Personally, I do not support or deny flat Earth because I have no irrefutable evidence, however there is very compelling evidence on both sides. Not to mention my skepticism of authority (9/11 false report, JFK assassination, The Lavon Affair, etc.) 
It is nice to see skepticism and &quot;thinking for yourself&quot; starting to go mainstream.</p>

<p>Edit #1 for formatting :)</p>

<p>Edit #2:
I didn&#39;t expect so much debate. This post wasn&#39;t meant to show support to either side, just to celebrate Kyrie&#39;s investigation and inquiry. It does not matter whether he is right or wrong, what matters is that he thought about the theory enough to do his own research. Thinking, research and investigation into truth should be celebrated!</p>

<p>Second, even though I know you are not open minded since you start your reply with insults, I will tell you that you have no Idea what you are talking about. The North pole is not Antarctica is a small area that people have gone to already, and you cant fly to Antarctica cause is a restricted Area.</p>

<p>Whatever. At least we follow the scientific method while &quot;Real&quot; scientists have yet to prove gravity or relativity with anything else than complicated illogical equations that they make up. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why we call them the Theory of gravity and Theory of relativity on 2017. Cause they can&#39;t be proven. And take in mind this two theories are the foundation of earth being a globe.</p>

Theory is based on as far as we can prove with the current information and cumulative study on the matter. You can add evolution to that list too but rocketing on a giant coin through space is som L.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you look it up on YouTube or actually got out there and binocular&#39;d or used a telescope to see it yourself? Honestly? Pythagoras knew is was a sphere in 6th century bc and was widely accepted in 3rd century bc. Didn&#39;t need YouTube to tell them. Magellan circumnavigated the globe to prove it was spherical. The renaissance thinkers and most middle age intellectuals knew it wasn&#39;t flat. Christopher Columbus didn&#39;t have a hard time finding sea farmers because they thought they would fall off or hit a wall of ice, he had a hard time conscripting because they thought they would run out of provisions going around the long stretch to Asia.. its common classical knowledge that our &#39; intellectual &#39; and advanced knowledge is denying now. How did native Polynesians migrate (by stars) to all the spaced out islands and territories they inhabited without the understanding of the rotation of the stars in the heavens for their bearings? This knowledge is ancient that the earth is not flat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actual Ancients did believe the earth is flat.  The Greeks, and Egyptians all believed the earth is flat, and before you say this people were primitive look up their knowledge on mathematics and astronomy, which was super advanced for their time. The Giza pyramids for example are impossible to replicate today, with current technology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about Renaissance thinkers cause they have not been able to prove nothing off what they said starting with Newton the clown( no offense there he just looks like a clown in his pictures) who had to invent a whole new mathematics (calculus) on the same year the apple fell on his head, just so his gravity theory made a little sense, yet newton himself never believed his own theory.</p>

<p>you can find that in his wikipedia at &quot;Newtons Reservations&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton&#x27;s_law_of_universal_gravitation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton&#39;s_law_of_universal_gravitation</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how Christobal Columbus proves anything People have navigated since ancient times perfectly. And is possible to navigate following a flat earth map.</p>

<p>I skipped your binoculars comment cause I have used them and yes honestly. They are very cheap. I Have no idea how this can surprise you?. But anyways use them yourself if you still don&#39;t believe me, or you tube, they are quite cheap, as I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you asking me this? </p>

<p>The horizon is &quot;the line at which the earth&#39;s surface and the sky appear to meet.&quot;</p>

<p>People can&#39;t see past the horizon because of perspective. However if you had a way to magnify your field of view then yes technically you would expand the horizon.</p>

<p>So after I use a binocular at the beach I can see again that ship that appeared to have left the horizon. </p>

<p>And if I had a more powerful magnifier I could see even further. 
This proves that there is no curvature on the earth.</p>

<p>Look here are 2 short video explaining exactly what i mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to your original post I would say I&#39;m not convinced of flats earth but I do have a couple of problems with the sphere earth model. It&#39;s possible to entertain and idea without accepting it. I see a lot of peoples knee jerk reaction is to lash out and call flat earthers idiots. </p>

<p>I was taught a lot of things in public school that turned out to be bullshit and nasa is full of shit.  Doesn&#39;t mean the earth is flat but gives me reasonable doubt to look further into it and at least entertain the idea even if I see problems with the flat earth model. 
Am I researching and spending time on what model is more correct? No, mostly because I don&#39;t really have anything to gain out of either but my initial reaction to hearing flat earth was that it sounds stupid but it&#39;s somewhat entertaining to hear how people try to explain flat earth. Most peoples initial reaction to flat earth theories are pure entertainment. </p>
