The problem right now is that there&#39;s 119 hours of hard to make out at times audio. It&#39;s very hard to transcribe and tell who is talking. And it&#39;s not like you want to skip through it quickly as you never know when you&#39;re gonna hear something juicy. It&#39;s gonna take time but things will come out of it. </p>

<p>In essence, you&#39;re right. Criminal syndicates, of which our elites are members, are being played by negative ETs to enslave humanity. These criminals syndicates work together to control the governments and the media around the western world. These ETs are in the thrall of an ancient AI.

The 4chan alien was an attempt to get everyone to focus on fucking space reptiles rather than pizzagate and this video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I didn&#39;t expect that. I see what you mean. It doesn&#39;t sit well with me either. Yet, it does seem like there is a lot of truth in the Law of One. I didn&#39;t read all of it yet though. </p>

<p>Let me start with the idea of spiritual energy. It is made by consciousness in positive emotional states (love based) and radiated in negative emotional states (fear based). The light inspires love based emotional states with their beliefs and behaviors. The dark inspires fear based emotional states, with their beliefs and behaviors. It is said that we and other planets are (loosh) farms for this spiritual energy for the benefit of malevolent beings. By being in the same base emotional state of fear, beings can absorb this radiated spiritual energy. This phenomenon is why misery loves company. It is why sadists love to torment. It is the purpose for sacrifice rituals. I had to explain this for the rest to make sense, please bear with me. </p>

<p>As said in the Law of One, as well as by other messengers, we are allowed to be exploited, harassed and corrupted by negative ETs and then this idea of harvest/graduation comes at the end of it <em>if</em> we censor our minds into a positive polarity or go nearly fully self-serving into a negative polarity. Otherwise we have to go back and be molested yet again by loosh (spiritual energy) farmers, aka the dark. </p>

<p>I think true freedom lies outside of the perception of duality. I don&#39;t see light and dark anymore. I see parasites and producers of value for consciousness. Truly benevolent beings would prevent infections rather than facilitating them. A healthy body protects its cells from parasitic organisms with a strong immune system response. So much of the time I contemplate duality I think that the light effectively helps the dark harvest our spiritual energy. </p>

<p>The light fertilizes us with loving perspectives and messages and maintains our positivity in order to maintain the generation of this spiritual energy. However, they never do what an immune system does and effectively identify, target and eliminate parasites. In fact they are dogmatic in their belief that they must not and that we need to interact with &quot;the dark&quot;, which is essentially just spiritual parasites. The dark causes suffering and fear which extracts our spiritual energy. To have only light would cut out the harvesting of spiritual energy. To have only dark would cut out the generation and thus the harvesting of spiritual energy. For maximum spiritual energy <em>harvesting</em>, a sort of balance is required. </p>

<p>So, it is as if we are forced to choose which way we want to assist in the farming of loosh from other life forms or be forced back into molestation by the dark until we choose a polarity. Because of this perception I cannot identify with the light and I sure don&#39;t identify with the dark. It seems that they are both part of a system for perpetual spiritual slavery. Perhaps the light are largely duped into supporting this, thinking it is good and/or necessary via fear and dogma, much like religious people who can&#39;t question their faith. </p>

<p>I now instead ressonate and identify with the idea of reflection of behavior. It is said as you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. I think as we approach the collective wisdom of all things, we come to realize that all choices are just choices, not so much light or dark. Yet, they come with consequences that do matter. So, a perception aligned with the golden rule emerges. The golden rule is to treat others as you would want to be treated. We don&#39;t need authority to tell us what is good or bad by honestly following this behavioral protocol. We need no master or middlemen in our experience of existence to be in self-control. </p>

<p>If we truly are all one, we cannot escape the idea that what we do to others we do to ourselves. It just has some lag time through the process of incarnation. When there are only two incarnations it is obvious. Enslaving your neighbor will lead to an encarnation of enslavement. When there are many trillions, the reflection of behavior is not so obvious. So it becomes important to have principles and protocols that mitigate the ever present temptation of powerful beings to enslave and exploit weaker beings.  Otherwise a few parasites can and will turn creation into a hell. </p>

<p>So, instead of blanket forgiveness, I find value in conditional forgiveness based on the correction of behavior. If we forgive others who harm, we facilitate the harm. It doesn&#39;t help anyone, except the one doing the harm and our own self just in that moment before we are reoffended by witnessing or experiencing new harm. However we can much more easily forgive, and it has much more merit and benefit, if the one that did the harm has shown that they won&#39;t do it again. It also works if some other party restrains them so they can&#39;t harm, just not as well as the aforementioned scenario. </p>

<p>I find forgiveness is a red herring for a dark in appearance, fear based, albeit necessary, emotional energy of correction. If we honor that energy of correction, forgiveness is easy. If we go against it, we get a lot of emotional resistance. The light seems to want us to forget about the energy of correction and forgive and love dark beings despite their incessant intentions to cause harm. That is too close to Stockholm syndrome. That is too close to condoning and perpetuating abuse. That is too close to submitting to slavery and it damn well feels that way too. It&#39;s like we are stressing the part of ourselves that wants to be free and self-deterministic to the breaking point. When we submit, we break it and feel broken, like a tamed animal. Why would truly benevolent beings want that?</p>

<p>There are some other, also apparently benevolent, beings that say we are in a spiritual slavery system where we are forced to keep feeding parasites our energy, reincarnating to pay off karma we are set up to create, through poor circumstances we are told are to pay off our karma. It&#39;s a cycle, much like grazing and milking is for cows. They tell us duality is an illusion. They tell us that we are already worthy of God&#39;s acceptance and love, that we are God and a piece of God at the same time. They tell us to get off our knees and stop submitting to judgement from others. They tell us that we are being deceived. I tend to think this is the correct perspective. </p>

<p>Life needs love and fear to remain independent and free. Throwing away one or the other, the desired effect of polarity, seems like a spiritual lobotomy now. Fear&#39;s role is protection, while love&#39;s role is growth. Growth without protection is ideal for farmers. That is low effort farming. Protection without spiritual energy production creates a tough parasite, usable by tougher parasites to harvest energy for themselves. We don&#39;t want to play that game though, do we? </p>

<p>So, I have come to what I find a beautiful perspective on morality. I simply agree with everyone. The most loving and the most parasitic. I do it in a reflective way. As anyone puts out an idea of how others should be treated I think the phrase, &quot;I agree with you, but for you alone!&quot; If beings are isolated with other beings that agree with their intentions, parasitic behavior dies a hard and appropriate entropic death. Yet in the very same situation, contributory, productive or rather benevolent behavior instead builds upon itself and keeps growing. One perpetually creates and the other just destroys. </p>

<p>If we were all put with those that agree with our intentions we&#39;d get what we deserve, destruction or eternal creation. Or something less extreme in between. This might seem dualistic, but production of value and parasitism of value are the real choices behind the false paradigm of duality we are used to hearing. The light actually facilitates the parasitism. So, it is not the same perspective. The test is really a reflection of the behavior we give, being received by ourselves. I don&#39;t want to expose others to these parasites and I doubt very many others on this planet do either. I think I&#39;d deserve them and through reincarnation in oneness in causality, I would experience them again and again too. No! </p>

<p>To effectively do this reflection based allocation of beings based on intentions is to make parasitic behavior impossible in the long run. I&#39;m hoping that this is closer to what might occur in correction of this planetary situation. It would be astonishingly beautiful and appropriate. God, or those aligned with its wisdom, would be like the perfect genies or martial artists that add momentum to attempted blows and throw their opponents with their own momentum. The parasites would despise this form of balance, while they thrived under the light dark paradigm&#39;s balance. </p>

<p>God, we don&#39;t care about their free will! That&#39;s not our way (power over others, enslavement).</p>

<p><em>If I disrespect their free will, why should I respect yours? In that case I&#39;ll just use my power over others to put you into a prison.</em></p>

<p>Thats what you just did to us God!</p>

<p><em>No, I just put you with yourselves. You are the prison guards of each other. It seems like hell, because you beings generate experiences that are hell. You deserve what you do to others. Indeed, it is an inescapable aspect of our collective coexistence. Free each other and you free yourselves. Enslave each other and you enslave yourselves. If I remove this balance, you would destroy all of creation.</em></p>

<p>Why do our hosts get a heaven from you?!</p>

<p><em>I gave them the same opportunity you are getting. They make it a heaven by treating others the way they want to be treated. You both are getting what you deserve, as it is what you create for others, which are your selves.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>I wonder how many others are starting to see the cracks in this light dark duality paradigm as I am seeing. Your comment gives me renewed hope. Good vs evil, light vs dark is a sort of scam designed to distort and thus cover for the real conflict of interests we see before our eyes, parasites vs producers of value for consciousness. Diseases, parasitic organisms, cabals of criminals exploiting others, dark beings, all of them are parasites and all of them are seeking a form of slavery for others. Fear is a red herring. Parasites are our bane and they generate our pain, at least a great deal of it. Fear can assist us identifying the parasites and dealing with them if we do not let fear control us, while love can motivate us to do so for others even when it doesn&#39;t immediately affect ourselves. We have to balanced and whole to be free, not just love and light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah bro. Here&#39;s what happened, as I have come to understand it. A mysterious post was mode on pol with the title of &quot;24489 taken 25 miles NW of (some air force base near Phoenix) Lab4RC&quot; or something like that. The pic was of a yellow, scaly alien creature with eyes like plums and humanoid features, a slightly hour glass head, in the left side of the picture looking diagonally away from the camera. A tree was in the background, it was in a desert area from the looks of it.   </p>

<p>The pic was only up for about two minutes before it 404d, and then 4chan went down for about ten minutes and when it came back image posting was banned for a while and threads about it kept getting nuked.    </p>

<p>x is saying it&#39;s debunked, it could be larpers, but they seem like faggots who are all &quot;eh you guys fell for my epic ayy lmao&quot;. Individuals are meming by posting okay &quot;here it is&quot; and then deleting their images because they are hopeless assholes, but threads about it do keep disappearing and the lack of even a screencap of the thumbnail is kind of interesting.   </p>

<p>So it never existed to begin with, but holy fuck it really gained popularity if that is the case, you know? Where did the whole thing start? It&#39;s strange.    </p>

<p>At one point there were some remarks about a certain person having people roll to get a leak, but that was proven to be a ruse. Or maybe it wasn&#39;t and this is the distraction. Who knows.    </p>

<p>Other anons, largely believed to be larping, said looking at the image made them physically feel sick. Shaking, nauseous that kind of thing.     </p>

<p>TL;DR: Strange happenings, even if there is no ayy lmao. </p>
