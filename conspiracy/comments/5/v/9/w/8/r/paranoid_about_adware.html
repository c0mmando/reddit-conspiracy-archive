    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s always the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">NAI Opt-out</a>. Personally, targeted advertising doesn&#39;t bother me all that much. If an advertising network realizes I&#39;ve been viewing its ads on auto part sites and so tries to sell me auto parts, based off the cookies stored locally on my device, I don&#39;t consider that a larger breach of privacy than - let&#39;s say - that same advertiser logging my IP when I visit that auto parts site. It is a little creepy, admittedly, though. My bigger concern is genuine adware and other malware - which often finds its way in through poorly screened advertisements.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard you can get an introductory program to see if you&#39;ll like linux. I&#39;ve heard its superiour to other osx due to control and reduced hackability however the learning curve is high if you are not a dev or programmer which is why there is a supposed intro to linux program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d advise doing this if you haven&#39;t already...</p>

<p>First of all consider the browser you are using. Chrome is known for tracking pretty much everything you do, but it does come with a lot of functionality so you kind of have to decide if you want to go all out and seriously sort your privacy out or if you just want to block trackers, ads, etc. If you do want to &quot;go for it&quot;, visit <a href="/r/privacy">/r/privacy</a> read the sidebar which has a very handy FAQ and other links. I would recommend Firefox.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for an easy 2 minute fix which does a pretty damn good job, then get <a href="https://disconnect.me">Disconnect</a> it&#39;s free and does very well at blocking trackers and all kinds of stuff you don&#39;t want following you around the internet. Sneaky Sneakers Snickers.</p>

<p>The Pro offering is well worth it at $40 (one-time fee) or $50 to go Premium and get behind a secure, fast VPN. Get the Disconnect &quot;desktop app&quot; to run it system wide which will block all trackers system-wide, or at the very least get the browser plugin there are other services that offer similar things but I&#39;ve found disconnect to be really good and super straightforward. </p>

<p>Get rid of &quot;adblock plus&quot; and get either Adguard Adblocker that page has the links to each browser plugin. Or get uBlock Origin not to be confused with uBlock, which is made by someone else. I use uBlock Origin with scripts/lists (below)</p>

<p>Once Adguard/uBlock Origin is installed you can add filter lists. <a href="https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/">This is a highly recommended list</a> and will block so much shit. We all know that shit is bad, well, that depends on the shit we&#39;re talking about... however, in this case, this is bad shit. A highly recommended list which many people use is the FanboyList select either complete or ultimate and you&#39;ll get a popup from Adguard or uBlock Origin (slightly different install process so please read the link carefully), asking if you want to import the list, click ok/yes.</p>

<p>For those who want to take things a step further and know how to use userscripts take a look at <a href="https://tampermonkey.net">TamperMonkey</a> if using chrome or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">GreaseMonkey</a> if using Firefox to install userscripts easily and keep them updated, you can do all kinds of awesome shit with userscripts (if you know what you&#39;re doing) but in this instance we&#39;re talking about privacy, so we want to block fucking everything.</p>

<p>So, once you&#39;ve installed Tampermonkey, Get Reek Adblock Killer from Github, make sure to carefully follow the instructions if you&#39;ve not used usercripts before, and don&#39;t get overexcited and start installing any old userscript, there are malicious scripts so be careful what you install.</p>

<p>Last but not least, if you&#39;re using Google&#39;s DNS servers, consider changing that to a secure DNS server, here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.opennicproject.org">OpenNIC Public DNS server list</a></p>

<p>Hope that goes some way to helping. Even if you just get disconnect you&#39;ll notice a huge difference in speed and you&#39;ll be able to see how many trackers have been blocked by clicking the icon in the taskbar. It&#39;s quite astounding on some websites how many systems they have running for analysing behaviour, harvesting data, and all sorts of really advanced marketing systems. I was shocked when I went on Wired the other day and saw the amount of systems they use.</p>

<p>Good luck and if you have any questions give me a shout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my very biased data, 
- All search engine sells your info
- All social media sells your info
- All browser sells your info, even fucking steam too
- Your smartphone sells your info regardless if it&#39;s apple or &#39;droid
- Even your own PC sells your info</p>

<p>Can say that I should just let the all seeing eye of the biggie corps, to watch over me, Accepting facts that privacy is dead is the only thing that lets me use internet without feeling paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your privacy doesn&#39;t have to be dead. That&#39;s not true at all. However, if you <em>choose</em> to publicize your life on social media then you obviously don&#39;t <em>really</em> care about your privacy. Any time you use some social media tool, you are selling your data to them. They <strong>will</strong> sell it to private third parties and <strong>will</strong> share information with the NSA.</p>

<p>People who <em>really</em> care <strong>don&#39;t</strong> use social media.</p>

<p>If you seriously want to protect your privacy you have to do away with a couple of luxuries but it can be done. The steps above are a very good starting point and so easy to set up. It should take 5 minutes to do and you&#39;ll be a LOT better of than you were before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest solution is to use startpage.com, which allows you to privately search google without revealing anything about yourself.</p>

<p>Also gives you search results that aren&#39;t tailored for the profile Google has compiled on you from all of your previous visits so it gives you a better and broader picture of what the majority of people have searched for and found in regards to any item or topic rather than just the ones with a similar profile to your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in public digitization, which means I use a government-owned computer that has a lot of access and sits behind some fairly state-of-the-art and harsh security measures. I&#39;ve never used my work station for private purposes or logged into anything privately. I&#39;ve never brought it to my home, I&#39;ve never used it to recharge my phone or similar things. I have a separate work and private phone by the way. I know a lot of people like slacking around on their jobs, but I get bored when I&#39;m not working, so I guess I&#39;m a little weird that way.</p>

<p>On top of this I&#39;m on social media with a fake last name, because why not? I guess I am weird, but whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m still getting facebook and google commercials for a work related IT-architecture certificate I took last summer.</p>

<p>This basically means that facebook and google has a way of knowing where I work, what computer I&#39;m on and what I use it for. I guess google could know where I work, and what position I&#39;m in, because I used my gmail account when I applied for the job, but it still scares the shit out of me.</p>

<p>Especially because the secret services most likely have much better shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing. You can reset, but never prevent. Just like in real life, if you create a new identity, the information on your old identity remains. Eventually, with enough data points, your activity is going to be attributable to the original identity.</p>

<p>Basically, total invisibility is impossible. Even if you only ever use tor via qubes/whonix, your actions are recorded. The key is separation. So for facebook, you want to sandbox that off from everything else you do. Don&#39;t share things to facebook that you look at on other websites. Don&#39;t click links to webpages in facebook, etc. Your email, connect to with a different sandbox. Browse reddit on a 3rd sandbox. You can even sandbox your <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> activity by itself. </p>

<p>Beyond sandboxing, there&#39;s also data contamination. Rather than having a very short list of specific things you are interested based on where you go and what you click, instead, soil that data by going everywhere and clicking everything. Also, generating false web activity while online will soil your timezone attribution. Look into AdNauseum. Not only does this falsify your targeted advertisement, it also costs the ad companies money.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to identify all vectors of possible attack. Put a radio in your closet tuned to the local hispanic channel. Place your smart phone next to it at night. Then, keep an eye out for any spanish language ads. Smart TV? Same thing. Anything that might have a mic.</p>

<p>Another idea, if you&#39;re pretty computer savvy. Set up your own email server on a domain you own. Create a different email for every piece of paper you put your email address on. This will show you who is selling your info.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t sign up for loyalty cards. Most clerks will have a spare card.</p>

<p>These are just a few tips. You&#39;re stepping into a whole new realm and it&#39;s not a conspiracy. They really are out to get you.</p>
