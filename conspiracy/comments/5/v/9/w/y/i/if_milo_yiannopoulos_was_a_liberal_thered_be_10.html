<p>I don&#39;t believe there is a moral high ground to have on any side of the political spectrum.

<p>There is no way 14 year old milo would have been in control of that situation and some potenitally nasty stuff he didn&#39;t understand may have happened to him. He is obviously saying this to cope by giving himself some agency when he was being groomed. </p>

<p>Victims of abuse do this as a coping strategy. If they can rewrite the past so they were in control of the situation it makes it much easier to deal with.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disrespectful to call people out of their name and trying to normalize disrespect of others is apart of the bigotry he&#39;s trying to spread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that a 14 year old can not consent to a relationship with another 14 year old. If they do they are both the victim and abuser of each other?  This is why stating they can&#39;t consent is a strawman in itself. Teenagers most certainly can and they do so on a daily basis with other teenagers. </p>

<p>Your problem is with how the word consent is being applied. You&#39;re applying consent it&#39;s literal legal definition in regards to consent law. I&#39;m applying it on the standard dictionary definition on the basis of social interaction of a particular age group (13-15yr olds) interacting amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Clearly your taking the speech part out of context. It does not matter if speech is disrespectful or not. There do not to be hate speech laws. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not surprised you ended with an ad hominem attack statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, I&#39;ll state why this is funny at the end. </p>

<p>That&#39;s priceless. Pointing out that standard dictionary and legalese definitions are different is a strawman. </p>

<p>You say they can&#39;t consent based on the legal definition. Which is correct, in most states the age of legal consent is 16-17. However it is 18 for signing contracts or participating in contests. </p>

<p>I say that they can and do consent with peers in the same age demographic based on the standard Websters definition. The vast majority know this is true due to their own individual experiences. </p>

<p>You run away </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because we&#39;re both right, you from a law / legalese standpoint and I from a social interaction and  demographic based standpoint. </p>

<p>The current written laws even acknowledge the difference between the legal / standard dictionary definition due to the additon of Romeo and Juliet exceptions in the states consent laws. </p>

It can describe anyone that is right-leaning and rejects the establishement, specifically the republicans and neocons in the top layers of the US goverment. So I ask you again, what is your point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it and I&#39;m not say it isn&#39;t cringy but it&#39;s a cringy topic. It&#39;s a topic that every person needs to be very careful in how they word things so they don&#39;t get taken out of context and the individual needs to be very clear or comments are twisted. </p>

<p>He does say that he agrees the consent laws as they are now are about right. I don&#39;t know if I agree with him on that because I know in the states consent laws vary by state, some states even have &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; exceptions to the consent laws. These exceptions make the laws pretty cluttered as they allow a 21 year old to date a 15 year old in some states if a relationship existed when they were both minors. </p>

<p>I find the timing of this odd, there was an attempt to stop him from speaking multiple times for supporting Trump, for having a trolling sense of humor, for comments on BLM/ Feminism, ect... The attempts to stop him from speaking have been done on twitter, Facebook,  riots /protests at college campus&#39;s and now this. </p>

<p>To me it seems like some groups saw the online responses to the pizza thing and dug up comments made by Milo years ago,  just as he was starting to get into the legacy media after being on Bill Mahr, and are trying to get him lumpped into the pizza thing. I say this due to the emotional response this topic creates. </p>

<p>The story just seems to be to well timed to be a coincidence, to some extent it comes off as a possible hit piece. </p>

<p>The one counter point I would like to point out is that the part about consent seems to be him referring to the consent laws on college campuses if the whole Drunken Peasants podcast is listend too. They then jump into Milo&#39;s own personal experience and it comes off as him justifing his personal experience to himself. I may have interrupted this incorrectly but that is how I took it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a left vs right issue... Why are you trying to paint whether or not child sex abuse is OK as a political issue.  It&#39;s not political.  Conservatives released these videos so that Milo would be disinvited as a speaker from CPAC so they won&#39;t be associated with this shit.  They are happy to have Milo on the fringe as a wrecking ball but they don&#39;t want him brought into the fold with his troll antics and unfortunate opinions on when kids and adults should be OK to have sex... On Rogan he talked about how at 13 a body is biologically mature for sex and was basically using that as his measure for when it&#39;s OK depending on the maturity of the boy.. so if a boy is post-puberty and seems to be mature then it&#39;s OK for that boy to have sex with a grown man.  That was basically his NAMBLA talking points.  </p>

<p>All over the world, in Canada, areas of the US, and many other countries the legal age of consent is 16. </p>

<p>He was talking in the context of a gay man, drawing correlations between how dating an older man (consensual) can be beneficial to you the same way as teenage girls date men who are older than them.</p>

<p>Is the 19 year old, or 20 year old dating the 15-17 year old a pedophile?</p>

<p>How about the 40 year old man that jerks off to 18 year olds on the internet?</p>

<p>You can draw the line wherever you want in society and someone will always argue. He was speaking on behalf of personal experience as a contrarian to the point that all relationships with people who are older than you are damaging and non beneficial.</p>

<p>He was also speaking from the perspective of a victim, not an attacker.</p>

<p>The correlation that he is a pedophile is really, quite honestly shameful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey 👋 the problem is that children are easily manipulated at that age. An older person with a job can take them out, buy then some ice cream, take them to the park and they think life is grand. Next thing they know they are getting fucked in the ass. </p>

<p>So we have to protect our children until they can make decisions on their own. Like hey, &quot;my body is worth more than an ice cream 🍦 and a trip to the park.&quot; Or hey &quot;I don&#39;t actually want this old guys dick in my ass.&quot; Or &quot;well this seems like he or she is using me, I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot; And stand up for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... are you confused about Milo.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t &quot;have something done to him&quot;.</p>

<p>Milo&#39;s position has always been that Milo was the aggressor, not the older man.</p>

<p>In fact, that is the crux of his argument in the video. He says that certain, sexually precocious teens pursue adults and he sees no problem with adult men accepting and reciprocating those advances.</p>

<p>We can debate those points, but don&#39;t misrepresent him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, didn&#39;t realize this.</p>

<p>But Milo was the minor and the aggressor. So would this be labeled as pedophilia? The adult would be called the pedophile, right? So what would Milo be called in this situation? Just genuinely curious, because I don&#39;t think the minor is called a pedophile.  Is there a name for a minor that makes sexual advances on adults?</p>

<p>The victim. </p>

<p>Milo is no longer a minor though, and is advocating for it. Which <em>now</em> makes him the defender of pedophiles.</p>

<p>As Milo ages, don&#39;t be surprised if he falls into the stereotype.</p>

<p>It was a huge tell how enthusiastic and positive he was about a &quot;loving older man&quot; psychologically altering a mentally malleable child.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a copy paste from a response I had to a similar comment:</p>

<p>Except that the circumstantial evidence around Milo is a couple of opinions and thinly veiled partisan arguments.
The circumstantial evidence surrounding Pizza Gate involves property laundering, propagandist David Brock, Hillary Clinton&#39;s Secretary of State choice John Podesta, his quirky art collecting brother Tony, highly controversial and somewhat sickening performance artist Marina Abromovic, publicly shared provocative imagery sexualizing food and children, video documentation of the spirit cooking process by Marina herself, a shooter at Comet Ping Pong whose dad has worked in child protective services for most of his life, a dead journalist by the name of Andrew Breitbart who accused John Podesta of being a pedophile years ago, Seth Rich an alleged informant whose murder has yet to be solved, and much more.</p>

<p>Example:  When I was 17 and in high school, I dated a classmate who was also 17.  Well, his birthday was 3 months before mine. So he turned 18 in January.  (I would not turn 18 until April). So for 3 months, he &quot;technically&quot; could have been labeled a pedophile. But he wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The law in most states I&#39;m familiar with doesn&#39;t work that way.  Most states have recognized this is a non-issue and created so-called Romeo and Juliet laws in which those near the  age of 18 can have sexual relationships because relationships with those of a similar age are healthy. What&#39;s unhealthy is a 13 year old having sex with an adult man which is what Milo was talking about.</p>

<p>Just as an aside: states that don&#39;t have Romeo and Juliet laws don&#39;t bring charges for teenagers in sexual relationships because it&#39;s not worth prosecuting.  The only case I&#39;m aware of involving something that &quot;fell into pedophilia&quot; (technically statutory rape) despite not seeming like it is one in which an 18 year old highschool student had sex with her 20 something substitute teacher. The law in that state said it was statutory rape for a k-12 teacher to have sex with a k-12 student.</p>

<p>No, no it didn&#39;t. Though its objectivity and bias was never so slanted towards one particular block of people. The Trumpist are so partisan and belligerent about their ideas that it infects every discussion. As if every argument is a linear left vs right framing, rather than the complex and nuanced reality that exists....especially in a sub devoted to conspiracy. Even the mods have dived into the partisan fray.</p>

<p>It really needs to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they do have an agenda tough, but (obviously) not every jew is part of it. If you look up who owns the majority of the media in the US, it&#39;s easy to spot a pattern there, even Milo admitted that jews run the media, is he a nazi now? Jews don&#39;t even (hide their influence)[<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19">http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19</a>]. The leftist jews are the ones pushing the pedo agenda, it is not very obvious now, but it will be. 4chan was telling it before sites like salon.com and vice were publishing pedophile friendly content. Look up who the chairmen of the fed were since its foundation (spoiler alert: mostly jews). There are a lot more things were there are too many coincidences. The information is there, you just have to look for it. They have power, and they misuse it for their interest and agenda (also, see Soros). Maybe prove me wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please. I provided evidence that shows that it&#39;s much more likely that he doesn&#39;t participate in such as act and all you&#39;re doing is shitposting with absolutely nothing but your own retarded opinion.</p>

<p>Tell me shill, you seriously think it&#39;s more likely that Milo, someone who has said and showed that he&#39;s against pedophile through words and actions, is himself a pedophile or that he isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>So far you&#39;re just shitting up the thread with your opinions. Provide evidence besides your own anecdotal bullshit. Your own profile reveals that you&#39;re a far leftist and are actively against Milo in most of your recent posts. Do not pretend like you aren&#39;t trying your hardest to push an agenda here while providing no evidence whatsoever. </p>

<p>Pizzagate has always been a political smear tactic since its inception. That&#39;s all it ever was. </p>

And as a result, it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s premier dog communities, where nobody has to keep their shirt on and pretend to be a normal human.  It&#39;s all whooo-hoo bark-bark.

    <div class="md"><p>Your statements are ridiculous. Minors can&#39;t consent? Tell that to the millions of people who consensually had sex before they were 18. I don&#39;t like Milo. I think he is nothing but a troll. His provacative comments are finally biting him in the ass. That being said, I do think the media has played a large part in purposefully blowing this up muddying the waters in terms of how people are talking about pedophilia. Why? To divide us and distract us from talking about pizza gate. And to say that this entire sub sides against children is a huggeee overstatement and plays right into their game. Who cares about Milo. Fuck him. Focus on the important stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about this with Milo is that it isn&#39;t a conspiracy. It&#39;s news, it&#39;s being covered all over the place.  </p>

<p>Pizzagate is about the covering up of pedophilia by the Washington elite.  It&#39;s fair to say that Milo is not a part of that scene.</p>

<p>Milo has certainly put a damper on his career, those who didn&#39;t take him seriously now take him less seriously. Those who loved what he had to say just pursue with the &quot;He&#39;s a troll&quot; narrative until the next appealing thing he says or does.</p>

<p>My take on his comments are that probably come from a position of having had an experience as a young lad which he does his own mental gymnastics to explain away as healthy.  This is obviously all guesswork but it could also explain his caustic behaviour and lack of empathy.  As we all know abuse breeds abuse.</p>

<p>As usual we say wait for any victims to come forward, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be so blasé if there were victims waiting in the wings. My suspicion is that he himself may have been a victim. </p>

<p>Yes,some including myself,were for Milo  UNTIL he started stating his views about it being o.k. for 13&amp;14 year olds to be &quot;mentored&quot; by older men.And then,rightly so,he was disavowed by people.</p>

<p>And,I just want to restate that 98% of people on here do not give a shit about what party you&#39;re in if you&#39;re a pedo.Lock them ALL up.Dennis Hastert is a Republican.And the Podesta brothers are still good friends with him.Who the fuck stays friends with someone after they are exposed as a pedo???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the FranklinSavings&amp;Loan scandal was almost all Republicans, and that&#39;s where it all started for me. It Doesn&#39;t. Fucking. Matter. I could give a fuck what side of the fake-coin someone is <em>acting</em> like they represent, I just want to see all these elite pedophiles, whatever their brand, hanging from trees like little Christmas ornaments (I&#39;m not advocating anyone do that btw, it would just be a satisfying sight to see). At the very least, in jail forever.</p>

<p>I think this post is more about trying to find some angle to pull the old &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; trick, so we start squabbling over completely inane, meaningless useless bullshit, meanwhile these fucks get to keep diddling kids with no consequences.</p>

<p>I really hope most people here don&#39;t fall for it. Moving on..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freud would say it&#39;s how they rationalize the id and the superego.  These people are self hating pedos, he would say, their id desperately wants to fuck kids or see kids fucking but their superego knows that&#39;s viewed as &quot;wrong&quot;, and is scorned and hated more than any other behaviour in society.  So to rationalize the two aspects of their psyche to each other they decide they&#39;ll crusade against pedophilia and if they happen to see some disgusting child porn on thier quest, well, they did it for the right reasons.</p>

Few people heard of Milo before he was banned from twitter, then a lot more heard of him after the Berkeley thing.

<p>As fucked in the head as this guy is, if it&#39;s not just some character he&#39;s playing until you link him to podesta, hassert, Sandusky, or Boystown I don&#39;t see the connection. </p>

<p>Alefetais hosts weird weird weird performance artists and they audience was cracking jokes that he likes diddling kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen lots of posts regarding Milo and his statement made. What I have not seen much of is anyone dismissing it (except some of the comments here). </p>

<p>I also have not seen much of people saying that Dems are the pedophiles and Reps are not. The general consensus is that it&#39;s a problem without party lines. </p>

<p>The video clip of Milo has been posted up several times here, because people here care about stopping pedophilia. There just has not been a connection made between Milo and pizzagate, specifically. </p>

<p>But if you come here often, you will see a wide range of posts about the stopping of pedophilia, many without any connection of conspiracy. And considering Milo&#39;s statement and no abundant evidence of more, it&#39;s not really conspiracy related either.</p>

<p>**this comment made by a liberal person who no longer identifies as a Dem (because now I cannot deal with that party anymore than I can with the Republican Party)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I said is factual, he said all these things years ago in public. Few people heard of Milo before he was banned from twitter, then a lot more heard of him after the Berkeley thing. People didn&#39;t give a shit then ( had millions of downloads on JRE) , but do now is the only point that I am making. </p>

<p>As fucked in the head as this guy is, if it&#39;s not just some character he&#39;s playing until you link him to podesta, hassert, Sandusky, or Boystown I don&#39;t see the connection. </p>

<p>Alefetais hosts weird weird weird performance artists and they audience was cracking jokes that he likes diddling kids. </p>

<p>What Milo said was fucked but please illuminate why you think it&#39;s unfair he&#39;s not linked to pizzagate? </p>

<p>Milos whatever his name is a pedo and should be fired not allowed to resigned. As he didn&#39;t view what happened to him as wrong he probably think nothing was wrong wIth him doing the same to a child which makes him dangerous. </p>

<p>Yes, like the poster of this post, people post things in this Reddit for political reasons and to advance their politics view. </p>

<p>Like the poster of this post, some posters are political bigots and make out their side are angels on child molestation while the other side is the devil themselves. So down vote them.</p>

<p>Pedeophilia is a society problem and predators are all through society and not bound by political beliefs or creed.</p>
