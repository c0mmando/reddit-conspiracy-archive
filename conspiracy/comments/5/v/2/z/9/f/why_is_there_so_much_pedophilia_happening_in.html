I just find it hard to believe that a Roman prefect noted for his disdain and violence toward the Jewish population would feel so strongly about sparing a Jewish peasant from Galilee.

    <div class="md"><p>well.. his wife didn&#39;t think Jesus had done anything wrong either.. neither one of them did.. because, he didn&#39;t do anything wrong.. it was a frame-job by the government of his own people, not by rome... the government of his own people had been taken over by elitist false-jews... those are the individuals who delivered him to pilate and demanded he be crucified, and who riled up the people to demand the same, by lying about what he&#39;d done and said... things haven&#39;t changed much since then... except, now, those things are being exposed, for once, as what they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s part of the counter-offensive from the opposition side... they&#39;re actively working to make pedophilia seem like a legitimate choice for the adult by pushing a lie that a child of a much younger age is capable of reasoning a choice to consent with an adult.. </p>

<p>the same reason there&#39;s a global push for &quot;child rights&quot;.. sounds nice on the surface but boils down to children being forced into a category of consent to sexual relationships with adults because it will be a &quot;violation of their rights&quot; to deny them that &quot;choice&quot;..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s being reported more in order to prime the public for when the giants of pizzagate fall.. same thing with the increased reporting on the deep-state... when pizzagate blows open its going to take down major players.. the public is going to need a point of reference for processing that type of mind-expanding reality.. so priming is the technique used to get the public into a &#39;comfort zone&#39; where they are mentally and emotionally prepared to understand the big news when it hits.. it&#39;s also insurance against that big news being buried by a series of seemingly more-important false flag distractions.. remember every time bill clinton got in trouble the US went to war?  priming the public by baby-stepping them into awareness ensure that when the truth comes out the public is able to hear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This statement seems to assume that there is some sort of &quot;public interest&quot; or benefit &quot;for the sake of the masses/public&quot; motivation involved in why pedophilia information is being released to the public.</p>

<p>&quot;so the public can be better able to hear/handle the truth when it comes out.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not very sure that the elite have any interested in attempting to help the public better accept pedophilia.</p>

<p>I think the elite kind of <em>know</em> the public won&#39;t accept it (as well we shouldn&#39;t).  I think that part of the reason it&#39;s come out to such a great extent is because Pizzagate has really gotten some serious, unstoppable, undeniable steam behind it, and the MSM simply can&#39;t shut it the down like they&#39;ve been trying to so hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I&#39;m reading what you&#39;re saying incorrectly then because it sounds like you&#39;re saying the reason why pizzagate&#39;s gotten so huge is because the MSM purposefully propagated the story <em>first</em> so that the public can then accept pedophilia and be okay with it (i.e. putting the cart before the horse), when it seems to me that the reason that the MSM is talking about pizzagate is because the story broke <em>independent</em> of and in spite of them and their efforts to talk the subject down.  In other words, <em>they have no choice</em> but to talk about it because the topic has A) practically taken over the public consciousness and B) it&#39;s rightfully being looked upon as bering the repugnant, abhorrent crime it in fact is, so the MSM&#39;s efforts to try to marginalize pizzagate as &quot;fake news&quot; or whatever are failing, and the less they address it, the more corrupt and useless they look...and the MSM doesn&#39;t want to look completely useless, so they&#39;re trying to cover it and give it some lip service to at least <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the MSM&#39;s talking about pizzagate because they&#39;re trying to prime the public to <em>accept</em> pedophilia - i.e. be okay with it happening and being perpetrated with general impunity by many elite individuals.  I think they&#39;re trying to do damage control for and protect the elite corporacrats they&#39;re slaves to.</p>

<p>the public has to be prepared to hear things like, &quot;Today, Hillary Clinton, John and Tony Podesta and James Alefantis were arrested for their key roles in a global satanic child-trafficking pedophila ring&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the MSM itself to a great extent doesn’t understand or really even accept that pedophilia even exists to as great of an extent as it does to begin with.  How can the MSM prime the public when the MSM itself has the wool over its eyes almost as much as a lot of the public does?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can&#39;t just throw that out there to the public without some backstory groundwork foundation...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is kind of assuming that MSM is formulating a “plan of action” with regard to how to lay out all the pedophilia information out there to the public - when the fact is that the MSM is itself to a great extent ignorant of the real pedophilia data out there in the first place.</p>

<p>The talking heads on the news are TOLD what to report and what not to report - and pedophilia is definitely <em>not</em> on the list of things to really look into.  As such, much of the MSM simply doesn’t know as much as they can about it.</p>

<p>It’s not like they’re not reporting on it because they’re <em>hiding</em> it from the public.  They’re not reporting on it because a lot of the MSM propaganda pundits don’t actually themselves even know that it’s as real as it in fact is.</p>

<p>That’s how it appears to me anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s certainly happening?  In your previous comment, you said:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with this perspective in the sense that the <em>reporting</em> on the busts is the primer...but if it is a primer, it&#39;s certainly not one that&#39;s being <em>purposefully</em> done.  It&#39;s a scenario where the MSM is being just as primered by virtue of the fact that they themselves are realizing that pedophilia is as globally rampant as it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure TPTB are going to keep working hard at trying to hide any MSM pundit trying to cover or bring to light any pedo information.  Hell, just look what happened to Ben Swann when he gave some air time to pizzagate - and Swann&#39;s one of the braver reporters out there.  Most others fall right in line with TPTB narrative  - so they&#39;re going to tow the line.  As such, most reporters are just as much in the dark about it as the citizenry in the area of pedophilia, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then if the MSM isn&#39;t intentionally doing it, then it can&#39;t really be called a primer per se, can it? - unless you&#39;re meaning, as I said initially above, that it&#39;s an unintentional primer that&#39;s preparing both the MSM <em>and</em> the public to the reality of pedophilia on the planet -  a reality they (i.e. the public and the MSM both) weren&#39;t previously aware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not complicating.  Primer means &quot;a base coat in preparation for the next coat&quot;.  This presupposes a premeditation that the MSM has absolutely <em>not</em> demonstrated they posses.  That&#39;s not complicating things.  That&#39;s simply stating the case.</p>

<p>Either way, things are indeed seeming a bit pedantic at this point.</p>

<p>Seems we both agree that pizzagate and its related subjects are real.  That&#39;s good enough for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, it has to do with those that govern the world, and have increasingly been governing it since the 19th century (using the British then Anglo-American Empire as the overt, armed executor of their power).</p>

<p>As others have been pointing to this sect and set of practices go back much longer in time; it&#39;s just that since ~100 years they have been enjoying unipolar power like never before.</p>

<p>For example, when thinking about the Varican connection to child molesting, remember the Rothsdhilds are <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12909-rothschild">guardians</a> of the <a href="http://m.imgur.com/a/tcW7Q">papal treasure</a>, according to the Jewish encyclopedia itself.</p>

<p>Here some <a href="http://truthtellers.org/alerts/Judaisms-Pedophilia-Begins-with-Rabbi-ben-Yohai.html">more</a> reading on the <a href="http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/jewish_sacrifice.htm">Talmud</a>. If this interests you, read this <a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/v/voltaire/dictionary/chapter287.html">chapter</a> from Voltaire&#39;s masterpiece <em>Le Dictionnaire Philosophique</em> (expunged from most modern editions), or <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/Jewish_Ritual_Murder.htm">this</a>.</p>

<p>And again this is not to castigate Judaism in general; I&#39;m talking about the hermetic/kabbalistic/talmudist gnostic sect that uses it as a cover.</p>
