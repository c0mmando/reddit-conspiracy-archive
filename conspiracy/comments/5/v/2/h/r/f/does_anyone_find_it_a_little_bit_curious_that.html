<p>&quot;And when FBI investigators looked through Epstein’s private address book, they found 14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman. Epstein also had numbers for Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-wife Ivana.&quot; <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/">http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, after Palm Beach Police were looking into him. I&#39;m not trying to say that Trump was definitely involved in Epstein&#39;s sick shit. I&#39;m just pointing out that people often downplay their relationship, because they don&#39;t want Trump associated with him at all. Which is kind of dishonest in a way.

    <div class="md"><p>maybe political party is the wrong word, but it seems accusations are being thrown more to one side than the other.. but maybe were not talking about the same pizzagate, because ive seen different definitions of it all over the place.. i do believe in a pedogate which i would define as networks of pedophiles in powerful positions.. that cant be disputed(u.k, portugal, sweden, and im sure it happens here too) but it seems like the version of pizzagate supported by people who think spirit cooking is satanic/art is creepy target a certain party more than the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a similar tactic the CIA uses when smearing someone that gets too close to the truth. Pedophilia rings are the low hanging fruit of the shit tree. We&#39;re only going to kill the tree when we focus on the ripe stuff. That being the global elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just HRC and Podesta that are being accused... Don&#39;t be ignorant... Do a tiny bit of research into what a &quot;CIA BROWNSTONE OPERATION&quot; is... J. Edgar Hoover invented it and GW Bush Sr. perfected it... This extortion technique is used on both Republicans and Democrats... Both foreign and domestic... Generals/military to CEOs and Wallstreet... It&#39;s about control and manipulation... Grow up r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, people need something to cling to. Alien conspiracy is getting old and boring. 2012 never happened. Planet X never happened. Obama taking away everybody&#39;s gun, ruining the economy with Obamacare never happened. Pizzagate arrests always seem to happen sometime in the coming days, then those days pass. Then folks point to random arrests a proof even though people have been being arrested for pedo-crimes for decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think i missed that part of the post/thread where people were arguing in defense of pederasts.. i agree with you.. but that is clearly not what is being asked by the op, what i get from the o.p is that a certain kind of person(trump supporters) are accusing anyone who disagrees with their way of thinking or that they find &#39;suspicious&#39; as pedophiles, and usually with very little evidence, i for one do find it concerning. group think and the mob mentality always make me uneasy</p>
