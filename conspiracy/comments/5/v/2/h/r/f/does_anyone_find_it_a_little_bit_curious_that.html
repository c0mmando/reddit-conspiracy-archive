       Yes, after Palm Beach Police were looking into him. I'm not trying to say that Trump was definitely involved in Epstein's sick shit. I'm just pointing out that people often downplay their relationship, because they don't want Trump associated with him at all. Which is kind of dishonest in a way. I see people all the time saying "He barely knew Epstein at all, he just happened to a be club member".

       I dont know, seems to be pointing to both sides of the aisle, doesn't it?  And even if it focused on one, just get them taken care of.  Each person will be given a chance to sell out others.  They can cast stones to their enemies.

       Except for the fact lots of people have been indicated who aren't publicly working with or friends with Clinton.. So.. you're wrong. Trying to paint this as a 'woe clinton and pals' isn't going dissuade anyone from pizzagate.

       maybe political party is the wrong word, but it seems accusations are being thrown more to one side than the other.. but maybe were not talking about the same pizzagate, because ive seen different definitions of it all over the place.. i do believe in a pedogate which i would define as networks of pedophiles in powerful positions.. that cant be disputed(u.k, portugal, sweden, and im sure it happens here too) but it seems like the version of pizzagate supported by people who think spirit cooking is satanic/art is creepy target a certain party more than the other.

       it seems like we aren't , isn't the topic at hand exactly that? this poster voiced a concern that the very real child trafficking and elite pedophile rings are being used as a political smear tool?

       i think i missed that part of the post/thread where people were arguing in defense of pederasts.. i agree with you.. but that is clearly not what is being asked by the op, what i get from the o.p is that a certain kind of person(trump supporters) are accusing anyone who disagrees with their way of thinking or that they find 'suspicious' as pedophiles, and usually with very little evidence, i for one do find it concerning. group think and the mob mentality always make me uneasy

       First of all,  the pizza party isnt politics exclusive. Many other elites in many industries are being singled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly,  the pizza is international.  So don't bait the discussion to only single out a specific administration of a specific country.

       As a conspiracy theorist I've been saying the entire political spectrum is involved. "We've" been saying this for years, before pizzagate/pedogate. Fuck Trump I don't worship him, he's probably involved too. Who knows. I hope the whole system gets a reboot. Trey Gowdy for prez.

       Hastert was in on it obviously, and he's from the right.  Trump could honestly be part of it for all we know-but I'd like to believe they make a play at taking them down.

       Hillary's got them 650k emails around her, so if you want proof, like people always clamor like these are kids running intricate ops and leave a note saying "out to get my money in Libya, will live tweet my activities!".

       It's a similar tactic the CIA uses when smearing someone that gets too close to the truth. Pedophilia rings are the low hanging fruit of the shit tree. We're only going to kill the tree when we focus on the ripe stuff. That being the global elite.

       It's not just HRC and Podesta that are being accused... Don't be ignorant... Do a tiny bit of research into what a "CIA BROWNSTONE OPERATION" is... J. Edgar Hoover invented it and GW Bush Sr. perfected it... This extortion technique is used on both Republicans and Democrats... Both foreign and domestic... Generals/military to CEOs and Wallstreet... It's about control and manipulation... Grow up r/conspiracy.

       OP, people need something to cling to. Alien conspiracy is getting old and boring. 2012 never happened. Planet X never happened. Obama taking away everybody's gun, ruining the economy with Obamacare never happened. Pizzagate arrests always seem to happen sometime in the coming days, then those days pass. Then folks point to random arrests a proof even though people have been being arrested for pedo-crimes for decades.
