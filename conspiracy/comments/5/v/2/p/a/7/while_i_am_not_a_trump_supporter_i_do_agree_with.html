       Another great example is Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winning journalist at CC, who said that they are routinely paid by the US government and foreign governments to selectively report and even distort information on certain events. She has also indicated that the government has editorial control over content.

       ***One great example is the supposed ‘war on terror,’ or ‘false flag terrorism.’ There are evenWikileaks documents alluding to the fact that the United States government planned to “retaliate and cause pain” to countries refusing GMOs.

       One is a politician who routinely lies for personal gain. Everybody knows this. The other works under a guise of truth. Not saying that it's a good thing that presidents lie, but an entirely infiltrated media is far worse.

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently we only have 2 sources of "facts" in America: the president and the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to be my own devil's advocate. I really want to try to convince myself why I should currently believe the president as my source of facts when what currently, what the president says is corroborated by foreign countries to be a lie (insert Sweden plug)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the media tells the truth. I think they spin every story according to their organization's political orientation. I think one objective fact has always been spun differently by different media outlets. However, I believe the media spins objective facts. I believe the president spins falsehoods and exaggerations; things that cannot be corroborated by fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please can someone explain to me why my beliefs are wrong and why I should currently trust the president over the media??

        CNN Journalist ‘Governments Pay Us To Fake News’, Shocking Exposé

      <p>
       According to Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winning journalist, CNN is routinely paid by the US government and foreign governments to selectively report on certain events and make up fake news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Obama administration pay CNN for editorial control over some of their content.

       Right... Which is exactly why Trump's opinion on "fake news" is totally worthless. Trump's definition of fake is anything critical of him. That's exactly why a statement like "the leaks are real but the news is fake" makes perfect sense in Trump's brain, the event actually happened, but reporting on it makes Trump look bad so it's fake news.

       Every MSN organisation has been against Trump from the second he decided to run.  In Australia the Sydney Morning Herald runs about 3 or 4 negative stories a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched in full his last press conference (the one where he was reported as "unhinged") where he humbly stated that he wasn't against stories against him, he knows he will make mistakes, but the slant and tone of the MSN was simply fake news.

       First of all, I don't see a tweet calling the media an enemy of the American people as inciting violence.  And secondly, I think it's an inaccurate generalization to call MSM free speakers.  There is much that is twisted by them, ignored and even published at the behest of the intelligence community without substantion.  The WaPo story about Russia hacking the electrical grid, for example--they didn't even contact the VT utility involved.  The story fit a narrative, and they published it, followed later by a largely buried retraction.

       Wake up!  There aren't numerous US mass media news sources at all; there are just six. Six giant corporations control 90 percent of US mass media. And direct links connect all six of these media conglomerates to the political establishment and the economic and political power-elites of the United States.

       They are among the largest companies in the world. They contribute to both of America’s big parties, the Republicans and Democrats, while supporting their policies. US media companies have also received from the Reagan, Clinton, and Bush administrations progressively greater media deregulation, which permitted ever greater media ownership concentration, culminating for the first time in allowing all the media in a community or city to be owned by one company.

        Fox News Wins Lawsuit To Misinform Public – Seriously
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        In February 2003, Fox appealed the decision and an appellate court and had it overturned. Fox lawyers argued it was their first amendment right to report false information. In a six-page written decision, the Court of Appeals decided the FCC’s position against news distortion is only a “policy,” not a “law, rule, or regulation

       .”
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <strong>
        So, Fox and the other gladiatorical cable news channels were given the okay to legally lie right around the time of the Iraq War’s birth – when media lies coincidentally hit a peak in both frequency and severity

        Media Admits Lying about ISIS &amp; Islam
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       " To be fair to the Obama administration, the idea that ISIS and al-Qaeda are totally divorced from ‘real’ Islam is one that the media — including me — have furthered as well. Motivated by a well-intentioned desire to curb Islamophobia, perhaps as well as a desire to undermine these groups’ ideology, this media narrative is nonetheless analytically incomplete. Worse, it is condescending, by suggesting that readers cannot be trusted with the truth.”

        Obama has not been alone in his ludicrous denial that ISIS is Islamic.

        Liberal Journalist Admits Media is Lying to Make Trump Look Bad
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Tucker Carlson: The Washington Post has spent months howling about ‘fake news’ rigging the U.S. election. Now The Post has been caught publishing its own fake news, once again. The D.C.’s paper of record published a bogus story last week saying Russia hacked the U.S. electrical grid. The story was totally discredited, but not before it spread across the globe. Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald has been spanking The Post like the bad little paper it is… So what exactly did The Post write that wasn’t true
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Glenn Greenwald: Essentially the entire article from start to finish. They have the this big blockbuster announcement on Friday which was obviously sensationalistic and it would have a huge impact if it were true that Russia and Vladimir Putin had invaded the U.S. electric grid by placing malware within the utility system in Vermont

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         They induced the governor of Vermont and Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) to make these really bombastic statements about how this thug Vladimir Putin was trying to steal the heat to make Vermonters suffer during the winter. It turned out that the malware found was actually on a single laptop totally unconnected to the grid. Then it turned out that the Russians had actually nothing to do with this malware. Then it turned out that what was on the laptop probably wasn’t malware at all. So the story just collapsed one step after the next in the grandest humiliation possible

       Hilarious how that little script backfired so predictably and thoroughly on the CIA / mainstream press.

       Whoever originated the 'fake news' strategy illustrates perfectly how inept these aging oligarchs really are. It's like they have no idea that a huge section of people do not watch corporate news.

       I agree with him but he is coming from it in the wrong way. He says a lie. The media reports it he screams fake news and that msm is enemy of freedom. There are plenty of examples of msm being fake he doesn't have to lie or make them up. I think he is spending too much time reading extreme right wing news.

       Occasionally Fox speaks the unvarnished truth.  And it's not just Fox that is the problem--Alex Jones, Breitbart, et al. have some combination of inflammatory paranoid rants based on their biases, plus some truth that has been ignored or buried by the MSM.
