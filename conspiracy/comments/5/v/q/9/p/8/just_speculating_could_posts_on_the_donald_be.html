       what is this like the 'fake news' version of shills?
       <br/>
       The donald supporters really are that devoted, and probably misled. CTR is a response to an organic collection of crazy people who think they can make america great again. That's really fucking annoying that you would twist the situation. and it's painfully obvious. go back to

       maybe they would. but we know for a fact that the 'establishment' is a thing, and they were pushing Clinton with online shills. Do you deny Trump's popularity and the fact that he was elected?
       <br/>
       This seems like very obvious strategy to de-legitimize Trump online.

       Look I'm no Trump supporter, but you can't tell me he's an establishment candidate.
       <br/>
       Being 'of the establishment' is about foreign policy, military policy, military industrial policy, trade policy, financial policy. And to some degree, Trump policies are compatible with basic capitalist America. I'm not suggesting Trump is anti-capitalist. He's clearly a right-wing authoritarian who barely understands what it means to run public policy. But he's not 'of the establishment' of the last 30 - 40 years.
       <br/>
       I'm talking about the same establishment that runs drugs through CIA channels and yet claims to fight a war on drugs, who funds ISIS through Saudi Arabia and claims to fight a war on terror, who provides Israel with endless weapons to destroy Palestinians, who makes shit up about other countries, lies to Americans, assassinates political leaders foreign and domestic, and has generally fucked up this country for decades to come. Trump is not of the establishment. He's different, not necessarily better.

       I still don't see though why being anti establishment means you can't pay for upvotes, which is the crux of the thread.

       I'm italian living in italy, everyone here hates trump so maybe my views are a bit skewed. I find it hard to believe that he is liked in the us, his campaign was great (addressing the h1b workers problem alone would have won my vote had i been american) but his policies don't seem too great now

       First of all, why are my articles fake, but yours are real? Just because they confirm what you already thought?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, the Washington Times article doesn't even back up the 'millions of votes' claim. FTA: “Is it plausible that non-citizen votes account for the entire nation-wide popular vote margin held by Clinton? Not at all.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, the Investors article is entirely hypothetical. They claim that it could have happened, but don't offer any hard proof of voter fraud cases committed in such large numbers.

       They are all different views.  The electoral college breaks down votes to a state level people count.  It is interesting to see how the breakdown would be if it was on a county level.  Done that way, the results are pretty stunning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it is all just for conversation as the electoral college doesn't work on the county level.

       It certainly puts the kibosh on tard candidates who can't draw crowds or necessary votes as well as stops NY and California from choosing who will be president. Not broken at all.

        Any candidate who wins a majority or plurality of the popular vote nationwide has a good chance of winning in the Electoral College, but there are no guarantees (see the results of 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000 elections).

       It's not necessarily scientific but come on man...you can't say it's not a decent representation who is more popular. And maybe even the fact that trump won showed that maybe he was liked?

       It's not a decent representation because it's not a fair sample. Think about it, how many impoverished people actually go to rallies? Not very many, because they're living hand to mouth. But poor people are typically supportive of democrats, especially minorities. The point is that the sample is biased towards a certain demo, so it's not a good representation.

       I have no doubt that Trump is well-liked by a lot of people, but it would be disingenuous to pretend like it absolutely hated by a comparable amount of people.

       Donald supporters have amazing energy.  You could see it in the rallies, and it is digitized in his t-d sub.  He can travel to any venue in any state and fill it as has been proven.

      <p>
       He is liked, by a lot of people.  I am neutral to him, but I can visibly see that the hate for him is MSM based.  If they stopped the daily/hourly fear-based anti-trump rhetoric, maybe the average Joe could just calm down.

       It's the job of the media to be antagonistic to the administration when the President is being dishonest. It's an important feature.
