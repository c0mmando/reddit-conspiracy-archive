        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many are well aware, around 3 weeks to a month ago a pedophile ring consisting of 474 people was busted in California in a 3 day sting.</p>

<p>Yet, incredibly, not ONE SINGLE major news organization has even written an article about it - at least that&#39;s what a simple google search seems to reveal. What kind of fucking world do we even live in anymore, where shit like this goes uninvestigated publicly and hastily swept under the rug?</p>

<p>This really upsets me. What are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the arrests are John&#39;s looking for hookers. Yes children were involved but it&#39;s not a &quot;massive pedophile ring&quot; as you suggest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Detectives conducted “john” stings to target men and women involved in prostitution and posed online as juveniles to go after pedophiles.</p>

<p>In all, 28 children and 27 adult victims were rescued, the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. About 140 men were arrested for solicitation and 36 others on suspicion of pimping. In total, 474 people were arrested, authorities said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mat means that most of the arrests were actually hookers looking for johns. most of the other arrests were johns.</p>

<p>Most likely the &quot;28 children&quot; were prostitutes under the age of 18.  So a 17 year old prostitute is a victim, and her friend the 18 year old prostitute is a criminal working in &quot;human trafficking&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right- it&#39;s easily semantics.  They say &quot;child&quot; and you think about actual children.  If you&#39;re watching a video on pornhub, how the hell are you supposed to know if that&#39;s a 15 year old or a 23 year old?  You are at their whim.  My girlfriend gets carded all the time.</p>

<p>You have to be careful here, because law enforcement is sneaky AND they&#39;re running a PR game on you.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that EVERYONE in this situation is a victim.  Maybe they&#39;re a victim of the sex industry.  They&#39;re certainly a victim of laws which criminalize prostitution, and a system which makes a criminal record a permanent scarlet letter.</p>

<p>The New York Daily news did pick up the story.
<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/california-police-arrest-474-rescue-28-sexually-exploited-kids-article-1.2962303">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/california-police-arrest-474-rescue-28-sexually-exploited-kids-article-1.2962303</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Searches related to operation reclaim and rebuild&quot; has &quot;Searches related to operation reclaim and rebuild pizza gate&quot; on it, with many of the search results calling this a massive pedophile ring or referring to it as Pizzagate LA/California.</p>

<p>These operations happen on a fairly regular basis and most of the arrests are johns and hookers over the age of consent. This particular operation wasn&#39;t a bust targeting an massive organization, but 3 separate stings targeting individuals or groups.There were several pimps arrested as well, which is good as regardless of the age of the hooker, pimps are generally real bottom-feeding scum.</p>

<p>As far as major news networks, they rarely cover local crime. While CNN has many, many faults, they have maintained a dedicated special project to covering human trafficking with in depth articles and film pieces, links to charities that combat human trafficking, as well as hotlines for reporting human trafficking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/world/freedom-project">http://www.cnn.com/specials/world/freedom-project</a></p>

<p>This is a good story they did last year about a wounded veterans group that combats child predators.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/us/freedom-project-hero-corps/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/us/freedom-project-hero-corps/index.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The HERO -- Human Exploitation Rescue Operative -- program is designed for wounded, injured and ill veterans to receive training in sophisticated computer forensics, to join federal agents fighting against online child sexual exploitation. 
Developed by the National Association to Protect Children (Protect), in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), the veterans receive 11 weeks of intensive training and 10 months of on-the-ground experience.</p>

<p>They work alongside law enforcement teams executing warrants and serving as computer forensic analysts as part of a year-long unpaid internship. That means scanning computers and external hard drives on-site to determine whether the suspect possesses child pornography and, critically, whether the suspect is also producing child pornography.</p>
