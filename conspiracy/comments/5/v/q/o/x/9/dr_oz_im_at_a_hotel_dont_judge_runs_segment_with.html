<p>After commercial break</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wnat to talk to my audience about FAKE NEWS. Often hard to spot, they run articles like “Use this anti-aging cream” or &quot;Trump reports world record in golf!&quot; or</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That being was demystified by some of the content from the account of Corey Goode. Even if you can&#39;t believe him, contemplating what he said about an ancient AI that infests and controls beings like the Draco explains so much of what&#39;s going on here. I am not exaggerating.</p>

<p>I was so inspired by that description of that being that my mind was swimming in thought for days. It was a missing piece. We know there is something awful going on with the elites on this planet. I can answer the why of so many questions thanks to this piece. I can&#39;t help but type out long posts about what is going on here. Feel free to ask me something. I can make a plausible response to so many former mysteries now. Yet, I can&#39;t prove it. </p>

<p>The devil&#39;s (this AI) greatest trick is convincing mankind that he does not exist. He has the resources to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pure drivel. </p>

<p>Step one: Provide LOTS of shit that anyone with a rudimentary understanding of religious history already knows so that people reading can look it up and give yourself credibility.</p>

<p>Step two: Provide details of many weird occult sects from around the world (and this is crucial) without any context or nuance, just basically transcribe shit from a Jack Chick tract.</p>

<p>Step three: Use these very real things that you have connected through the natural ties that modern-day occult has to ancient occult (on purpose, mind you) to provide fake evidence connecting everything together. </p>

<p>See, if you do it this way, then by the time people get to step three, they already have bought into what you&#39;re saying because you&#39;ve listed a bunch of things that anyone can check on Wikipedia. So maybe there are people who will look at these extremely slipshod connections with a critical eye (yo) but there are plenty of others that don&#39;t actually know a damn thing about the stuff from step one and two, and they&#39;re already sold. And once you&#39;ve got them hooked, then they&#39;re ready to make even more unwieldy connections, all of which now handily lead back to occult concepts because you&#39;ve inexorably linked them to those things in their head.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind criticism, as long as it is constructive (as you&#39;ve already done).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The art world is the most common form of money laundering (and in placing value in objects) - pieces be damned. However, the Podestas collect those specific pieces as virtue-signalling. What we collect as &quot;Art&quot; is an extension of ourselves. We see a need for a certain piece because it evokes a memory within us that makes such an object worth collecting. Arguably, the entirety of the modern art movement, when it&#39;s not being co-opted by the CIA (cough cough Jackson Pollock), is nothing more than a circle-jerk. </p>

<p>As for the Occult, it&#39;s the globalist understanding of the Occult. The article was to establish the &quot;energies&quot; all cultures ascribe to (Chinese call it &quot;Chi&quot;, Christians call it &quot;Prayers / prayer healing&quot;, etc) - as well as to delineate a timeline / historical record as to how such occult practices came to be. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only factual result of that piece is that there have historically been people who believe weird shit that might otherwise seem normal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as I&#39;ve proven, it still goes on to this day, with Podesta, Alefantis, Clinton, etc. Every conspiracy theory has a kernel of truth. I didn&#39;t cover Pizzagate, I covered that kernel.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not incidental either. In roping someone into occult practices, you can create blackmail. You can then also, since you&#39;ve got them by the balls, teach them &quot;rituals&quot;, and with the vast amount of resources they acquire (thanks to you), they can then teach others &quot;rituals&quot;. The world, for a while, becomes their oyster - all of them interconnected by the Occult. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi43MZ-DPH4">They revel in the perverse, so what&#39;s one more vice for them</a>? </p>

<p>Additionally, many are roped in because they&#39;re curious or have something to hide. Sammy Davis Jr., for example, was considered to be gay. So he joined LeVay&#39;s Church of Satan. He shilled hard for that Church, even making a short film in that regard.</p>

<p>The statement shouldn&#39;t be: &quot;But I mean, anyone who&#39;s studied scientology could tell you that.&quot;. The statement should be: &quot;Why are Scientology / Mormonism / Illuminati / Ordo Templi Orientis / Temple of Set co-opting symbolism and methodology from Freemasonry, and why are our politicians so involved in it?&quot; </p>

<p><em>At the very least</em> John Podesta practices Spirit Cooking. Spirit Cooking is a modern take on the &quot;Cakes of Light&quot;. The Cakes are part of the religious cult Thelema, invented by Aleister Crowley. Crowley plagiarized most of his &quot;religion&quot; from Freemasonry (which doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the Occult). </p>
