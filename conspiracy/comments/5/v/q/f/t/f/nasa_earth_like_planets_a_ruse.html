        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are the odds that the NASA announcement of the 7 earth like planets is a ruse?<br/>
I feel like that since Trump is in office, the state run media clearly has a bias against him. So he could be legitimately trying to change things for the better. That has still yet to be seen though.  </p>

<p>But my line of thinking is this, if Hillary had won, we would probably be put into more wars/keep the current ideological oneâ€™s going(which the media seems to be doing now trying to separate everyone). As we know, wars bring in a TON of money into the economy from nothing. But without expanding them, how can the banks keep producing enough money to keep our(U.S.A.) economy afloat and the whole house of cards from falling down?   Space could be the answer. Now we shift peoples attention away from creating money for war abroad, to traveling the stars abroad. This lets money keep generating from nothing without being questioned. It also keeps the people in power with all of the money, in power.   Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you like to know? My mother worked for Lockheed&#39;s environmental sciences division, before they got busted for manipulating GCMS data and got blown out (I mention this because it is something verifiable that only someone like me would know offhand, and is verifiable without doxxing me specifically). While there, she worked with one lady that used to do something with satellite imagery, which has its own interesting story associated with it. But, that discussion was specifically about a bunch of books, pictures, and negatives that a guy gave my mother for me from all of the Mercury/Apollo missions, as well as a bunch of satellite imagery. My mom was quite the looker, and it wasn&#39;t unusual for guys to try to get to her by way of impressing her kids heh. </p>

<p>This came up in a conversation about the moon landing being faked. I have never been able to get on board with that theory, because I had all the pics and negatives, and hung out with lots of people that were involved in those projects, and it just isn&#39;t something that could be faked. At least, all those scientists would have had to be in the dark as well. </p>

<p>So, I kinda grew up around a bunch of scientists that worked for Lockheed, EG&amp;G, SAIC, ICF Kaiser, and the EPA. Lots of friends of family worked at the Nevada Test Site. Even knew a few guys that flew on the Janet flights, although I did not understand the significance of that until long after I lost touch with them. Never really thought about how interesting my childhood was until the other day, I kinda regret I didn&#39;t mine all of those scientists for information more than I did.</p>
