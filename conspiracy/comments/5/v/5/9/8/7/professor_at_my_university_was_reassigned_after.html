    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing, great story. I went to Catholic my entire life and the point of no return for me was my high school&#39;s &quot;banishment&quot; of the movie the &quot;13th Apostle&quot;. I vividly remember the principal saying the church was threatening members with excommunication! I had lost all interest in religion much earlier on but that I think that was the first time I saw censoring up close and personal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an English teacher in high school who had us read 1984 against the instructions of the school board...this was probably around the time they first started trying to ban the book in public schools. I will remember what he said for the rest of my life, he said &quot; So the school board has told me to drop this book from the curriculum, I&#39;m not going to do that, if there is one book in the world you should read it is this one, I don&#39;t care if they fire me, you all need to know this.&quot; This intrigued me of course and I read the book more intently than I had ever read before...that was his last year teaching...he now works the counter at a bait and tackle fishing shop.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not totally sure if it was just my state, or city, just my school or if it was a nationwide attempt. I&#39;m not even sure if they ever got away with banning it. It was my senior year at the time so I&#39;m not sure what happened after I graduated but he did end up getting fired that year. All I know for sure is what he said to us and than coupled with the fact that he was never allowed to teach again. I use to drop by the place he works to say hi but haven&#39;t in awhile.

<p>My boyfriend&#39;s dad was our literature teacher at the private school; he wound up getting fired and suffering a bipolar meltdown due to the stress of fighting a bunch of asshole administrators. Subsequently tore that family apart (divorce due to medical bills, mother sided with the school, etc.). Found out why the administration was so against a book that could teach someone to distrust authority, later (ha haaaaa  school-made pizza).</p>

<p>Public school just never had it on their curriculum at all, and no teacher ever brought it up. Although one of my social study teachers did suggest we read Animal Farm, so I guess that&#39;s a small favor.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a new thing to try and stifle Orwell in the education system at all, from what I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it technically is. I think it&#39;s more a pressure from &quot;higher up&quot; who discourage teachers from following their own curriculum. With the global agenda infiltrating the education system it seems likely they made the message clear from top down and the teachers were handled with like Mr. Anderson. If they don&#39;t go along they are fired, until all they have left are teachers willing to fall in line and do whatever they are told.</p>

Thousands of people have spoken out against the official narrative, its just that you generally don&#39;t hear about it because the media is controlled. And institutions are controlled, so if an &quot;authority&quot; figure (police officer, university professor, celeb, etc) decides to talk about it, their career is over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno about WTC7, but the two towers being dropped by the planes themselves seems plausible to me. </p>

<p>Mainly because it doesn&#39;t matter what really dropped them. Really it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>US intelligence let those terrorists into the country, Saudi intel seems to have helped them plan it, and then government figures helped those responsible get out of the coutry ASAP. </p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t enough it&#39;s common knowledge that the very same organisation that is said to have commited the attacks was armed, funded and trained by the CIA as a proxy against Russia. </p>

<p>To sum it up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>US intelligence involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Saudi intelligence involved</p></li>
<li><p>Perpetrated by a CIA proxy group. </p></li>
<li><p>Government action to get foreign nationals involved out of the country before a crackdown happened. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s no need for conspiracy to prove any of that. It&#39;s fact. The conclusion is still the same: The very people who are supposed to prevent that kind of thing happening are the same ones who colluded to make it happen. They are directly responsible and then they used it to justify waging war. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Even with only mainstream facts it was a false flag. What need is there for conspiracy?</p>

<p>And the specs on the LEM were not modified, i.e. they didn&#39;t make any overhauls to the equipment used on the mission, despite the fact that they were allegedly able to add a collapsed lunar rover to the LEM starting with Apollo 15 without changing the design of the lander. And the 32 kB mission computer was just as useless on A17 as it was on A11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Necklace is either CGI or visible floating for short times when they use parabolic flight trajectories to cause temporary weightlessness. By the way, the goofy hair is one of several ways we know at least some ISS footage is being faked one of which being BUBBLES escaping from space suits during &quot;space walks.&quot; And you&#39;re right, I think we can put people in orbit but you should watch some of these videos about ISS fakery on YouTube, it&#39;s absurd and stupid. </p>

<p>Put it this way, you&#39;re open to the Apollo hoax which has been exposed over and over again now, so it&#39;s not a stretch to think that NASA is still up to no good and up to their usual chicanery. These are the same people who say they put men on the moon in 1969 and then lost the footage of it and presented petrified wood to other countries and called them moon rocks. </p>

<p>It funds the shadow government. The inter connected web of billionaires. Now why would they just fake it all? Because it works.

    <div class="md"><p>I make a point of avoiding that subject when talking to people about 9/11, but privately I&#39;m very confused. The total lack of deceleration at impact <em>should</em> prove that the videos are fake, and the eyewitness accounts are suspect or contradictory.  But I can&#39;t really flesh out an alternative that feels plausible.</p>

<p>Likewise, the alleged foreknowledge in movies and TV is extremely convincing. I can&#39;t rationally dismiss <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lnoyH">this</a> as a simple coincidence, but I can&#39;t explain how they&#39;re connected. It makes me very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I think that goes for most references I see to coincidental clips of stuff for topics outside 9/11.</p>

<p>I mean, I agree it&#39;s spooky, but I think that&#39;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>All I can say is that I, coming from a technical background in mechanics,  find quite improbable that those buildings would collapse vertically, it was almost as they were imploded.</p>

<p>But a couple of things baffles me:</p>

<p>1) How could a large number of people say that they saw the planes? Mass hallucination? </p>

<p>2) If those planes didn&#39;t crashed the towers, what has happened to them? I find that&#39;s a lot of dirt to throw under the rug.</p>

<p>I think why so many don&#39;t believe 9/11 and are mesmerized by trying to make sense of the cognitive dissonance of it is because from a physics standpoint the official explanation contradicts the reality. So it&#39;s a battle of what you believe as it is influencing what you see.</p>

<p>Architects of the towers said they were made to withstand a 747? Something similar... but the point is, the speed and mass of the plane, yes it&#39;s heavy, But also fathom how heavy and well put together a 90 plus story building is. The building has more potential energy than the plane which in comparison is tiny. The building would of barely been penetrated, causing the plane into an accordion shape. </p>

<p>They can only show horrific gruesome things on television if it&#39;s fake. If you watch the Walking Dead they can show a person being decapitated and eviscerated with a katana. But if you watch the evening news you can&#39;t see any real blood. Unless of course the blood is fake, like in the Boston Marathon Bombing. And by showing a plane crashing into the building they would have been showing the violent horrific deaths of many people, some of whom would have been splattered along the side of the building -- <em>if</em> it were real, which it was not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;no planes hit WTC 1 &amp; 2&quot; is baseless, but it&#39;s easy to see how people can get swept up into thinking such things, as the official narrative was highly questionable.</p>

<p>Here are some details about that day which muddy the waters and possibly lead people to false conclusions, such as &quot;no planes hit those buildings&quot;.</p>

<p>The damage and wreckage at the Pentagon is not consistent with the size plane they claim hit it.  The flight path (the only flight data claimed to be recovered) and damage are in line with a smaller craft, possibly one operated remotely.
*Some say it wasn&#39;t a plane, but a missile that hit the Pentagon, but this is largely unsupported except for one blurry still image from a security camera.</p>

<p>The lack of wreckage in Pennsylvania, along with eyewitness testimony, point to a possible missile strike which took that plane down.  Several people (military vets) say they heard a rocket and one lady says she saw a smaller white plane in the area and her description matches military drones.
*Ground crews at the wreckage site say they could not find any remnants of an actual plane in the immediate aftermath.  They later claimed to have recovered 90% of the plane from the &quot;hole&quot; it crashed in, but this is highly suspicious of being false, especially considering the hole was already there and the remains of the plane are kept in secret.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if these facts got blended together somehow, but it is easy to see how people could be confused about the events of the day, especially someone who did not gather facts from multiple sources and rather heard a few things in passing and drew their own conclusions with no research to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go back and watch the news footage from that day again (courtesy of the Internet Archive) - each channel had an &quot;eye-witness&quot; on the ground who coincidentally happened to be an employee of that channel (so head of something at Fox on Fox News, head of something else at CNN on CNN etc.), If any &quot;real&quot; people phoned in the call was &quot;lost&quot; if they went off-script for a second. All the &quot;I saw a passenger plane&quot; witnesses were news channel employees. The less sure, &quot;it might have been a small plane&quot;, &quot;there was no plane but I heard explosions&quot; accounts were from actual people - the rest is down to Emperor&#39;s new clothes - &quot;everyone&quot; says they saw a plane, so other people say &quot;oh yeah, I saw it too&quot;.</p>

<p>As for the planes - some people say there&#39;s no proof they even took off that day... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple answer is he can&#39;t handle the truth. On some level he probably knows you are right but can&#39;t digest the hard truth of it all. It is too big, too painful to acknowledge. As a cop he probably views himself as the good guy but to acknowledge things like 9/11 conspiracies brings all those notions of being the good guy into question. Maybe he fears that he is just a servant or a slave to system that is inherently evil. Maybe he fears he is going to hell if you are right so he just buries it to the back of his mind and denies the truth through cognitive dissonance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the gist of it, it&#39;s just far too huge and the implications are just completely unbearable for some (most? Numbers are shrinking) people. I can imagine for a fundamentally decent person who&#39;s given all the best years, decades of their life to the system, like a cop or fireman, it&#39;s simply beyond their willingness to even consider. Everything they&#39;ve ever believed in or stood for would, by necessity, crumble. It&#39;s definitely not impossible as many have done it. But many more just will not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will probably get buried, but I just found <a href="http://www.mymcpl.org/blog/banned-books-week-presents-1984-george-orwell">this</a>. It&#39;s a very brief summary with a couple of links that may prove useful to someone. That is my 100 lvl biology professor (2004ish) in the pic! That was my first Google search result... Google is getting creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the second video is convincing. but isn&#39;t there a lot of space trash in our orbit bc of all the satellites and absconded projects and stuff? what if the &quot;bubbles&quot; are space trash? the thing that really shook me was the one bubble (it looked like a bubble the most) that was inside the ship. im still on the fence but it&#39;s very interesting, thank you.</p>
