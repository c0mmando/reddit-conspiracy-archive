<p>Guiliani apologized last Oct. for saying that Clinton had said she was in NYC on 9/11/2001<sup><sup><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rudy-giuliani-i-was-wrong-about-hillary-clinton-and-911-2016-10">[1]</a>.</sup></sup>  She wasn&#39;t<sup><sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton-9-11-attacks-response">[2]</a>.</sup></sup>  She was in DC because Congress was still in session<sup><sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton-9-11-attacks-response">[3]</a>.</sup></sup>  </p>

<p>But Guiliani was confused about an event that happened 16 yrs ago, because he was reminded about the event when Hillary had stated that she was in NYC on 9/11 in January of last year<sup><sup><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hillary-clinton-wrongly-says-she-was-in-nyc-on-911/article/2606229">[4]</a><a href="https://youtu.be/LhWwBH9Xflg?t=58">[5]</a><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-911/story?id=41946570">[6]</a><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/01/hillary-clinton-says-she-was-in-new-york-city-on-911-she-wasnt/">[7]</a><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/2/hillary-clinton-lies-say-she-was-nyc-911/">[8]</a>,</sup></sup> so the fake news is actually her fault.</p>

<p>But that didn&#39;t stop TIME MAGAZINE from defending Hillary Clinton with Fake news, <a href="http://time.com/4528425/clinton-giuliani-september-11-photo/"><em>&quot;Here&#39;s the Photo That Contradicts Rudy Guiliani&#39;s Criticism of Hillary Clinton&quot;</em></a></p>

<p>If you&#39;ll notice the byline of the photograph, it was taken on Sept 12, 2001!  Guiliani was correct.  She wasn&#39;t in NYC on 9/11.  She was in NYC on 9/12.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>9/11 is not 9/12.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article is a &#39;gotcha&#39;.  To catch and influence &quot;Skimmers&quot; who only read the headlines and look at the photograph and not the byline and not the content.  It&#39;s an insidious new type of propaganda that I&#39;m calling an <em>ad attention-unspanium</em>.  It&#39;s gross that our media has become so dishonest that they have to contradict themselves in a surreptitious, sneaky way for political points within the very same article!!</p>

<p>Some may say this is a technicality, but time matters, except when it&#39;s a publication that lies to you.  Why again was Guiliani forced to retract and apologize for remembering 9/11 correctly--when she did in fact state that she was in nyc on 9/11--when Senator Clinton was actually not in NYC but hanging out with her <em>real</em> friends in the State Dept?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>FakeNews is Mandela&#39;s Fault</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous articles debating Clinton&#39;s whereabouts on 9/11 back and forth, it&#39;s hard to know the objective material truths.  Maybe there&#39;s another way...</p>

<p>We could of course give Hillary Clinton the benefit of the doubt and assume she is telling the truth, by applying the ontological model of her being a split-clone of herself--a quantum anomaly responsible for the disturbance of the spacetime continuum that is the <del>Knights of Malta</del> <strong>Mandela Effect</strong> (Beren<em>stein/ain</em> Bears Effect) by <em>being in two places at once--DC and NYC.</em></p>

<p>I offer this reality-model because it wouldn&#39;t be the first time <a href="https://steemit.com/anarchy/@bigblackhawk/a-hologram-hillary-for-the-king-clinton-s-teleporter-accident-strategem-for-cass-sunstein-s-ministry-of-truth">Hillary Clinton Glitched in and out of our Consensus Reality</a></p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s really one of 2 things, which I leave up to you to decide for yourself: </p>

<ul>
<li>Clinton is the CIA&#39;s own Liar, and this subversive network of immature journalists who support her unquestioningly need to rekindle their relationship with facts again.</li>
<li>Preposterous Reality Shift in the Cosmological Constants of the Universe</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, Clinton did say she was in NYC on 9/11 and the media reported on Guiliani&#39;s comment unfairly.  One small correction though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when Senator Clinton was actually not in NYC but hanging out with her real friends in the State Dept?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was in the Senate, not the State Dept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;At that moment, my cell phone went off and it was my older brother, Mike, who&#39;s an attorney in Milwaukee, and he
wanted to make sure that I was in D.C., and not in New York. I hung up the phone, and the news suddenly said the
Pentagon had been attacked. And at that moment, like a lot of people, I had no idea whether the White House or the</p>

<p>Capitol or monuments or anything else might be attacked. My cell phone went off again. It was Mike again, and he said,
&quot;Get the hell out of there!&quot; I said, &quot;Bro&#39;, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m thinking just like you!&quot;</p>

<p>So I went down on the street-the corner on the Union Station side-to try to find a cab. People were crowding into cabs, and
hundreds of people seemed to come up. I&#39;d only started walking, maybe 3o yards, when I heard a familiar voice yell, &quot;Gene
Sperling! Gene Sperling, get in the car!&quot;</p>

<p>I looked up and I saw a silver car, and I was confused because all I could see were two large men in the front seat. And I
finally saw that on the other side there was a woman yelling to me. It was Mrs. Clinton. I think they were less than thrilled
that Mrs. Clinton was stopping at all; these are moments when the Secret Service has a mission to get her to a protected
area. She asked me where I was going. I said Dupont Circle, but I could walk. She insisted. I get in-it was right on the way.
It was a car ride I&#39;ll never forget. She was the first person I was really sharing this horrible, horrible day with. And you
could see the different roles in her life.&quot;</p>
