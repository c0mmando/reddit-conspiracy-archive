      <p>
       But that didn't stop TIME MAGAZINE from defending Hillary Clinton with Fake news,
       <a href="http://time.com/4528425/clinton-giuliani-september-11-photo/">
        <em>
         "Here's the Photo That Contradicts Rudy Guiliani's Criticism of Hillary Clinton"
        </em>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll notice the byline of the photograph, it was taken on Sept 12, 2001!  Guiliani was correct.  She wasn't in NYC on 9/11.  She was in NYC on 9/12.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        9/11 is not 9/12.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This article is a 'gotcha'.  To catch and influence "Skimmers" who only read the headlines and look at the photograph and not the byline and not the content.  It's an insidious new type of propaganda that I'm calling an
       <em>
        ad attention-unspanium
       </em>
       .  It's gross that our media has become so dishonest that they have to contradict themselves in a surreptitious, sneaky way for political points within the very same article!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may say this is a technicality, but time matters, except when it's a publication that lies to you.  Why again was Guiliani forced to retract and apologize for remembering 9/11 correctly--when she did in fact state that she was in nyc on 9/11--when Senator Clinton was actually not in NYC but hanging out with her
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       friends in the State Dept?
      </p>

       <strong>
        FakeNews is Mandela's Fault
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous articles debating Clinton's whereabouts on 9/11 back and forth, it's hard to know the objective material truths.  Maybe there's another way...
      </p>
      <p>
       We could of course give Hillary Clinton the benefit of the doubt and assume she is telling the truth, by applying the ontological model of her being a split-clone of herself--a quantum anomaly responsible for the disturbance of the spacetime continuum that is the

       Aside from this, I also think it was shown with many side-by-side photos during the campaign that there was more than one 'Hillary'... Including the day she collapsed 9/11/16, in which there were two distinct individuals acting as Hillary, with different body types and facial features.

       You are right, Clinton did say she was in NYC on 9/11 and the media reported on Guiliani's comment unfairly.  One small correction though:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when Senator Clinton was actually not in NYC but hanging out with her real friends in the State Dept?
       </p>

       She was in the Senate, not the State Dept.

       "At that moment, my cell phone went off and it was my older brother, Mike, who's an attorney in Milwaukee, and he
wanted to make sure that I was in D.C., and not in New York. I hung up the phone, and the news suddenly said the
Pentagon had been attacked. And at that moment, like a lot of people, I had no idea whether the White House or the
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitol or monuments or anything else might be attacked. My cell phone went off again. It was Mike again, and he said,
"Get the hell out of there!" I said, "Bro', don't worry, I'm thinking just like you!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went down on the street-the corner on the Union Station side-to try to find a cab. People were crowding into cabs, and
hundreds of people seemed to come up. I'd only started walking, maybe 3o yards, when I heard a familiar voice yell, "Gene
Sperling! Gene Sperling, get in the car!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked up and I saw a silver car, and I was confused because all I could see were two large men in the front seat. And I
finally saw that on the other side there was a woman yelling to me. It was Mrs. Clinton. I think they were less than thrilled
that Mrs. Clinton was stopping at all; these are moments when the Secret Service has a mission to get her to a protected
area. She asked me where I was going. I said Dupont Circle, but I could walk. She insisted. I get in-it was right on the way.
It was a car ride I'll never forget. She was the first person I was really sharing this horrible, horrible day with. And you
could see the different roles in her life."
