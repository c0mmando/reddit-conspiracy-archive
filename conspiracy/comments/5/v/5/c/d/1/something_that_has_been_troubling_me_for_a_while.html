        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As I&#39;m sure everyone is aware, this sub has been flooded with shills in the last few months aiming to disrupt and deflect regular discussion topics and marginalise people with interests in conspiracies (or aspects of human society which are not purely surface-level).</p>

<p>What I struggle to come to terms with, is how the process of recruiting shills does not end up becoming a mass-redpill for those approached? If you were recruited to viciously refute any evidence of wealthy/powerful pedophile rings - but weren&#39;t actually provided with anything which <strong>could</strong> refute it effectively, wouldn&#39;t you automatically assume that there is something nefarious afoot? Wouldn&#39;t you realise you are muddying the waters in aid of pedophiles?</p>

<p>I really struggle with this aspect of the shilling industry, the idea that I could approach someone and say &quot;if anyone mentions Epstein being a pedophile and his deep and multifaceted connections with other pedophiles, it&#39;s your job to find someway of confusing the discussion or changing the subject&quot; would you not instantly see what is going on?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t get paid well for shilling at all (compared to the damage they are required to cause to humanity-at-large, including future generations) so I wonder how this isn&#39;t one massive redpill? </p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea what I am talking about?</p>

I guess these &quot;shills&quot; could be provided a list of pre written responses and could be tasked with using search tools to auto respond to a large number of buzz words. Shill responses rarely seem well thought out. Sorta like a &quot;Chinese room&quot; type of situation where they don&#39;t necessarily need to understand what&#39;s being said?</p>

<p>The system (school) is built to churn out people than can memorize information that&#39;s fed to them. That makes people appear intelligent, when really they are just talking encyclopedias at that point. Then they&#39;re spoonfed information through MSM talking heads and institutionalized religion, and never really have to parse and analyze data. Then when/if they finally do try to analyze data, that analysis will likely be skewed based on that spoonfed mainstream political and religious ideology. Lots if barriers to break through before you can even attempt to search for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the answer in a way is board culture.</p>

<p>We are much kinder to people here than say our counterpart /pol/. Pol is extremely aggressive in regulating the norm or &#39;board culture&#39; and anyone who doesn&#39;t get that or the already established general knowledge gets no help. You can&#39;t really post with them in cognito until you more or less behave like them; essentially joining the hive. Anonymity also lends a hand because pol is uniform in thinking and the shills can&#39;t coordinate as well as they can on reddit without usernames/votes.</p>

<p>I would say 4chan probably gets higher shill conversion rates because of this. </p>

<p>It is strange you can&#39;t find recruiting drives or CL posts and it does bring the shills morality into question. I&#39;m not ready to rule out the advanced ai scenerio.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t hear about any shill defectors; Monsanto, ctr, SB: nothing. And that&#39;s weird. Also no trace of how they recruit. How can we be sure it&#39;s even a person? Because of the payroll?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s either a small cohesive group of people or somehwat advanced AI, possibly both to get the effect.</p>

<p>AI can focus on keywords and parrot shill arguments creating a sense of organic discussion and should an apologist show up it&#39;s likely a human shill would take over and be supported by the bots appearing to &#39;win&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a couple floating around some time ago but who knows if any of it is legitimate.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t hear about any shill defectors; Monsanto, ctr, SB: nothing. And that&#39;s weird. Also no trace of how they recruit. How can we be sure it&#39;s even a person? Because of the payroll?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s either a small cohesive group of people or somehwat advanced AI, possibly both to get the effect.</p>

<p>AI can focus on keywords and parrot shill arguments creating a sense of organic discussion and should an apologist show up it&#39;s likely a human shill would take over and be supported by the bots appearing to &#39;win&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What actual proof is there that a shilling industry operates within this sub? Can anyone provide any evidence?</p>

<p>You cannot simply assume that people who disagree with you are paid to deflect discussion. I find it more likely that they just have differing opinions, or that they haven&#39;t done enough research and are making assumptions based on their pre-existing bias.</p>

<p>I know that Ive personally been called a shill a couple of times on here, simply for questioning the validity of someones sensationalist claims. I find it quite sad that some conspriacy followers have this tunnel-vision where everything they believe is 100% the truth and if you disagree you&#39;re automatically a sheep/troll/shill. Its a kind of &quot;thought-terminating cliche&quot; process where they can automatically dismiss any genuine questions about flaws in their theory and ride off on their high horse telling themselves they are &quot;awake&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a seeker of truth, they should welcome healthy skepticism (I mean genuine criticism, but obviously not insults).</p>

<p>On another note, as someone else here mentioned, if there actually are accounts deflecting convos... they could be just bots/AI, which would explain why they dont give a shit.</p>

<p>Tl;dr please provide proof of shilling industry operating in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s talk about Science as one example.  There is a difference between science as an epistemology and Science as an institution.  The latter exists for two purposes: (1) to advance the technical capabilities of the corporate/state borg; and (2) to promote <em>scientism</em>, which is essentially a religion of materiality/&quot;physicalism&quot;.  The folks that are engaged in objective #2 are your high-school teachers and university professors.  They have gone through years of education to do exactly that, and through that education process, all other intellectual faculties have atrophied in order to be able to work in one narrow band of consciousness.  So they become evangelists of a lie they can&#39;t even see anymore.</p>

<p>I imagine it works that way for all so-called shills:  they&#39;ve already drunk the kool-aid, and everything is kept neatly compartmentalized in their heads, with cognitive dissonance buffering any friction that might result when two contradictory ideas are juxtaposed.</p>

<p>That said, I think there are far fewer paid &quot;shills&quot; in this sub than people complain about.</p>
