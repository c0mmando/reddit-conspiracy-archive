       If your the leader of our country you shouldn't fuck up on that kind of scale on three different occasions within the first three weeks on the job. And if it's a case of misinformation then he needs to reevaluate all the corrupt fucks he's hired into his cabinet. That or he actually needs to go to a briefing instead of just watching the news and tweeting.

       My idea is that Trump is aware of planned false flag events. And he is making himself look stupid by making comments about these before they happen. Think about it if you were planning a false flag and then all of a sudden it was announced you couldn't go through with it. Or it would raise more questions. I have no evidence that this is what is happening but if I am correct it is a great strategy

       Three guys raping a woman and taking video is despicable. But if we are going to call that a terrorist attack then Brock Turner and American fraternities are some of the most active terrorists cells in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like people were arrested in bowling green for a plot. The trump campaign has exaggerated the hell out of these events trying to scare people.

       If our pussy grabber in chief wants to unite the world in making rape happen less I'm all for it. I'm sure the secret service agents constantly surrounding him are decreasing rape cases already.

       But trying to pretend this is the terrorists attack that 'happened last night' that trump was referencing is a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's a great straw man. But it doesn't really answer why trump and his team seem to be inventing terrorist attacks to talk about.

       You got a quote from Donald saying it was a terrorist attack?  He was talking about what he saw on television and he never said anything about a terrorist attack.  If you read something that said something about a terrorist attack, then I'm sorry friend, you were misinformed.

       "You look at whats happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with half a brain can understand that he's talking about immigrants doing bad things, why the fuck would he say "Sweden! They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible" if he wasn't trying to push his immigration agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sweden has had a number of grenade attacks over the last four years, but literally none of them have been linked to immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is simply trying to push his agenda here, and he gets people like you defending him if he doesn't explicitly say "THEY HAD A TERRORIST ATTACK LAST NIGHT!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Please inform me in what the fuck he was talking about when he said "You look at what's happening last night in Sweden" because blindly defending him isn't helping anyone here.

       What amazes me is that him admitting to sexual assault didn't immediately disqualify him within his own party, as in 'let's call a sheriff and have this jackass arrested on assault charges' disqualified.  Also that Melania didn't defenestrate him out Trump Tower the night that video aired.  Also that his early-on submission of a 'physical exam letter' from his 'gastroenterologist' didn't get him laughed out of the country, since it was so obviously written by him, no matter what the Manhattan pill-pusher says.  How many times do we have to go over the utter and glaring fact that Donald is a criminal, a pathological liar, and subhuman?

       That may be exactly how he 'makes America great again' - he's awakened dozens of sleeping beast voting blocs all over the country, who are never going to take 'business as usual' for granted again in their lifetimes.  I have a saying, that 'the internet is electronic telepathy' - because it allows us to know what other people are thinking globally in real time, and coordinate activities with them.  That's a catalyst for change that is supercharged compared to whatever has come before.  It took starving peasants to storm the Bastille; I wonder how much anger it will take to storm the WH and Congress...

       If you actually researched each specific attack you'll realize that immigrants aren't the ones doing the bombings.

       Do some research, it's gang based for the most part, I don"t feel like pulling up the articles but literally none of the attacks were from refugees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find me one attack that's been proven to be caused by an immigrant. We can't keep blaming certain demographics for the bad shit that happens in the world, its how we divide ourselves as a species and get into terrible situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it makes you sleep better to know that all the grenade attacks were caused by refugees go ahead and believe what you want.

       Us Swedes just magically started throwing handgranades right when the migrant crisis happened. Crazy coincidence.
And no I know they aren't "refugees". They are the second generation of "refugees".

      <p>
       By the way, if your life is in danger you won't make your way through multiple safe countries til you reach the one of the most northern countries in Europe.
They are economic migrants.

       Except you can't exactly compare "rape statistics" across multiple EU countries because they all have unique laws and interpretations of "rape." Remember your hero Assange is wanted on "rape" charges in Sweden with two different women over the alleged use of a condom-- two separate events each classified as rape despite the actual sex being consensual.

       They categorise many things as rape that other places don't. They count rape accusations rather than convictions, unlike most other places.

       More how it's just bad policy. It was rolled out in a sloppy fashion that displayed a lack of communication with necessary players. And it's just a play to his base. This policy won't keep America safe and it distracts us from talking about issues that actually matter.
      </p>

       If you think muslims immigrating to America is the threat to our country the president needs to be addressing right now, I have to question what the hell kind of reasoning leads to that conclusion.

       Illegal immigration is a straw man. Technological advancement will continue to displace American workers at a much higher rate than illegal immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how to solve the immigration problem? Crack down on business paying cash to avoid taxes and tax any employee in the states regardless of country of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jobs illegals take are readily available to Americans too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey. If you think I'm wrong. If illegal immigration is a huge problem. Change my mind. But of the pressing problems America needs to deal with. I just don't see illegal immigration any where close to the top.

       Rapes literally happen hundreds of times on an hourly basis, uploads/videos of said rapes are sure to happen frequently too, doesn't make it a terror attack or a news item that pushes your immigration agenda

       Nope, but keep taking the bait.  As you look more deeply into the decline of Swedish society at the hands of certain refugee criminals, remember you're learning about the world because of the words of "an idiot."

       You have to understand that people aren't perfect. Not everything can be a perfect script. Trump from what I've seen isn't that great a speaker in the first place. Choice of words etc., and sometimes mistakes happens, with everyone, including the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is that this doesn't have to be a conspiracy, it might just be, in my opinion a rather small, error, and the whole thing was blown majorly out of proportion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, can you expand on what you mean by him causing the decline of American society? As I see and interpret this situation, he is saving it, so do you care to explain further? I see more jobs incoming, national pride on the rise, a better NATO on the horizon, and a potentially better relationship with Russia. Are these things somehow negative?
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition I'd like to know what you mean when you call the guy an idiot, questioning whether or not he's on the verge of being labeled incompetent? His track-record shows him as a rather succesful businessman, he also managed to win the election with a lot of major media organizations working blatantly against him and in favor of his opponent, doesn't that show the slightest form of competence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious to know your reasoning behind this and why your opinion about him is seemingly largely negative.

       I understand bad speakers making mistakes. In this instance you have spicy, Conway, and trump (probably others I'm forgetting) referencing nonexistent events. To me that goes beyond mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest...
      </p>
      <p>
       Decline of American society. Trump's message is largely one of fear. 'Inner city crime' 'terrorists slipping through immigration to get us' etc. data, facts, reality just don't support his narrative. In addition to being completely anti intellectual. This guy thinks climate change is a hoax and investing in science is a waste of money. Our future is literally tied to alternative energy or some other kind of future technology and trump is driving that investment overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as idiot and incompetent. Trump has filed bankruptcy 3 or 4 times. After owning 2 or 3 casinos on the same block he decides to open another?! From the early 90s until now literally no western bank would lend him money. This is the start of when he had to start going to Russia, China and the Middle East with his hand out. He has stiffed so many contractors it is hard to believe. I actually know two family businesses personally affected by this. (He likes to make excuses about the quality of work but the sheer volume of this pattern exposes his tactic and it's abusive bully bullshit).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as winning the election. 11 million more people voted against him than for him. Fake news, Russian hacking and Hillary fear-mongering just barely swung the needle in his favor in terms of the electoral college. That is definitely an accomplishment. The guy has definitely done things with his life. It's the how that rubs me wrong. He is an abusive thug. He tears people down and always goes for the lowest common denominator - plays to people's fears and hate. This is incompetent leadership. You can't build anything from here as his last 4 weeks have shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as bringing in jobs. This is laughable. Robots are going to replace workers at a faster and faster pace. Anyone not talking about universal basic income, restructuring our economy or some other future based idea rather than 'I'll bring your coal mining jobs and manufacturing back' is short sighted and... an idiot or incompetent. He'd rather lie and tell people what they want to hear then give them the hard truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Russia. What's going to happen to all that frozen tundra 1.5 times as big as the USA when global temperatures continue to rise? What happens when everyone is fighting amongst themselves while Putin does whatever he wants. Putin is a KGB spy master and he has his hands in trump's cookie jar. Just look at donny's contradictory and fawning statements. Putin is playing 4D chess and America is going to continue to be diminished if we continue to fall for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on. But if trump as president doesn't scare the living shit out of you. I honestly don't think you're informed or paying attention.

       They are laying as many falsehoods as they can spew to muddy the waters.  There is no way in hell anyone actually thought he would win.  They are now trying to do as much damage as possible before the inevitable impeachment.  The actual politicians in the GOP are simply putting up with it until he finally crosses some moral line they can get behind and impeach him.  And then they have a rented mule for a commander in chief and full control of the government.

       This is an actual conspiracy.  Russia has managed to  handjob a literal fascist idiot into the US presidency.  They didn't even want that.  But they have it.  And now they're turning up the intensity.

       Atl was a mispoke, Spicer corrected himself to orlando

      <p>
       Sweden wasn't called a terrorist attack, he was referring to the letting in of migrants, and how much crime has shot up, especially rape.

        After the FBI received the intelligence tip later that year, a sting operation in Kentucky was mounted to bait Alwan with a scheme hatched by an undercover operative recruited by the FBI, who offered Alwan the opportunity to ship heavy arms to al Qaeda in Iraq. The FBI wanted to know if Alwan was part of a local terror cell -- a fear that grew when he tapped a relative also living in Bowling Green, Hammadi, to help out.

        I think that these two individuals are innately evil to be able to act as a terrorist and attack and kill American soldiers, then have the balls to come over to the United States and try to do the same exact thing here in our homeland.

       Dude this shit was on my local news and they interviewed the neighbors, I can't find the exact video, but letting in people who planted IEDs is not cool.... They were charged with their war crimes and trying to send weapons back to iraq to be used against our people. Which is fucking terrorism...

       To be fair to trump, he apparently said "the situation in Sweden"... the whole 'attack' thing was added by the media and commenters. It's still debatable if there is a situation in Sweden, but it adds a little more context to the comments.

       He gets his information from Fox News and interview guests whose work has been debunked. He uses this to form his world view and screams "fake news" at anything that doesn't fit his narrative because admitting he made a mistake would break his fragile ego.

       So he calls the mainstream media fake news, everyone gets mad, and then it turns out a bunch of MSM outlets produce fake news? Fox is as bad as the others. I find it funny though that the fake news stuff is glossed over. I think we should all be paying attention to the news wherever it comes from and we should be testing things like that. You can't take any outlet at their word anymore, regardless of your leanings

       Look, I get it, you guys need to twist and distort reality in order to fit your narrative. The reality is the person most often lying as Trump himself. Or his surrogates.

       i'm not twisting anything. i'm saying the reality is a shade of grey rather than white/black. you're the one over-stating things and being sure of things you cannot possibly be sure about. I think Trump is trying to do a good job, but its like a kid getting bullied at school. Everything he says is taken as the worst possible version of what he was trying to say. Everyone is hanging on his every move to jump all over him when he makes a mistake. It's totally out of balance, and that's what I value most.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote for Trump, but I will give the man the respect of fairness. That isn't happening right now. You can go and justify it however you want, but people are being destructive towards their own situation. I am willing to work and move forward even when I don't totally get my way, which many others clearly struggle with.

       Actually reality is pretty black and white. That's the great thing about facts and data!
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific observation shows us:
Global warming is happening and human activities are the cause.
More American Christian terrorists kill Americans than Muslim immigrants.
Robotics and technological innovation have killed more American jobs than illegal immigrants.
Our country has been literally built by refugees. Reference the Statue of Liberty.

       Trump lies, he constantly peddles fear and false narratives to play to the lowest common denominator of his base.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you'd like him to have a special space bubble where people give him a chance. How much respect did the cheeto in charge have for obama? How about we take a page from lil donnie's book and respect him at the same level?

       Wow. Reality is not black and white. Facts are black and white, but facts are only proofs for the conditions they were tested in. If the variables change, science breaks down, and very few things in this world stay exactly the same. So science is immeasurably valuable, but it cannot answer a certain set of questions because it is too constrictive. Take consciousness for example - we don't really understand all of the science about it, yet we study it as an entire subject (psychology). It's more nuanced than you are trying to make it out to be.

       That is not fact. That is the media's role - not Trumps. You are attributing the words of the media to somebody else - that is not fair and it's non-scientific. The media is what is pushing fear and false narratives for the most part. Tell me one thing that Trump has done that has actually affected your life to this point... yet he's destroying the world. Can't you see the hyperbole?

       Obama definitely faced a lot of bullshit as well, but never to this level. The birther stuff was also more under-the-radar than the mainstream media assault of today. I just don't think it's balanced, and it makes me distrust the message. I filter what they say as if i'm listening to a bitchy high school girl telling me about her ex's new girlfriend.

       I almost wish lil Donnie had even this level of sophistication in his thinking. At least he would be acting intentionally.

       He was literally just parroting some bs debunked other moron he heard on Fox News. Our cheeto in charge doesn't actually KNOW things. He just huffs and puffs and gleefully giggles at what falls over.

       That's actually a really plausible answer I hadn't thought of. Apparently this administration isn't interested in intelligent briefings from you know intelligence agencies. So the lists they're passing around could have started on breitbart in all likelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they truly don't even know the difference. As close as we can tell from observation lil Donnie is either functionally illiterate or has a severe form of dyslexia preventing him from really understanding what he reads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likelihood of documents floating around based on our cheeto in charge dictating rambling thoughts to his halfway competent sycophantic advisers and those documents getting mixed up is probably pretty high.

       More how it's just bad policy. It was rolled out in a sloppy fashion that displayed a lack of communication with necessary players. And it's just a play to his base. This policy won't keep America safe and it distracts us from talking about issues that actually matter.

       If you think muslims immigrating to America is the threat to our country the president needs to be addressing right now, I have to question what the hell kind of reasoning leads to that conclusion.
