    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that people aren&#39;t perfect. Not everything can be a perfect script. Trump from what I&#39;ve seen isn&#39;t that great a speaker in the first place. Choice of words etc., and sometimes mistakes happens, with everyone, including the president.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that this doesn&#39;t have to be a conspiracy, it might just be, in my opinion a rather small, error, and the whole thing was blown majorly out of proportion.</p>

<p>Also, can you expand on what you mean by him causing the decline of American society? As I see and interpret this situation, he is saving it, so do you care to explain further? I see more jobs incoming, national pride on the rise, a better NATO on the horizon, and a potentially better relationship with Russia. Are these things somehow negative?</p>

<p>In addition I&#39;d like to know what you mean when you call the guy an idiot, questioning whether or not he&#39;s on the verge of being labeled incompetent? His track-record shows him as a rather succesful businessman, he also managed to win the election with a lot of major media organizations working blatantly against him and in favor of his opponent, doesn&#39;t that show the slightest form of competence?</p>

<p>Curious to know your reasoning behind this and why your opinion about him is seemingly largely negative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand bad speakers making mistakes. In this instance you have spicy, Conway, and trump (probably others I&#39;m forgetting) referencing nonexistent events. To me that goes beyond mistakes.</p>

<p>As for the rest... </p>

<p>Decline of American society. Trump&#39;s message is largely one of fear. &#39;Inner city crime&#39; &#39;terrorists slipping through immigration to get us&#39; etc. data, facts, reality just don&#39;t support his narrative. In addition to being completely anti intellectual. This guy thinks climate change is a hoax and investing in science is a waste of money. Our future is literally tied to alternative energy or some other kind of future technology and trump is driving that investment overseas.</p>

<p>As far as idiot and incompetent. Trump has filed bankruptcy 3 or 4 times. After owning 2 or 3 casinos on the same block he decides to open another?! From the early 90s until now literally no western bank would lend him money. This is the start of when he had to start going to Russia, China and the Middle East with his hand out. He has stiffed so many contractors it is hard to believe. I actually know two family businesses personally affected by this. (He likes to make excuses about the quality of work but the sheer volume of this pattern exposes his tactic and it&#39;s abusive bully bullshit).</p>

<p>As far as winning the election. 11 million more people voted against him than for him. Fake news, Russian hacking and Hillary fear-mongering just barely swung the needle in his favor in terms of the electoral college. That is definitely an accomplishment. The guy has definitely done things with his life. It&#39;s the how that rubs me wrong. He is an abusive thug. He tears people down and always goes for the lowest common denominator - plays to people&#39;s fears and hate. This is incompetent leadership. You can&#39;t build anything from here as his last 4 weeks have shown.</p>

<p>As far as bringing in jobs. This is laughable. Robots are going to replace workers at a faster and faster pace. Anyone not talking about universal basic income, restructuring our economy or some other future based idea rather than &#39;I&#39;ll bring your coal mining jobs and manufacturing back&#39; is short sighted and... an idiot or incompetent. He&#39;d rather lie and tell people what they want to hear then give them the hard truth.</p>

<p>As far as Russia. What&#39;s going to happen to all that frozen tundra 1.5 times as big as the USA when global temperatures continue to rise? What happens when everyone is fighting amongst themselves while Putin does whatever he wants. Putin is a KGB spy master and he has his hands in trump&#39;s cookie jar. Just look at donny&#39;s contradictory and fawning statements. Putin is playing 4D chess and America is going to continue to be diminished if we continue to fall for it. </p>

<p>I could go on and on. But if trump as president doesn&#39;t scare the living shit out of you. I honestly don&#39;t think you&#39;re informed or paying attention. </p>

<p>After the FBI received the intelligence tip later that year, a sting operation in Kentucky was mounted to bait Alwan with a scheme hatched by an undercover operative recruited by the FBI, who offered Alwan the opportunity to ship heavy arms to al Qaeda in Iraq.

</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Reality is not black and white. Facts are black and white, but facts are only proofs for the conditions they were tested in. If the variables change, science breaks down, and very few things in this world stay exactly the same. So science is immeasurably valuable, but it cannot answer a certain set of questions because it is too constrictive. Take consciousness for example - we don&#39;t really understand all of the science about it, yet we study it as an entire subject (psychology). It&#39;s more nuanced than you are trying to make it out to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump lies, he constantly peddles fear and false narratives to play to the lowest common denominator of his base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not fact. That is the media&#39;s role - not Trumps. You are attributing the words of the media to somebody else - that is not fair and it&#39;s non-scientific. The media is what is pushing fear and false narratives for the most part. Tell me one thing that Trump has done that has actually affected your life to this point... yet he&#39;s destroying the world. Can&#39;t you see the hyperbole?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much respect did the cheeto in charge have for obama?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama definitely faced a lot of bullshit as well, but never to this level. The birther stuff was also more under-the-radar than the mainstream media assault of today. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s balanced, and it makes me distrust the message. I filter what they say as if i&#39;m listening to a bitchy high school girl telling me about her ex&#39;s new girlfriend.</p>
