       For anyone on the fence on thinking that Elite Status Pedophilia Groups are real I suggest you listen to Episode 5 &amp; 6 or Sword and Scale.  These were produced 3 years ago and examine the Franklin Boys sex scandal.  The stories and real evidence inside this podcast will erase any doubt you might have regarding elite pedo rings and the role the CIA and politicians play.
      </p>
      <p>
       After listening to both episodes today and learning more about how these elites operate and the very very tight nature of their inner pedo circle o have no doubt the original PG investigators were on to something HUGE with Podesta.  IMO parts of that initial investigation shook the elites and they have now decided the best way to combat PG is to make those that believe in its existence look crazy (common tactic). They have done this through the media but are now focused online.  They are putting up rediculous pieces of so called evidence that send people running in circles while at the same time dominating converstaion online to make it appear as if all who believe in an elite pedo ring are crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to take down an elite pedo ring we must stay focused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please listen to Episode 5 and 6 of Sword and Scale on any podcast service. It is purely investigative. look at the connections and how these people operate. The best part is this seems be be 100 non partisan and instead realize only on facts gathered not wild claims.

       What is there to focus on though? There have been countless scandals confirmed, but the more everyone digs the more obvious it is that police will not prosecute unless they have an 80-year old man in black robes with his cock in a 3 year old while chanting whatever weird ritual shit they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We dug, and we found that adoption agencies are corrupt, foster care agencies are corrupt, daycares are corrupt, schools are corrupt, courts are corrupt, churches are corrupt, charities are corrupt, it's a MESS. I'm not sure what there is to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess, if it were me, I would vocalize to people how politicians are members of secret societies, like the Knights of Pythias with Weiner and Chuck Schumer or the Order of St. Hubertus which was apparently freaked out after Scalia told them their pedo ring was over (plus John Podesta's clear "wet works" hitman email). Those are public affiliations, they're on Wikipedia. Make them believe that elite live a totally different life than you, born into secret societies with secret oaths that declare they are the masters and the rest of humanity is cattle, we're the Muggles literally (that's what they call us, no joke).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it makes me wonder if the whole world needs to burn.

       The key is to find a victim. This has been in operation for some time so many of these people are in there 30-40s by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the BIG THING MISSING. There is now crime yet in which to investigate. Find some victims and listen to them. They will know alot more about the inner workings than posting Worldcorp Videos, Sara Silver man and JK Rowling nonsense

       There have been dozens of victims. The victims tell tons of stories. Implicated all kinds of people, there's been so many scandals were it isn't just a few kids telling the odd story, it's 30-50 accusations against one person - look at Dennis Hastert, Jerry Sandusky, Jeffrey Epstein. We
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       the victims, they
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       the proof, but it doesn't matter. They just corrupt the judge and get the charges brought to nothing, usually making illegal plea deals violating the rights of the abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, we have hundreds of missing kids in Virginia that we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       are being snatched, but they could be getting snatched by the foster care, police, churches, freemasons, satanists, medical care, teachers, who the fuck knows there are a million ways that a kid goes missing. Especially foster children. Most of those Virginia missing kids didn't even get a picture posted of them - that's not an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we don't need a smoking gun because
       <strong>
        we know law enforcement already has it
       </strong>
       . It's not like our evidence is going to court. So it's purely a matter of actually forcing prosecution to do something. Our job is convincing the public and it's already working, slowly enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, if it goes on long enough, people will start to take it into their own hands. Vigilante justice isn't pretty and always ends up badly, but people will be pushed to it if they are convinced enough. Something will break if public opinion changes and law enforcement doesn't.

       Wow, OP, thank you for referring us to those Sword and Scale podcasts. There is SO much more damning evidence in there than in the Conspiracy of Silence video.
      </p>
      <p>
       This horror must stop, and it must stop now. Please let this hideous depraved conspiracy unravel, completely, once and for all, so that our collective psyche can find peace.
