    <div class="md"><p>Snowden never really had access to much, just some random files he accessed while working as an NSA contractor. As for Assange? Who knows, maybe he and the rest of WikiLeaks have never gotten dirt on any of them. I would imagine the real MIC aren&#39;t leaving easily accessible email servers, etc. with dirt that implicates them in anything. They probably don&#39;t even use computers knowing how vulnerable they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk... If I was sitting at the top I wouldn&#39;t allow any communication except word of mouth. Think of all the meetings of the BIS, IMF, Bilderbergers, Bohemian Grove, Presidential golf games, ambassador tea times, etc etc... These people don&#39;t need to communicate every second of every day, because they are already meeting face-to-face quite often. They can certainly use encrypted networks to talk about shit, but not the next move in their game of world domination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gives the illusion of freedom of speech. We think we have access to all the information and truth in the world. However the truth is, even scientists and universities have agendas and funding they need to keep. So the studies that every smart arse likes to cite are only one persons version or opinion based on thier own research. Theories and not facts.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know the truth, only what those at the top decide to share. 
They don&#39;t need to encrypt thier own communications if they own the intelligence agencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People gave fairly divisive opinions on this. So I&#39;ll share my opinion based on my experience in the SIGINT community for the military between 98 and 2006. (Obviously difficult for me to prove but I welcome questions and urge people to look at it themselves)</p>

<p>Snowden is alleged to have breached security within a compartmentalised system. These systems would also have restricted physical access to terminals that could not have been accessed without a swipe card of sorts to even get into the room.</p>

<p>He managed to do that whilst said system failed to raise a single alarm, that somone/anyone was accessing the data outside the prescribed personnel. Anyone who has worked in a SCIF knows that this is not a simple task and certainly not solved by sticking a USB stick in a keyboard. That alone would have had alarms blaring.</p>

<p>If the intelligence community wanted him dead, he never would have made it to Greenwald. Full stop.</p>

<p>Also the intelligence he released was primarily already known. ECHELON had already been investigated by the European courts in the late 90s. So really he was just advertising old (seriously old) collection systems that had been surpassed.</p>

<p>Obviously there is more but I don&#39;t want to write an essay.</p>

<p>Assange : he was known to the ASIS and ASIO in Australia in the 90s. Australia is part of the 5 eyes community and the US have some interesting bases in Australia. Again he was known to agencies and was still allowed to rise to where he got. I believe he was an Australian asset that got swapped to CIA.</p>

<p>Again, if they wanted Assange gone they had to  opportunity before the whole Sweden/Rape chapter. His role is done and I believe he has been moved on to a nice retirement. The Wikileaks has also served it&#39;s purpose.  For whom, I&#39;m not sure. </p>

<p>Apologies for spelling or grammatical errors my fucking Samsung keyboard does my Tits in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I added some links for you to have a look at in my original response. </p>

<p>Next step : I have been out of the military for about a decade now, so I can&#39;t tell you what the noises are within. </p>

<p>If I was to lean on my personal historic experience I would say this : </p>

<p>Cuba are now friends with the US. Castro was also playing a role, perhaps unknowingly but according to MSM he was playing a role. </p>

<p>Iran : The US would have to be fucking mental to even try it. Iran will continue to be the outsider whilst the US is allied with Saudi Arabia. I think the US saw an opportunity for economic trade with Iran, when sanctions were lifted, I believe that Saudi responded with the refusal to reduce oil production to remind the US who their best mates were. Saudi and Israel are sisters in the region and hence Iran will continue to be used as the justification for military spending (and funding by the US) by both countries. Iran might not win but they would certainly bleed the nose of NATO and I believe Russia would have something to say. </p>

<p>North Korea : Same as the above. The sheer numbers of their military would make it a fools errand. Also, consider that North Korea hasn&#39;t actually been hostile to anyone other than over dispute terriorties which arguable South Korea were deliberately provoking. </p>

<p>If I had to put a wild card out there, I would suggest Saudi Arabia may be the next war in the Middle East. The US is slowly moving away from oil. Saudi have some cool military toys to put on a good &#39;war show&#39; but ultimately their soldiers are not in it to win it. It would pave the way for an economic relationship with Iran, which would see decades of trade to benefit both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the detailed responses. Couple more questions if you don&#39;t mind. I&#39;m 22yo with no debt besides the governments lol, living at home, have a decent job that I like doing and saved up a little chunk of change. I was saving for property but I&#39;m thinking about buying gold for the long term. Opinion? I won&#39;t take your word for it don&#39;t worry. Also, how far ahead do you think this is all planned out? Besides family tradition and maintaining lifestyle, what could motivate the next generation to move in the same direction as those before them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go to any financial adviser they will suggest property. 
Ultimately it is a risk because the market fluctuates, but the &#39;average&#39; person shouldn&#39;t have to worry, its the people that buy beyond their means. </p>

<p>Gold is always a solid investment, but to really be able to &#39;make&#39; money from gold you need to be buying a lot of it. </p>

<p>I think the TPTB, for me consist of the power families, the ones we know of like the Rothschild, Rockefellars etc, but also the foriegn versions and the Monarchies obviously have plans that span multiple generations. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the next generation should move in the same direction as the last. That is the trap we are in. Every generation before the current say&#39;s how life was better, money was better, &#39;xyz&#39; that won&#39;t change. </p>

<p>The only way we can really move forward, unfortunately, is full blown and bloody revolution. Until the power families are removed, and government moves away from out-dated democracy and organized religion, we will always as a race (human) be forced to &#39;look up&#39; to people for guidance. </p>

<p>One thing that did me well was getting the f-out of the UK when I was a bit older than you. I lived in the UAE and Saudi for a few years before coming to Australia. I will retire in Thailand. There is a great life to be had out there, outside of what you are told is the &#39;norm&#39;. Third world countries that are prescribed as poor and backward are generally happier in themselves and with life. So my guidance if I was allowed to give any would be, move away. Far away and experience life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuckkk. I&#39;ve been thinking about how it would be living in countries we&#39;re told can&#39;t compare to America. Every Arab I&#39;ve ever met has been beyond nice and showed a sense of hospitality that people here couldn&#39;t care less about. 90% of the people in my life have distanced themselves from me because I&#39;m always pointing out the hypocrisies in America from the way the people think to the way the were told were have to remember the bad stuff so we don&#39;t repeat it but we don&#39;t mention what our own military did or that were still out there fucking shit up. People really get mad when I talk shit about the military.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t even watch sports anymore either without feeling like I&#39;m wasting time watching an  advertisement. And even during the super bowl I was shitting on how much the people around me care about guys throwing a ball around and I&#39;m from fucking New England. I even made the mistake of trying to tell my parents who didn&#39;t have the privilege of an internet to provide an opinion other than the media&#39;s.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m at the point where I understand what the problem is but I also understand that it would take nothing short of a miracle for an undertaking like global rebellion to even be a dream, nevermind a reality. I want to contribute as little as possible, but that&#39;s come with the consequence of a much less fun life.   </p>

<p>I think about this all the time and sometimes my answer changes, but really I wish I was a dumb ignorant fuck that enjoyed all aspects of slave life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive seen people go through it to but when they say theyre woke its because they found out what a pineal gland and wont drink non bottled water. I take great care of my dog. Hes next to me right now. And I love to cook, especially for other people.  </p>

<p>I cant help but look at these people like idiots. What makes me so different that I have no problem asking questions about everything while so many are happy to &quot;do as I say and not as I do&quot; or &quot;You have two ears and one mouth, learn the ratio&quot;  </p>

<p>What makes me able to overcome that indoctrination garbage? Are the baby boomers really to blame for these weak minded people? Did their &quot;lovey dovey&quot; parenting cause this? Because my mother grew up poor in Italy, and like most immigrant familys I know here, tough love was a theme even stronger than religion. Oddly enough I got an excellent education from a Catholic school until 4th grade and without that good foundation combined with my moms tough love and willingness for me to enjoy reading then Im not sure where Id be mentally right now.  </p>

<p>Ive had a war waged on my mind too. And its not that I dont try to make people think by pointing things out that made me think. Like how our school system is based on the factory model, or how strange it is that this so called free country was founded by slave owners, or even less complicated things like how most of our city (I live near Boston), like an overwhelming majority of it, is land from all around the greater boston area that was often times being brought in on a railway that had cars going 24/7  or why the media only shows crimes and violence as if a car crash should ever be reported about, much less reported live from the side of the highway.</p>

<p>Its like people only want to talk about things that affect their emotions and not their minds (in terms of curiosity or perspective) because they like living in a little safety bubble where nothing outside the confines of their worldview can hurt them. I start getting irritated being around willfully ignorant people for too long. Even the people I would consider to be critical thinkers. Peoples willingness to step out of the crowd and possibly labeled as a conspiracy theorist as if the word conspiracy is defined as something thats fake 100% of the time. Its hard not to call it how I see it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the last question Ill bug you with, but dont take my word for it.  </p>

<p>What do you think of the Unit 731 experiments by the Japanese? In relation to globalism I mean. Was it purely for medical research? Because I cant see how injecting someone with bubonic plague and letting it fester for a while before theyre cut open with no anesthesia would be useful to study.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess there are two ways to look at this : </p>

<p>One is based on what we are told occured : I am pretty sure there would be  many scientists in this world, that if given the opportunity would love free - reign to conduct experiments they wished. Then you could also consider if they were doing so under pressure from superiors. I don&#39;t think it would need to have anything to do with Globalism, but genuine (albeit fucked up) scientific inquiry. If what we are told is true, then the Japanese genuinelly and sincerely did not view the Chinese as human. They were conditioned (much like we are with Muslims now) to believe they were of a higher race than the other Asian nations. We have pictures of American soldiers who electrocuted Muslim prisoners, pissed on them, tied them up like dogs. We know there were black sites and we know there was torture and death, so it isn&#39;t hard to imagine there were far darker things going on we aren&#39;t privvy too. War does fucked things to a persons mind.  </p>

<p>Then you could consider whether these events really occurred in the ways we are told. I don&#39;t personally know where i can find legitimate transcripts/translations of Japanese documents telling me exactly what went on. Yes there are some dark pictures but would those pictures be as dark without the supposed context around them? </p>

<p>There are obviously some question marks over the German concentration camps now, but nothing I would have been told at school or via MSM would have given me an alternative view. Whilst I have no doubt the Japanese were bastards, you have to remember who is feeding us that information. It isn&#39;t the Japanese. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know plenty of people my age who joined the military and looked forward to shooting arabs. Even had a family member who got his gopro taken because of something they were doing with dead bodies in Afghanistan. But hes a local hero here. </p>

<p>I dont know what to think about 731 but I dont think white people saw blacks as being the same species either so I guess it applies in Asia too.  </p>

<p>The holocaust is something I dont even bother bringing up because of how emotionally charged it is. I dont even have to deny it. I can just ask for conclusive evidence that anyone was gassed. And people will freak out while listing off things like piles of hair and shoes, the existence of the ovens themselves, or all the &quot;witness&quot; accounts. Then I try to explain how that doesnt prove anything and watch as their system overloads. The number of bodies cant be proven, but 6 million is awfully coincidental. Convenient too how the Nazis allegedly burned ALL the evidence. Nobody here has ever heard of the Balfour Declaration because were never taught about it so it must not exist. And if it does it cant be real. Hitler has to be evil! He never did a good thing in his life!  </p>

<p>My favorite part is how the Rothschilds arent even Jews. Just further using societal systems that they have no stake in, to pit us against each other and watch us willingly hate as if love and peace isnt a common value in all the big religions. I dont wanna call it respect, but I do admire how well theyve played us in terms of dotting every i and crossing every t. What a truly epic story. If the founding fathers couldnt make a difference from across the Atlantic then I highly doubt the internet will do anything but give them a reason to laugh at those who are aware but powerless nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange&#39;s leaks have very much exposed the Rothchild&#39;s organizations and people who pull the strings for them. They also expose executives of the major banks and people associated with different countries currency creators, the IMF, and the world Banks. </p>

<p>People are making the connections, but the majority seem to focus on some of the more high profile individuals. </p>

<p>Many CEOs of media companies, prime ministers, and 1%ers. You have to dig into things and do homework about the people to find out. It isn&#39;t hard, a few branching google searches, but most people don&#39;t want to make the links. </p>

<p><a href="/r/DNCleaks">/r/DNCleaks</a> has a lot of this information. I  and others did a ton of work linking people with the Rockefellers and Rothchilds, council on foriegn relations, clinton foundation, IMF, world bank, and Trilatteral Commission. They aren&#39;t the only pupetmasters though. </p>

<p>The problem is very much international, which makes it more difficult to expose and draw significant attention to all. It is happening though. We are seeing arrests, collapse of funds and they are getting sloppy with thier propoganda meathods. </p>

Even if he wasnt...you think they would let some loudmouth asshole air their dirty laundry to the entire empire? He&#39;s apart of the establishment. They wheel him out during the election with these &quot;leaks&quot;. Give me a fucking break.  Bill Mahr had him on.  Come on.  You think they would allow that kind of shit if it didn&#39;t benefit them? People hanging on to every fucking tweet? Vault 7 lol. You might as well be watching CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I added some links for you to have a look at in my original response. </p>

<p>Next step : I have been out of the military for about a decade now, so I can&#39;t tell you what the noises are within. </p>

<p>If I was to lean on my personal historic experience I would say this : </p>

<p>Cuba are now friends with the US. Castro was also playing a role, perhaps unknowingly but according to MSM he was playing a role. </p>

<p>Iran : The US would have to be fucking mental to even try it. Iran will continue to be the outsider whilst the US is allied with Saudi Arabia. I think the US saw an opportunity for economic trade with Iran, when sanctions were lifted, I believe that Saudi responded with the refusal to reduce oil production to remind the US who their best mates were. Saudi and Israel are sisters in the region and hence Iran will continue to be used as the justification for military spending (and funding by the US) by both countries. Iran might not win but they would certainly bleed the nose of NATO and I believe Russia would have something to say. </p>

<p>North Korea : Same as the above. The sheer numbers of their military would make it a fools errand. Also, consider that North Korea hasn&#39;t actually been hostile to anyone other than over dispute terriorties which arguable South Korea were deliberately provoking. </p>

<p>If I had to put a wild card out there, I would suggest Saudi Arabia may be the next war in the Middle East. The US is slowly moving away from oil. Saudi have some cool military toys to put on a good &#39;war show&#39; but ultimately their soldiers are not in it to win it. It would pave the way for an economic relationship with Iran, which would see decades of trade to benefit both.</p>
