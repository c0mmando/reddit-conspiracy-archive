       Just look at how many users who in the past claimed to be supporters of the pizzagate conspiracy now fall over themselves to defend the sick pedo Milo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I just wonder why they were pretending to be anti-pedo  when in fact, they defend pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone got any ideas?

       As mentioned by myself in another post, Milo is right that he is not a paedophile.

       Words have this thing called "meaning". If you are an American, let me remind you that Americans always demand everyone to speak English.

       hell even epstien was not known to have any victims under the ago of 11-14, so that must mean he isn't a pedo either right?

       You should think about why you are being seen to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yuo must realize that pedophilia has a terrible connatation. Neither hebephilia or ephebophilia have had enough of a use in the public to gain the negative connotation.

       Exactly I have no doubt the guy was just spouting bullshit to be controversial which seems to be his modus operandi. What's weird to me is this podcast that happened more than 6 months ago suddenly just caught a mysterious wave of publicity.

       The entire idea of calling Milo who is objectively a victim of pedophiles but is a troll who can joke about that experience is laughable. The Corporate media that was trying to normalize pedos are now attacking a victim. Salon has started deleting their pro pedo articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the fun part, Milo is in a unique position to blow the lid on pizzagate and turn this narrative against them.

       It's not as black and white as the media would like you to believe. I urge you to watch the full segment of the podcast, read Milo's statement, and recognize that Milo literally makes a living by abusing the 1st amendment and saying controversial stuff. Don't let this distract you from the important truths. Milo is nothing but a troll. This is dumb media stuff. Don't turn this into a "all trump supporters are pedo sympathizers" fest. They want it to be us against them.

       Milo is a fucking piece of shit, all these idiots defending him are on his level of 15 year old student political thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think he’s hilarious cause he’s a “troll”, so anything he says has no meaning or bearing, it’s there to piss people off, however, when his words actually do garner attention and have
       <em>
        consequences
       </em>
       like in this case and he is lambasted and pushed back into the gutter where he belongs, all his little fuckboy fanboys come out with “you just don’t get it, he’s a troll” which is another way of saying “aww shucks Milo didn’t weally mean it!” It was trolling so there should be no consequences for spouting asinine bs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or like the same scum that make shitty youtube Videos in the ghetto and then get shot while explaining “it’s a prank” well, it’s too late now mutherfucker.
