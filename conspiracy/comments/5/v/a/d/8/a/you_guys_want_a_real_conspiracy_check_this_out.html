        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Background .... I drink beer and troll political forums. Yay me. I am also a super nerdlinger and back in the good old days did my fair share of interweb spelunking..... I spent 22 minutes writing a schlitzs fueled post on a forum. Before I posted it i have a five minute old response to my as of yet unfinished comment.
( I operate reddit with multiple windows so I can agrue with more people at once because I am classy like that) </p>

<p>Some background here , I locate underground utilities, I have a deep intrinsic understanding of how all the fiber and copper cables you dont even know are buried underneath your feet work. I am the only guy on my semi rural block with my backbone ISP provider who happens to be the most established and oldest ISP in the world (you all know who they change names alot) I should not have had a five minute old response to my yet to be posted comment to a sub i have never posted in before. But I fucking did. I know how the data moves from my pc to the reddit servers and which cables it runs on. Everything about this makes absolutely no goddamned sense at all. I am typing this comment in the little box on the screen right now in the GUI noone should be able to read it as it type it. Someone did and formulated a response to me that was actually older than my initial post. Anyone have any Idea what is going on here. I dont think I am important enough to have someone actively getting through my isps firewall and my own firewall and past my anti virus software and into the code of my browser to see what I am typing as I am typing it. </p>

<p>That is absolutely possible but an assinine waste of resources , i think it is much mor elikely that something I typed in my 5000 ish plus word essay triggered an automatic response from reddit has anyone else experienced something like this or heard of it happening? Let me know whats up guys/gals okay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here we go i imgured some screen shots. now to explain exactly what happened here I have been posting all night at my leisure. I had just clicked post on this long ass comment i had spent quite some time writing, then immediately refreshed my reddit page (one of several i have open as i have been posting all night and constantly refresh at least on window to catch responses faster as I assume we all do) The very second I refreshed immediately after posting this comment I already had a five minute old response to the comment I had just posted. You can read my post history if the pictures suck or dont work and see more basic information on why this should not happen ever. There is no reason I should have a five minute old response to a post that is only less than 2 seconds old. Very strange.</p>

reply from bot at tuesday feb 21 07:25:08:2017 UTC</p>

<p>too bad I dont have a timeline for where in my post I was at the time because according to the little green letters we are looking at the reply was five minutes old when it was posted, then we could figure out what I said to &quot;trigger&quot; the response. Honestly I am surprised I havent been banned from that sub yet, for a bernie sub this is my current record for how long it has taken a comment of mine in one to get me banned from said sub..</p>

<p>mine was same it took bot only three seconds to reply. So i guess in a way it still is an actual conspiracy. Thankfully not the one I feared it could be. It is funny that I can mention interweb ghosts from over 20 years ago and still get worried about it on account of a politcally motivated reddit bot.</p>

We know it obviously does each time you type a character on googles search bar for example, because it&#39;s used for the prediction algorithm. Reddit is just a plain old text box from the looks of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was my intitial concern , I had just finished typing and half assed editing my long ass post and refreshed. Already I had a reply to it that was over 5 lines long. the little green time stamp at exactly that time said it was 5 minutes old. I am used to getting quick replies but normally the say something like F-U or something short for a reply that soon. Not knowing what type of system reddits internal workings are made from it is hard to tell. I haven&#39;t messed around with packet sniffers since whois and fingerclient was a thing over dial-up. And I cannot imagine reddit having enough script or code running in the background while I am typing a comment to discern the contents of my post (which I believe only mention Trump once or twice at most could elicit a response that quickly) the whole initial timestamp threw me off because it appeared the reply was older than my post although when looking at the little reddit time stamp now it says it was three seconds later ....maybe the post time for me started before I finished and sent the post due to the size of the post and how long I spent typing it, would make sense 20 years ago with the memory capacity everything had back then but today I imagine it would be pretty hard to max out the available space in this GUI text box I am typing into on my web browser and even though chrome is quite the ram hog I doubt it is running some kind of reddit program in the background while I type.</p>

<p>I ended up replying to the bot thinking it was a person, but got no response but the fact that it is a bot makes much more sense now. Still dont like the whole auto response aspect. It was not directly related to my post at all, my post was about Hillary &amp; Co using Russia as a scapegoat to cover for why they lost so hard and Bernie not calling them out for their corruption, the &quot;bots&quot; response was a bunch of gibberish about illegal immigrants and them voting none of which was mentioned in my initial post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of this bot posting, you should know this does still happen.</p>

<p>Its very simple and uses a common programming language known as AJAX. This code was implemented to allow refreshing a page without having to reload the whole page.</p>

<p>Instead of a static piece of data, the code is querying a database, and presenting the results dynamically.</p>

<p>It can also be used in text fields and often is. There have been security talks on this. As soon as you start typing the AJAX call is firing every 5-10 seconds or whatever and updating a database with your writing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you end up posting or if you erase things. The frequent query is still sending your typing to a remote server.</p>

<p>Facebook in particular is known to do this to store comments people don&#39;t send and add it to their data profile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for your awesome response and very helpful information</p>

<p>That actually completely explains what my concern was, being that the bots response was before my final posting at least from what I could see.</p>

<p>SO that means that reddit is runing that bot? That is kinda fucked up?</p>
