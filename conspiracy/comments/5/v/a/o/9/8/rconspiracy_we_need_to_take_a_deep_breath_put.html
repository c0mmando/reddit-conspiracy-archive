        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s obvious that the media and political establishment are getting nervous that people are still talking about pizzagate and that it&#39;s not going away. Pedophilia is a hot topic lately. Especially with the news out today about the former prime minister. We need to come to terms with the fact that this isn&#39;t some giant conspiracy theory that has no backing. It is very real and it&#39;s not going away. </p>

<p>Milo has been gaining a lot of negative attention lately. He is a troll who purposefully spouts provocative and controversial shit. He is an easy target to use to muddy the waters on how people are talking about pedophilia. They are trying to divert the conversation and pit us against each other. And it&#39;s working. Look at the state of this sub. Now it seems that anyone who is a Milo-or by association, trump supporter- must be a pedo sympathizer. You think this &quot;news&quot; just naturally sprung into existence out of nowhere? The podcast is from January 2016. It was obviously someone&#39;s job to dig through and find a narrative somewhere by using the near universally hated Milo as a target. No better target than Milo. Remember, they did the same thing with Julian Assange with the pedophilia narrative. </p>

<p>Yes, Milo is a troll. Fuck Milo. No one is surprised that he is saying controversial shit. Don&#39;t let this distract you from the important stuff. Keep the conversation and your energy on the TRUTH. Don&#39;t let the media divide us anymore.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Since this thread has gained some traction, I want to use it as an opportunity to post a few videos for anyone who might still be skeptical, or have some reservations about pizzagate. It&#39;s totally understandable to reject it. I don&#39;t want to believe it myself. Remember, this isn&#39;t about red vs blue. It&#39;s about truth. It&#39;s not cold hard evidence, but I think that any sane person who looks into this stuff can see that there is more going on than we have been led to believe.</p>

<p>There is no way that can be twisted to be &quot;okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course yes the media is going to jump all over it and try to make it worse than it is.</p>

<p>&amp; The liberal homophobes are out in full force, which is just shameful.</p>

<p>But no there is no way to defend what Milo has done. And he has now lied about it instead of taking responsibility which only makes it so much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he&#39;s not. His personal experience is that he pumped/was pumped by older guy, 27 i think he said, when he was 17.
That&#39;s hardly child molesting. Also, he does say in the clip that the age of consent is fine.
How has he lied? Did you watch his FB video response?
I&#39;m no fanboy for Milo, but these accusations are meaningless drivel trying to hang a paedo tag to him.
He is a troll, and a high profile one at that, so sure people want to bring him down.</p>

<p>Say something pedo-edgy and get people all worked up. Draw a ton of attention to yourself and boost your career.</p>

<p>If/when things get too hot, use the gay thing to counterattack and paint your opponents as homophobic.</p>

<p>This way you achieve two things: A major boost in visibility, you become some sort of gay rights champion to the SJW crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t say it was ok to fuck a 13 y/o or that he wanted to, he said at one point that he thought the age of consent was fine. Milo has made a ton of dodgy remarks around the age of consent but I think that it stems from the fact that he was a victim of childhood sexual assault/molestation (although he can&#39;t admit that he was a victim). Looks like the guy has basically been a victim and is trying to convince himself he isn&#39;t, screams stockholm syndrome since he said on Rogan that he liked the priest that molested/assaulted (not sure what exactly the term is, Milo wasn&#39;t clear on what happened) and made it sound like he was the one doing the assaulting. Obviously this is bullshit, he just seems a bit more unhinged than he usually is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk I see it as more of a coping mechanism to deal with being a victim of this stuff since anecdotally the rape/molestation victims I know tend to deal with it this way. It&#39;s up for interpretation obviously but I think his early years were just fucked in general. I believe I heard in a talk he had with Sargon that he lost his virginity at a really early age (early teens) and has talked repeatedly about using drugs and going clubbing (later in his life, not teens) so I think his development as a person has been pretty abnormal to say the least</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is intended to destroy Milo. It&#39;s intended to normalize pedophiles.</p>

<p>The attacks on milo are OBVIOUSLY edited to make it look as bad as possible. But what he actually said contextually was pretty bad regardless.</p>

<p>Milo has a lot of hardcore fans, he&#39;s a trump supporter and the trump sub defends him relentlessly.</p>

<p>By twisting his words the media is forcing his supporters to defend him. Since things are SO partisan in TD, you either have to defend him entirely or get booed down for admitting he was wrong at all. This puts them in the position of having to defend even the part where he claimed he was mature enough to consent at 13. </p>

<p>In my opinion, he&#39;s allowed to say that, because he was the 13 year old and nobody else could possibly know how it effected him... But if you aren&#39;t very careful about how you defend his statement, you are putting forth the argument that 13-year olds can consent to sex with ages 25+.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a ship I want to sail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find an unedited transcript of it, but essentially Milo talked about that when he was 14 he was the aggressor in a sexual relationship with a much older man... someone more than twice his age.</p>

<p>He went on to support older men who accept advances from boys as young as 13, saying that such may-september relationships could be &quot;life affirming&quot; and positive experiences for both parties.</p>

<p>There are suggestions that the video has been edited down to make it more inflammatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your second paragraph takes the flow of the conversation out of context.</p>

<p>He was not referring to 13 year old boys and old men, he was referring to cross-generational age gaps- meaning young men with older men. He clearly indicated that the age of consent was about right.</p>

<p>This is a witch hunt and nothing more. Milo&#39;s support of free speech, ridicule of safe spaces, logical mockery to modern feminism, support of the 2nd Ammendment, rejection of globalism, and derision for Muslim immigration has worried the liberal establishment and put himself in the cross hairs of &quot;fake&quot; news. I hope they just made him a martyr.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And? In the UK and many countries it is 16. In Germany, it is 14. In several states in the USA, it is 14. In some countries, it is even lower, but generally, the bare minimum is age of puberty.</p>

<p>In the USA, at 14, teenagers can get a job or drive a motorcycle in some states. At 14, teenagers have the right to protected health information.</p>

<p>In no way was Milo supporting pedophilia- which is the attraction of people ages 16 and older to pre-pubescent children (not teenagers).</p>

<p>Hell, almost every porn purveyor online has multiple &quot;teenager&quot; sections, legal teen, etc... no one bats a damn eye.</p>

<p>But, this is all the left can do- make baseless, fact-free claims against opponents in an attempt to smear them and shut down anyone who argues logically against their fascist, globalist, feminization plans for the future. Fake news.</p>

<p>No, but it does give that video context, especially when one considers his explanation of the term boy and the fact that he was himself the victim of abuse.  </p>

<p>It is also constructive to consider the controversy is being fanned by the leftist media, so let us at least be honest about that.  I never saw the leftist media go after Lena Dunham like this, and she wrote a book about how she &quot;played&quot; with her little sister on many occasions.  No pitchforks for her.  Go figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His latest regarding this:
I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim.
I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors. I am horrified by pedophilia and I have devoted large portions of my career as a journalist to exposing child abusers. I&#39;ve outed three of them, in fact -- three more than most of my critics. And I&#39;ve repeatedly expressed disgust at pedophilia in my feature and opinion writing. My professional record is very clear.
But I do understand that these videos, even though some of them are edited deceptively, paint a different picture.
I&#39;m partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, &quot;advocacy.&quot; I deeply regret that. People deal with things from their past in different ways.
As to some of the specific claims being made, sometimes things tumble out of your mouth on these long, late-night live-streams, when everyone is spit-balling, that are incompletely expressed or not what you intended. Nonetheless, I&#39;ve reviewed the tapes that appeared last night in their proper full context and I don&#39;t believe they say what is being reported.
I do not advocate for illegal behavior. I explicitly say on the tapes that I think the current age of consent is &quot;about right.&quot;
I do not believe sex with 13-year-olds is okay. When I mentioned the number 13, I was talking about the age I lost my own virginity.
I shouldn&#39;t have used the word &quot;boy&quot; -- which gay men often do to describe young men of consenting age -- instead of &quot;young man.&quot; That was an error.
I am certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret.
Anyone who suggests I turn a blind eye to illegal activity or to the abuse of minors is unequivocally wrong. I am implacably opposed to the normalization of pedophilia and I will continue to report and speak accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Just because I was sexually precocious doesn&#39;t mean that I am going to say that every 13 year old that has sex with a 28 year old is fine.

<p>If you need to know the specifics of a case where a 13 year old boy has sex with a 28 year old man is ok or not you are being a pedo apologist. He believes his relationship when he was a teen was fine because he consented.  It is good that he exposed 3 pedophiles but that doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t an apologist for remarks like these which are clearly not &quot;lol trolling u edgy joak&quot; statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age of consent in other countries is as low as 14. In his response video he said he was thinking about his relationship with a 29 year old when he was 17.</p>

<p>It sounds like he thinks young teens are capable of making decisions like sexual consent with older adults. I disagree. (Though having sex at 13-15 isn&#39;t uncommon) But many people support young teens in making grown up decisions, like changing their gender for example. It&#39;s not too far off a stretch to suggest that if they can undergo surgery/hormone treatment to change their gender, or become emaciated by a court of law, then perhaps they are also capable of consenting to sex with an adult. </p>

<p>I disagree though and I think kids should be protected despite what they themselves think. From all but emaciapation if deemed appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. Obviously a lot of people hate Milo and I&#39;m sure someone was looking for something to use against him, but what he said does sound bad. I see people posting &quot;that&#39;s not what he meant&quot;, when his words are pretty cut and dry. Even the people on the podcasts were a little weirded out, and they know how much dumb shit he says. I think he&#39;s hilarious and I agree with some things he says, but maybe he was &quot;trolling&quot; a little much, because this is fucking him up badly and probably won&#39;t go away. Maybe wanting reactions isn&#39;t the best way to constantly conduct yourself, Milo. </p>

<p>Yeah I guess it&#39;s weird to connect John Podesta with emails that <strong>he received in his inbox</strong> regarding a game of dominoes played on pasta vs pizza.</p>

<p>I know when I buy a new game of dominoes I like to whip up a batch of penne, nab some spicy marinara from Whole Foods, and do a quick round on the pasta before eating. Of course the pieces get kinda dirty, so sometimes I e-mail my friend John asking if he thinks I&#39;d do better playing on pasta or pizza.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all there is to it. No other connections here. He literally owned a handkerchief with a literal map, and somehow that map was pizza-related. It was so important that someone decided to email him asking if he wanted the pizza-related map handkerchief back. No connections to be drawn whatsoever to John Podesta, it&#39;s a totally &quot;made up&quot; connection even though the email was literally sent to <em><a href="mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com">john.podesta@gmail.com</a></em>... totally made up. </p>

<p>If you say it&#39;s made up over and over I think that makes it true.</p>

<p>I used to lurk /b/ all the time before and saw cheese pizza mentioned hundreds of times, 99% of the time with pics of pizza. &quot;Mods are asleep, post your cp!&quot; threads all the time, flooded with pictures of pizza. </p>

<p>What? We don&#39;t need proof? <strong>I</strong> need proof, especially to believe extraprdinary claims. What&#39;s the source for that FBI claim? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;d see it take place on 4chan all the time, it was disgusting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the time is a bit of an overstatement. It&#39;s not like 4chan was a safe haven for it because you&#39;re &quot;anonymous&quot;. Iirc, Moot holds all IPs and will give them up in an instant to save his own ass, especially when it comes to cp.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well when you fit reality to the evidence you have, then I could see why you&#39;d say that. But the emails say nothing of child abuse, they&#39;re heavily taken out of context, and the &quot;code words&quot; that were used to &quot;decipher&quot; the emails originated from <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/070/af6.png">4chan</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Older generations are funny like that with computers. They always underestimate how vulnerable their tech really is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a generalization and doesn&#39;t speak for every elderly person. My grandfather is the person who first taught me anything about computers when I was 3 or 4 years old. He has the computer savviness of your average person in their 20s. Now obviously I can&#39;t say the same for Podesta given how his emails got out. But what&#39;s the point of this argument anyway?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The BTK killer was caught because he didn&#39;t know you could pull .exif data from files on a floppy disk he sent to the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that has what to do with pizzagate? Stop comparing pizzagate to other crimes. The claims of pizzagate must stand on their own merit, not on the backs of other proven crimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John Podesta lost his e-mail to an old school phishing scam. We&#39;re talking some serious amateur hour stuff here.</p>

<p>Yeah, the dude was worse than stonetear with computers. That does what to prove pizzagate&#39;s claims are true?</p>

<p>So? </p>

<p>So?</p>

<p>Maybe John doesn&#39;t care what random neckbeards think of him?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can you concede this is strange language to send to someone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes this is strange language to use, but we don&#39;t convict people who use &#39;strange language&#39;, we commit people who we have solid irrefutable proof against and it&#39;s been weeks without any &#39;major&#39; developments.</p>

<p>If the Clinton foundation is hiding global child molestation, they&#39;re doing a better job at it than Hilary did at running her Presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Also another thing that makes me doubt this conspiracy is true is that Trump&#39;s name never comes. I mean he&#39;s been accused of sexual assault multiple times and he&#39;s openly admitted to &#39;grabbing women by the pussy&#39;, yet his name never comes up here on this sub unless it&#39;s about the deep state run by the Clintons  that are trying to overthrow him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, here we go. Have you ever communicated with another human being? Are you aware that human communication is often distorted by slang, idioms, in-jokes, and informal language to the point that it can be indecipherable (or open to interpretation) to outsiders?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know when I buy a new game of dominoes I like to whip up a batch of penne, nab some spicy marinara from Whole Foods, and do a quick round on the pasta before eating. Of course the pieces get kinda dirty, so sometimes I e-mail my friend John asking if he thinks I&#39;d do better playing on pasta or pizza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no. Or one of them lost a game of dominos after eating one food type, and jokingly asked if they&#39;d to any better after eating a different type. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He literally owned a handkerchief with a literal map, and somehow that map was pizza-related</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you stop to consider that the man just likes pizza? Considering he seemed to be visiting somewhere, could it be that he wanted to visit recommended pizza places? Or had picked up a souvenir? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He literally owned a handkerchief with a literal map, and somehow that map was pizza-related. It was so important that someone decided to email him asking if he wanted the pizza-related map handkerchief back. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, or someone cared about customer service and wanted to go that extra mile. If you found something that belonged to one of your customers/clients, would you ignore it and throw it away? Or would you contact them and ask if they wanted it back?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you say it&#39;s made up over and over I think that makes it true.</p>

<p>That lack of self-awareness.</p>

<p>If you make something up and say it&#39;s true over and over, that must make it true, right?</p>

<p>No, he doesn&#39;t owe anyone any sort of explanation in this. You don&#39;t get to throw out spurious accusations about horrific crimes on the flimsiest of evidence and demand a suitable explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird too because it seems like things are always brought back to politics for some reason. People just cannot remove their limbic system from the discussion and talk about the topic at hand objectively without attachments.</p>

<p>For example, a discussion about immigration isn&#39;t about left/right, it&#39;s about allowing people to immigrate. The political stage is not needed to discuss that(or any other) issue.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s being done on purpose. People are being polarized so they basically NEED to bring every discussion back to politics. I work my damnedest to push convos in real life away from polarized statements but it&#39;s tough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two ways to interpret that statement, as I see it.</p>

<p>Interpretation 1: &quot;It&#39;s how we&#39;ve been wired by external agents of some kind.&quot;  To this I say: No, dude.   This isn&#39;t some TPTB thing where we were once purely rational thinkers back in some point in history and they subverted that state of things.  It&#39;s how we evolved.  The limbic system is tightly connected to the prefrontal cortex.  Emotional content feeds directly into the apparatus of complex cognition.  That&#39;s basic neurology.</p>

<p>Interpretation 2: &quot;It&#39;s how we&#39;ve been wired, but that can change.&quot;  To this I say: absolutely.  Anyone who has taken up a diligent meditative practice has experienced the amazing phenomenon of building a separation between awareness and cognition and thereby gaining deeper mastery of one&#39;s own reactions to things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually easier now than ever to discuss ideas, we just have to deal with the stress and emotional fallout. We are at least discussing uncomfortable opinions openly (maybe not responsibly) and dealing with the ramifications of that instead of keeping it in the fringe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. It&#39;s hilarious how there&#39;s still people banging on about there being some sort of sex dungeon in the pizza restaurant with no basement. They are so annoyed that people won&#39;t &quot;pick up on&quot; their intentionally twisted &quot;evidence&quot;, and are mad that pizzagate is no longer in mainstream news.(and when it was, it was simply to highlight the madman with a gun, and how workers at the restaurant are being harassed and stalked IRL by conspiracy tards)</p>

<p>THIS is the number one tactic that has been in use to discredit the investigation. This is why it&#39;s called Fake News. The &quot;fake&quot; part is the media insisting that everything hinges on a sex dungeon in the basement of a pizza restaurant.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them fool you. The pizza restaurant is a point of association between some powerful people with disturbing interests. The investigation is about a very real and very large criminal organization involved in human trafficking and other crimes. Major media outlets are complicit, at least at the level of cover-up.  </p>

I think the profile of his face is there for about a second there too. Not sure if that&#39;s the video, but I really am not in the mood to keep watching this video lol. There were 3 videos I think not very long, if you look through them you&#39;ll see the profile, most defining was his nose and eyebrow. Its a crude video, but there are way too many things, appearance, voice, &quot;John Podest-&quot;, etc. that are 90% probable for it not to be John Podesta.</p>

&quot;Coincidentally, while trying to dig up more info on John Podesta’s father, I came across a slightly disturbing piece of text in an article that was in the Federal congressional register. It describes how Podesta learned to slaughter pigs, and how he even used to have a slaughtered pig as his screen saver. You literally can’t make this up.</p>

<p>The address of the mansion and the farm, however, ran chills down my spine. They’re both right next to the CIA headquarters. So now I’m wondering whether the home was a brownstone operation and/or whether the fire was covering up evidence.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/07/john-podesta-a-seasoned-hand-024575?o=2">http://www.politico.com/story/2009/07/john-podesta-a-seasoned-hand-024575?o=2</a>
From Politico: </p>

<p>&quot;Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown, he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-creation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta explained: “It’s best to do the butchering at 4 a.m., “because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It’s most important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a knife in its throat.” </p>

<p>&quot;In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.”   That goes beyond an odd taste in art if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>serial killers usually start out with animals.  This is one strange thing among a number of strange things regarding Podesta.  You are free to dismiss it, I am merely curious about why he is so fascinated with the pig farm that he makes a stuck pig his work screensaver, has cannibal and pedo related art, seems to be involved in controlling the media&#39;s narrative, and I am seriously questioning his morals and the more I look into it the more it seems there should be a thorough investigation.  <a href="http://www.md-health.com/Sociopath-Traits.html">http://www.md-health.com/Sociopath-Traits.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it raises my suspicion of him by &lt;0.5%. Someone disgusted and empathetic to animal slaughter is less likely to hurt humans. Although it in no way means that someone who can so unqueasingly slaughter and display butchered animals is likely to feel the same about humans. </p>

<p>More suspicious to me is the location and the fact that the slaughter house was just burned down. Kind of coincidental given the huge amount of pedo busts going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s nothing really condemning, especially compared to his paintings. He could really just be priding himself in killing an animal in the best way possible to preserve its quality. Everything he explained is good slaughter technique, prevents the animal from being too stressed, which burns up its glycogen stores, eventually resulting in dry, dark, alkaline meat.</p>

<p>Only disturbing thing is having a slaughtered pig as his background, but it could be just that he was so proud of such a clean kill that he had to save it. Definitely all a bit weird, but I would be more disturbed if he described slaughtering pigs with bad, messy, and pain-inducing technique. Some people just aren&#39;t queasy at all and just don&#39;t get that other people are.</p>

<p>Only suspicious thing in my opinion is the location of the farm, and the fact that it was just burned down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  There&#39;s no real way of knowing what goes on in Podest&#39;s head.  But it concerns me that this is what  is being mentioned in profile pieces on him, the same way that the article on Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection of naked children, gives me pause to wonder about him.  I feel that they are putting these things out there for people in the know.  Also I read that Podesta got his start in Politics by compromising republican judges, and if he is involved in some type of blackmail sex ring, this might just be him knowing how the sausage gets made, so to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Near the end of Clinton’s second term, Podesta devised a plan to advance stalled elements of the president’s agenda: Rather than battle a hostile GOP Congress over legislation, Podesta proposed a series of executive orders and changes to federal rules that wouldn’t require Republican cooperation. The move was dubbed “Project Podesta .” One conservative publication fumed that this constituted nothing less than an “abuse of power.”   <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/45994/project-podesta">https://newrepublic.com/article/45994/project-podesta</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one that took that up as my retarded banner. Now that the pizzeria theory is thoroughly discredited PG folks are looking to distance themselves from that nonsense, but it&#39;d be better to first fully own up to it as nonsense and start over with less intellectually dishonest investigating. PG started as a smear campaign, it may have evolved for some folks but not enough to change the shape of it. The goalposts keep getting moved on what constitutes PG even though it started with Comet Pizza most PG people are jumping all over themselves to distance themselves from that now that it seems increasingly likely nothing will come from it. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree traficking rings exists but they are not related to these random accusations about the content of emails taken out of context. The PG folks insisting that they are are just wasting their own time and the time of &quot;real&quot; investigators to the extent they receive false tips due to this non-starter nonsense. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is exactly about that. No matter how hard you are trying to rebrand this, that&#39;s what pizzagate is. Pizzagate is about the leaked emails, James Alefantis, Podesta, and the crazy theory that some shit was going down at comet pizza, that&#39;s what it is. Words have meaning. If we&#39;re not talking about that and none of this sounds familiar, that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m talking about pizzagate, and I&#39;m saying the whole thing is obviously false. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s a fucking stupid name that lets people like you harp on it. This isnt about pizza places, it&#39;s a large network of organ and child harvesting that got national attention from the work people did looking into Podesta and Alefuckskids. </p>

<p>Enough narratives, any intelligent person looking into these networks sees the proof. </p>

<p>Oh and before you bring up another brilliant talking point (since you guys only have a few) NO GENIUS ITS NOT LEGALLY PRESENTED PROOF.</p>

<p>Because 1) Doing illicit and amoral things at such high levels involves intelligence and covert ops, and evidence is meticulously removed. There are fail safes for fail safes, and the only reason anyone caught wind is fucking leaks. </p>

<p>and 2) If there was concrete proof, there would be no investigation. OJ wasnt convicted in one day, and other trials with more evidence take longer. It&#39;s an investigation into some of the most powerful and connected people. No shit we&#39;re not gonna pics of Podesta removing kid&#39;s hearts or raping em in his many basements. </p>

<p>However, it&#39;s one thing to <em>think</em> those things when dealing with an unruly child, and it&#39;s an <em>entirely</em> different thing to <em>act</em> on those thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that were the only suggestive picture or fact regarding that restaurant I would vehemently agree with you. But you look at the other pictures and the artwork involved, then the emails and people involved, then the fact that they hired an actor that also happened to be Hillary&#39;s friend, who just happened to walk in and make one shot only at the hard drive, and walk out, and the media going full force saying this was debunked even though this was never a complete theory, but rather an ongoing investigation, and debunked being a term they never even used before not even moon landing conspiracies, REALLY makes it look like something is going on here. </p>

<p>Listen when I read all this I thought it was such BS and would only make the right look like lunatics when we didn&#39;t even need to go here as we had so much real evidence. But there are FAR too many coincidences here. </p>

<p>I am not saying that you need to be convinced of such a damning claim, but there is enough evidence and coincidences here that you can&#39;t deplore those that do believe it. It would be irrational to say that there so little chance of this being true that these people are lunatics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you call someone with some IMDb extra credits from years ago an actor? And source on him being Hilary&#39;s friend?</p>

<p>Also the hard drive thing is invented, try finding any real source for it. IIRC there were three shots fired, one shot to open a lock did strike a computer but there&#39;s no mention of it destroying a hard drive.</p>

<p>I was on here at the time it went down, in the usual fashion there were people posting &quot;false flag&quot; before a single fact was known. There&#39;s a time for that sort of propaganda technique but I don&#39;t recall what it is. Many outright fake stories were cropping up too, traffic cameras being moved and the like, no evidence of course.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not a single allegation of a specific crime, no victims of said crime, and no witnesses or evidence.</p>

Now, if I were a kid these days, my parents could take a picture of that balled up blanket with a caption like &quot;She&#39;s the kibble!&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Its coincidence to you then, that the coded language they used in emails they thought would be private forever translates to code the FBI has IDd before.

<p>That&#39;s not how operational security works. Email is an extremely insecure technology and anyone running a criminal enterprise would know that. Are you saying they managed this worldwide conspiracy with what, hundreds of people across several countries but they don&#39;t know what encryption is, relying on code words instead? </p>

<p>The emails containing these supposed code words traversed multiple external servers meaning that it was likely sent over the internet unencrypted where anyone could pick it up. Some of these also include gmail addresses which the FBI can subpoena at any time. </p>

<p>If they suck this bad at OpSec they would never have gotten off the ground, conclusion: they are talking about fucking italian food.   </p>

Given what Alefontis writes on his instagram, given 5 decades of friendship with Dennis Hastert, given FBI code definitions, given every email and every other detail of PG, what meaning of those words makes the most sense to you?

<p>100% yes. This is far more reasonable than what you are proposing. A high end realtor is going to make a 5-6 figure commission on a deal you better believe they kiss their clients asses, especially VIPs. They probably would have offered to send back a half eaten apple if they thought it would give them a better chance at a deal. </p>

<p>Honestly I think you could use some rest and maybe a break from all this. I know my personal assurances don&#39;t mean anything but you&#39;ve clearly spend too much time on this if it&#39;s affecting your sleep.

    <div class="md"><p>It would be if there were a hundred other extremely suggestive pieces of supporting evidence. That&#39;s all pizza/pedogate is imo, a huge amount of very suggestive evidence. The amount of &quot;coincidences&quot;  is proof in itself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a coincidence that in the video of the guy torturing a child, the guy sounds exactly like John Podesta, it&#39;s another coincidence that the child calls him John, it&#39;s another coincidence that where we see a quick profile of the man, he also has the same nose and eyebrow as Podesta, also the name Skippy in the video is tossed in Wikileaks, most coincidentally is the guy that sounds and looks like John Podesta starts singing to Caillou like a maniac and says &quot;I&#39;m John Podest-&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean you have to admit that even if every piece of evidence here was only 60-70% condemning, cumulatively those facts and the fact that they all occur in less than 3 minutes of film, would bring that suspicion to over 95%, and maybe 96% when you read that Podesta talks about his torture chamber in a Wikileaks email, maybe 99% when you read the vast amounts of other email that make paedophilia suspicious on his part. </p>

<p>We all do this, it deductive and cumulative reasoning. Coincidences happening over and over again, not damning in their own right, warrant heavy suspicion if not condemnation. If you had a new room mate and every time he was home alone without other roommates, something went missing you would condemn him. You might lend credulity to someone just misplacing something the first few times something went missing, but not if these coincidences kept happening. Podestas and the Clintons, and the old establishment for that matter, consistently appear too close to paedophilia for it to be a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no no, the burden of proof is on you pizzagaters to proof something exists, it&#39;s not for us to proof that it &quot;doesn&#39;t exists&quot;</p>

<p>if investigating is easy anyone would be able to do it, of course it&#39;s hard, crowed fund, rent out the place for a part, secretly videotape it with a hidden camera.</p>

<p>nothing about the police, we can&#39;t control what they can or can&#39;t do.</p>

<p>&quot;highly doubt Alefantis is dumb enough to run a pedo ring out of a pizza restaurant.&quot; that&#39;s what pizza gate is though, people are running the pedo ring out of the place, that&#39;s what it is to begin with.</p>

<p>This makes fucking zero sense.</p>

<p>Of course people have been to CPP. People have posted pictures inside of the creepy art they have on public display. Regardless, do you really think that a pedo ring of any kind, let alone a fucking government involved pedo ring would leave evidence on display in the fucking restaurant? If and I emphasise <strong>IF</strong> there is any nefarious incidents going on at CPP, it&#39;s obviously hidden in some way. Perhaps in the 75,000 square feet of abandoned tunnels running underneath CPP and other stores?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why don&#39;t guys who absolutely think there&#39;s something going on at comet pizza crowed fund a private party there, go eat and walk around the place, ask for a tour, grab the blue print and go check every room, if you find anything remotely resembles evidence I will be a believer.</p>

<p>Yes that&#39;s a grand idea. I&#39;ll gather a group of friends and politely ask James A. if we can get a tour of the entire building. I&#39;m sure he would be thrilled to show people the <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/0aab857046.jpg">digging operations going on below</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The pasta in question was a box of uncooked noodles that he decided to finally serve up</p></li>
<li><p>He could&#39;ve meant that he was given a recipe for a certain pasta dish for Christmas </p></li>
<li><p>It was given to him for Christmas, and he decided to keep it in a freezer. Granted, this is a stretch, but not as much of a stretch as it being a subtle code for the child sex slaves he&#39;s keeping in the nonexistent basement of a pizza place in Washington, DC</p></li>

<p>The last decade has seen a rise in people regretting sex and therefore retracting their consent after-the-fact, which is ridiculous and can have serious consequences for the accused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also difficult to determine when consent was given in situations where both parties are intoxicated, which, at college is very common obviously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Louis CK may be a genius, but he is also a sick fuck. If you pay any attention at all to the comedy circuit, you know how sick already. I&#39;ve never heard Bill Burr talk about sex with kids, and I listen to his stuff a lot; if you&#39;ve got a link, please share it. David Cross I don&#39;t particularly like, wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he&#39;s a kid rapist but I&#39;ve got no inkling towards that. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a comedian who gets off on telling jokes that are &quot;extreme material&quot; about raping little kids, my feeling is you&#39;re a fucking jerk. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re all pedophiles or not, but they sure are normalizing conversation about it and no one should feel bad or guilty about pointing out that it&#39;s fucked up. </p>

<p>Milo: British journalist, author, entrepreneur, public speaker, and former senior editor for Breitbart News. </p>

<p>Silverman is a fucking comedian. Dunham is a shitty actress. </p>

<p>This political shit is what Milo DOES. It is his career, his life, what he is known for. They are just 3rd rate celebss. Like they are not even comparable in terms of what they mean politically.</p>

<p>When you whine &quot; but what about theeeeem&quot; and point to fucking actresses, you HAVE to know it minimizes any chance of taking you seriously, right? You have got to look at your mindstate here. Its classic shifting of blame and looking to make your guy look okay, which is what Kellyanne Conway does every single time she is on tv. Is this where you are learning this shit from? Please man, for all that is holy under the sun, stop these kinds of shenanigans. Don&#39;t waste your time doing something like this SERIOUSLY. People like Kellyanne are paid large sums of money to bullshit like this. She doesn&#39;t actually believe any of it. Find your footing. please.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t say this is the case, but I will say that if you want to make claims about a massive web of people who are pedophiles just because their brother knew someone who knew someone in the 70s then you need to use that same logic against everyone, not just pick and choose because not it&#39;s your &#39;side&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it stems from the fact that this is not a forum of discussion between two people.</p>

<p>One &quot;Pro-Pizzagate&quot; person may make a really well made post and then some &quot;Anti-pizzagate&quot; person may just make a dumb and uninformed comment against it.</p>

<p>One &quot;Anti-pizzagate&quot; person may make a really well made post about how this is all insane and a &quot;pro-pizzagate&quot; person may just make a dumb and uninformed comment against it.</p>

<p>Sometimes someone will just make a joke and get upvoted, sometimes serious discussions will get upvoted. Sometimes serious discussions will be side-lined by funny one liners. Sometimes funny jokes will be side-lined by insightful discussion.</p>

<p>My point is: If you are looking at this site as some sort of conclusion to an ever-going argument you will never be happy or fulfulled and you will always feel like you are losing FROM BOTH SIDES.</p>

<p>By the nature of the way this forum of discussion is designed you will never be able to have a clear and consice debate about something like this, because that is just beyond the limits of what reddit is able to do.</p>

<p>That is why it makes me so mad to see either side quoting things out of context as &quot;proof of shills&quot; and &quot;disinformation campaigns&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Look what this guy posted! HES OBVIOUSLY A SHILL!&quot;</p>

<p>Well, maybe, but maybe people were just tired of seeing the same old shit and upvoted a tongue in cheek comment. etc...</p>

<p>This is absurd. Podesta wasn&#39;t decades long friends with Hastert. There was a reference to him being &#39;a friend&#39; in context of someone wanting a keeting. Absolutely anyone who knew and worked with the Speaker of the House would be similarly implicated by this reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and just as someone that has been skeptical of this whole thing from the start (like I am with every conspiracy):</p>

<p>Milo is a guy that has openly talked in a weird way about pedophilia and you want people to assume all of his intentions were 100% innocent and that he just mis-spoke.</p>

<p>Then you have people that you accuse to be a part of &quot;pizzagate&quot; who do not speak openly about pedophilia and just post weird posts and have weird parties and you want people to assume that they are 100% guilty and definately pedos.</p>

<p>Where is the critical thinking and analysis and pages of copy/pasted screenshots for a guy like milo? I am not saying he is guilty of anything nor am I saying that pizzagate is not real.</p>

<p>All I am saying is : <strong>how do you expect people to take something like this seriously when there are so many glaring inconsistincies in your own &quot;research&quot; &amp; &quot;reporting&quot;?</strong></p>

<p>From the outside it looks exactly what you are accusing people of here: a political hit/smear attack based on nothing but circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot; while you have people on &quot;your side&quot; like milo that have openly &amp; recently openly talked about &quot;weird&quot; pedophilia things.</p>

<p>If your tactics were not meant to be a smear or conspiracy style attack on a certain group, would you not be more consistent in your attack approaches to people? Wouldn&#39;t someone that openly talks about pedophilia be investigated like this more?!</p>

<p>Trump on Jeffrey Epstein:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein likes to tell people that he&#39;s a loner, a man who&#39;s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges.   </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years</strong>. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. <strong>It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.</strong> No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;  </p>

<p>NYPD is saying there is evidence.  Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin were in the Clinton&#39;s inner circle.  Jeffrey Epstein has been convicted of sex crimes and we all know how often Bill and Hillary visited him.  The Clinton&#39;s went to bat for Laura Silsby and she is now working with Amber Alerts. These are some of the reasons people are suspicious and looking for answers.  </p>

<p>“During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” the Ivana Trump statement said. “[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.”</p>

<p>During a divorce this came out.  I am not doubting her claims, but if she doesn&#39;t want her rape to be considered literal or criminal how can you take it as an indication of anything other than one instance of an argument and sex between a husband and wife?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/">http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/</a>
A civil suit against Donald Trump alleging he raped a 13-year-old girl was dismissed in California in May 2016, refiled in New York in June 2016, and dropped again in November 2016.</p>

<p>So two different courts have ruled in Trump&#39;s favor.  I would like to see the Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s alleged victims get their day in court. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/30/a-guide-to-the-allegations-of-bill-clintons-womanizing/?utm_term=.5ee12210eb52">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/30/a-guide-to-the-allegations-of-bill-clintons-womanizing/?utm_term=.5ee12210eb52</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20440254/v_Epstein_et_al#">https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20440254/v_Epstein_et_al#</a></p>

<p>There are more than 40 Jane Does in Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s civil case.  Trump could be a rapist for all I know, but I think the reason he won had a lot to do with no one being able to prove he was as corrupt as Clinton and company, and I am sure the NSA/CIA/FBI have looked him over thoroughly.</p>

<li><p>Doesn&#39;t the prevalence of &quot;teen porn&quot; kind of indicate that attraction to people younger than 18 is fairly normal?  Teen porn is not some weird genre you have to go onto the darknet for.  Its one of the main category on any of the tube sites.  Again, if there is such outrage over attraction to teenagers, then why no outrage over teen porn?  </p></li>
<li><p>As a society do we accept teens as sexual beings or not?  I don&#39;t buy the idea that a teen can consent to sex with another teen, but not an adult.  Especially given the fact that teens are clearly attracted to adults (male teens jerk off to images of adult females, female teens have pictures of adult males hanging in their lockers, gay male teens cruise for adult males).  Milo, isn&#39;t wrong when he says this is strictly a one-way street and it is always the adult that is the pursuer. </p></li>
<li><p>The age of consent in many countries isn&#39;t 18.  Hell, for most of South America it is 14.  Put in this context what Milo has said isn&#39;t controversial at all:   </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What i heard when i listened to what he said regarding the priest was a classic victim of sexual abuse. This is actually a pretty sad case. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never talked to victims of sexual abuse or experienced that for yourself what you might not understand is that a kid does not comprehend their own lack of ability to consent. It&#39;s one of the ways perpetrators control their victims. The victim is always made to feel that in some way they asked for it, wanted it or deserved it.</p>

<p>You might think that idea goes away and the realisation that a crime took place occurs to the victim when they reach an age of understanding, but that&#39;s usually not how it goes. That idea that you are the problem persists. The part of the mind that deals with those incidents keeps operating in that childlike mind-set. You remain the one who &quot;asked for it&quot; or &quot;deserved it&quot; until the day you can face the truth and (hopefully) have someone who cares tell you that you were indeed a victim. </p>

<p>Most victims of childhood sexual abuse do not automatically see themselves as victims no matter how obviously horrible the incident might be to everyone else. That&#39;s what i saw when Milo spoke about that. A guy who has not come to terms with the painful truth.</p>

Milo was talking in a vulgar way, but that&#39;s what he does. If you actually watch the video, he says that he agrees with the age of consent, made clear he wasn&#39;t talking about pedophilia, but said that some people reach the maturity level for consent earlier than others. He was just pointing out that it isn&#39;t black and white. It&#39;s not like something magical happens to you the day you turn 18 that makes you ready - some are ready sooner than others. </p>

<p>No, they tried to frame Assange. Milo actually said this. Not the same.</p>

<p>However, I will say that I think it&#39;s wrong to dogpile Milo for this because his downplaying of such gay relationships is almost definitely a defense mechanism to protect himself from unresolved feelings about being preyed on himself as a teen. If he can&#39;t convince himself it&#39;s totally fine and even a good thing, he can&#39;t keep pretending it didn&#39;t hurt him.</p>

<p>Holy shit, that&#39;s not at all what he said. I&#39;m actually legitimately surprised that&#39;s what someone believes they heard. Milo never said he was 14 - that was Joe, and Milo ran with it.

<p>Yes, it&#39;s Milo&#39;s fault because he chose his words really really really poorly. That doesn&#39;t mean he said &quot;I think men should fuck 14 year old boys&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a conversation to be had there, and it&#39;s one that SHOLD be had. That&#39;s especially true when you consider 1) Milo agrees with the age of consent, 2) Milo has never had sex with a minor (at least not that we know of), 3) Milo is gay and has a pretty good grasp on the gay community, and 4) Milo is himself a victim of abuse. </p>

<p>There is, quite literally, nobody better to have that conversation. Taboos don&#39;t need to exist. We should be free to explore all topics in a philosophical sense (which is exactly what that conversation was). </p>

<p>No, he said the actions were good for him. He said the actions could be good for <em>some sexually mature</em> gay boys who are shunned by their communities. He never once said the actions were good for everybody, or even encouraged them. He also agreed with the current age of consent. </p>

<p>Dunno, I&#39;m not Milo and that&#39;s his quote. Someone who&#39;s &quot;sexually mature&quot; is biologically defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity">someone who can reproduce</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s &quot;about right&quot;. It&#39;s not a fixed number world wide. Hell, it&#39;s not even a fucking fixed number in America. In his home country, it&#39;s 17. In other countries, it&#39;s 14. So you can&#39;t say &quot;age of consent is right&quot; because it is entirely dependent on the country. </p>

<p>As for the whole 15 year old boy sex with his teacher thing.... You&#39;re absolutely fucking right....that is an extremely common viewpoint for society to have of that situation. But it&#39;s still a WRONG viewpoint. The problem is, a lot of society holds those views, and thus, no one really gets &quot;shamed&quot; for holding that view. (Although it&#39;s just as wrong as if the genders were reversed).</p>

<p>The problem for Milo is literally NO ONE advocates his views. They are not &quot;common beliefs&quot; held by any part of society. Well...one.....NAMBLA. He literally managed to turn himself into a pariah with his own comments because people don&#39;t fuck around when it comes to pedophilia (except in those extreme cases you mentioned, where society won&#39;t view it as a big deal, even though it should be).</p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t view it as backtracking. I can see why you would, but as someone who&#39;s been following Milo for a very long time (before he was &quot;famous&quot;), that wasn&#39;t Milo backtracking. He backtracks ALL THE TIME, that wasn&#39;t his press conference. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And this is what I disagree with. If nobody is hurting anybody, it&#39;s HEALTHY to talk about it from a philosophical sense. Maybe not so much on a drunken late night stream, I&#39;ll give you that. </p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;s right about his comments (he&#39;s not) on helping young boys &quot;coming of age&quot;. We&#39;ll never know if we&#39;re unable to talk about it. As I said, I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s right. I firmly believe sex before you&#39;re ready can have a pretty bad impact on your life. But my point is, we&#39;ll <em>never</em> know if the subject is so taboo that it literally gets you fired and your career ruined for even broaching. </p>

<p>My defense of Milo is 2 fold. First is, he&#39;s a victim. I think that gives him special leeway in discussion of the topic. Just as I&#39;d give a victim of domestic abuse special leeway in discussing the topic. Second is, as I just said.. it shouldn&#39;t be a taboo if nobody is acting. </p>

<p>As a people, we learn and grow when we explore areas (philosophically) that maybe we&#39;re not &quot;supposed to&quot; explore. </p>

<p>But seriously....you think just because a subject is taboo, but not harming anyone, it should be okay to be discussed in public? </p>

<p>You do realize there IS a reason it&#39;s TABOO already right? Because society decided that shit was fucked up, that the age of consent is what it is now, period, and that it&#39;s a nasty subject to talk about.</p>

<p>Are we seriously trying to relitigate if it&#39;s okay to diddle young boys, so long as they are seemingly gay and providing consent? It sounds to me like you&#39;re with me on being 100% against that....</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get how you think it&#39;s okay for Milo to say what he said in public, with the platform he has. You&#39;re right...no actual &quot;harm&quot; has befallen from what he said, but he&#39;s still &quot;whitewashing&quot; it in someways, in my honest opinion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s been my main point all along. Milo is a victim trying to rationalize his abuse. He&#39;s no more advocating for young boys to be raped than a battered wife is advocating for another wife to be beaten. He&#39;s merely trying to come to terms with someone he trusted, someone in power, taking advantage of him. He&#39;s convinced himself he wanted it, and it was good for him. That&#39;s TEXTBOOK behavior from a victim of abuse. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point. Talking about something doesn&#39;t mean you agree with it. Or that you think it&#39;s okay. Or that you take part in it. </p>

<p>We both talk about the Holocaust. In fact, we all talk about it during school. We learn about it, etc. I&#39;d wager we both agree that what happened in Nazi Germany was beyond terrible. That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t discuss it. Likewise about murder - there are so many books that exist about murderers, their thought process, their feelings while killing people, what they did afterwards, etc.</p>

<p>The same holds true for what Milo was talking about. The reality is, age of consent is only what it is BECAUSE someone talked about a taboo subject (yes, at one point it was taboo to suggest you couldn&#39;t fuck an 11 year old). Maybe there&#39;s a middle ground. I don&#39;t believe there is, like at all, but if we can&#39;t discuss it we&#39;ll <em>never</em> know. Maybe there&#39;s something we learn from what Milo was saying. Is there a part of that gay culture we don&#39;t know? Is society helping to shun young boys, who then make themselves easy victims? That&#39;s all information we can gleam when we make the subject less taboo. That doesn&#39;t mean we embrace the topic, only seek to understand it. </p>

<p>And I say that as someone who believes the age of consent should be the same as our drinking age. I think many 18 year olds still don&#39;t know what all sex entails, all the baggage it can and does bring. I think that&#39;s largely a product of sex being a taboo subject for discussion. We only accept it in advertising and tv, for some weird reason. It&#39;s so taboo that many adults can&#39;t even have conversations with children about sex. The lone exception being a parent. Many parents don&#39;t want schools teaching it. They don&#39;t want sex ed classes, etc. </p>

<p>However, when you put on a SS uniform, a Red armband with Swastika, and start shouting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; you get punched in the face (or denegrated by society in other ways, with good reason!). That&#39;s because that&#39;s taboo to do, an extremely frowned upon by society because we don&#39;t want those views to spread. The same applies with talk of &quot;normalizing&quot; paedophilia in anyway.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know any other way to slice it. I&#39;m not saying the guy deserves to have his life ruined (regardless of my views on his politics), just that with his platform, the public sphere is NOT the place to be figuring that shit out for yourself.</p>

<p>See, I guess I just don&#39;t view what Milo as him shouting &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;. He never advocated for young boys to be molested, he said that those relationships can SOMETIMES be good for the boy (depending on the boy). </p>

<p>I totally get it&#39;s an extremely uncomfortable conversation. Shit, I hate typing this stuff out myself. I also get how it can be viewed. And I can even understand why it&#39;s viewed as people viewed it. I don&#39;t think that warrants the reaction he got. </p>

<p>And now I&#39;ll contradict myself. He got exactly the reaction he deserved. Society reacted to the story in the way society felt was appropriate. I actually have little problem with many of the things that happened to him. His book getting canceled, him being disinvited, and leaving Breitbart are all reactions I&#39;d expect. And as those all being private entities, it&#39;s absolutely within their right.  </p>

<p>I have a <em>huge</em> problem with the way the media twisted the story about Milo. They are making him out to be a pedophile. He&#39;s not. They are, effectively, victim shaming him and I find that unfair and rather viscous. </p>

<p>I find it even less unfair when everybody was praising Salon for running a story titled &quot;I&#39;m a pedophile and I&#39;m not a monster&quot; (or someshit like that). Or when everybody ignores George Takei saying the same exact thing on Howard Stern&#39;s show. Or when the media props up Lena Dunham who admitted to molesting her sister. Or the love affair with Roman Polanski. I could go on, but you get the point. </p>

<p>I also find it extremely unfair that they (the media) sat on this story to do the most damage possible to Milo. This podcast was over a year ago. It&#39;s been public. Anybody who follows Milo knew it existed. Anybody who wanted to hurt Milo knew it existed. </p>

<p>I find it really really really really suspicious that none of his critics thought to write a story about it until he gets invited to CPAC and goes on Bill Maher. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jokes like &quot;I learned to give good head from Father so and so&quot; trivializes what thousands of young male victims went through in similiar conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That I absolutely agree with. I think the way Milo choses to deal with this is probably doing harm to other victims. I just have a hard time saying he&#39;s wrong, because I&#39;m not a victim and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d react if I were. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This wasn&#39;t hidden though. Both Milo&#39;s supporters and critics knew it existed well over a year ago, right after it happened. It was brought up on twitter way back then (when he was still on twitter). I have no doubt tips were sent to journalists to cover the story. </p>

<p>He, clearly, wasn&#39;t a big enough fish for them at that point so they ignored it. Once he became a big fish, they pounced. They turned the idea of molesting children into a political weapon. It&#39;s not the first time it&#39;s happened, for sure, but I still have no respect for anyone who does that. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, if only because that&#39;s what society dictated. With speech, it&#39;s up to society to determine what&#39;s right and wrong. As we&#39;ve established, I disagree with society on this one (and all taboo subjects, for that matter), but I&#39;m just one man in a sea of many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Milo has a long history of taking the words of other people and putting them in a context that generates outrage among his base.  Even if he has to lie about it.</p>

<p>He does this to people who define themselves by activism.  People who make a living generating outrage themselves.</p>

<p>All the people Milo has ever shit on, whether or not they deserved it, have a chance to get back at him.</p>

<p>But it is.  It is complete BS. The term cheese pizza being used in an email or whatever is not evidence of a global podesta/clinton pedo cabal.</p>

<p>It is more probable that Donald Trump is or has been associated with child or adult sex trafficking considering the weird pics he took with his daughter, the statements he has made about his daughter, other statements he has made, being associated with teenage girl pageantry. Seriously what kind of well adjusted non sex offending adult male involves himself with teen pageantry and walks backstage while they are undressing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is specifically related to members of the DNC and investigates ties to the Democratic Party. This is because it first came up through John Podesta&#39;s emails. So naturally it&#39;s going to seem partisan. There have been many conservatives and people in Hollywood accused of pedophila as well. Dennis Hastert is an example. What Milo did has nothing to do with pizzagate. And Trump isn&#39;t invincible either. If stuff as weird as pizzagate surrounded trump  we would hear about it endlessly from CNN, MSNBC, etc. Pizzagate isn&#39;t getting that kind of reaction. What I&#39;m talking about is how the media is muddying the waters. They won&#39;t investigate pizzagate but they will dig up a year old comment Milo made and deliberately plan to destroy his career once the time was right. Im not trying to say that what Milo said isn&#39;t fucked up and doesn&#39;t deserve attention. But why doesn&#39;t Pizzagate deserve equal attention?</p>

Trump and anyone even slightly associated with Trump could have those connections especially if Trump knows Epstein and the Clinton&#39;s.

<p>I&#39;m not the one that took that up as my retarded banner. Now that the pizzeria theory is thoroughly discredited PG folks are looking to distance themselves from that nonsense, but it&#39;d be better to first fully own up to it as nonsense and start over with less intellectually dishonest investigating. PG started as a smear campaign, it may have evolved for some folks but not enough to change the shape of it. The goalposts keep getting moved on what constitutes PG even though it started with Comet Pizza most PG people are jumping all over themselves to distance themselves from that now that it seems increasingly likely nothing will come from it. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree traficking rings exists but they are not related to these random accusations about the content of emails taken out of context.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that society trivializes sex, but that&#39;s an entire discussion in and of itself and I&#39;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Look, I get the &quot;Milo is a victim&quot; thing....I do...And I seriously think the guy should talk about these things with a shrink. But you don&#39;t talk about them in public, or you get scorned, like he&#39;s finding out now.</p>

<p>You brought up Nazi germany so I think that&#39;s an apt example. Is it okay to study the history, discuss the culture, even try to understand the motivations? Of course it is. </p>

<p>However, when you put on a SS uniform, a Red armband with Swastika, and start shouting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; you get punched in the face (or denegrated by society in other ways, with good reason!). That&#39;s because that&#39;s taboo to do, an extremely frowned upon by society because we don&#39;t want those views to spread. The same applies with talk of &quot;normalizing&quot; paedophilia in anyway.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know any other way to slice it. I&#39;m not saying the guy deserves to have his life ruined (regardless of my views on his politics), just that with his platform, the public sphere is NOT the place to be figuring that shit out for yourself.</p>
