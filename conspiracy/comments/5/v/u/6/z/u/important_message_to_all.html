        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is to all the backslidden Christians out there, the time is at hand! We are in the most lawless, perverse and prophetic
days in all of history! We saw from wiki leaks and to our surprise we found out our very own elite are pedophiles and are known to gather together at retreats where they worship Moloch which was even admitted in Crooked Hillary&#39;s email scandal where she literally said;
&quot;With fingers crossed, the old rabbit&#39;s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch&quot; 
and if you have dove deeper into the rabbit hole you would know that 1500 arrests of pedophiles have been made since Trump took office.. </p>

<p>We also know about Tony and Cherie Blair&#39;s secret occultic private life where it was made known to the public by the Independent UK and Jimmy Savile&#39;s rape and molestation of 450 known victims that came forward that was made known to the public by BBC and we know how he was close to Margret Thatcher the then Prime Minister of the UK and he also had close ties with the royal family and there are literally way more examples then that.. </p>

<p>PEDOPHILLIA is currently becoming normalized by Salon, a left wing so called credible
news source by libtards in which they showcase someone being proud of coming out as a pedophile saying its his sexual preference....</p>

<p>first we had the gays then we had the trans genders and then the lunatics who don&#39;t identify with their genders, these of whom which never passed basic high school level biology... then this? what&#39;s next bestiality? if you think that&#39;s farfetched you really don&#39;t know how far this evil will go.. Society is morally degrading, academia is being dumbed down to the point where professors are losing their jobs over their conservative or alternative views, students are being beaten up or ignored on campus..</p>

<p>In the bible it says a house divided shall fall and boy are we divided.. and the sad part is those who don&#39;t have spiritual discernment don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m talking about.. god said there would be a strong delusion in these days and it&#39;s so true. Anyone with an ear must listen and those who are blind need to see and come to the truth right now, this is a warning to all those who don&#39;t believe in GOD and in JESUS CHRIST do not be deceived for many have come in his name and deceived many. </p>

<p>The pope or &quot;holy father&quot;, which the bible says clearly not to call anyone the father, has openly said that Christ&#39;s death was ultimately a failure, he has openly accepted gays and atheists and said even they can find god when the bible clearly stated otherwise. With an influx of this new age religious deception including other fake religions such as Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism and Islam etc. are all tools the devils are using to surround you with.. </p>

<p>Imagine every turn that you make you are constantly confronted with deception on a mass wide scale.. where do you think you&#39;re going to get the truth from because it is void in this world and only found in the book of life, the bible. Guys I have so much to say but so little time, you need to go about your day seeking the truth. Stop going about your day being content with this life cause it&#39;s about to end.. don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t tell you so.. because that dreadful day is at the door even now. Peace be unto you all and may God&#39;s spirit guide you all. Amen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother you need to just get rid of all that which you think is right just for a moment and take that in and or search through the bible yourself everything you&#39;ve been taught has been a lie from the very beginning and I know you&#39;re a free thinker and you probably know that already but my question is how much more is it different with your belief system, if they lie to you about what they put in your food how much more would they lie to you and deprave you from real food for thought.. just a little something to sit on, I honestly want to see you and anyone for that matter overcome this.. everyone&#39;s really underestimating evil&#39;s ability to deceive.. it&#39;s sickening honestly to have spiritual discernment and to see the wickedness just all around us and people don&#39;t even know of the spiritual warfare that&#39;s going on its crazy</p>

<p>The spiritual warfare thing I can kinda relate to and I&#39;ve heard a lot of ppl lately say we are under attack.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isnt the Old Testament version of the KJV based on the flawed Greek Septuagint rather than the original Hebrew manuscripts? The New Testament part I know was based mostly of fairly late manuscripts several hundred years after Christ. Can&#39;t remember but didn&#39;t much of it even come from the Latin vulgate? Copy of a copy.... There are many cases of copying errors and insertions that made it into the KJV. To say nothing of the council of Nicaea voting on what books to include.</p>

<p>The KJV is arguably beautifully written and enriching but it is not the height of biblical scholarship or fidelity to the earliest best manuscripts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the old testament is actually Jewish text it has nothing to do with the Greeks lol I think you mean the new testament? but even then you would know that the apostles, particularly Paul when throughout the roman empire preaching the gospel, (which if you know your history ancient Greece was the pre cursor empire that ruled before Rome devoured them) and the roman catholic church basically took the gospel and took out certain parts and added works for salvation based doctrine in which they used it to accumulate all the wealth they have today, the roman catholic church is actually responsible for killing many of the saints from the bible, many of whom which wanted to convert the new testament in other languages for everyone to know but the roman catholic church being the greedy manipulative power that it was killed anyone who would dare do such a thing and burned those books along with them.. that&#39;s actually where the term &quot;layman terms&quot; comes from interestingly enough.</p>

<p>And you know what the craziest thing is? the bible predicted the 4 super powers that would arise before the end of days, </p>

<p>in order being ancient Babylon being the time which the prophecy was written, then following in order; the Persian empire, ancient Greece and Rome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Septuagint is a Greek translation of certain books (seven, in fact) of the &quot;Old Testament&quot; that was in use in hellenized Israel at the time of Jesus. It has some errors and the best translation would go to the original Hebrew.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad that King James, in his move to get out from under the reign of the Catholic Church did not think to attempt to improve on their flawed source material. Other Protestants that came after did a better job and took a scholarly and honest approach rather than relying on the idolatrous dogma of the Catholics. Translating to a person&#39;s native tongue is only part of the job. You must faithfully attempt to translate the original message to the best of your ability.</p>

<p>As for prophecy in the Bible I think there is good evidence that it was written for contemporary readers, not those two millennia hence.</p>

<p>Religion is the plague of the earth that has been used to control and manipulate the masses. Everyone thinks their own religion is righteous yet they ALL have fucked up skeletons in their closets. Whether it be priests diddling little boys or ISIS chopping heads off or Christians support for capital punishment, corporal punishment under the guise of &#39;spare the rod and spoil the child,&#39; justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men.

    <div class="md"><p>So I agree with the disadvantages. But that wasn&#39;t really the question I asked. I&#39;m an atheist, always have been, but I&#39;m starting to wonder if the Bible was created by man as a guide for how to live. You know, simple concepts like having faith. For all the flaws in religion and particularly Christianity, regular Christians seem to lead happier, more fulfilled lives. And we&#39;re becoming a society of morally bankrupt, depressed, anxiety ridden, autistic, loners. I think there are a number of reasons for that, but I&#39;m beginning to wonder if lack of religion is a contributing factor at all.</p>

<p>I dont think so personally. I think this has a lot more to do with economics. People are bogged down right now. The masses are trapped in a sea of debt that they can never and will never get out of. When the &quot;elite&quot; saw that religion was losing it&#39;s control and more and more people started waking up, they had to come up with a new plan. This is their plan. Economically cripple the masses forcing them to be 100% reliant on the state. They have migrated from mind control to economic control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all Catholicism is different then Christianity.. did you know that Catholicism is responsible for the killing of many of our Christian saints.. there is nothing Christian about Catholicism, now if you actually read the bible there is no such thing as a &quot;radical Christian&quot; because Christianity doesn&#39;t not promote or endorse radicalism in anyway unlike ISLAM where in the Quran it says that apostasy is not tolerated and should be condemned and followed by capital punishment which is basically a beheading.. that is why there is a big discussion going on with immigrants flooding democratic societies which were, (if you know anything about history), founded on CHRISTIAN VALUES.. so showing a list of &quot;so called Christian&#39;s&quot; who erred completely in the faith and are far from the teachings of the bible is completely ignorant based on the fact that you yourself never even read the bible let alone touched one and your trying to come off your own understanding... When will mankind just give up with trying to think of itself as wise, we&#39;re failures bud are you ever going get it? I pray that you do but judging by your firm stance you will never be wise.</p>

If it helps you to be a better human, then that&#39;s great. I have nothing against religious people (any religion). It&#39;s when people try to shove it down the throats of others that I start having problems with it. It&#39;s when the words of ancient texts are followed to the letter that I start having problems with it.

<ul>
<li>The origin of Buddhism points to one man, Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, who was born in Lumbini (in present-day Nepal) during the 5th century BCE.</li>
<li>Scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder or source. The history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development, with the first period being that of the historical Vedic religion dated from about 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE.</li>
<li>However, according to some, Taoism formed into a religious system within the lands of China sometime around the 4th or 3rd century BCE. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Isnt the Old Testament version of the KJV based on the flawed Greek Septuagint rather than the original Hebrew manuscripts? The New Testament part I know was based mostly of fairly late manuscripts several hundred years after Christ. Can&#39;t remember but didn&#39;t much of it even come from the Latin vulgate? Copy of a copy.... There are many cases of copying errors and insertions that made it into the KJV. To say nothing of the council of Nicaea voting on what books to include.</p>

<p>The KJV is arguably beautifully written and enriching but it is not the height of biblical scholarship or fidelity to the earliest best manuscripts.</p>
