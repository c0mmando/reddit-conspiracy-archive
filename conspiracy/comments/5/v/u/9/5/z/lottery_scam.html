<p>I&#39;ve seen a story from I think Iowa where an lottery official bought a winning ticket and got busted... It was I think the second time he did it.
I mean the whole reason the lottery was ever started was to fund the war effort.</p>

<p>They use to claim that most of the taxes from winnings went towards schools but they seem to be broke year after year.</p>

<p>Our state, the schools and stadiums both have lotteries.  The school&#39;s general fund budget goes down as the gambling money rolls in.  So the schools never get the extra money that was promised when they started the lotteries and the casinos.  </p>

<p>Seen too many cases first hand of someone spending what was likely the bulk of their disposable income on lotto tickets.</p>

<p>It should be criminal, but that would require politicians having enough backbone to clean up the debt mess found at every level of government. Too good of a revenue stream at the moment, especially when it breaks $100-200M.</p>

<p>The government takes over 50% in taxes. They don&#39;t need to rig the lotto; they always win.</p>

<p>&quot;3 Sandy Hook Victim&#39;s families Won Lottery Twice.
3 of the victim&#39;s families have won the LOTTERY TWICE:</p>

<p>Mark Mattioli won $100,000 on 9/16/11.</p>

<p>Mark Mattioli&#39;s son, James Mattioli, was a victim in the shooting on 12/14/12.</p>

<p>Mark Mattioli won $50,000 on 12/20/13.</p>

<p>the chance of this happening is like a few trillion to 1.&quot;</p>

<p>I still have no idea how people believe this wasn&#39;t a false flag.... It is mind blowing the amount of evidence there is... Just the whole gene Rosen charade alone is laughable along with Robbie &quot;are we ready yet&quot;Parker...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah a lot of people see the lottery as a major scam. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s known as the &#39;poor/dumb man&#39;s tax&#39;.  Financially well-to-do people don&#39;t squander their cash on corner deli lotto tickets or supermarket scratch offs. They can speculate on stocks if they want to gamble.</p>

<p>I walked into a western union/check cashing place the other day and saw like four or five gigantic lotto scratch off  card machines lined up along one wall. Pretty weird juxtaposition; I guess the thought is someone cashes their check or receives some funds, sees the machine and figures they&#39;ll drop a few bucks because they start imagining how better life would be if they were more financially secure. The placement is definitely deliberate and probably predatory - but so is the whole lotto system after all. You get killed in taxes then get grifted again by the lotto scam.</p>

<p>It&#39;s telling when the local news spends time chattering about tonight&#39;s mega bajillions jackpot between their segments about shitty current events. It&#39;s like, &#39;The economy is down, taxes are going up, there is no longer a middle class, unrest and riots are spreading across the country like wildfire, the proletariat grows weary and thirsts for revolution-- by the way, spend your meager earnings on a zero percent chance to become filthy rich and live like the top 1%! And now, here&#39;s the weather.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lottery is right behind the income tax as the <em>biggest generator of revenue</em> for the government </p>

<p>Think about that </p>

<p>The government relies on you spending your money to make more money after they already robbed you of money you already made </p>

<p>People don&#39;t realize that if we got rid of the lottery on Monday, many essential governmental services would collapse on Tuesday</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very sad imo. I feel bad for people that get sucked into it. I suppose the unseen grass can always be greener. </p>
