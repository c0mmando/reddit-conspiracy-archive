       Am I the only one who believes the lottery is one big scam and when the pot gets up to like 300 - 400 million it is won by some obscure person that no one knows and really goes to the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a story from I think Iowa where an lottery official bought a winning ticket and got busted... It was I think the second time he did it.
I mean the whole reason the lottery was ever started was to fund the war effort.
      </p>

       They use to claim that most of the taxes from winnings went towards schools but they seem to be broke year after year.

       Most lottery have very positive features that give back to the community.  I lived in a state that used the lottery to let students go to community college for free.

       They don't need to cheat to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our state, the schools and stadiums both have lotteries.  The school's general fund budget goes down as the gambling money rolls in.  So the schools never get the extra money that was promised when they started the lotteries and the casinos.

       Some describe it as a tax on the poor, as it is the poor that spend so much on it while people like my dad spend a few spare dollars when the amount goes over $200mil.  Done right, municipalities can use the profits for good.

       Seen too many cases first hand of someone spending what was likely the bulk of their disposable income on lotto tickets.

       It should be criminal, but that would require politicians having enough backbone to clean up the debt mess found at every level of government. Too good of a revenue stream at the moment, especially when it breaks $100-200M.

       Go back and watch the videos of those people who lost all their lotto winnings seven or eight times.  They are so fake.  Sometimes they give the people fake teeth and stuff.  It's all bad acting.  You don't win 5 times... and if you did, you don't lose all that money.  It's just actors getting caught by reporters years later.

       Thanks for the link... I never knew this and just reinforces the notion Sandy Hook was one big farce....
      </p>
      <p>
       I still have no idea how people believe this wasn't a false flag.... It is mind blowing the amount of evidence there is... Just the whole gene Rosen charade alone is laughable along with Robbie "are we ready yet"Parker...
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess people just don't believe they can possibly be lied to... But whatever.. You can't change a zebra's stripes.

       Nah a lot of people see the lottery as a major scam. There's a reason why it's known as the 'poor/dumb man's tax'.  Financially well-to-do people don't squander their cash on corner deli lotto tickets or supermarket scratch offs. They can speculate on stocks if they want to gamble.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked into a western union/check cashing place the other day and saw like four or five gigantic lotto scratch off  card machines lined up along one wall. Pretty weird juxtaposition; I guess the thought is someone cashes their check or receives some funds, sees the machine and figures they'll drop a few bucks because they start imagining how better life would be if they were more financially secure. The placement is definitely deliberate and probably predatory - but so is the whole lotto system after all. You get killed in taxes then get grifted again by the lotto scam.
      </p>

       It's telling when the local news spends time chattering about tonight's mega bajillions jackpot between their segments about shitty current events. It's like, 'The economy is down, taxes are going up, there is no longer a middle class, unrest and riots are spreading across the country like wildfire, the proletariat grows weary and thirsts for revolution-- by the way, spend your meager earnings on a zero percent chance to become filthy rich and live like the top 1%! And now, here's the weather."

       The lottery is right behind the income tax as the
       <em>
        biggest generator of revenue
       </em>
       for the government
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that
      </p>
      <p>
       The government relies on you spending your money to make more money after they already robbed you of money you already made
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't realize that if we got rid of the lottery on Monday, many essential governmental services would collapse on Tuesday
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very sad imo. I feel bad for people that get sucked into it. I suppose the unseen grass can always be greener.

       The lottery is a scam, but it's not a secret. The odds are stacked in favor of the people running it. This is how all forms of gambling work, and it's a well known fact.

       My mom went to school with a local dude who won. He spent the money very obviously and lost lots of it and became a drug addict who bought stupid cars.
