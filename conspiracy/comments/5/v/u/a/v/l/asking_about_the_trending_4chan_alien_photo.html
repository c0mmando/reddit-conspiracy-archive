    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see the picture, I just saw the fallout directly after. I am starting to think this is definitely being used to keep the autist megamind off the CNN leaks. The more I think about it, the fewer people and tools I think it would really take to accomplish this disruption.</p>

<p>Like, I want this to be aliens and secret stuff soooo bad. But imho the reptillian angle has always been psyops. And I can&#39;t find any megathread or subreddit or forum focusing on the CNN tapes. Remember what happened with podestas emails. This is potentially bigger, and yet we are chasing lizardman.</p>

<p>I do believe it may be a ruse my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short words somebody posted on 4chan politically incorrect a photo of a lizard like alien after 2 minutes the site when down when it got back up every trace of it was gone there are rumors even the downloads were gone right now only crappy versions of the photo exist there have been rumors that original photos do be uploaded to 4chan but they keep getting deleted there have also been rumors that the photo is connected to projects or experiments to outer space there was also a rumor that at the bottom os the photo there were some numbers translated into &quot;you look without knowing what your looking for. You will find the answers but simply not understand them&quot; something like that undoubtedly this may all be hoax but I&#39;m hoping this is legit you can find crappy versions of the photo on /aliens (btw the crappy version is a remake of the original photo)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything about the 4chan fiasco were true I&#39;d go with the assumption that the big coverup isn&#39;t because someone posted a photo of a real life lizard alien dude but rather that the image contained some sort of incredibly damning leaked information within its data. You know how people can send info like text or even another image by way of embedding it within a seemingly innocuous picture that requires other programs to decipher. </p>

<p>The coordinates could be related to the information hidden within the image - maybe it&#39;s a military black budget type deal being concealed in the Arizona desert? </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the theory that the coordinates (or some set of numbers included in the original post) are actually the registration number of one of the planes involved in 9/11, possibly of the plane that should have hit the Pentagon (I assume most people here believe a missile or drone was used which raises the question of what happened to the actual airliner that was supposed to hit it).</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the theory that the alien picture scavenger hunt is just a massive psyop to keep people distracted from a possible program being tested that can quickly delete &#39;sensitive&#39; information and ban anyone who tries to repost it - evidenced by the many threads being posted and immediately deleted moments after the OP tries to link it to an active thread.</p>

<p>Or maybe the mods are just yanking everyone&#39;s chain and people are independently deleting their own threads to add to the confusion. Who knows! </p>
