       I will think something of it when something is said more explicitly.  All of this "OH NO YOUR POT" sounds like a bit much for what has actually been said thus far.  Especially if you consider what Trump has said previously.

       This doesn't make sense. I'll bet trump himself has smoked weed very often and I'm sure he's not really against it.

       The only reason weed has been kept illegal is so that certain people can make massive profits from the drug war.

       Trump is straight-laced. His brother was an alcoholic and he's been famous for decades about his lack of substance usage. Trump has never drank and certainly has never smoked weed. He is completely oblivious to the effects these drugs have on people except for the negative consequences.

       Guys, it's not just big Pharma and big alcohol/tobacco that wants to see Marijuana illegal. Don't forget that Donald Trump is pro-law enforcement. Law enforcement is the main set of government institutions that plan to profit the most off of the war on marijuana. Civil asset forfeiture will increase the pocketbooks of the police departments and federal agencies. The DEA and ATF will find ways to take as much money as they can from legal dispensaries, grow op's, and financial institutions working within the marijuana industry. The Judicial system will make a killing with all of the court fees and proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a multi-billion dollar grab bag from private citizens to the Fed's "law enforcement" apparatus.

       Here's my question, what exactly are they going to do in terms of cracking down? Shutting down dispensaries? Raiding them all? I know during Obama's presidency a lot of dispensaries got shut down by Feds. And it could certainly get worse :(

       Its just the constitutional thing to do.

       Even if the whole country wants it legalized, something like this sets a precedent for an overreaching federal government. Its just to keep the balance of seperation between feds and states

       That doesn't make sense though. It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       up to the states to determine if they want marijuana to be legal by state law. But the federal gov't also has criminal laws, and right now it is illegal, by federal law, to possess or use marijuana. So making marijuana legal at the federal level wouldn't suddenly make marijuana legal in all states, it would simply mean that the feds couldn't interfere with the state's determinations (as they can now, and did under Bush, though Obama put that on hold). Additionally, declassifying marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug at the federal level would take a lot of wind out of the sails of anti-legalization advocates at the state level.
