       Now the distance from Mars to the Trappist-1 system.

       Space travel requires resources, by ruined I mean a point where we can't get enough resources to travel to other systems.

       Not that large a claim, global warming is already a threat, as is diminishing resources.

       You would assume the resources Required for space travel or at least mars travel / colonisation  could be up and running, before the world is total fucked - in this futurists somewhat scenario ?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       While you are right the world will likely be in trouble you would have to assume the elites have plans and hence joke about space travel. Maybe the deep underground military bases will be quite nice in event of nuclear holocaust.

       Exoplanets are nothing new, Trappist-1 is newsworthy because of the number of Earth-like planets and distance to Earth. Like I said, it's like finding an unusually large bit of treasure.

       A little mind experiment for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       What (in your opinion) are the differences between the process of looking for planets in general and looking for earth like planets? Hint: There obviously are none. Now with your newly aquired knowledge, please answer me two questions.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Why should it be unlikely, that these planets were randomly found?
       </li>
       <li>
        How many of the known "earth like planets" do you think have been found by complete accident?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Another important info: 40 light years away from us is not a great distance for a star.

       There's a difference in having a bag of balls and looking just for red ones and having a universe full of planets and looking just for the earth like ones. Exolanets are really hard to find in the first place, as they emit no light by themselves, so we have to use the fluctuations of the radiation of the star, the planets orbit, in order to detect them. There are no
       <em>
        clues

       where, or how to exactly look especially for earth like planets, that's what I tried you to realize.

       My definition of discovering something by accident in this case is, if you manage to find something you're looking for by complete chance, without any clues, just by analyting specific parts of the sky. That's pretty much exactly what happenes, whenever a new exoplanet is found. The process of discovering an earth like planet is always like so:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's a star we haven't checked of natural satellites, let's take a closer look.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There clearly are fluctiations in this star's radiation, so lets take an even closer look.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A certain amount of exoplanets orbiting this star has been determined, now let's check, if they orbit the star in it's habitable zone.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       4.Actually there are one or more exoplanet's in this star's habitable zone, now let's check their composition, maybe some of these are rocky planets, just like earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The process of checking wether an exoplanet is
       <em>
        earth like
       </em>
       or not doesn't start until step 3, they are discovered in the exact same way as every other exoplanet.
