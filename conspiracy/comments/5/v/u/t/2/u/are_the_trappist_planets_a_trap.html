    <div class="md"><p>A little mind experiment for you:</p>

<p>What (in your opinion) are the differences between the process of looking for planets in general and looking for earth like planets? Hint: There obviously are none. Now with your newly aquired knowledge, please answer me two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why should it be unlikely, that these planets were randomly found?</li>
<li>How many of the known &quot;earth like planets&quot; do you think have been found by complete accident?</li>
</ol>

<p>Another important info: 40 light years away from us is not a great distance for a star.</p>

<p>I stand corrected, you just said it&#39;s <em>Bollocks.</em> There&#39;s a difference in having a bag of balls and looking just for red ones and having a universe full of planets and looking just for the earth like ones. Exolanets are really hard to find in the first place, as they emit no light by themselves, so we have to use the fluctuations of the radiation of the star, the planets orbit, in order to detect them. There are no <em>clues</em> where, or how to exactly look especially for earth like planets, that&#39;s what I tried you to realize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>depends on your definition of &#39;complete accident&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My definition of discovering something by accident in this case is, if you manage to find something you&#39;re looking for by complete chance, without any clues, just by analyting specific parts of the sky. That&#39;s pretty much exactly what happenes, whenever a new exoplanet is found. The process of discovering an earth like planet is always like so:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There&#39;s a star we haven&#39;t checked of natural satellites, let&#39;s take a closer look.</p></li>
<li><p>There clearly are fluctiations in this star&#39;s radiation, so lets take an even closer look.</p></li>
<li><p>A certain amount of exoplanets orbiting this star has been determined, now let&#39;s check, if they orbit the star in it&#39;s habitable zone.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>4.Actually there are one or more exoplanet&#39;s in this star&#39;s habitable zone, now let&#39;s check their composition, maybe some of these are rocky planets, just like earth.</p>

<p>The process of checking wether an exoplanet is <em>earth like</em> or not doesn&#39;t start until step 3, they are discovered in the exact same way as every other exoplanet.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t claim there was a significant difference. Nor did I claim It unlikely </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stand corrected, you just said it&#39;s <em>Bollocks.</em> There&#39;s a difference in having a bag of balls and looking just for red ones and having a universe full of planets and looking just for the earth like ones. Exolanets are really hard to find in the first place, as they emit no light by themselves, so we have to use the fluctuations of the radiation of the star, the planets orbit, in order to detect them. There are no <em>clues</em> where, or how to exactly look especially for earth like planets, that&#39;s what I tried you to realize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>depends on your definition of &#39;complete accident&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My definition of discovering something by accident in this case is, if you manage to find something you&#39;re looking for by complete chance, without any clues, just by analyting specific parts of the sky. That&#39;s pretty much exactly what happenes, whenever a new exoplanet is found. The process of discovering an earth like planet is always like so:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There&#39;s a star we haven&#39;t checked of natural satellites, let&#39;s take a closer look.</p></li>
<li><p>There clearly are fluctiations in this star&#39;s radiation, so lets take an even closer look.</p></li>
<li><p>A certain amount of exoplanets orbiting this star has been determined, now let&#39;s check, if they orbit the star in it&#39;s habitable zone.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>4.Actually there are one or more exoplanet&#39;s in this star&#39;s habitable zone, now let&#39;s check their composition, maybe some of these are rocky planets, just like earth.</p>

<p>The process of checking wether an exoplanet is <em>earth like</em> or not doesn&#39;t start until step 3, they are discovered in the exact same way as every other exoplanet.</p>

<p>I stand by my original words. As opposed to the lies  you allude to I have Said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t follow, please show me the part of my last comment where I alluded to any <em>lies</em>
 ypu have said? Because that&#39;s definitely something that didn&#39;t happen</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It waS actually me , of the two in the conversation that implied 40 light years is actually relatively close. Hence the comments &quot;keep consuming - fuck up this planet - go to mars then Trappist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh, where did you say that? Please stop confusing me. I&#39;m the only one in this thread that has mentioned that 40 light years is not that great of a distance for a star (Source: I just ctrl+f&#39;d it). I probably just misunderstood your comment <em>&quot;The distance to earth, part is key comrade&quot;</em>, what did you mean by that then? Also, 40 light years sure might be no distance for a star, but our close descendants most likely won&#39;t live long enough, to witness anything human made arriving the Trappist system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So stick ya mind experiments where the sun dont shine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey, no need to get impolite. As I said, I just tried you to realize that just looking for <em>earth like planets</em>, without looking for all the other planets does make no sense.</p>
