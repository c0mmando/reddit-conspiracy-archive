        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off I want to say I&#39;ll post a lot here, but I can&#39;t post them all. Not enough room. I made a blog on Wordpress to help organize them all. I will post that at the end of this with mods permission. I have videos, pictures, and articles. I worked so hard on this for you guys, so I hope it all looks good to you. I have lies from every single news organization almost. Proven lies too. Not just &quot;I think they are lying&quot;.  A lot of it deserves more context, which I gave on my Wordpress, but will be less here because of room. I archived everything on the Wordpress too in case they delete anything. So let&#39;s start, don&#39;t want to waste room. </p>

<p>Elon Musk being lied to about what Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan said on 60 minutes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P8UKBAOfGo&amp;feature=youtu.be">Video</a> </p>

<p>Proof that the 60 minute reporter lied: <a href="http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1005/12hearing/">here</a> </p>

<p>Here is 60 minutes apologizing: <a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/06/60-minutes-clarifies-neil-armstrongs-position-on-spacex/">here</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQSJSwqDrbA">Here</a> Is a video of 60 minutes pushing for soundbites. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIgDZ8Usgdo">Here</a> is a video of Tucker Carlson having a guy named &quot;Dom Tullipso on his show&quot;. The guy claimed to be an anti-trump protester, that paid people to protest against Trump. Turned out the guy was trolling and it was all a hoax. His name isn&#39;t even real. The Washington Times, TownHall, Inforwars, Truthfeed, and Gateway Pundit on this guys story, before realizing it was a hoax. Some of them did updates, but The Washington Times just changed their whole story (have the archive before and after on my wordpress), and some didn&#39;t update at all. </p>

<hr/>

<p>CNN Chris Cuomo said it was illegal to possess the Wikileaks documents <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A">here</a> </p>

<p>This is a complete lie. The First Amendment offers the same protection to the media as to the rest of us, including possessing illegal documents, as long as you weren’t involved in the original illegal hack. <a href="http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/press.pdf">here</a> is the proof of that. </p>

<hr/>

<p>CNN covers unfolding crime stories happening in two different cities from the same parking lot. Basically they are just pretending to be in two different cities. <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/9x4jrq/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-standlot">here</a> is the video for that. </p>

<p>Fox News lies about unanimous vote “split” for Obama : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkqosRiyYo">here</a></p>

<p>NBC edited the Zimmerman 911 tape, to make it seem like he was being racist in the 911 call: <a href="https://youtu.be/4bDOF18xbb0?t=47">here</a></p>

<p>CNN altering Donald Trumps tweets from Twitter: <a href="https://youtu.be/09Eps97Mp_s">here</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.medialiesagain.com/img/01%20-%20v0ydnav.jpg">here</a> is a picture of what Trump said, vs how the media took it. Tons of media outlets actually. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/iranprop.php">Here</a> is an article showing that the media lied about why Iranians were protesting. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_iXfbxfwDA">Here</a> is video of CNN editing out Sylville Smith&#39;s call for violence. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/bRgGS">here</a> is John Broder from NYT lying about Telsa. <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive">Here</a> is Telsa proving he is lying, with graphs and everything. </p>

<hr/>

<p>CNN calls Assange from Wikileaks a pedophile without any evidence backing the claims: <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/312654-wikileaks-threatens-cnn-with-defamation-suit-over-pedophilia-claim">here</a></p>

<p>I have a lot more <a href="https://propagandamachineblog.wordpress.com/about/">here</a> and by a lot more, sadly I mean tons and tons more. You can just go to the top link &quot;Media lies&quot; and it will show &quot;videos&quot;, &quot;pictures&quot;, and &quot;articles&quot;. Click any of them and go to February and then it will show you everything. I wanted to organize it so it&#39;s easier to read, and you don&#39;t have a never ending scrolling page. </p>

<p>If you have any type of video, picture, or article of the media lying or showing extreme bias please link them below and I will review and add it to the site. I&#39;m sorry btw for the Wordpress not having an actual domain, I&#39;ll get it eventually.  If you see anything on the site that is wrong, please tell me, I worked hard on it, and want it to be perfect! I will continue to update as much as I can too. Anytime I find anything, and plan on doing my own research in the next couple of days on stories I know that are complete lies, but need to get all the sources proving it. </p>

<p>Also, any ads on the Wordpress are not mine. They are Wordpress ads. If you want to get rid of them use Ublock or Adblock of course. </p>

<p>Enjoy. </p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and if anyone knows how I can archive videos, I&#39;d really appreciate that. I can archive all the links, but I don&#39;t know how to archive videos. I&#39;d hate for any of the videos to be taken down and lost forever. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Hey guys, I really appreciate all the kind words. I worked hard on this, so really I do. I&#39;m doing this just to push information out to everyone. On all sides. I wanted people to realize that it doesn&#39;t really matter what side you are on, we have a huge problem with the MSM. I think there is nothing more important then Freedom of Press. I&#39;m showing all the lies, but I will admit that there is another side where journalists do care. Some put their lives at risk for us to release information. For that they are nothing less than heroes. </p>

<p>However, the side of the MSM that doesn&#39;t care at all about us. That lies to us. Uses us for profit or to push their agenda, they are doing a great disservice to the world. I don&#39;t know if anything should change, laws, regulations, ect, but I do know that we need to start keeping our eyes more open. We need to start questioning everything always. No matter what side of the political spectrum we are on. No matter where we live. No matter who we are. We need to start questioning everything, I believe more so now then ever. The MSM have become great magicians at deceiving us, and we now see more of them than the heroes. The biggest way we can fight back against this is just calling them out. Letting people know when the MSM lies. So please question everything, and share any information you find with everyone. </p>

<p>I plan on making updates every week or so on my blog, with new MSM lies. I will continue to do research. I will continue to post their lies. I will use everything in my power to make sure that this information gets out to as many people as I can. Thank you guys again for the kind words, and remember please share all information you have on the MSM,  for it&#39;s our responsibility that they don&#39;t get away with lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly after finding out a lot of stuff, looking at everything, and reading into everything.. what Pelley did, doesn&#39;t surprise me at all. It doesn&#39;t even horrify me anymore. I honestly just don&#39;t trust the media at all. Everything they now do is a complete lie to me, unless I can find 100% proof they are telling the truth. That&#39;s how bad it is. </p>

<p>I mean I&#39;ve saw reporters green screen a fucking memorial. The only reason I didn&#39;t put that on the site is cause it was a bad compilation video of other stuff too. I&#39;m trying to find the original video so I can put it on there though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is, in my opinion, the correct stance to take. There is a lot of self-interest in the news. They are companies after all.</p>

<p>Oh ya, don&#39;t forget CNN is the &quot;most trusted news network&quot; so their intro says after every commercial break. That is until you look at their trust rating. If you&#39;re going to lie about that &quot;small fact&quot; every 5 min on TV, why would I trust anything you say, CNN?</p>

<p>Thanks for this amazing post, OP!!!</p>

<p>he made it clear he had an agenda to shit on Elon Musk on cable TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardly. The 60 minutes piece glorifies Musk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmOt5OZGvhw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmOt5OZGvhw</a></p>

<p>During the interview, Pelley asks a few challenging questions, which are very softball questions by 60 Minutes standards. If they didn&#39;t include any skeptical questions at all, it would be like a commercial for SpaceX.</p>

<p>Pelley should have said that Armstrong and Cernan testified against making NASA dependent on private companies for manned spaceflight. Instead he said &quot;There are American heroes who don’t like this idea. Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan have both testified against commercial spaceflight and the way that you’re developing it, and I wonder what you think of that?&quot; Musk, of course, knew what Armstrong and Cernan had said, but it is misleading to viewers.</p>

<p>The guy was pretending to be a random protester, but he wasn&#39;t. He was a camerman that works for CNN. </p>

<p>So what exactly are the chances that a random protester, where they are recording at, that gets an interview with the corporation he works with, and no one notices until Don Lemon says something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yeah there is a lot of right stuff. But I really tried to find stuff on both sides. It was just far easier finding the right stuff because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> the_donald, and places like that post them more, and they tend to be more far right. </p>

<p>However, I did go look at <a href="/r/hillaryclinton">/r/hillaryclinton</a> , bernieforpresident and all them. I found some good things for Bernie I plan on posting later on in this week. Found a lot of media lies on him, but I need to organize them. I didn&#39;t find any for Hillary. I even asked the mods over at HillaryClinton to be unbanned so I could ask people there, to be fair. They said my ban is sticking. Which is fair. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really willing to post anything as long as it&#39;s a 100% lie. I don&#39;t care who it&#39;s about or what it&#39;s about. If it&#39;s a 100% lie from the MSM that can be proven, I will post it. </p>

<p>I will admit that I&#39;m only human and I might make mistakes, but I&#39;ll continue to ask people to tell me if I do. I&#39;ll look at things objectively and fix them. Like here. This guy was 100% right on that reporter video shouldn&#39;t be on the list. I believe even now it was a lie, and they set it up.. but if I can&#39;t prove it, it doesn&#39;t deserve a place on my list. </p>

<p>MediaMatters is a liberal website that does God&#39;s work: it analyzes hundreds of hours of Rightwing media coverage and points out lies, exaggerated claims, funny segments, etc.</p>

<p>Not all their posts cover falsehoods, however, hence me searching for the word &quot;lie&quot; in the website.</p>

<p>The incredible about their search page is how impeccably organized it is. You can filter by network, personality, show, issue, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, there&#39;s definitely a left-wing bias. But I&#39;ve never stumbled upon a website like this. There isn&#39;t a single other news site that puts in the amount of effort MediaMatters does. I&#39;ve been browsing their website more lately, and the level of organization and detail just destroys everything else</p>

<p>Soros&#39; money is almost everywhere when it comes to left-wing causes. From BLM to Planned Parenthood. I think he does this because his early life experience with Nazis caused him to despise the far-right. </p>

<p>Soros helped the U.S. overthrow the tyrannical Communist regimes in Europe at the end of the Cold War. His money and organizations helped cultivate anti-Soviet resistance in Central and Eastern Europe. </p>

<p>My point is that one shouldn&#39;t invalidate the organization just because it uses Soros&#39; money. Without that, who would fund the multi-billion dollar Koch+DeVos+Adelson+etc rightwing effort? Certainly not us.</p>

<p>She apologized later because she was called out for it. She lied, got caught, then apologized. It&#39;s still a lie. It goes to show that media just speaks without looking into things sometimes. Which is why I added it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a normal every day person. When it comes to someone speaking to millions they should be a lot more careful on what they say. She lied, she was caught, she apologized. It&#39;s something that happens all the time. And should be shown to question a couple things, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If they weren&#39;t caught would they apologize?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, then how many times have they lied and it never got brought back up again. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Like them editing footage of people, calling people out, ect. It happens a lot. </p>

<p>They should keep to facts then. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t, and good on her for apologizing. But it&#39;s still a lie, and idk if she would have apologized if not called out for it. That&#39;s why I posted it. It&#39;s still a lie. </p>

<p>I do get where you are coming from, I honestly do. Some I see and I think well they apologized and maybe it was just a misspoke or then slipping up. They are just normal people. However I have no way of telling if they lied, and just corrected themselves and apologized because they got called out, or if they really mean it. They also speak to millions and should be more careful. </p>

<p>I guess on these we will all have our opinions, but I&#39;m going to keep them added because they are lies. </p>

<p>This is where I think we just have to disagree. Newspapers, and other media outlets, have run retractions and corrections since essentially forever because mistakes happen. What matters is that the correct information was relayed when they were made aware of it, be it something they found out on their own, or someone else pointed out.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s easy to think that they are on TV so they should know everything, all the time, but that&#39;s simply not realistic. </p>

<p>But, I do think you&#39;re trying to do something noble here. This is a decent list of lies by Bill O&#39;Reilly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they should know everything all the time. I agree with that. However, I do believe that making blatant statements can cause more harm then good. The issue I seriously have is that we have no way of knowing if their retractions are made because they were caught or not. </p>

<p>I think that part really comes down to opinions. Maybe I can add under videos like this, &quot;This person apologized that is to be noted. It could have just been a mistake.&quot; or something along those lines? </p>

<p>I mean my focus is just showing that the media lie. I do know that sometimes people make mistakes, and retractions are great. I just don&#39;t know the reason why they made those retractions for good or bad. So I&#39;m going to keep the lies, but I&#39;ll also look into doing something like I mentioned. </p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback, and also the Bill O&#39;Reilly lies. I&#39;ll look into them. So much to look into today just from all the posts. I appreciate it a lot. </p>

<p>Ironically, I think you&#39;re finding yourself in the position that the media regularly finds themselves to be in -- At some point, you have to exercise editorial control and decide what you want to include and how to include it. </p>

<p>People will criticize you for that. </p>

<p>The media lies, there is no doubt there. But, I do think that by portraying a corrected instance of misspeaking as a full blown lie, you lessen the impact of out right lying. </p>

<p>Think of the difference between a &quot;falsehood&quot; and a &quot;lie.&quot;  Generally, falsehoods are considered to be untrue statements that were likely said without the realization that they are. </p>

<p>For example if your parents told you that you can&#39;t go swimming for 30 minutes after you eat, because you&#39;ll get a cramp. That&#39;s a falsehood because they, at that time, don&#39;t realize it&#39;s untrue. They didn&#39;t <em>lie</em> to you. And I imagine if they were presented with the evidence, they wouldn&#39;t stick to it.</p>

<p>Perhaps &quot;inaccuracies&quot; is a better subsection for this sort of example? Because it&#39;s certainly inaccurate.</p>

<p>See I&#39;m okay with being criticized and reading peoples opinions, thinking on them ect. However, I won&#39;t lie. That&#39;s really my issue here I understand the media messes up. I understand there are mistakes. I understand that the media is ran by just normal people. However, because they speak to a large base I think they should be more careful, and should be judged harshly for their lies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a normal person. I don&#39;t work for the MSM or any news organization. I think there is a huge difference between bloggers, social media posters, and the MSM. </p>

<p>I will have to disagree here. Like I said we have no real way of telling why they apologized. I think I should add that yes they did apologize, make your own opinions on that, but the statement at start was a lie. For context and allow people to make their own opinions. Personally I think it goes to show that we should trust them less just because they don&#39;t know everything, and we walk around thinking they do. Idk that&#39;s just my opinion. </p>

<p>Yes but how do we make that distinction? It&#39;s pretty impossible without reading that persons minds.</p>

<p>For example, I have a video where the title first off is</p>

<p>&quot;Anderson Cooper from CNN denies that Hillary Clinton laughed in a tape over a 12 year old rape victim. Don Lemon did the same thing.&quot; </p>

<p>On my site. I added context: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before anything, I want to say, I know it was Hillary Clinton’s job to defend the accused in the court case. I’m not arguing that. All I’m showing is that Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon is denying that it ever happened and that Hillary Clinton had been recorded laughing about the case. I’m not arguing, defending, or saying anything on Hillary Clinton. I’m just saying Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon denying something that is well known (That Hillary Clinton defended the accused in this case, and that there is recording of Hillary Clinton laughing about the case) is a lie. In fact CNN reported about the story before, so him saying “not in this network” is a lie itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I post the videos. </p>

<p>Now maybe Anderson Cooper just didn&#39;t know about all of this. Or Don Lemon. Maybe they didn&#39;t know that their own network a few years back had reported on this exact thing. Maybe they just misspoke. Maybe in a lot of these instances they misspoke and just made mistakes like Brian Williams lying about his airplane getting shot down while he was with some soldiers. But how do we make that distinction between knowing that they lied or it&#39;s a falsehood. Or that if they did apologize they are doing it because they were caught or because they  feel bad for messing up.  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m doing is just posting the lies. And I guess on the other things where I can&#39;t make that distinction, everyone else needs to just decide for themselves. </p>

<p>I do believe that maybe I should add more context to the video you mentioned and others, which I will do.. but overall I&#39;m just posting lies. I have no way at all of knowing their intentions or knowing if it was a mistake. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example if your parents told you that you can&#39;t go swimming for 30 minutes after you eat, because you&#39;ll get a cramp. That&#39;s a falsehood because they, at that time, don&#39;t realize it&#39;s untrue. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but a parent is a parent. Maybe they should look for the information through google or w/e means.. but the media itself is supposed to be that information. Parents or whoever can have opinions or beliefs all they want, before looking into information (Which sadly happens a lot).. but the MSM&#39;s responsibility is to make sure they have that information before passing on beliefs or w/e. </p>

<p>Like the video you mentioned for example. Let&#39;s say she did misspeak. Honest mistake. The question is still, shouldn&#39;t she, for working at the MSM, knowing her job comes with a great deal of responsibility more so then most, look into the stuff, and make sure she 100% has the facts before she spoke? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps &quot;inaccuracies&quot; is a better subsection for this sort of example? Because it&#39;s certainly inaccurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good idea. Maybe using the word inaccuracies for these instances would be better. Later when I add more to my &quot;blog&quot; I&#39;ll change the rhetoric for these types of videos as inaccuracies with added context. Because I do believe you are right that we have don&#39;t know if it was an honest mistake, and some good very well be. </p>

<p>My answer to this is yes and no. You have to consider the context of the program. This was a &quot;talking heads&quot; show - one in which conversations are had with a guest. During a conversation, you can&#39;t just stop to double check facts. Which is why a correction indicates, to me, it&#39;s not a lie. What happened is they went to break and someone realized what she said was not true, and they addressed that. </p>

<p>If it was a scripted news program, then I would agree with you a lot more. For example, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call out O&#39;Reilly if he did the same thing while discussing with a guest. But, when he does his scripted segment at the end of the program, he should be a lot more truthful than he has a tendency to be. The context of the mistake makes a big difference.</p>

<p>This page lists personalities by name, which you can click to see a list of statements they have made and the supposed truthfulness of them <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/personalities/">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/personalities/</a></p>

<p>In your case, I would click a name and then click &quot;Pants on fire&quot; in the chart which will show you that person&#39;s outright &quot;lies.&quot;</p>

<p>This Hannity one is a great example of the documentation they provide because he responded to their claim citing a new source, and they further investigated it, and include that information on the article.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/26/sean-hannity/250000-syrian-refugees-us-fact-check-trump-hannity/">http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/26/sean-hannity/250000-syrian-refugees-us-fact-check-trump-hannity/</a></p>

<p>The only real drawback with them is they aren&#39;t super fast at new reports. but for your purposes, that&#39;s probably fine.</p>

<p>Hardly. The 60 minutes piece glorifies Musk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmOt5OZGvhw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmOt5OZGvhw</a></p>

<p>During the interview, Pelley asks a few challenging questions, which are very softball questions by 60 Minutes standards. If they didn&#39;t include any skeptical questions at all, it would be like a commercial for SpaceX.</p>

<p>Pelley should have said that Armstrong and Cernan testified against making NASA dependent on private companies for manned spaceflight. Instead he said &quot;There are American heroes who don’t like this idea. Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan have both testified against commercial spaceflight and the way that you’re developing it, and I wonder what you think of that?&quot; Musk, of course, knew what Armstrong and Cernan had said, but it is misleading to viewers.</p>

<p>Like the video you mentioned for example. Let&#39;s say she did misspeak. Honest mistake. The question is still, shouldn&#39;t she, for working at the MSM, knowing her job comes with a great deal of responsibility more so then most, look into the stuff, and make sure she 100% has the facts before she spoke?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My answer to this is yes and no. You have to consider the context of the program. This was a &quot;talking heads&quot; show - one in which conversations are had with a guest. During a conversation, you can&#39;t just stop to double check facts. Which is why a correction indicates, to me, it&#39;s not a lie. What happened is they went to break and someone realized what she said was not true, and they addressed that. </p>

<p>If it was a scripted news program, then I would agree with you a lot more. For example, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call out O&#39;Reilly if he did the same thing while discussing with a guest. But, when he does his scripted segment at the end of the program, he should be a lot more truthful than he has a tendency to be. The context of the mistake makes a big difference.</p>
