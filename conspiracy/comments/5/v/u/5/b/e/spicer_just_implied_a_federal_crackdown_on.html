<p>I&#39;m curious how Libertarians for Trump feel about this. Feeling hosed yet? Any semblance of Trump being some social moderate is fading fast. Should have been obvious the instant Sessions was appointed AG. </p>

<p>Broader question to the board: If you were an aspiring totalitarian regime, wouldn&#39;t the topic of conspiracy be of great value to you? Wouldn&#39;t it behoove you to maintain various narratives in which your political/ideological opponents are under constant suspicion of conspiring to do terrible shit? The focus will be solely on THEM (the opposition, the enemy, the evil conniving disgusting inhuman Other)  leaving you to do whatever you wish. Not saying this board is a hive of directed anti-everything but Trump hatred and fear-mongering, but I am definitely feeling it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this is in another thread on the subject; we start a petition.  Someplace like Change.org, that states very simply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We the undersigned will vote for Democrats in every upcoming election, major or minor, if this current administration cracks down on marijuana in any way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m tired of this shit.  It&#39;s all seriously the dog shit police and prison guard unions.  Literally the worst people on the face of this Earth and I don&#39;t care if anyone here has them in their family.  They&#39;re puritanical, authoritarian, stupid Nazis that only have one skill; smashing heads and looking mean doing it.  That&#39;s it.  So they protect the only jobs that trade in that skill; knucklehead police and security gigs. </p>

<p>So, from now on anyone who cares about this at all should actually fight back.  It&#39;s simple, vote against these people.  Actually turn out.  Threaten to bring HillDog back if he fucks with weed in any way.  &quot;We, the 60% of America that support legal pot, will vote for the Hillary Clinton / Mark Zuckerberg ticket in 2020 if the Trump administration so much as touches pot&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck puritans.</p>

<p>The thing that&#39;s always struck me about the anti-establishment crowd: what comes next? You burn the whole world down but rarely mention what you&#39;d like to follow. A country run by it&#39;s people, for their own best interests...yeah, that&#39;s the dream. Giving corporate America unprecedented power is not the way there. Increasing the police state apparatus and discriminatory policies? Allowing the religious right access to public school money and the political machine? None of that is anti-establishment, it&#39;s just anti-&quot;liberal,&quot; previous establishment. No sign of corruption or conflicts of interests being defeated, just increased exponentially, if not encouraged. It&#39;s unbelievable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have they stated yet whether marijuana can be used as a pre-emptive solution to many illnesses. If it can be shown to either cure or ease symptoms for sufferers of catastrophic illness, then it&#39;s use as a preventative should be explored rapidly and be presented before the appropriate bodies. Why do people assume because one person makes a decision based on their limited knowledge, that it should end there. Take umbrage and demand that you as a whole are heard, but show some qualifying data.</p>

I understand that msm is heavily mediated  over there, but are people who voted for this change that cowed that they will accept every decision that is taken.

<p>Feeling hosed yet? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I am not. Did you feel hosed when Obama (arguably had the worst stance on medical marijuana in our nation&#39;s history) spoke out against it? Or Bush? Or the Clintons (because neither supported it)? </p>

<p>Trump supporters understand this marijuana conversation is outdated and old If you search around the interwebs, you&#39;ll see a strong resistance to what was said today about marijuana. There are even conversations about how to really get the government (you know, since this has more to do with Congress than Trump) to change their mind soon. Wow. </p>

<p>I have been an avid recreational smoker for years. Health issues now classify me as a medical smoker. Marijuana is a big issue for me but I understand this isn&#39;t something the fed will do and we&#39;ll see a trickle down. The states have to continue to legalize. The people have to continue to speak out. Tie the hands of the fed and they&#39;ll change their tune. </p>

<p>And.. being an avid smoker who cares deeply about the medical, social and monetary benefits of marijuana.. I still think kids being kidnapped, sold, tortured, raped and so on is a bigger deal right now. </p>

<p>But! Thankfully... I can manage two topics at once. On a good day, I can manage three topics. /s</p>

<p>He said that about it. Which, if you ask some people it apparently means he does not care one way or another, as long as congress makes a law to legalize it. I don&#39;t see them doing that. </p>

<p>People have also said that means he is against it, and he&#39;s going to enforce it, cause that is the law, and if they want him to to not do that, fuck you make a law. </p>

<p>Thing is half the shit these guys say is vague probably on purpose. It&#39;s much more likely to me that they&#39;d come after it cause it&#39;s an easy target, historically. </p>

<p>If you had your own 200MW reactor in your back yard, running cheaply, and reliably, and if anyone tried to control your energy you&#39;d tell them to shove it. They don&#39;t want that, they want to tax you $100+/mo to turn your lights on, they want to cut you off if you don&#39;t pay tribute. The reason nuclear energy is so restricted and controlled is because they don&#39;t want normal people to be energy independent. They want you as dependent as possible on their shitty product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most scary thing IMO is TD has created an actual Fascist environment where ZERO questions can be asked.  ZERO DISSENT IS ALLOWED.</p>

<p>Many users of that sub only visit that sub and they only see positive things and have on idea things like this are going on.</p>

<p>The admins who i believe have ties to Bannon have created the largest echo chamber ever seen and control the narrative like nobodies business.</p>

<p>As a Trump supporter Ive been banned from TD at least 15 times for questioning certain moves.  The reaction is always You aren&#39;t a real Trump supporter, no concern trolling, sharia blue etc.</p>

<p>I worry about the people there because many are the ultimate sheep with blinders on.</p>

<p>How is this topic not being discussed at all on TD?</p>

<p>It truly is amazing that this of all things is no where to be found on TD</p>

Further, he convinced actual people to get out of their homes and work environmentd to drive down to their polling station on election day to physically select him as their potus. He did this in 30 states, culminating a complete constitutional electoral victory.</p>

<p>r/the donald isn&#39;t conformist anything. It&#39;s one single subreddit showing support for the man, shame on them. As if Trump support is openly accepted on reddit anywhere as is.</p>

<p>Trump supporters on the <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> subreddit, where many speculated that the organization is a scam and criticized its initiatives as “astroturfing.”</p>

<p>OK so basically some random rich guy wanted to support Trump&#39;s campaign by astroturfing, But if you actually think about it the amount of Trump supporters doing the astroturfing is hilariously low since it goes against their beliefs...</p>

<p>Is this seriously all you got? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it is an interesting point the article you have posted points out about the difference in stance with state laws vs federal with transgender laws and recreational cannabis, and I was just pondering that sort of... inconsistent narrative the administration has pushed in .. the same day right? </p>

<p>This follows in to your broader question, because sewing confusion and chaos into your public persona as the most powerful official in the world would probably do well for pushing a totalitarian regime. </p>

<p>If the truth is a total enigma, it becomes a lot harder to focus on what the truth actually is, and just like the dispute about &quot;how many people showed up for the inauguration&quot; bs, this is just another tactic to make people give up searching for the truth in some ways. </p>

<p>I support legalization but this is a mischaracterizing what was said. Medical marijuana will be supported - something Obama would not endorse... everything else will be up to the states. Federal law on recreational marijuana remains the same as it did under Obama. </p>
