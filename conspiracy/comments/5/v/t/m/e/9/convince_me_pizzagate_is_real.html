       This is why most people don't believe pizzagate and conspiracy theories. Don't conflate different things. Pizzagate doesn't mean pedophilia throughout the world. This isn't a giant conspiracy. Stop connecting bullshit strings. Yes, Saville was a pedophile who was helped by powerful people for decades. And???????

       That's the problem OP. 
It's not about a pizza shop in the United States and the Podesta emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emails linked in major party players, and the relationships established between those in DC, and others across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name Pizzagate, is terrible, and some theorize to be utilized on purpose. Those who research Pizzagate do not limit their scope to Comet Ping Pong in DC. It expands beyond that. Comet Ping Pong was the initial stepping stone that lead to the chase of people all across the globe. That linked in Haiti with Monica Peterson and Laura Silsby. The art scene with Pegasus museum, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you realize the connections to John and Tony Podesta, James Alefantis, Silsby, Clinton, etc, you realize that their grasp truly is above and beyond a lowly pizza shop in DC.

       Before it was set to private on 11/7/2016, public activity was dominated with references to obscene art, sexual activity, in combination with images of children, joined by derogatory/sexually suggestive commentary from various users. Some posts are evidence of the ties between James Alefantis and prominent figures.

       James Alefantis used the term #chickenlovers which is slang for a homosexual attracted to young male children in this Instagram post. The New York Times intentionally ignored this and other very damaging Instagram posts which contain obvious references to pedophilia/pederasty.

       you want definitive proof and it's not there.  Just a huge long string of many coincidences.  There's nothing wrong with you wanting proof.  Just wait and it will come or it won't.

      <p>
       Many of us consider the coincidences as too numerous to ignore.

       I consider the massive
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/">
        pizzagate disinfo campaign
       </a>
       that has been operating since pizzagate day zero to be some good evidence that pizzagate is real.  Factual coverage of pizzagate by notable media, such as Ben Swann, was quickly shut down.  Add this evidence of a cover-up campaign to the email code words, artwork, social media pictures, and various other circumstantial evidence and I believe "pizzagate is real"
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is "pizzagate"?  I think pizzagate is that there is a very high likelihood many government officials are pedophiles/abusing/sex-trafficking children.  I do not think it is likely that they are torturers/murders/blood-drinkers/organ-stealers (especially operating out of chambers beneath a pizza shop) which is what the disinfo shills are hellbent on turning pizzagate into.  The evidence to push this narrative (such as the wikileaks "torture chamber" email, or fabricated 4chan LARPs, can be easily debunked).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I am sure deaths/homicides happen in rare instances (the average lifespan of someone being sex-trafficked is 7 years, and 10% of people sex-trafficked are under the age of 18).  But I don't think you can order children off a menu in Washington, DC and murder them in basements to appease your Satanic Ritual needs.  That would be bad for business.

       It's about, first and foremost,human trafficking and, secondly, blackmail.  It sounds you think pizzagate is just about implicating John Podesta and democrats. For some people it is, but there's more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of proof that human trafficking involves high level players. The dutroux affair, the norway busts, the bbc special that got swept under, the anderson cooper special that got swept under...
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate only refers to Podesta's very questionable emails that, at best, read like an order for a drug deal. The connections to pedophilia vis-a-vis terms and symbols is conjecture, granted, but that's the kind of conjecture investigators rely upon when following leads. It's much bigger than podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of pedophilia in blackmail is a bit suspect, but it's a pretty great theory that offers a credible reason for "Why would they?" along with all the CP found in the pentagon and Anthoney Weiner's laptops, for example. It is also would answer the question of why sites like "Lake City Quiet Pills", which was a dark web site for hitmen and their clients, was, at first glance, a pedo site full of CP- they could keep their clients quiet because they could prove they visited a CP site...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you want me to prove that Pizzagate is real, I would just point to podesta's emails. There is pizza mentioned and it's obviously not about pizza.

       If you want to be convinced this kind of evil actually happens, google anything I mentioned above.

       I'm looking to be convinced. Convinced that a pizza shop was/is a front for pedophiles. Forget the politics and political figures and hints of government sex rings and yada yada yada. Is this place actually a front for pedophiles?

       True. I think there's some truth here but it has been so drowned out and abstracted by wild conspiracy theories and people finding pizzagate connections in anything and everything.

       I actually want to be convinced. I was just watching W. Bush's state of the union speech after 9/11 and behind him was now convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert and former KKK member Robert Byrd. So it wouldn't shock me.

       Pedophilia and sex trafficking are very real. That doesn't mean Comet and these emails are connected however.

       I'll pass on voat. I've known about it. It's peppered with politics and coincidence pieces viewed as fact. It's been bloated to the point where most of the posts have nothing to do with the essence of pizzagate beyond pedophilia being involved.

       it's almost like no one can provided a short coherent argument for pizzagate IMO.

       So Im supposed to type something out and the reader isnt supposed to
       <em>
        **READ
       </em>
       * it?  So if the person asking the question isnt going to read anything, then why are they asking the question.  If they are asking the question and want an answer they can read, why reinvent the wheel when the person can be directed to the same information already gathered?

       Why haven't anonymous and other groups hacked further and helped to get to the bottom of this? What's stopping people from uncovering further real evidence when Podesta is obviously sloppy with security?

       there are pedo politicians then no one here can help you.  That is just a known known.  Its an accepted fact.  Its not a question of "if" there are pedo pols, but who are they?  Thats the question that PG is answering.  You probably wont like the answers though.

       So Im supposed to type something out and the reader isnt supposed to
       <em>
        **READ
       </em>
       * it?  So if the person asking the question isnt going to read anything, then why are they asking the question.  If they are asking the question and want an answer they can read, why reinvent the wheel when the person can be directed to the same information already gathered?
