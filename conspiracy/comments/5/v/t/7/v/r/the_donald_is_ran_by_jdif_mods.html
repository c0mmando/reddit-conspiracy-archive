       Her family allowed the bushes to fly in tons of cocaine into this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately addiction has affected multiple family members. I did my research and found out a Dominican drug cartel connected to iran contra has been operating in a major city about 30 mins from me for over 25 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The feds were going to bust them in the 90s, but the investigation was closed because the cartel was connected to a Dominican presidential candidate that was favorable to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is when i got into truthseeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when people call me a shill or a leftist because i dont support trump, i wish the worst possible cancers on those people and there familes. Then maybe they could understand a lil bit how i feel every day.

       I find answers like this too funny to keep quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how I know this is the work of something much more powerful than the human mind is working this all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rothschild is the founder of white supremacy and the richest family on the planet. They are the reason that whites in America get to live so well and how the white power structure around the world stays in tact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you chose Donald Trump over Hillary is fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Donald you get a loud outspoken and destructive force that will surely lead to the world turning against America.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Hillary you would have gotten the same thing you've been getting but at least it would have came with perks, for whites at least. Her entire game plan was subvert and uplifted the white agenda behind the scenes whereas Trump is telling everyone the plan to their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's posted here all the time, Hillary killing indigenous people and what not, toppling indigenous governments for the further exalting of America. Hell the woman was basically a modern day Christopher Columbus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you chose the Greedy guy, the guy who can't stop engorging himself on the gains of the oppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go big or go home was the motto the entire time. Now the entire world has to watch you guys
       <em>
        sweat
       </em>
       because deep down you know this is a hail-Mary play on the last down for the super bowl, winner takes the world.

       I suppose it's all irony by God.

       When you post a link, you cant add a comment until you submit the link. Sometimes link posts need context. I like to add to my posts so the reader understands why i posted what i posted. 
Currently this is the only account im using. Never meant to log out or whatever the fuck was implyed.

       yes there are a lot of t_d users here but they don't get to decide what kind of sub this is. it IS a conspiracy sub. to say "oh well we lost our sub to politics" is defeatist. I like this sub so why would I just give it up because it's gotten messy?

       why bash your head against the wall when you can just call out the people who misuse the sub? if something is blatantly not a conspiracy, say so. if someone's breaking one of the 12 rules, report them.

       There are ways to counter JIDF, instead of defending Iran and attacking Zionist, you can defend Israel and tell that they should attack Iran, they have the right now. Israel will never attack Iran on it's own and comments like this makes Israel look bad even though the masses upvote it because it follows the circleyerk of the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       When enough comments like that are flooding the wordnews sub it will only make the Israelis look weak because they are not doing anything themselves.

       My claim was a stretch, I'll admit, but I was literally banned just for questioning Israel for "concern trolling". I think it's just fishy when they're all for free speech but the same people attacked me for going after this subject and not agreeing with trump on this. Yet, I've seen several posters on there saying they're going to keep trump straight, I doubt it.

       Same here, speaking ill of Israel actions aren't a damnation of the Jewish people (and if anyone views my criticism as such, I apologize in advance) it's condemning actions of the Neocons and Conservative Zion ambitions. I found this website here...

       This really helps me sort out what's going on the Middle East and how it all blends together as far as geopolitics. The authors are Jewish too so I don't think there is any Neo Nazi vibes coming from it ala Stormfront or Red Ice Radio.

       Dude you are right the mods are JDIF, Nimble America.  They have created the most fascist sub on reddit.  Zero questioning is allowed.  So many TD users only get their info from TD and have no idea abot most of the things going on because the first whiff of dissent is met with a down vote and a ban.
