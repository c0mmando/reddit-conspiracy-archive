<p>Unfortunately addiction has affected multiple family members. I did my research and found out a Dominican drug cartel connected to iran contra has been operating in a major city about 30 mins from me for over 25 years.</p>

<p>The feds were going to bust them in the 90s, but the investigation was closed because the cartel was connected to a Dominican presidential candidate that was favorable to the US. </p>

<p>This is when i got into truthseeking.</p>

<p>So when people call me a shill or a leftist because i dont support trump, i wish the worst possible cancers on those people and there familes. Then maybe they could understand a lil bit how i feel every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find answers like this too funny to keep quiet.</p>

<p>This is how I know this is the work of something much more powerful than the human mind is working this all out.</p>

<p>Rothschild is the founder of white supremacy and the richest family on the planet. They are the reason that whites in America get to live so well and how the white power structure around the world stays in tact.</p>

<p>The idea that you chose Donald Trump over Hillary is fascinating. </p>

<p>With Donald you get a loud outspoken and destructive force that will surely lead to the world turning against America.</p>

<p>With Hillary you would have gotten the same thing you&#39;ve been getting but at least it would have came with perks, for whites at least. Her entire game plan was subvert and uplifted the white agenda behind the scenes whereas Trump is telling everyone the plan to their face. </p>

<p>It&#39;s posted here all the time, Hillary killing indigenous people and what not, toppling indigenous governments for the further exalting of America. Hell the woman was basically a modern day Christopher Columbus. </p>

<p>Instead you chose the Greedy guy, the guy who can&#39;t stop engorging himself on the gains of the oppressed. </p>

<p>Go big or go home was the motto the entire time. Now the entire world has to watch you guys <em>sweat</em> because deep down you know this is a hail-Mary play on the last down for the super bowl, winner takes the world.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s all irony by God.</p>

<p><sup>Your</sup> going to wish Hitler would have Won WW2 but hate to break it to you that wasn&#39;t the War plan. Controlled Opposition is always lead to defeat and Germany was the Controlled Opposition. WW2 was nothing more then Step 2 in a 3 Step Plan, The proof is in that WW2 America should have shielded Germany (all of it) from the Communist and this holocaust wouldn&#39;t be in history. The Machine Master Have been Hard at Work for over a 100 Years To Transform all these Western Civilization and its people into Something that&#39;s Mirror the Middle East.</p>

<p>injustice towards women/lgbtq</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just an excuse. People want something to hate, and their oppression of women and LGBT are just an excuse to legitimise hating them. It&#39;s funny, because Saudi Arabia is the one that&#39;s providing a lot of manpower (terrorists) to fight America&#39;s covert wars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zionists vs the globalist Jews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait... They aren&#39;t the same?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>war to happen in Iran</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their God King Emperor Trump campaigned on being tough with Iran and China, one of the options is war. So yes, it stands to reason that they will &quot;allow war to happen&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>question the Mossad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcd-yvudYSg">supported and funded by Israel Firsters and Zionists (start watching from 9:30)</a>, and he has made it very clear that he is very pro-Israel.</p>
