<blockquote>
<p>Spicer on Thursday, however, linked marijuana use with the widespread abuse of painkillers, suggesting that allowing recreational use of marijuana could be interpreted as condoning drug use more widely.</p>

<p>“When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people,” Spicer said. “There is still a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana and drugs of that nature.”

</blockquote>

<p>and the prisons thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department has reversed an order by the Obama administration to phase out the use of private contractors to run federal prisons.</p>

<p>In a memo made public on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Obama policy impaired the government&#39;s ability to meet the future needs of the federal prison system.</p>

<p>Shares of the two leading U.S. private prison companies gained in after hours trading, with GEO Group Inc up 2.15 percent and CoreCivic Inc up 3.44 percent.

We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

    <div class="md"><p>Very honest question. </p>

<p>If the rule of law is a democracy, and the people can get together and draft a proposal, and that proposal can get on a ballot, and if that ballot passes it&#39;s the law. </p>

<p>Why even incorporate the tax?</p>

<p>It would seem (to me at least) with weed legal there would be less people in the system, being arrested, being tried, being put in prison, So simply legalizing it would save the state a ton of money. </p>

<p>On top of that you could still collect a sales tax on all weed sales and bring in more revenue. </p>

<p>Why put an additional tax on top of that? It just seems very strange to me. </p>

<p>If weed were legal we could spend less on legislation, enforcement, trials, lawyers, and imprisonment. Saving a shit ton of money, and we could make money on the already existing sales tax. It just seems like a Win/win/win/<sup>win<sup><sup>win<sup><sup><sup>win<sup><sup><sup><sup>win</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>Why add the extra tax on top of it? </p>

<p>I still think a 24x7 rally for the president of the United States is rather off-putting</p>

<p>I had no problem with this during the campaign, but having a 24x7 rally without any critical voices allowed for the most powerful man in the world feels a bit more like state propaganda </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty brutal observation.  You&#39;ll see it in they way that they argue, too.  Echo chambers are destroying people&#39;s ability to critically think and have intellectually honest discourse.  Good luck having an in-depth and nuanced discussion with a member of an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Repetitive chanting, regurtitation of the same mantras and the gifts are all cultish behavior. Not allowing even neutral stuff. </p>

<p>The obsession with pedos and pizzagate is used to give people a sense of shared purpose as they track down the vile podesta pedophile network. Everyday it is insinuated that soon MASSIVE pedo busts are coming, people use cryptic tweets to justify it. </p>

<p>When nothing happens that day everyone fucking drops it like a sack of potatoes, and since shit just flies to the top up there, it is quickly scrubbed from peoples memories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kinda reading too far into it. Most people on T_D probably realize that the subreddit is a circlejerk and keep their doubts about Trump to themselves. For example, I&#39;d never post anything negative about Trump on T_D but outside T_D I speak my mind freely and feel like there&#39;s plenty of reason to be skeptical about Trump.</p>

<p>You&#39;re 100% right about the repeated chants, the pizzagate, pedo shit, etc. though. A narrative is repeated on there again and again and again until everyone believes and supports it. For example, when Trump announced Mike Pence as his choice for VP there were many people commenting in the threads expressing their doubts for the pick talking about his poor record with LGBTQ, etc. </p>

<p>But then the shitposts began and then people started supporting Mike Pence - I bet most people don&#39;t even know anything about his policies but just say &quot;BASED PENCE&quot; to fit into the group. Same shit goes for literally every one of his other cabinet picks. There&#39;s certainly dangerous elements in that sub because they&#39;ve already kind of branded their opposition as satanic pedophiles, etc. while praising the God Emperor as if he&#39;s perfect.</p>

<p>But overall I&#39;m not too worried because I think (or atleast hope) that most people on there are just memeing and trying to fit in and don&#39;t genuinely believe everything they read/post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to agree, I was also exaggerating the &quot;sinister&quot; angle a bit as a joke too. The not believing memeing though, I dunno about some of that. The marijuana news for instance, I have never seen so many people seemingly shook all of a sudden on there. Like people were like fuck that, &quot;im not sure, maybe he has a grander plan&quot;, and stuff. I have an inkling there are a larger amount of young, probably first time voters in there. If that were the case, they would have grown up in an extremely liberal cannabis time, right? Cause I look at republicans and I don&#39;t see weed getting through them. I dunno.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen more libertarian refugees from Trump after that announcement too, but in other subs. </p>

<p>This is the dangerous element. They simply cannot accept that Trump may do some things that they may not agree with. I even saw a thread on 4chan /pol/ that tried to brand this as a genius move to quickly deport the illegal immigrants by charging them with marijuana possession lol... It&#39;s simply put just mental gymnastics so they don&#39;t have to admit that they were wrong.</p>

<p>This is either appeasing to big pharma, corporate prisons, or his evangelical base. Or all three. Even if it&#39;s just one of them, fuck him. Small government my ass. </p>

<p>So the issue was basically not touched, states were left alone to do their own thing. Weed was technically illegal on the federal level due to the interstate commerce cause, but legal in places like oregon where I am.</p>

<p>The problem is is that we have been working on the assumption the feds were going to leave us alone. Basically, the feds could have come in and fucked with us, but we basically were told in the last admin &quot;it&#39;s fine&quot;. </p>

<p>Indicating you are about to begin to enforce the laws that for so long have not been enforced, and an actual industry popped up. </p>

<p>Saying you&#39;re going to start enforcing those laws makes people like investors spooked-- why would you want to drop thousands of dollars for a business the feds can just decide to come shut down the next day?</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So I employ a couple people to trim the weed after its finished. If the feds come and arrest me for producing cannabis, not only am I looking at a felony, the people I employ no longer get paid, investors lose their money cause the gov seizes it... etc.</p>

<p>In the legal state, jobs. These people aren&#39;t criminals. They pay taxes, they are part of the community, etc. </p>

<p>For most people it probably is just that. I have spent a long time advocating for this and working towards it obviously, so I am a little more worried than most, for my employees as well as my debts and all that, but I believe we will be able to weather the storm.</p>

<p>Hopefully thats all Spicer meant, and they are admittadly sometimes terrible at communication.</p>

<p>It is cause for concern for people in my position, for instance. Or for like the 30k jobs in co, not to mention all the ancillary business that comes from it... etc. </p>

<p>All in all though, it&#39;ll just be more in lawyer retainers probably :/</p>

Remember, things have only really been loosening up a lot in say the last 10yrs and it&#39;s been gradual. There are lots of new people in our scene these days that don&#39;t really remember the trenches...(christ way back in the day we basically all knew one another/and we&#39;re all still here fighting for the most part) it remains to be seen if the newer people are going to stick around and fight if things take a real harsh turn(ie--harsh jail terms). I hope they do--but this is bad news. We should be going in the completely opposite direction as a country and putting this stupid drug war to an end.  </p>

<p>Why the hell are we back peddling on something has been nothing but good for the economy? There is statistical evidence of crime going down after it being controlled, children are in less possession of it in states where it is controlled and shit weed from the cartels is having trouble when it can be grown in the states.</p>

<p>Marijuana used to be easy for me to get when I was 15. Alcohol was way harder. I can only imagine how hard it must be to get now that it is controlled. I have heard rumors that opiates and heroin is the new drug that is easy to get for teens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it you aren&#39;t actually familiar with the story of Pandora&#39;s box...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In ancient Greece there were two brothers named Epimetheus and Prometheus. They upset the gods and annoyed the most powerful of all Gods, Zeus, in particular. This was not the first time humans had upset Zeus, and once before, as punishment, he had taken from humans the ability to make fire. This meant they could no longer cook their meat and could not keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>However, Prometheus was clever and he knew that, on the Isle of Lemnos, lived Hephaestos, the blacksmith. He had a fire burning to keep his forge hot. Prometheus travelled to Lemnos and stole fire from the blacksmith. Zeus was furious and decided that humans had to be punished once and for all for their lack of respect.</p>

<p>Zeus came up with a very cunning plan to punish the two brothers. With the help of Hephaestos, he created a woman from clay. The goddess Athene then breathed life into the clay, Aphrodite made her very beautiful and Hermes taught her how to be both charming and deceitful. Zeus called her Pandora and sent her as a gift to Epimetheus.</p>

<p>His brother Prometheus had warned him not to accept any gifts from the gods but Epimetheus was completely charmed by the woman and thought Pandora was so beautiful that she could never cause any harm, so he agreed to marry her.</p>

<p>Zeus, pleased that his trap was working, gave Pandora a wedding gift of a beautiful box. There was one very, very important condition however, that she must never opened the box. Pandora was very curious about the contents of the box but she had promised that she would never open it.</p>

<p>All she could think about was; what could be in the box? She could not understand why someone would send her a box if she could not see what was in it. It seemed to make no sense at all to her and she could think of nothing else but of opening the box and unlocking its secrets. This was just what Zeus had planned.</p>

<p>Finally, Pandora could stand it no longer. When she knew Epimetheus was out of sight, she crept up to the box, took the huge key off the high shelf, fitted it carefully into the lock and turned it. But, at the last moment, she felt a pang of guilt, imagined how angry her husband would be and quickly locked the box again without opening the lid and put the key back where she had found it. Three more times she did this until, at last, she knew she had to look inside or she would go completely mad!</p>

<p>She took the key, slid it into the lock and turned it. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes and slowly lifted the lid of the box. She opened her eyes and looked into the box, expecting to see fine silks, gowns or gold bracelets and necklaces or even piles of gold coins.</p>

<p>But there was no gleam of gold or treasure. There were no shining bracelets and not one beautiful dress! The look of excitement on her face quickly turned to one of disappointment and then horror. For Zeus had packed the box full of all the terrible evils he could think of. Out of the box poured disease and poverty. Out came misery, out came death, out came sadness - all shaped like tiny buzzing moths.</p>

<p>The creatures stung Pandora over and over again and she slammed the lid shut. Epimetheus ran into the room to see why she was crying in pain. Pandora could still hear a voice calling to her from the box, pleading with her to be let out. Epimetheus agreed that nothing inside the box could be worse than the horrors that had already been released, so they opened the lid once more.</p>

<p>All that remained in the box was Hope. It fluttered from the box like a beautiful dragonfly, touching the wounds created by the evil creatures, and healing them. Even though Pandora had released pain and suffering upon the world, she had also allowed Hope to follow them.</p>

<p>While the gist is correct, Prometheus and Epimetheus were not humans.  Hope was left inside the box, it didn&#39;t flutter out &quot;like a beautiful dragonfly&quot; like a Disney movie.</p>

<p>His views on states rights was one of my selling points.</p>

<p>Also Obama could&#39;ve played the ultimate trump card in his last days by removing MJ as Schedule 1. That would have forced trump to keep it or change it back and would expose him to many independent voters that only voted for him because of their hatred for HRC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you correlate marijuana use with options use? How fucking stupid do they think America is????? How can trump, who acts like a republican and has stated he believes in STATES RIGHTS, decide that he will crack down ON STATES RIGHTS TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW!? This was Sessions&#39; plan from the start and everyone knew it and expected trump would just tell him to hold off... please. ALSO, what is funny is that almost all legal marijuana states are liberal states. So here comes the crackdown on states rights for the liberal states! YAY GOD EMPEROR ORANGE MAN TO THE RESCUE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was beyond insulting for Spicer to liken marijuana consumption to opioid use in the United States. Thousands of people are dying to fill the greedy pockets of BIG PHARMA and he think its at all similar to smoking a plant that makes you somewhat hungry and lazy.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Session&#39;s reversal of Obama&#39;s memo to discontinue private prisons, it&#39;s crystal clear that the Wall will be used to keep people in and jail drug users for profit and free labor. </p>

<p>Seriously, a billion USD per state is incredible money, you&#39;re disenfranchising the cartels too. Why continue this war? If Ryan knows whats best for him, he&#39;ll convince Trump to hold off on this till 2018 because if not, midterms will be a landslide for Dems.</p>

But sure thats harder to do when legal mary j helps prevents both those industries from taking advantage </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TRUMP: I think it’s up to the states, yeah. I’m a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.</p>

<p>Sessions said: &quot;I know it won&#39;t be an easy decision, but I will try to do my duty in a fair and just way.&quot;
Sessions also responded to a similar question from Republican Sen. Mike Lee by saying that &quot;it is not the Attorney General’s job to decide what laws to enforce.&quot; It is notable that Sen. Sessions chose not to commit to vigorously enforcing federal prohibition laws in states that have reformed their marijuana laws.</p>

<p>And then Spicer says: “There is still a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana and drugs of that nature.”</p>

<p>In my opinion, from publicly available information, those who are concerned are overreacting to what has been a fairly consistent stance from this administration... but I live in a state where it&#39;s legal!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt that Trump will recriminalize weed where it&#39;s been decriminalized. He&#39;s been quoted as saying that he&#39;s pro states-rights and he understands the benefits of medical marijuana. I believe I read that he&#39;s however, not satisfied with how things are working in colorado (can someone confirm?) and wants to change how the system works. I think he&#39;s going to crack down hard on sellers though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What did you expect from him? I heard some people saying Trump was close enough to libertarian. He&#39;s liberal on a bunch of issues, but it&#39;s clear that he doesn&#39;t see liberty the way most Americans do on this issue. </p>

<p>That and even with the most sophisticated tremor sensors they won&#39;t detect someone digging under it with a shovel. Those sensors will only pick up heavy machinery. They aren&#39;t that sensitive. Since they can&#39;t see through it like a fence, to find people doing that would need cameras or guard towers along the whole thing - and that&#39;s a ton more money.</p>
