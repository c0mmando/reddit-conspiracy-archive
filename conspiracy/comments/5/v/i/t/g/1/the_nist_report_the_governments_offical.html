<p>Edit: &quot;Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author&#39;s scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha exactly. Even life long scientific professionals are willing to forget everything they&#39;ve ever learned on this one day in particular. It really just goes to show how horrible public education really is. 10% mass of a building can not pile drive through the other 90% with gravity alone. Other factors HAD to be at play it&#39;s really that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it totally can. It shows how horrible your own engineering and material science education is. But here, without getting too complex for you, I&#39;ll lay it out.</p>

<p>The temperatures in the building were very hot. Steel gets softer when it gets this hot, and isn&#39;t as strong as it was. Any structures made of steel can&#39;t do what they were supposed to, and the building goes down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait your actually saying that the steel throughout the entire building became too hot to keep its integrity?? From what amounted to office fires on a few floors,the heat became so intense that the entire structure below was compromised....my friend, you are the one who needs a better understanding of materials science....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but what I am saying is that losing the load capacity on even one floor would be enough to level the building from the sheer amount of mass being held above that one floor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the majority of the uncompromised mass of the structurally redundant building below? How could the top 10ish% crush 90ish% as if there was zero resistance from gravity alone. Skyscrapers are designed specifically to withstand the force of the building above it from gravity as well as force of the wind ( which is many many times higher than the plane crash) it makes no sense that the top part of the building did not. But the floors below and either destroy itself on an equal mass of floors below or fall off to the side. Which if you watch closely one of the towers started leaning to the side...what was left to crush the building?? Point is it fell through the entire path of most resistance of a structure specifically designed to withstand the gravitational force of the structure above from gravity, and it was built to withstand at least 3 times the force that it actually held...aka structural redundancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... every steel beam failed at exactly the same time and it collapsed into its own footprint. You realize for the collapse to happen like it did this is what would have had to happen? If any   structural supports of the building failed at different times, even less then a minute later, the building would have tipped over. </p>

<p>But it gets better! Not 1 but 3 buildings perfectly collapsed into their own footprints that day. It&#39;s like lightning striking the same place 3 times in a row.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kidding I hope...how does that even come close to explaining symmetrical collapse with only asymmetric damage? How does that explain how that top portion crushed the rest of the building with a structural redundancy of of at least three times the load without coming to a rest after the equal and opposite reaction of hitting the floors below. Never even losing speed....how does that explain how it crushed through the entire path of most resistance with gravity alone?? It doesn&#39;t and it can not. The structure below was uncompromised and designed to resist gravity...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize I thought you were using those to defend the official story. You are spot on about tower two starting to fall off to the side, it makes no sense how the rest was crushed. I thought you meant those models explain how that happened.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/Nat_Gandhi">/u/Nat_Gandhi</a> Hello! Did you know there&#39;s a $300,000 model analysis being conducted at the University of Alaska Fairbanks regarding this issue?

<p>The University&#39;s preliminary findings are discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKN4qilUOfs">during this American Society of Civil Engineers presentation.</a></p>

<p>Just this past month, a former NIST employee of 14 years made his first public appearance speaking out against the official report with Dr. Hulsey: <a href="https://youtu.be/Pb2NOBbD88c?t=2m46s">https://youtu.be/Pb2NOBbD88c?t=2m46s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If NIST truly believes in the veracity of its WTC investigation, then it should openly share all evidence, data, models, computations, and other relevant information unless specific and compelling reasons are otherwise provided. - Peter Ketcham, NIST 1997-2011</p>
