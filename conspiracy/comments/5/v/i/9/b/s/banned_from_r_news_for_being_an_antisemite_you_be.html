       After getting into a debate about how many non Jews died in the concentration camps with the_raucous_one, he calls me an asshole, assenine and antisemite and then has me banned for telling him he's a moron for name calling instead of contributing anything of substance to the conversation. Tried messaging the mods and they tell me antisemitism is against the rules but can't show me where I'm being antisemitic. Biased mods.

       Honestly it's the least intelligent response anyone can pull. I got routed on fb the other day because people were frothing about Trump's immigration ban on 'International Holocaust day'. All I suggested was that I doubt Israel stopped controlling the West Bank on international Holocaust day. Within 2 minutes 'anti-semite' over and over.  No actual conversation. I was even reminded that Israel does not represent Judaism. Well then how is it anti-Semitic to criticise Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it as a cop-out by those not intelligent enough to craft a proper response.  Consider it a badge of honour that no one could argue your point.

       It's what they go to when they can't fight back. Name calling. Ever watch videos of protesters answering questions? I like when they bate them into saying the opposite of what they are protesting for. Total waist of a brain. It's why other protester repress your freedom of speech to talk to reporters. I saw one protester with a sign that said creative. Wtf does that even mean?

       He probably means that most vegetable farms sell all types of product and not exclusively vegetables and that some people are under the assumption that there are farms that only grow and sell vegetables.

       Holy Christ with the antisemite and holocaust denial and all caps BS. Here's the deal, I don't hate any race or religion. I think all religions are ridiculous because they're all about which group is superior, not unlike fanatical sports fans. Reguarding holocaust denial, that's probably the most ridiculous of all baseless accusations since you have to be nuts to think these enourmous structures around Europe were built as a hoax. I believe what just about every Jewish historian believes which is that these were slave labor camps that were financed by western powers to enrich a few bankers by employing a lunatic like Adolf Hitler. Were they death camps? No, why would they have swimming pools, orchestsras, and bordellos if they were simply looking to exterminate people. The holocaust was a tragedy since I sure as hell wouldn't want to be on the inside but the fact is if you point out that others were also affected, you hate Jews. It's like being called a racist when you say all lives matter. People get so caught up with their preprogrammed emotions that they refuse to look at facts and when you start pointing out historical fact in different conversations, people of all races start cursing and attacking. It's really silly but it got me censored on Reddit news and that pisses me off.

       Not only were you objectively correct, but according to the International Red Cross who had representatives present at every concentration camp, more Catholics died during imprisonment than Jews.

       Being labeled as an antisemite is the first sign you are on the right path.  keep up the good work.  remember, an anti semite isnt someone who hates the jew, its someone the jew hates.  let me quote Israeli MP Knesset Shulamit Aloni regarding antisemitism "Its a trick, we always use it."

       Damn you are salty. Know whats funny? I bet your dumbass is on welfare, living off the government. Better yet, probably typing this from your mom's basement. And when your heart gives out from all those cigarettes and meth, you can thank the probably Jewish/Immigrant doctor that saves your life. And you know why they save you? Because they try and help people. You on the other hand sit there venting on the internet blaming others for the problems you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I dont get with you Neo-Nazi retards. You want to "cleanse" America, but then what? None of you country fucks have an education. Who will lead this country? You fuckers dont work real jobs, you dont contribute. You live off the goverment and then complain about other hard working people who have too much pride to take charity. They would rather work 80 hours a week and still be poor than to sit at home and cry about America like you. They are living the American Dream, because they work hard and have something to show for it. You, a piece of shit deadbeat, isnt worth anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we took all you Neo-Nazis and rounded you up and removed you, think this country would even notice? Stocks wouldnt drop, GDP would probably increase since we are giving less hand outs. No one would notice because you are literally worthless. If we took all the Jews and exterminated them from this country like you want, you can bet your see-through skin head ass that the economy would take a toll. People would die because now suddenly we have less doctors. Criminals would go free because we have less lawyers to prosecute them and innocent people will go to jail because less lawyers protect them. Fuck, this country would probably fall even further back in education. Wanna know a fun fact? 50% of nobel prize winners are Jewish. Without them literally ever single field would take a toll. How many Neo-Nazi's have contribute so much to this world that they received a nobel prize? ZERO.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say Jews objectively own more wealth than anyone else in this country. Know why? It's because from birth they are taught that they arent owed shit and that if you make something of yourself, you need to work for it. And so they work hard, they make connections, they make something of themselves. Your retard ass was born being told that the reason your life sucks is cause Jews took your money. Jews didnt take your money, you inbred family didnt have money ever, in the history of this country. So you sit there crying how America isnt the way it used to be, and how life isnt fair. And while you do that, other people have real jobs and do real things. They go to school, they get an education, they work hard. That's how you make money. Maybe if you spent less time crying and smoking meth, you would get that. Too bad your inbred genes made you be born mentally retarded. Maybe the Jewish doctors of this country will figure out a cure for that one. Till then, keep being a Neo-Nazi.

       Excuses, deflection. You are so passionate about getting rid of Jews, but now that you have a chance to debate your ideas you bail. To scared to be proven wrong. It's easier to hide in your safespace and think you have everything figured out. Classic snowflake behavior.

       Yea, one of those Jews that got removed goes by the name Jesus. Might of heard of him.

       Plus again, remember how you said Jew's own a majority of the wealth? So if 50% of America's wealth left when your dream of Jew removal comes true, what would happen? Shit, that would probably mean you would have to leave your trailer home, government wouldnt have any more money to keep paying you to stay there. What would you do without all the welfare?

       Projection of what? Do you even know what that means?
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you think I'm arguing with you because secretly I am a closet Neo Nazi and I am using this argument to validate that I am not?
      </p>

       No, I genuinely think you are a mentally disabled, misguided person. Who else would ignore facts and spit hate purely on uneducated beliefs? Only person projecting here is you. You loath what you have becoming, a pathetic pile of crap which is a barely passable excuse of a human. You have nothing going for you in your life, that you blame everyone else instead of blaming yourself. That's projection.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        obsessed with getting them out of my nation. goddamned corrosive cockroaches.

       your attempt at a slur has no effect.  the jew acts as a corrosive cockroach, and yes, I want them out of my nation. Uncle Sucker gives them 38 billion or 10.8 million a day for their holy land.  its not miami or long island.  gtfo.

       How would you describe yourself if not an anti-semite? You clearly hate jews. Does that not fit the term anti-semite exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I proposed Neo-Nazi as an alternative because you appear to share their ideals. I'm frankly surprised you viewed it as a slur considering your views. I expected you'd see it as a compliment.

       So if you don't view Jews as semitic then you view the title of anti-semite to be inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering your hate for Jews, don't you think Neo-Nazi is a fitting term for your idealogy? I mean, you can't claim to be "anti-zionist" like most people who hate Jews try to do, as you've been up front with your hatred. E.g.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the jew is a creature. the jew itself thinks its not the same as what the jew terms "goyim". fuck them, they arent human, and only chosen to be hated by the rest of humanity and occasionally slaughtered into gassy soapy ashes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What is a better term for your views on jews than Neo-Nazi? You view them as in-human and deserving of extermination. Neo-Nazi sounds like a perfect fit.

       Jews arent semites fro the large part. How can 'people' from the hills of Russia Poland Hungary and Germany say they are sons of Shem? no sir, its bullshit.   I dont care what label you ascribe to me, it matters not, merely shows your inability to hadle abstract thought, everything must be labeled for easy identification.   The jew has been removed from civilized society 109 times from 84 nations, including these United States.  If you are evicted from every apartment, fired from every job and banned from every bar, the problem isnt the landlord, the bossman or the bartender/waitress, its jew.

       You need to go, and take a few jews with you, as you are part of the problem. You refuse to see the havoc that jews wreck onto the fabric of American Society from Foreign and domestic policy to finance scams to media debauchery.   you are just as bad as the jew if you dont see that, yet you choose to focus on assigning labels.  who cares?

       Honestly you'd do well as a stand up comedian on some 3rd rate cable channel. You should have a think about it, your reddit commenting career can't last forever!

       your attempt at a slur has no effect.  the jew acts as a corrosive cockroach, and yes, I want them out of my nation. Uncle Sucker gives them 38 billion or 10.8 million a day for their holy land.  its not miami or long island.  gtfo.

       I dont care what you care to call me, My self Identification as an American tired of jew bullshit is obviously triggering for you.

       You need to go, and take a few jews with you, as you are part of the problem. You refuse to see the havoc that jews wreck onto the fabric of American Society from Foreign and domestic policy to finance scams to media debauchery.   you are just as bad as the jew if you dont see that, yet you choose to focus on assigning labels.  who cares?
