    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a lost cause, but I think you have to be careful about things like this. My SO is not totally on board with red-pill takes on things so I do understand it a bit.</p>

<p>My advice would be to realize that you can only give answers to somebody who is asking a question. When you give your SO these &#39;answers&#39;, he ignores them because he is not asking that question. It&#39;s irrelevant to him.</p>

<p>Where I am with my SO is I don&#39;t really talk about things unless it is something very mainstream. My take on it is that when things come full circle and get dragged into the light, then i&#39;m sure they will want to hear all about it, but for now it is just not a part of their worldview. And that&#39;s okay. It is good to stay focused on things you can control... a lot of this stuff can be very emotionally draining. I don&#39;t hold it against some for not wanting to dwell in those energies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many who share our views out there and communities like this are a good place to dispel some of that.</p>

<p>With that said, as a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; veteran, let me give you a simple piece of advice - knowing where the wolf is hiding in the bushes is a great thing, and I think that&#39;s why people like us are drawn to this. We are not afraid to face our threats and understand them - we are fearful of ignorance first and foremost. However, these topics can become distractions too. Make sure that your interest in this is creating the correct results within yourself. If these things empower you and fire you up to be more in the world, then keep going with it. But if you feel drained yourself and things are getting dark, move on from the wolf and do something worthwhile and impactful with your energy instead. Facing the world with understanding gives us some great opportunities if we are willing to look for them, but we can get too caught up in &#39;information&#39; rather than action. Many of these things will never affect your life, but your decisions affect every moment of it. Work with what you can control :)</p>

<p>Have a good one!</p>

<p>Here is a big link to <strong>one</strong> of peekay&#39;s channels and I&#39;m sure his analysis of the Paris Kosher Deli shooting is in there! His work on Boston Bombing is eye-opening. His latest will be his analysis of the Australian Car Rampage.</p>

<p>My roommate, (I&#39;ve known since 1978) was a real tough candidate for red-pilling but when I <em>asked him to explain the ballistics</em> etc it was like a light came on! </p>

<p>He&#39;s done his own watching of 9/11 and it is something he&#39;s not ever going to fully <em>investigate</em> - he&#39;s satisfied with his level of acceptance for extreme government cover-up and murder of innocent civilians.</p>

<p>He&#39;s even aware of Geoengineering Weather now!</p>

<p>He&#39;s older, he has MS. He&#39;s fighting a battle everyday and that is enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sucks.  In my opinion you shouldnt try to redpill anyone.  What if you are actually wrong?  What if you get them to change their mind and it ruins the relationship?</p>

<p>I grew up mormon and when I figured out it was a cult built on lies and there was nothing good about it I also realized that my marriage, that was built on mormonism, was also built on lies and there was nothing about it I wanted to keep, so I left.</p>

<p>You are making a huge assumption here that if your SO starts thinking like you, it will make your marriage stronger.  That assumption could turn out to be wrong.</p>

<p>Also, in the grand scheme of things, none of this matters.  It doesnt matter if he is redpilled.  You and he will both die and it will be as if your existence never happened.  Do you know the names of your ancestors that lived 5000 years ago? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it though?  You are just an actor on their stage.  They may not have fully realized it, but its true.  Your SO could be just as unhappy with you and your &quot;crazy conspiracy theories&quot; as you are with him not &quot;opening his eyes&quot;.  </p>

<p>You should find someone that wants you as an actor on their stage and that you want as an actor on your stage.  Never feel bad about seeking happiness.  Happiness is the ultimate goal and the only thing that gives any meaning to this pointless existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no problem. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with it, it was the CIA CRV (Coordinated Remote Viewing) project. Hundreds of documents are on the CIA website detailing this psychic espionage program. Their studies indicate that anyone can be trained to analyze a geo-location telepathically when given the precise latitude and longitude of a target site. Some were even able to &quot;view&quot; Mars in both the present and the past. So it&#39;s really out there, but also corroborated with official government documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I could no longer contain the passion I had for the truth, and wished to share it with my SO, I was as careful as possible.</p>

<p>And even then, I now know I wasn&#39;t careful enough. In the end, it boils down to the individual&#39;s journey, and spark and passion for truth.</p>

<p>My SO, born in &#39;89, was a product of Saturday morning cartoons, Disney, and high sugar breakfast cereal.</p>

<p>I had my work cut-out for me.</p>

<p>I began with very disarming questions. Un-biased. Un-loaded. So that my SO&#39;s answers came from within, without my influence.</p>

<p>Try and form those questions based on what you are trying to have a discussion about. Whatever truth you are trying to discuss with them. </p>

<p>Do not ask yes or no questions, they have to be open-ended, so that they can form a response. Their response, is their&#39;s. It is not something to fight about. The goal, is that they will question their response internally. And perhaps spark a curiosity for them to look into it in their free time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how long your journey took you OP, to come to some realizations and some truths. And it may take your SO longer.</p>

<p>We cannot red-pill someone in a mere conversation.</p>

<p>The journey is long, and will break down internal walls, that for some, they never come back from.</p>

<p>My SO, was on the verge of depression, and I can still see them fighting it back, as the comfortable bubble, and veil of reality has been ripped from their reality. </p>

<p>The question really is, are you willing to break someone, to free them.</p>

<p>It is an everlasting curse or blessing, to those who have been awakened. It is the individual who deals with these truths, however they see fit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my two cents, and I wish you both a great happiness in this life.</p>

She claims to have seen documents that informed her 9/11 was an inside job. So when it comes to opening her eyes to other things I just find the most informative and down to earth video I can on the subject and it usually takes. I find the crazier the video seems the less likely she is to accept it. Good luck. </p>

My mom would always come up with stupid and wild rationalisations, but my dad is a very logical person and I was able to show him convincing proof. I eventually realised it was too much for him and started dismantling my own claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trick is to slowly introduce the topics.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t start will the actual conclusion/ story of the conspiracy. Start with the facts and videos that obviously contradict the mainstream story. Ask them what they think, this is to get then to start thinking! Naturally they will try to debunk and write off these facts as coincidence. Try and get then to debunk you and prove you wrong. Keep showing them fact after fact that goes against the mainstream story. After dozens and dozens of inconsistencies they will start to see something really doesn&#39;t make sense. If they still refuse to see the truth point out the absurdity of the sheer volume of inconsistencies and coincidences you would have to belive in for the main stream story to be true.</p>

<p>My favorite place to start is the false flag shooting and bombings. They are just done so poorly that if you look at any details you will see nothing matches up or makes sense. If someone is open enough to listen to me for an hour or 2 I can easily show them Sandy Hook was clearly a fake false flag event, hundreds of detailed facts and news clips that clearly show its fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is a great start! If you have him convinced on sandy hook show the fact that the picture of Noah Ponzer was also a claimed victim in another school bombing in Pakistan. Then lead into all the other fake shooting and bombings where he will start to see reoccurring people crossing from one incident to the next along with the usual details that make no sense.</p>

<p>Also the key point is they have Fema/DHS training events for the same scenario the same day in the same city for half these events, like sandy hook.
