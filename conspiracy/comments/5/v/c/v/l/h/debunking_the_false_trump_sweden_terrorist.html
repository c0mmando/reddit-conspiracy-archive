       The Sweden thing is false news. Trump said..
      </p>
      <p>
       "if you look at what happened in Sweden last night......they took in large numbers. they're having problems they never thought possible"
      </p>
      <p>
       He never said anything about terror attacks. He was implying problems from unchecked mass immigration. The actual video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgceQTbH52o">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgceQTbH52o
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And look at the headlines about Sweden now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he conceded to the main stream news because either you are going to watch the actual speech and see the MSN claim is a lie or you will believe what you are told to believe. There was no point wasting time arguing about it.

       Right, and your uncertainty is why he had to back track and say he meant "in general, immigration blah blah".

       Wow seeing this talking point from many people today.... His message was very clear if you watch the speech yourself and don't allow the MSN to interpret it for you. He was saying if you want to see the problems cause by mass unchecked immigration just look at the countries that have allowed it.

       I think Trump is one of those people obsessed with TV, and the Tucker Carlson angle is the most likely reason here. Because to people like Trump, what happened on TV last night is literally what happened last night. Because in his life, TV is the only way things "happen".

       His message wasn't clear at all.  Maybe if he said, "If you look at the reporting Fox News has done on the issue, Sweden has been having problems..." It would've been clear.  But it was not clear to a lot of people.  Keep in mind that Donald Trump is speaking to hundreds of millions (if not even billions) of people.  You need to be absolutely clear on your message.  If there is room for a misunderstanding, then you start to have constituents defending a travel ban because of the Bowling Green Massacre, or constituents attacking Trump because they believe the National Guard is going to be called to deport immigrants.  This is a high stakes game we're playing, misinformation and miscommunication does not help right now.

       Fascinating response.  So we can conclude that Donald Trump's message is very clear to his supporters, but since his constituents expand well beyond his supporters, he needs to work on clearing up his message for the rest of the population affected by his actions.  I think this piece of constructive criticism for President Trump is fair, do you agree?

        ...They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.
       </p>
       <p>
        “If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.
       </p>
       <p>
        “He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?
       </p>
       <p>
        So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.
We had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.
We do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.
No wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.

       Trump's "safe zones" chill me to the core. He wants to set up autonomous regions within someone else's country, Syria, protected by the US military. And to hell what the Syrians think.

       I think Trump is one of those people obsessed with TV, and the Tucker Carlson angle is the most likely reason here. Because to people like Trump, what happened on TV last night is literally what happened last night. Because in his life, TV is the only way things "happen".
