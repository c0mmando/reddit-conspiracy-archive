       Refugee centers are a big business and a private landfill to dump public money into. In some countries they were in such a hurry taking in the refugees that they couldn't properly make contracts and inspections and ended up with refugee centers getting an open cheque from the government. These centers are often owned by private section.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think we need to help people in need, but EU is being exploited left and right and population is happily unaware of the reasons for refugees in the first place. Take a random citizen and ask why are so many people fleeing from Syria, common answer would be "I think there was Isis, or was it dictator as president. Something like that.. heard it from the news". And the news are in most cases just translated from US news. Media keeps making money on divided population arguing about refugees and nobody is looking at the crisis zones.

       TPTB want to be able to rapidly depopulate a nation through both war and resettlement. This way, when they decide that they need a new oil pipeline or whatever, they can essentially dissolve the population of a non-compliant state.

       Think about it. Who benefits most from all of the chaos that is being created? Surely not the people living in Europe. The people that benefit are the same ones that created the chaos in the first place, and they are doing it for the same reason all evil in the world takes place - money and power. TPTB and the Military Industrial Complex have made trillions of dollars from the War on Terror, while simultaneously destroying all of the countries surrounding Israel and using the fear from the War on Terror to slowly turn all Western countries into surveillance states. And they have accomplished all of this with such ease and impunity. Do you really think they are willing to give all of that up anytime soon???
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to keep support for war going than to import into the West the very same people they have been bombing non-stop for over 15 years, while simultaneously using the mainstream media to increase fear and tensions between the locals and the refugees? Any organic terrorist attacks committed by these refugees is further fuel for the War on Terror, and if things don't happen organically, they are nudged along with a false flag attack that accomplishes the same purpose. It's quite a genius plan really. I just wish more people could see through it.

Young women are not expected to work so don't need to travel until there is a home and income set up for them. Military age is also working age.

       The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the 'agentur' of the 'Illuminati' between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion. We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

       Couple that with world war 3 being planned against Russia and you get the picture of many countries sending their reproductive age men to war leaving a vacuum at home. The refugees will be there to fill the vacuum and they will quickly become the majority.
