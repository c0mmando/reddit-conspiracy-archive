I know technically bing is owned by MS who are globalists, but still its quite more secure than google.</p>

<p>Use Firefox instead of Google Chrome or alternatively use Opera&#39;s chromium browser. Google does spy you through their browser.</p>

<p>Unfortunately even Firefox about a year ago started using Google&#39;s &quot;spam&quot; filters, so it checks websites against their databases, so some info will leak out to google, but its a lot better than using Google directly.</p>

<p>There is a very good Firefox specialized browser called Cyberfox with tons of customizations and its a generally more optimized browser.</p>

<p>Apart from that always use some adblock addon for all globalist websites, I also use Avast free security which comes with its own browser addon that not only blocks ads, but also scripts, tracking, web analytics, social media and others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not completely.  Google is using cookies to track you across all their platforms with background services like jquery and ajax.googleapis.com and fonts.googleapis.com and Recaptcha.  </p>

<p>Just about every site on the web uses one of these services.  So let&#39;s say for instance you access your youtube account.  There is now a cookie connecting your Identity with that account.  Now, any other site you go to around the web that utilizes a google-based background service connects you with that account.  So they know exactly who you are and what you are browsing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they are using ip6 exploits to determine your REAL ip6 address even on VPNs because many VPNs are only routed for IPv4.  So using a VPN doesn&#39;t guarantee safety unless you&#39;ve disabled IPv6 on your system.  Even then there are ways for a focused attacker to acquire your IP if he gets an account with the same VPN as you and gets on your subnet.</p>

<p>There is a Firefox addon RequestPolicy that gives you control over all cross-site browser requests.  It takes a little getting used to but makes a big difference...</p>

<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/</a></p>

<p>Tor Browser is the most secure and anonymous way to browse the web and access onion services but should only be used with NoScript.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% correct. You&#39;re never truly safe when you use a computer.

<p>Interesting about ipv6 leak attacks. I&#39;m going to look into it. </p>

<p>Another method of identification that I&#39;m sure google is using is Font fingerprinting.  If they can connect you even once with a fingerprint of certain characteristics of your browser then they can isolate your network usage in the future...</p>

<p>We believe that freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy are fundamental human rights that should be respected on the Internet as well as in real life. Moreover, we are a civilization transitioning to an information-based society, and as such we feel that the permanent storage of information for future generations is a critical issue we should be striving to solve as soon as possible.
Driven by passion and inspired by “what ifs” we explore the applications and implications of a permanent web in the context of social networks, freedom of expression, creative perpetuity, and privacy for a better Web in service of humanity.
After all, it’s not information that wants to be free – it’s us.</p>

<p>Maybe OP just isn&#39;t a techy person, but they really shouldn&#39;t be giving tech advice. All of the alternatives they suggested aren&#39;t any better.</p>

<p>If you really want to stay anon online use TAILS and get behind a trustworthy VPN. Even then you aren&#39;t 100% anon but taking that route is much better than using Firefox lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not about having crashes and frustration just wanting to surf the web. </p>

<p>An internet browser has to be intuitive and user friendly, I can recommend two browsers still in development and open source, but who would use them? Who would want an unfinished and bad experience?</p>

<p>As far as search there aren&#39;t many alternative, duckduckgo is probably the best one, but the results are terrible, apart from the top 10 sites in their search, all the rest is garbage. So you need to use different ones to get the best results. </p>

<p>When duckduckgo doesn&#39;t find something more specific try yahoo and then bing. </p>

<p>Avast free AV is one of the best and most secure and privacy oriented protections out there period. In fact this was tested 2 years ago which AV sends most data to their HQ and Avast was one that did it the least. Their HQ is also based in Prague, one of the least globalist countries who also has strong privacy laws. </p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not talking about hiding your IP, I&#39;m talking about direct data that you give Google and Facebook when using them. Best thing is to not use them.</p>

<p>If you truly want best privacy then use double vpn over TOR, but that is a terrible and frustrating and expensive experience. </p>

<p>If you truly want good VPN you have to pay and even then the speeds are wobbly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re close, but still not completely right. </p>

<p>Chrome has google based trackers (RLZ trackers), which <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en">can be turned off</a>, assuming you take Google&#39;s word for it.</p>

<p>Chromium is made by Google employees, but it doesn&#39;t have the RLZ trackers at all.  It does have an opt-in option to track usage statistics and crash reports, but that is different than the RLZ tracking, and is off by default.</p>

<p>Chromium is open source, so these claims would be refuted immediately if they were incorrect.</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#User_tracking">see this link</a> for details on RLZ tracking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t ignore it. It just doesn&#39;t make any sense in the context of what I said to you.</p>

<p>What does you saving money and flying around the world cheaply have to do with a global economy? Traveling around the world doesn&#39;t require a global economy. People have traveled for ages.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is this. You never truly own anything. You pay someone for everything you need to survive. You are a slave of the system, and there isn&#39;t a single thing you can do to get out of it. Aside from maybe living as a hermit in the jungle somewhere. But good luck with that if they find you living on &quot;their land&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And those same taxes that you and I pay, allows us both to receive a free college education and live rent free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand...</p>

<p>If I own a home (mortgage paid in full), I still cannot live in that house, or claim ownership of it, if I fail to pay property taxes. The same goes for a car, and several other things. The government didn&#39;t do anything to obtain this money. It is a tax on your existence. You pay it, to exist. Literally. </p>

<p>What does this have to do with globalization? The global cabal that runs the Federal Reserve, and most banks seeks to gather as much power as they can for themselves. Unfortunately however, the national borders still stand in the way. (reasons like tax havens, etc. stand in their way)</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples of people trying to be &quot;self-suficient&quot; or live &quot;off-grid&quot;, and almost without fail, the government steps in to stop them. They need to have just enough control over your life to make you think that you are free to do as you chose, when in fact, you work for them. (aka slaves, albeit with a bit more free will)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a dogwhistle for the jewish conspiracies. Often these accusations are made by nazis.  </p>

<p>Otherwise Globalism is not inherently bad, unless you live in a country or region that is temporarily left behind. It mostly brings wealth, products, culture, peace, ethics, humanitarian aid, enlightenment etc. People with job problems often hate &quot;globalism&quot; and not progress in general. People who are very sceptical of many governments and potential conspiracies of course see large scale population control as a threat, although that of course doesnt make all that much sense. &quot;Globalist&quot; is just a fancy boogieman word that makes conservative, conspiritard, unemployed, hypernationalist and nazi people happy. For the most part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% correct. You&#39;re never truly safe when you use a computer. Just look at the <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/researchers-use-hacked-hard-drive-led-to-steal-data-from-air-gapped-computer/">air-gaping hacks</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking">Van Eck method...</a>.  </p>

<p>Interesting about ipv6 leak attacks. I&#39;m going to look into it. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re serious about privacy, you probably shouldn&#39;t be using windows. Some good privacy OSes are <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qube OS</a>, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix</a> and of course <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> </p>
