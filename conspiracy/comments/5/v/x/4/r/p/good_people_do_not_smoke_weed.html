       White House Opens Door To Crackdown On Recreational Marijuana - The Huffington Post

       Donald trump is proving to not use medical studies and has insulted anyone including those that are doctors, attorneys, and many other Americans that partake in the substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DEA, the pharmaceutical companies, and the private prisons all seem to have paid trump off on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Trump has likened weed to opioids. This is far from what medical testing has shown as weed is not addictive, does not cause death as there has been no causes of death from the plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a man who feels weed is more dangerous than alcohol. This is a step back. He also stated he will be going after states that have legalized it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he wants states to make there own laws, unless it's against his agenda. Now he is threatening our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a sad day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone feels trump is right, I ask you share a medical study that backs his claim.

       I don't think there is a quote from Trump on a crackdown, but he should clarify it today. He is getting alot of flack from people who voted for him ( I'm one ) on this. Go over to
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       and see for yourself. If he cracks down on recreational use he's going to lose supporters. I don't smoke weed but enforcement against recreational use is wrong. Legalize it, license dealers and tax the sales. Too bad to any ultra conservatives that think different on this they weren't his supporters anyway.

       So why don't we just deregulate all drug use, prescription or otherwise, and just let the "states decide".
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to sound harsh, but what is the difference between weed and any other drug?

       Unfortunately, people aren't smart enough to realize that recreational drug use has very serious consequences for other people... just like alcohol abuse.

       I'm not really a student of the subject, but I'm not aware of anything that proves marijuana is any more harmful than alcohol. Both have the potential of being used responsibly or abused. As far as other drugs, I don't know of any that are recreationally used that are on the same level, but if there is any particular ones that exist fine, legalize it.

       Both marijuana and alcohol are addictive, I don't care what anyone on here says. I have seen both first hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the recreational use of other drugs, there are hundreds... people get addicted to prescription drugs every day, and cannot break free of that addiction. A few that come to mind are Valium, Hydrocodone, Percocet, Ritalin, etc.  These drugs are extremely habit-forming (addictive) and are regulated with a prescription to prevent their misuse. Their use is not quite as main-stream as weed, but the idea is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legalizing the misuse of these drugs would be a terrible idea. It's bad enough that we have people out on the road driving after smoking weed, drinking alcohol... we don't need them high on all these other drugs as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what people do in their own home. Smoke, drink, get high on prescription drugs, whatever. But as soon as they leave the house, and put someone else at risk, that's where the line has got to be drawn. Don't put your own life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness in front of someone else's. That's selfish and wrong.

       Cannabis addiction is not the same as other drug addictions.  The pills you listed cause a physical addiction.  The same is true with alcohol and nicotine. Cannabis can cause a mental addiction in some people, which is easily broken with a wonderful thing called willpower.

       I'm sorry, not buying that. It's a chemical addiction for all the things you have listed. Willpower in most people is not strong enough to break that addiction.

       Lol, I only read the WebMD one and it is automatically biased by referring to it as pot.  That study asked life long weed smokers to quit smoking.  Obviously they will start again and probably went and bought a huge sack from the money they got.  The symptoms listed were the same you would get if you asked someone to stop using social media, video games, tv, unhealthy food, cokes, the list goes on and on.

       Well, if you had read the rest of them: LeafScience is actually a pro-marijuana site which I included for non-biasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is using the word pot biased? Marijuana smokers themselves use this word all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just trying to show you that there are real consequences of smoking weed, not just the immediate effects. Just like cigarettes, alcohol, etc.

        Both marijuana and alcohol are addictive, I don't care what anyone on here says. I have seen both first hand.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You generally make a good argument, but I don't think it's necessary to be quite so black and white about it. Many things are addictive, be it psychologically or physiologically or both, but not all of those are inherently harmful to the addict or their peers. Weed is about the least harmful drug (in both the recreational sense as well as the pharmacological sense) we have ever known, and criminalizing its use leads people to seek legal alternatives to mend their pain or to simply get high for the fun of it. In many cases, this leads to the abuse of painkillers and opioids, as well as alcoholism. Inversely, it has been shown repeatedly that alcoholics and painkiller addicts manage to reduce or quit their self-destructive habits by using cannabis instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying that one can get lost in the pleasures of cannabis too, but from my own experience, that is less an inherent danger of the substance than it is dependant character and circumstance of the user. Criminalizing the substance when the overwhelming majority of users has no personal, psychological or physiological issues resulting from the use of the substance seems entirely the wrong approach to my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable regulation as we have with alcohol, as well as an appeal to personal responsibility and accessible rehabilitation for those who have crossed the threshold and need help is the way to go in my view.

       One requires malice, the other requires ignorance.

       What does that have to do with holding an outdated and ignorant view on cannabis? If anything he should be able to recognize rules against cannabis don't make sense, it isn't harming others, and shouldn't have ever been made illegal in any so-called free country.

       Drugs don't destroy people's lives, people destroy people's lives. Weed is just a plant that grows out of the ground. You can bake it into food just like cinnamon, thyme, basil, ginger, it's just an herb with health benefits. I guess garlic is a drug, because by medical definition a drug is something used in preparation of, or used as medicine. Better make turmeric illegal for healing inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you ever ban medicine? Does that even make sense as a rational human being to have something defined as "medicine", per their own definition, as
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       ? They can go fuck themselves with a cactus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opium derivatives and alcohol are the only legal narcotics. Life is too fucking hard to go through completely sober. Being human is fucking painful. Without help to numb the pain, you can't begin to heal. Opium products don't offer any healing properties, so this is big pharmas choice for control. Must rely 100% on it for numbing, therefor they control you. Alcohol is loaded with empty calories in the form of sugars that lead to excess weight and health problems, which means you need to go to the doctor more often and buy medication more often. The more excess fat you have, the more likely you are to become complacent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of the laws make no logical sense, by definition. The targeting is very obvious to someone who can look at it objectively, without any pre-conditioning or knowledge of what a "marijuana plant" even is.

       How exactly is my life ruined by smoking some mary jane?

       You are basing your ideas on what the mainstream tell you and not listening to people with real life experiences that don't match that.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been smoking weed for longer than Christianity has existed.

       I think I have had a change of ideology on this issue, and here is why...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I toke daily for 6 years or so, before that it was weekly. I have a stable relationship with my non smoking gf, have friends who do and don't smoke, I hold down a highly demanding job which I excel at.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I drink daily, before that it was occasionally. I also have a stable, high paying job, have a great relationship with my wife, have friends who both drink and not drink, and I make my own beer in my basement, which is a fun hobby. People tell me that I am an alcoholic sometimes, because I drink every day. So I can see how you feel about my opinions.
      </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can honestly say that I was basing my opinions on personal experience of family members who I have seen go down the road of using drugs, and it wasn't pretty. But you know what? You are 100% right. That was all about choice... So I guess that sort of biases me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say that I have come to terms with use of weed as both a medicine and a recreational drug. However, I do think that we should at least place the same restrictions on it that we do any other mind-altering substance. (i.e. smoking and driving)
      </p>
      <p>
       What it really comes  down to is this: do you control your drug use, or does it control you. Just like alcohol, when the latter becomes true, that's when you have a problem and need to take action to change.

       At the end of the day, recreational use is self medicating. It's making people feel better. So what's wrong with that? God gave us the beautiful plant.

       What right do you have to tell me what I shouldn't do? I'm not hurting anybody, or myself. I don't drink or smoke. I like to eat a cookie in the evenings, watch a movie, and go to bed contemplating the nature of reality. I wake up with no hangover, go to work all all day and repeat. I've been doing this for years and I've never been healthier. It's a plant. Humans have been using cannabis for as long as we've been here. Look up the "endo-canabinoid system". This plant is a gift from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, my new mantra is that any politician that supports the failed wars on terror and drugs, supported any of the other senseless wars we're in and isn't calling for reform of the financial system is NOT getting my vote, ever again. I'm sick of this bullshit.

       I have the freedom to say god doesn't exist. Weed has proof to not dumb people down after there brain has developed. In fact it has caused more help then bad. God on the other hand has caused more bad then good. God has no proof of existence other than faith. Weed has science to back it up. Btw if god does exist he created weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your on  his page following these stories look at the facts why weed is illegal. It all goes back to Nixon. And even further.

       You have no freedom of speech if you have a registered SSN with UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, which is a corporate llc based in Puerto Rico. You are by definition, property, and there are no rights for property. Only those born in the US with a certificate of live birth in a registered county with no social security number may have the protection of the constitution. You can even take it all the way to the Supreme Court if you'd like, but their is a court above them, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that does not follow the laws of the land. The US Supreme Court is the "highest court in the land", but not the people. All they can do is kick you off of their land, because the Vatican owns it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people who can grant you right to free speech are your fellow citizens. The government is not there for you and will NOT protect you, unless it is to promote the agenda of the Company. Any rhetoric going against the direction of the company will result in silencing.

       It depends what they mean by greater enforcement. I mean alcohol and tobacco are heavily enforced and regulated (age restriction, taxes, a federal police force designed around the two along with firearms). If the feds allow states unhindered choice for MJ and only ensure that the focus is on maintaining it like other legal vices I'm OK. If they go the hard nose route, well that's never worked.

       No, let's look at what hypocrite means.

        Hypocrite:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       1: a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion
      </p>
      <p>
       2:  a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in the first sense, maybe. He acts religious and perhaps isn't all that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the second sense, he does not consume drugs; and therefore is not. And this is the relevant sense for this discussion.

       <p>
        One of the most controversial decisions a President Trump will have to make is whether to continue the federal stand-down by the us Justice department in which DOJ does not enforce federal marijuana laws where they contradict state laws legalizing the legal use and sale of marijuana in the 37 states where it is currently legal in some form. Although he has a long standing personal opposition to drug use Trump has also expressed support for the medicinal use of marijuana in the states where it is legal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Canceling the order by Obama attorney general Eric Holder to stand down on Marijuana would cause a major dislocation in multiple states that are currently budgeting millions in state revenue from the taxation of marijuana and un-employing hundreds of thousands of people currently working in an industry legalized by the states. I would urge President-Elect Trump to view this as a business man; U.S. government cannot turn back the clock on federal marijuana law enforcement.

       We will never solve our problems with Mexico until cannabis is normalized in the US and hard drug users are rehabilitated.  As a Christian, it really bothers me that most religious people hate cannabis but are perfectly fine taking big pharma's drugs.

       I don't think the stand-down vs. the states on pot should be rescinded. But, speaking just for myself, I would note that marijuana was great for me until it became horrible for me. People say it's not addictive, but it certainly was addictive for me and remains so. If I have it, I smoke it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I would not have the broad worldview I have today without it (I don't think--who can say for sure?).

       The bigger deal that nobody discusses is how hemp is like a super-plant for making pretty much any kind of product from building foundations to clothes to paper, and it's completely organic and will decompose naturally in earth or water over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true battle may not be against pot, but hemp.

       The battle against hemp is a huge portion of the opposition. So many industries fear what hemp can provide as a replacement to current products. Paper, lubricants, rope, textiles, etc...

       I realize your comment on the addictiveness of weed is anecdotal, I think you may be referring to 'habit forming' rather than addictive. There are no physical withdraw symptoms to stopping marijuana. Some mental dependences, sure, but nothing like trying to fight true alcoholism or a heroin addiction.

       Think about those private prison profits. They fill a cell get cash. Also the pharma companies are in on it too. The more prisoners they have the more medicine they need. Who do you think purchases a ton of drugs directly from Pharma? Prisons do.

       I support Trump and believe he will do great things for our country. As for this though, I do not agree with him. It appears that big Pharma is more powerful than the president. Although this may be a good thing and allow me to explain. If marijuana gets legalized on a federal level then it will become commercialized like the tobacco industry. Companies like Marlboro and Camel will manufacture the process and sale of joints and chemicals will be pumped in to the cannabis just like they are pumped into tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I disagree with Trump on his stance, I see this as a sort of win for the marijuana community. We've been smoking illegally for years and for just as long we've been smoking safely. I don't believe we would be able to say the same if marijuana becomes commercialized like tobacco.

       Yes business would boom but that is what I fear. With weed sales legally through the roof there is no way that corporate greed isn't going to try and take over which means masa producing joints filled with not only weed but weed processed with chemicals.

       In one hand this would help the economy but on the other the quality and harmlessness of weed would decrease drastically.

       Well let's think about this, you are right. But take for example at Colorado. Many companies are starting to grow starting out with weed. Pharmaceutical sales are down because many are using weed to treat themselves instead of other than harmful opioids. Marlboro has already started selling weed products. But does that hurt weed? No it creates another market for competition. Weed prices have not gone up by fluctuate. If we need to legalize weed, we should follow amastradam and allow weed bars where there are professionals that teach you about the product let you try samples and keep it in a safe legal environment. When people think of legalization they think a bunch of hippies will be stoned all the time. Far from it. In fact most people who try weed don't do it again.

       I'm addicted to responding to irrational posts, but I sometimes use discipline and constraint to break the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when I read posts like these I relapse not because I am an asshole, but because of the substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's your posts fault that I'm responding in such a dick way.

       It is a bit strange that you would choose to argue that marijuana is addictive on a post subject dedicated to Trump and his administration cracking down on marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you're just wanting to converse the thought you expressed, but I hope you understand that it comes across as you defending the decision because it is "psychologically addictive".

       Anything is addictive in that way....... your claim is true. But a cell phone, driving, hell even exercise is addictive. Anything can cause addiction but it won't harm you if you do it with control. Unlike alcohol or opioids.

       I want to say that he is not attacking medical marijuana but only attacking recreational. He is probably going to cut federal funding to governments that legalize it. That's his plans so far as president. Threaten to cut federal funding if he doesn't get what he wants.

       Sensationalist title and an incorrect analysis of Spicer's speech. How can there be a worthwhile discussion of the topic if you incorrectly recount what was said? Congrats on getting some karma and a bunch of comments. This is purposefully inflammatory to illicit responses. Your efforts are transparent.

       Nowhere in your post did you address one word Spicer actually said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not at all mad, I was pointing out a major flaw in your argument so that we could begin a discussion, where you could provide a rebuttal that had the opportunity to convince me of any potential misconceptions I may have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't care less about what Trump said in this single particular instance, as the whole marijuana rhetoric on this sub has been fueled directly by Spicer's speech, which is now being used as a tool to push discourse.

       Yes, but it would take big $ from Pharma.  Bribery to have whole $ pie with dangerous opioids as alternative by prescription with malice. Also there big $ to make torturing ppl for petty crimes with long sentences  in private prisons. They already paid their bribes as well.

       HE's against federal legalization. All for state legislation and federal medical use.

       Generally speaking, the President is against creating any federalized legalization. Same with a few other things "leave it to the states" .

       I wouldn't be too worried about it.  Spicer can't stand there and say we're enforcing the shit out of immigration law on principle while being meh on pot.  They don't actually have to
       <em>
        be

       consistent here, it's enough just to say it.  Wait for a real change in policy as implemented.  I don't think the odds are very high, 90% of people in the DOJ and DEA know pot is not harmful the way opioids are.

       I believe he may be forcing the states to acknowledge that maybe, we don't want the federal govt to have control over their individual rights. The way we have allowed the fed to become an overlording entity is ridiculous. Same with trans rights, it should be implemented by every state, instead of a federal law... in a civilized society, it would be a non-issue.. yet, there are some states that would rather drag transpeople behind pickups than allow them to pee next to them. good news is, people would either work to change the laws, THERE, where the knowledge is needed, OR they would move. The state that continues to be treacherous will show that in its people, its economy and its govt officials. the states must have control over the fed, not the other way around.

       Your comment is the opposite of what he is saying. He is saying states need to follow federal laws. Not pass laws against federal laws.
