    <div class="md"><p>My opinionated answer is that they should not stay open, as consuming cp is illegal and the consumption of it product comes directly from viewing it.</p>

<p>My philosophical answer is how do we know what is objectively right and objectively wrong? I think most everyone (especially on this sub) can agree that cp is wrong. And so it is illegal. But what if one day the president says, for example, rock music is now illegal. Does that make rock music objectively bad because it&#39;s now illegal?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that when you start a sentence with &quot;you think&quot;, double check to make sure you&#39;re not building a strawman. I did not say we shouldn&#39;t censor, I said that censorship is futile and creates a police state in the process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So tell me how you intend on executing your censorship regime without invading everyone&#39;s privacy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think unicorns should have tea parties, but without technical details it&#39;s not a very compelling argument, is it? I probably don&#39;t have the expertise to even make such an argument, without knowing what it would take to manifest it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the Five Eyes system? How does it violate the constitutional privacy protections of the public? How do you intend to protect dissidents from having CP planted on their computers by MI5 in order to silence them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question, they should be shut down after as many parties as possible who build and use the sites are arrested and prosecuted. Always and never are currency of the foolish. But I think OP was referring to &quot;regular&quot; sites however controversial that are not blatantly illegal. Also, you don&#39;t have to validate your abhorrence to things like child porn. I just assume it disgusts you unless someone demonstrates otherwise. That brings me to a side rant. </p>

<p>The part where we have to lead or end every thought by reiterating how much we hate child porn makes it that much more effective of a power grabbing tool. I&#39;ve never looked for nor possessed it, just like the vast overwhelming majority of people. </p>

<p>Then people do the all or nothing. Either we allow the government to monitor and control every aspect of the internet or child porn on everyone&#39;s computer is inevitable. What about having the regular people do the regular (read: lawful and effective) surveillance and then when they want to go deeper, get a warrant. Even Alex Jones types aren&#39;t opposed to the government doing things like enhanced surveillance, intrusion, and tracking when they have a warrant documenting what they are going to do and why the are going to do it. These dragnets are wholly unnecessary and according to some whistle blowers, reduce effectiveness because they become bogged down in data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who saw the whole thing go down it&#39;s hilarious how badly the Palmer Luckey fiasco was reported in the mainstream media, as if it was evidence of a vast right wing conspiracy to control the internet. </p>

<p>Palmer Luckey wanted to put up shitpost billboards around the U.S with donations from T_D members. Everyone on T_D rejected it because it sounded shady and thought the sub was getting bought out. It was an embarrassment for Milo and a few mods resigned over it. </p>

<p>I can accept that there&#39;s a Russian troll factory pushing nationalism and that a lot of conservative blogspam suspiciously comes from Eastern Europe, but the Palmer Luckey non-story is a sad attempt at finding a right-wing parallel of David Brock and CTR</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed that does happen. But is this what happened with Zika?</p>

<p>Personally I think there are so many man-made environmental toxins throughout the world that entire populations of peoples&#39; immune systems are compromised to the point that something that was once non-life-threatening like Zika can now afflict more horrible effects on people.</p>

<p>Our immune systems as a species are withering due to our own toxins we unleash haphazardly.</p>

<p>Disagreeing with the news featured on the naturalnews.com website is no reason to de-list 140,000+ web pages. (Nor does it make it propaganda.)</p>

<p>They have definitely produced more political news articles since Obummer Season 2 (understandably, what a disaster!) and I don&#39;t like the politics - I like the health news.</p>

<p>The site was way better before politics were infused. You link all politics articles. What about things like the Fukushima crisis?? Naturalnews has been keeping that story afloat since day 1 even if it just rehashes old facts. That is IMPORTANT, especially when MSM buries it and the Japanese government denies it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.  Let me attempt to verbalize how I see the loop.</p>

<p>At every point in the symbol there is another point equidistant in the loop (like a circle, yes), but I believe there is an energy that keeps the loop together.  As a piece of the loop gets further away from the center, the energy of the center pulls the piece back to the center and then it goes to the other side and repeats.  I feel like this explains our duality.  In one realm/existence/reality we are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; but in another we care &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; (one side of the loop being &quot;positive&quot; and the other being &quot;negative&quot;).</p>

<p>In a circle, even if there is energy in the middle keeping the circle static, the circle never changes its distance from the center. In the Lemniscate symbol, the energy pulls back into the center and then moves it back to the other side so we are continually moving from one side to the other with a very brief time at the very center.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress and Im probably not explaining it well.  Let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had a better term then energy.  The energy doesnt influence events as we understand events or as we understand the word &quot;influence&quot;.</p>

<p>Light and sound energy dont &quot;influence&quot; matter (they dont make matter make decisions), but imagine existence without light or sound energy.</p>

<p>No problem about calling me nuts.  When I type this stuff out and tell people these things I feel like I could be listening to a crazy person.   </p>

<p>These are things Ive just &quot;felt&quot; and &quot;seen&quot;.

Granted, a LOT of those thoughts and feelings turned out to be wrong, but some turned out to be right.  Ill pursue this until I come to a satisfactory conclusion (right or wrong).</p>

<p>This reminds me of what a friend of mine would describe as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg">&quot;the sine curve of life.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Ever notice how your life experiences sort of fluctuate between really good and really bad? When things are going well and everything&#39;s at its best, you&#39;re at the top of the curve. But without fail, something inevitably goes wrong. It could be something really damning or something minor, but you always get knocked off the crest. And when you&#39;re balls deep in the trough, eventually something goes your way and you start working your way back up.</p>

<p>But the sine curve is linear, and I don&#39;t think it accurately represents time as a dimension. I&#39;ve never heard anyone describe this theme quite like you have, but it makes a lot of sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Exactly.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going through the Reformation:</p>

<p>The printing press is starting to become dangerous to the establishment and they&#39;re cracking down. Martin Luther is a bother to them by spreading information about the hypocrisy of that establishment, but receives the protection of powers who are sympathetic to his cause. People are breaking from the establishment-pushed thought orthodoxy in record numbers and forming new, and sometimes outlandish, systems of belief. Violent resistance is rife in areas where the grip of the establishment is weakest as cultures work to form the good ideas of the old establishment into something more representative of their culture. Iconoclasty and ideological violence are pandemic, and no-one is sure where they will strike next.</p>

<p>Printing Press = Internet</p>

<p>Martin Luther = Julian Assange</p>

<p>Holy Roman Empire = US Economic Empire</p>

<p>Holy Roman Emperor = POTUS</p>

<p>Theological Clergy = Economists</p>

<p>Inquisitors = Intelligence Agencies</p>

<p>Catholicism = Free Trade</p>

<p>Protestantism = Economic Nationalism</p>

<p>Pope = (?)</p>

<p>Early Reformation = Brexit (?)</p>

<p>Magisterial Reformation = Korea/Japan (?) </p>

<p>Radical Reformation = Islamic Terrorism</p>

<p>Jesuits = MSM</p>

<p>Ottomans = Russia</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear the thoughts of anyone familiar with the Reformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to lurk here frequently, but as I do have some tech background, I feel a little qualified to comment on the subject.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t so much the technology, google, or even greedy faceless companies out to make a buck off our collective ignorance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s our dependency.</p>

<p>For the most part, I&#39;m pretty sure everyone here gets the idea; our dependency on modern technology, and furthermore the convenience of function within this technology is what brought us to this point. For those who might not fully get what I&#39;m saying, allow me to put it like this.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, you decide to go camping. Feeling a bit spontaneous, you elect to make a fire yourself. While this choice doesn&#39;t seem all that important, it is greatly important because it is technology in its most basic form and in this form, you, the user, have complete and total control over how it will be used. You can create fire easily with two sticks and a bit of kindling. No one can patent it, or assign DRM to it. No one can send you a C&amp;D order. It is yours.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s say we alter one variable and instead of you making your own fire, you choose to bring a lighter. Seems innocent enough until you realize that you are dependent upon the lighter to make the fire you yourself once did. However, that dependency doesn&#39;t stop there; you&#39;re dependent upon the designer of the lighter, the producer of the fuel used it, etc. The measure of control you can exert has diminished, albeit in a small way.</p>

<p>To further the example, and to make it of the most relevance to this discussion; imagine you&#39;ve only ever known how to make fire using a lighter. The implication are immense, even though the subject in question is rather small. You are completely dependent and in every way possible; you have no say in how designs will change and how available that device will be. All you can do is consume based on what you are given. When you think about it, this kind of dependency is mirrored throughout our daily lives.</p>

<p>In short, this dependency has grown out of a need for convenience; sacrificing personal effort for quick solutions. We&#39;re willing to sacrifice a bit of control if it means we don&#39;t have to knead our own dough to make a pizza. We&#39;re willing to let someone dictate the quality of our meals if it means saving us a bit of time slaving over a stove. We&#39;re willing to allow others to handle our financial security if it means letting us get on with the less stressful moments in our lives.</p>

<p>It may seem a far cry from your original title, OP, but if you think about it, it makes sense. Modern society has given over control of how we gather information to a finite select group of sources, sources we naively entrust to be unbiased and factually focused. We can&#39;t be surprised when that kind of power is abused for the sake of preserving whatever narrative fits the times.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, I&#39;m likely preaching to the choir on this matter.</p>

<p>My philosophical answer is how do we know what is objectively right and objectively wrong? I think most everyone (especially on this sub) can agree that cp is wrong. And so it is illegal. But what if one day the president says, for example, rock music is now illegal. Does that make rock music objectively bad because it&#39;s now illegal?</p>
