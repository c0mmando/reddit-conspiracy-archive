       Well he makes a ton money off of ads from YouTube. And the fact that he's going out of his way to sell you a "based" water filter just tells you a lot.. thatb reminds me of the lady who was claiming the world was going to end soon and started selling emergency food storage.

       Alex hasn't just started selling anything. He's been in business for a long time. Yes, he makes a ton of money. He also has more listeners than CNN has viewers. Big money in is needed as he has to pay big money out. He isn't some dude doing a podcast. He has something like 50 employees and pays millions in bandwidth costs. This is how business works. If someone doesn't like him they don't have to listen. But he has a right to run his business and make money.

       Alex Jones isn't especially comparable to the CEO of Exxon?  Read that comparison back to yourself.  Doesn't that sound a bit wild to you?  It's blatantly arbitrary.

       It is why DMT and other hallucinogens are illegal.  It is to prevent us from opening the third eye, so we do not realize we are all one.  I mean all of humanity, and all of life.  It is the great secret.  Native cultures learned this long ago, but their knowledge is suppressed.

       It is interesting that the CIA promoted research in LSD, and then LSD use caused the hippy generation.  Peace, love, great music, great art, etc.  The CIA wanted to use LSD for mind control.  When they saw how it was setting people free and empowering them, they made LSD illegal.

       And the MSM channels who are all owned by 6 corporations have commercials to sell stuff and earn money. Most independent/alternative  media outlets have ad space on their websites or patreon to earn money he isn't forcing anybody to buy it and he isn't asking YOU to pay attention to him. Why does it matter?

      <p>
       David Seaman : the alleged Bitcoin forefront reporter who failed to buy enough to make any money and so needs people to give him money, nothing in return, in order to fund shitty youtube videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex is a bit of a tit that's undeniable but I imagine, like myself, he was many people's introduction into the conspiracy world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course he wants to make money, we all do, but he's not forcing anyone to buy it. And to be frank the fluoride issue is an issue so if someone has a tool to mitigate it, is that a crime to advertise it?
