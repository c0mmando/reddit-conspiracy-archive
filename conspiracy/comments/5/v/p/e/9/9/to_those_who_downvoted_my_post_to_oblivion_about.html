    <div class="md"><p>Alex hasn&#39;t just started selling anything. He&#39;s been in business for a long time. Yes, he makes a ton of money. He also has more listeners than CNN has viewers. Big money in is needed as he has to pay big money out. He isn&#39;t some dude doing a podcast. He has something like 50 employees and pays millions in bandwidth costs. This is how business works. If someone doesn&#39;t like him they don&#39;t have to listen. But he has a right to run his business and make money. </p>

<p>It is interesting that the CIA promoted research in LSD, and then LSD use caused the hippy generation.  Peace, love, great music, great art, etc.  The CIA wanted to use LSD for mind control.  When they saw how it was setting people free and empowering them, they made LSD illegal.  </p>

<p>Alex Jones for having a business that sells items to create financial backing for his (albeit biased) news organization</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>David Seaman : the alleged Bitcoin forefront reporter who failed to buy enough to make any money and so needs people to give him money, nothing in return, in order to fund shitty youtube videos?</p>

<p>Alex is a bit of a tit that&#39;s undeniable but I imagine, like myself, he was many people&#39;s introduction into the conspiracy world. </p>

<p>Of course he wants to make money, we all do, but he&#39;s not forcing anyone to buy it. And to be frank the fluoride issue is an issue so if someone has a tool to mitigate it, is that a crime to advertise it?</p>
