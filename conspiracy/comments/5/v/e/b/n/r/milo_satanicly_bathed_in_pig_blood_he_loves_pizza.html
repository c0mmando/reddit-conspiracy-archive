       - Milo posting prominent pictures of him with pizza. "True Religion"?? Is pizza his religion? Pedophilia and child porn is his religion? It's a message to the fellow #pizzapedos that he's their inside man. This scandal was manufactured to throw us off the trail.

       - Isn't it a (((COINCIDENCE))) that he is in love with "PizzaPartyBen"? "I LOVE PIZZA PARTIES" - can he be any more clear?

       - HE CALLS HIMSELF "PIZZA PARTY MILO"! He admits attending child sex parties so he knows what this means! He knows their terminology and code words, and he is using them!
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo is very media savvy! This could not have been a mistake! Be very careful! This is only the start of my investigation.

       Milo says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "when I announced I was going to speak about pizzagate, I got calls from DC saying: stop it!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       HE GETS PERSONAL CALLS FROM HIGH RANKING POLITICIANS IN DC TO STOP HIM TALKING ABOUT IT? WHY? Because he is more involved than we know! Maybe the PEDOPHILES IN CHARGE didn't agree with his undercover tactic?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit 2 : He calls his pig blood bathing "art"? Like Podestas child torture (((art)))? Like the spirit cooking (((art)))? Like the eating blood soup off naked women (((art)))?
      </p>

        SATANIC TEMPLE
       </strong>
       DISAVOWS ITSELF FROM MILO PROTESTORS? WHY? SATANIC TEMPLE SIDES WITH MILO? WHY? BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE'S ONE OF THEM!
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo also very familiar with Satanic groups! Refers to satanists by their first name "Jex" and posting articles promoting them

       - Multiple tweets about "pineapple pizza". Not "pineapple and ham" pizza, not "pineapple and cheese" pizza, just "pineapple". Seems like codewords to me. Very suspicious way to discuss pizza, like in the emails. Not natural at all. Thanks for the support so far guys, I think we're on to something.

        ROUNDUP
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Milo talks often about sex with children
       </li>
       <li>
        Milo admits attending hollywood child sex parties ( Knows their codewords too )
       </li>
       <li>
        Milo often talks about "pizza parties" and "pizza" openly to signal to other pedos, especially with visual clues on his clothing
       </li>
       <li>
        Milo is very media savvy, intelligent, and image conscious - these were not mistakes he knew what it meant!
       </li>
       <li>
        He uses "pineapple pizza" and other codewords like pedos
       </li>
       <li>
        Very knowledgeable about Satanic groups and Satanic groups defend him
       </li>
       <li>
        Literally bathed in Satanic pigs blood, called it Art like Podestas baby torture art
       </li>
       <li>
        High ranking politicians in DC call him often about pizzagate and pedophilia
       </li>
       <li>
        Pedo symbols in his tour material
       </li>
      </ul>

       Step outside your circle of "everyone" else then. Most people havent seen anything, and either dont comment or repeat the stupid quips you guys leave.

       When you show people the full breadth of the investigation, they start questioning things and understand the topic.

       Most likely yes. I do performance art type stuff on occasion and I researched using blood for a piece - most uses of blood in performance art which doesn't involve actually cutting yourself or whatever are pig's blood, which is reasonably easy to source from butchers, usually chilled to kill off any germs etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I do find funny is how ridiculously het up some conspiracy people get about performance art. Most of it is just about shocking people (Milo's frankly rather derivative piece definitely was), some of it is good, some of it has interesting ritual or shamanic elements but it isn't teh Satanoidz trying to work bad juju to bring about the New Birb Order. Anyone thinking that, in my opinion, needs to crack the books harder and revise their understanding of both art and magic, frankly.

        on the front page

       of the sub because she has a charitable organization that has a logo depicting moth wings, which means it's obviously a front for child abuse and she's tied to pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo has blood-splattered photos (which for other people were seen as evidence of nefarious deeds) and expressions of pizza love (which for other people were seen as evidence of nefarious deeds) and talks about pizza parties (which for other people were seen as evidence of nefarious deeds), but that's just art and innocuous food references.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and he's literally on record as saying he's okay with older men having sex with boys.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys."

       She's the pedo supporter. He's just a victim of a smear campaign.

       Gosh, I can't imagine why the two would get different treatment from the pizzagate community. What could it
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       be? What on
       <em>

       could be the thing that distinguishes them and gets them treated different?

       Careful, you can develop back problems from bending over backwards like that.

      <p>
       He's literally, unambiguously talking about sexual relationships - but you know this already. You already know that the context of those comments was a sexual one and that the surrounding comments are about sexual relationships, such as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The entire
       <em>
        context
       </em>
       of the conversation was about sex, consent, and age. Why are you trying to pretend otherwise?

       Probably because proving Milo as a pedo would be neither interesting nor surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, there seem to be a lot of people hellbent of proving he

       a pedo. Probably for petty reasons, I doubt there's a conspiracy to discredit a walking meme.

       Jesus, are you serious?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not putting you down because this is a Milo thread and I'm somehow a supporter of this prick, nor am I putting you down because I don't support the pizzagate theory, you can check my history to see I very much argue for its existence. I'm putting you down because you're reaching to a ridiculous extent with all this, especially that comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I have commented on threads before where I thought people were reaching beyond the reasonable speculation, but you are pushing it to new levels and are discrediting any prior investigation, willingly or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The pigs blood stunt:
       </strong>
       Not unlike the spirit cooking, disturbing but not criminal. I'm very much intrigued by Abramovic and her art and can see how it attracts people with varying levels of perversions, but I don't find it criminal or worthy of banning. If anything truly nefarious like actual sacrifices, rapes or murders were to be proven in connection to spirit cooking I would change my mind. If it were to be proven that Milo bathing in pigs blood was anything more than a publicity stunt, I would change my mind. Until then, who gives a shit? Stay suspicious, that's fine, I'll stay suspicious too, but calm your shit, mate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The pizza foto with the stitched on jacket?
       </strong>
       Even if that was John Podesta or Alefantis or Clinton herself, I wouldn't give a fuck. No serious pizzagate researcher would see anything nefarious in that and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        PizzaPartyBen:
       </strong>
       A connection that leads nowhere from what I can tell. I get a strong feeling you're just throwing wild accusations around so it looks to outsiders like that's all that pizzagate researchers do. I going to assume I'm wrong in my suspicions of this thread and that you just had a bowl too many today.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        And the pineapple pizza?
       </strong>
       Come on, man. What's universally known as either the worst or the best pizza of all time, depending on who you ask? PINEAPPLE PIZZA. Not Pineapple and Ham pizza, I worked at a pizza place for years and noone ever orders a "Pineapple and Ham pizza".
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, nobody is surprised that douchebag Milo holds twisted and controversial views. Nobody is surprised he would actually defend these twisted views, but they're views. There is nothing more we have proof or indication of at this point. You added nothing but misinformation to this topic. I'm sorry to put you down like that if you merely acted out of a hyperactive imagination but on behalf of my suspicion that you may actually be attempting to slide the forum I have to be as frank as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and lastly, you should really brush up on your understanding of Satanism if you wanna throw connections and accusations around.

       Sounds pretty good to me. These are not the "satanists" you see in public, with public websites and commnity meets that you should worry about. It's the ones that take "Do what thy wilt!" uncompromisingly literal that do what they want no matter the consequences for others. They don't have to be satanists to be sociopaths, you dig? There's lots to be learned from satanist teachings that don't result in death and murder. Like all religion, the interpretations is very much up to the believer.

       I have been following this revelation from before it had a name and still have my doubts about most of the so-called "evidence", not just yours. But I'm practically convinced at this point, that the core of the theory is terrifyingly accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The George Webb series, in my view, has it figured out most accurately and objectively from all the material out there and it has very little to do with Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis. We're talking massive human trafficking networks, not just children and not just for sex, but these seem to be the most disturbing crimes to outsiders and the most prestigious purchases for those involved. But there is also drug running, weapon sales, intelligence and state secrets for auction, slave labor, still too this day, and organ harvesting going on. Both the Clinton Foundation and Dyncorp appear central to the apparatus. CPP, at best, is a meeting place for a small part of the network. Taking down Alefantis is like taking down one of the Padre's honchos on the street. It effectively changes nothing.

       I didn't mind being dismissed harshly don't worry. Maybe I was wrong to portray only this interpretation of Satanism and include all in that interpretation. "Pineapple pizza" was not a lie, people where I am from do not call it that.

       Fair enough. Still doesn't make it's code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I get that people might think Milo is a pedo from the comments he made, and I'm not gonna deny the possibility that someone with his views may be tempted to act on them. But it is not a given conclusion that this is what is happening or that he ever did. He advocates for moral relativism, as many others do. He just takes his views a step or two farther than most reasonable adults would be ready to do. I personally hold starkly opposed views and consider moral relativism a dangerous delusion, but as long as it's just that, I will defend those people's rights to try to make me see their side. That's free speech.

       If there are any criminal actions involved, the story changes drastically, but so far all we have on him is a controversial stance on the age of consent, but no actionable offense worth getting your knickers in a twist over.

       The True Religion / Pizza pic has me dying laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
       True Religion is an extremely popular brand of clothing and it appears he is sitting with a fan/friend. I know Podesta has made us all have a negative connotation with pizza, but news flash....not EVERY SINGLE PIZZA picture is pizza related even if we want it to be.

       I've eaten slices of pizza since the news came out.

       I think this is just another clue. Not to be rude ( Unless she is involved) but that lady is what Milo would consider "fat". Why is he taking photos with people he thinks should be shamed and shunned?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it to indicate to fellow pedos "I am not in character right now, this is the real me, look at me with this lady I normally wouldn't associate with."

       Not every pizza picture that is true! But pizza pictures from well known pedos I think are open to analysis.

       I have lurked here for many years but thank you for the welcome. I can't remember if pizzagate had started when the fake dating website accused assange of being a pedo, or if pizzagate was after that. But the fake dating website primed me to be open minded to it and it was around the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not very well read with pizzagate I am sorry, I only skim the information. I did not want to give the impression I was a big honcho. The clinton connections to people involved in child trafficking and kidnap seems like the strongest strand to this amateur

       A lot of it is grasping at straws. Do you know exactly what you're doing at any point in time when you're piecing together a complex puzzle? I suspect you too will be grasping for pieces without knowing which context they belong to or if they'll get you any closer to the final picture, but that's what you have to do. Who knows, half the time you might be holding pieces of a totally different puzzle in hand, that just vaguely looks to fit in the puzzle you're trying to solve.

       As long as people remain critical and skeptical of their own ideas and the ideas of others, we'll get there in time. Have a little patience.

       Watch the George Webb series if you wanna get perhaps the most plausible reading of what has been revealed thus far. As I've said in other threads. Comet Ping Pong is incidental, Dyncorp and the Clinton Foundation is the trunk of the rotten tree that has been throwing shade on our picknick all this time. These are the fuckers that need to be exposed, all the way down to the British Crown. The root of this evil.

       This is just a blatant sub-attack on Reddit to coincide nicely with the Milo scandal spat out by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, his words were twisted and regurgitated by the MSM to discredit him, the threat that he posed as a potential bridge between liberals and alt-righters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no fucking way that the masters of our planet would let that bridge be built. His image will be soiled and we will lose another opportunity to actually listen to each other. Divide and conquer.

       I haven't got that far yet. There are a lot of websites discussing him, satanism, homosexuality, and his blood bath. A lot of them were racist or very focused on him being a Jew though, I will go through them if I can.

       I highly suggest you look into the piece. It was part of a pro Trump art show hosted by Lucrien Wintrich called "Daddy will save us". Milos piece was called "Angel Mom" and was meant to represent the suffering of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorism. Behind the claw bathtub on the wall are photos of victims from the hands of illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorism.. the blood is meant to represent the innocent lives lost.

       I'm pretty shire I saw pictures of him laughing and I think drinking champagne out of the bottle in that tub of blood. It didn't come off as such a somber demonstration as you described. Maybe it was just some satanic front like the Super Bowl halftime show?

       I did not describe the atmosphere of the art show. I merely gave context to the photos. It seemed OP was hastily trying to link things to PG without properly finding the context to support his suspicions. I was honestly put off by his choice of using the bath and pigs blood. However this art show took place around the same time that spirt cooking was becoming a big talking point against HRC. I believe he used the set up to 1) be outrageous and in turn gain more interest/clicks and 2) because it was relevant to anti HRC/podesta information freshly circulating.

       We all know why you're posting this, pacifier. If this is your concept of a joke, know that we're dealing with real child molesters. The problem is endemic. Nobody praises or admires Milo, we don't give a shit about his fantasies. He's a useful distraction, like many others. He's not in power. He's not a war criminal. This is not a partisan investigation.
