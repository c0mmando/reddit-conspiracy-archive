       Did you say things like: Do you think I would be good at playing dominoes in the cheese pizza or the pepperoni one? Or things like yes the entertainment will be 7, 8 and 11. They are shy but bring swimsuits the pool will be heated

       That didn't look like anything.  Looked like an inside jokes and talking about a party.

       I copied the first sentence I found where I used the word map.  Let me know what you think it means:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Have you thought about maybe adding a map and marking the major sites (the Cummings ones)? They love their maps....

       Maybe not, did you read the end where they talk about the ages of kids and saying they will definitely be in the pool? This is also just one out of very many emails that are sketchy. You should check out the fatherhood video too

       Because kids never like hanging out in the pool during a pool party, right? And maybe the guests will need a map to get to a semi-rural property in MD they've never been to before. And maybe a couple of friends are bringing their housekeeper's kids with them for a break from the city?  And maybe. . . .

       I've always found watching kids playing entertaining-- especially when they're with new friends-- so yes, they are indeed "entertainment" for many-- especially us oldsters (like Clinton, for example). And I've heard all manner of cutsie and affectionate names -- and seemingly insulting ones, too-- used to describe them.

       Yeah, that isn't weird.  Parents always talk about their kids ages.  Kids like to swim.  You really think it is more plausible that a pedo ring is using their work email to plan pedo "activities" than a normal get together where kids are invited and they have a pool??

       I wouldn't say hard evidence, at least enough to throw the cuffs on him at this point.  There are just a lot of oddities. Like the weird code that other pedos use that is used in tons of emails, the symbols that were linked to the declassified FBI doc in 2007, the 'fatherhood' video, the band at that pizza shop that talked about pedophilia like 'everyone has their preferences', the weird art of little kids in diapers in his brother's house, the weird art routines that look like satanic rituals and so on. Those are just the things I've seen

       Well none of those are owned by Tony Podesta.  They are works of art created by a woman whose art he does have in his home, which you can see on the walls in
       <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">
        this article
       </a>
       which are not of kids in their underwear. Is there other pictures of Tony Podesta's house where these pics are seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll ask again, is there any actual evidence? I would love to get on board with this, but all I've ever seen is a bunch of Da Vinci coding with no actual payoff.

       Welp there was but that article I read was deleted so now I look like an idiot. He did own paintings like those and they were mentioned in the article, however it wasn't the main subject. It was an article from 10 years ago and they mysteriously deleted it when the pizzagate shit came out. But check out the fatherhood video. Do your own research. The one thing that is annoying to me is that he hasn't addressed the emails he hasn't addressed the videos to my knowledge, the only thing he has said about it, is that it is 'fake news' and people should move along. But you seem to have already made up your mind so I don't want to take anymore time trying to change it. I hope you're right and I am wrong

       Well indeed. I'm doing the research and I'm presenting you with facts. You haven't really presented anything at all yet. You hope I'm right and yet you keep perpetuating the story as if you're sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I read the WaPo article from 2004 as well as saw the accompanying picture that also did not contain anything odd. And also, for the record, the stories were both about Tony Podesta, not John.

       Lastly, my mind is very much not made up but so far, you, nor the pizza party have shown or said anything other than what amounts to fanfic. I'm asking you to help me nail this guy to the wall if he's indeed a satanic child molester.

       I do hope you're right? Why would anyone want this to be the truth? And we certainly weren't reading the same article. Yes as I said before this was his brother's art collection. Other than the art collection what is it exactly that you think you have debunked? The emails? Also what do you mean Jeffery Epstein crew?

       Well you initially linked me to an email chain by people who weren't the Podestas talking about nothing in particular. You haven't actually provided any other evidence except for that and
       <a href="https://archive.fo/HhWH9">
        an article(which is most definitely the same article)
       </a>
       that I found about an art collector. Have you actually seen the photos in question? They're by Katy Grannan and you can find them by doing an image search for "katy grannan photography suburban teens" in Google or Bing. Maybe I've lived in cities or have been on the internet too long but they're not even remotely shocking, gross or exploitative.

       Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire pedophile that had a sex slave island who Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were friends with. They both spent time on the 'Lolita Express', his private jet that ran to and from the island. Now, if you'd like to be as genuinely curious as you say,

       Damn you for keeping me up haha. Yes I find the suburban teen photos disturbing. I skimmed the article and that is very disturbing. When trump says he has been around these people for years and knows how corrupt they are do you think this is what he is talking about? If he is part of pedo shit I would lose all support for him that's for damned sure. Also what do you think about Trumps plans to attack sex trafficking today, making it known nationwide that it is a very real problem? Also idk if you saw it but

       Which part? Pizzagate? Evidence surrounding him and real life convicted pedophiles is much more concrete than pizza logos and handkerchiefs. But when he's talking about corruption, no I don't think he's talking pizzagate. He's talking about politicians he's paid for, his cabinet, who've all paid to him for their positions, and himself who is essentially charging rich business owners for access to him at Mar-A-Lago.

       The way you worded it sounds bad but pretty sure it was closer to "do you think I'd play dominoes better on pasta or pizza?" Which sounds more like drugs to me. Funnily enough the term "cheese pizza" doesn't appear in the emails once.

       I've just found some people will refuse to believe they're not code words. So I figured the way it's worded ("on pizza or pasta") makes it sound like if it's code for anything it'd be drugs.

       Great question.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a pizzagate supporter; my concern isn't necessarily with Podesta/Alefantis but with the bigger picture of child trafficking being brought to people's attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, there is no legit evidence that Podesta likes kids. There are just several intriguing things. (his coded emails, his link to Comet with their pedo instagram 'humor', his and his family's art preferences, "spirit cooking", his link to the Clintons and the emerging evidence of Clinton Foundation crimes, the McCann suspect sketches...).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Shit adds up", ya know?
      </p>
      <p>
       For sure Podesta is a weirdo. Not for sure that Podesta likes or abuses kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like it's worth investigating, though, doesn't it?

       If it was my choice i dont think it rises to being worth investigating.  Each piece of evidence seems really shoddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However im not bothered by anyone that wants to make an investigation happen.  I say if that's how you feel then push it.  What does seem scary to me is how many people have already concluded he's a pedo.  Im sure Podesta is fine and probably doesnt care too much how conspiracy folks feel,  but he is a human that has to go to bed every night.  The mob mentality to condemn someone with such weak evidence to me in unnerving.

       I hear you; but to me it's been pretty justified by the response. There's been little attempt to address any of the evidence - and if it's so weak, this should be easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fake news" is a post-pizzagate concept. If you've been following since the start; you'll know the response has been to just label it an 'absurd conspiracy theory'; without even acknowledging that it's a serious topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, to each their own opinion. It's nice to have a civilized convo about it.

       People have had their lives destroyed because of false pedophilia accusations.  Someone using the words "pizza" and "walnut" in their email and attending a famous performance artist's event is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end it comes down to do you as a person think it's justified to ruin someone's life over speculation because you find the guy "creepy".  There is not one victim, not one person who has come forward saying they were abused by Podesta.  All you have is a few words and a triangle in a logo of a pizzeria.

       If you just go by the art in his house you think wow what a fucking nut. If you just go by the weird ass handkerchief email you think well that's weird.  If you just go by all the strange food emails you think maybe him and his buddies have some kind of lingo, weird but whatever.

       I wouldn't be surprised if they can't link him to anything related to acts of pedophilia. But they'll probably catch him for a list of Hillary's dirty laundry. He's already been set up as the fall guy, even if it won't revive her political career.
