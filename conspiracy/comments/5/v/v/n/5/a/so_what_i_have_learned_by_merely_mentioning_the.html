       For the mere mention of the word, a post mentioning 'prayer' will be downvoted.  For the mere mention of the word, a post mentioning 'prayer' will be mocked.  For the mere mention of the word, commenters will get nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tells me a few things: 1) there are shills here (we all knew that) 2) people are easily offended over words 3) many are open to almost any and every new idea, fad, opinion, jabberwocky, flim flam, butternut, gobbledygook, hornwonk, or even a well-founded conspiracy
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       for the greatest Conspiracy of Them All:  That there is a God, He exists and is trying to get through to us and that we can communicate with Him through prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, it suggests to me that people may actually be afraid of prayer. Or simply of things they don't understand.  Or afraid of other people who say things they don't understand? Or afraid to even consider the possibility of anything remotely related to God?
      </p>
      <p>
       Haven't quite figured it out yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can think of any other reasons why posts with the merely the word 'prayer' in them would be so derped upon, please comment.

       I'm an ex-Catholic, now more spiritual, so I will preface it with that. We have a vast readership here. Many are atheists, spiritual, religious, etc etc. For the most part, I see a heavy leaning to more spiritual. People not believing in religion or not atheist, but believing in intelligent creation of some sorts, like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only speak for myself, but I see many of us have "been there done that", and have evolved in thinking and spirituality. I see religion as a control mechanism, but I'm not going to throw baby out with the bath water (prayer is that we are all connected to the universal conscious mind - Aether). There are many good things encoded in many religious texts, but that's the thing, it's encoded and not meant for the masses. Hence the control mechanism.

       I saw that post, and who derailed it (no stranger to them). Let's just say, they are known here to be a... yeah, I'll use the word "distraction"... To get you to do exactly what you did. Be strong in your faith/spirituality. Just know many have been in the same place, and a few coward users are not representative of the users here. We are all individuals, and ultimately we have zero idea why we are here, or how we got here. I'll leave you with this:

       PLC is attacked often and he says his peace with little care.  I think if your point is intellectually strong, you can ignore all the emotional bullcrap replies, and await intellectual replies agreeing or disagreeing with you.

      <p>
       Honestly, I prefer intellectual disagreement, as it gets me thinking about my stance deeper.

       Maybe because one of the biggest conspiracies that people have been trying to get evidence of and uncover is pedophilia rings &amp; the largest known group of pedophile sympathizers and protectors is the catholic church and the pope, who also believe "just pray and confess and everything is all gravy"

Maybe that's not what Catholics believe.

       And maybe there are plenty of Catholics who are appalled by what happened and stand by Christ's statement that "it is better to have a millstone thrown around one's neck and be thrown into the sea than to harm children".

       The enemy plans a mass "hex" tomorrow. We should respond with our synchronised prayer beginning tomorrow as well. Yes, it is a spiritual war.

       The original date was for the 25th but the "hex" is supposed to be tomorrow so i suggested moving the prayer up or beginning early. The thread on the original prayer plan is here:

       Most of the world's population have a religion. Therefore, the "existence of god" is not a "conspiracy" unless there's no god and people conspire to make one to create a control mechanism that ensures the obedience of the populace through the fear of eternal torture in the afterlife.

       I was in that post earlier. The word prayer didn't trigger anyone, we all just think you are retarded. You can play pretend with your battle of good and evil nonsense, but at the end of the day both groups are accomplishing nothing, and it's just sad that in this day and age we have people like you who believe in magic. And dont tell me you don't, because if you didn't you'd have no reason to feel threatened by these "witches".

       You don't have to believe as I do, and nothing in my post suggested that you did.
      </p>

       All you have to do is keep on scrolling.   You're entitled to you're beliefs.  I'm entitled to mine.  Live and let live.

       But again, no one's saying you have to believe that.  Only to take a step back out of your headspace for two seconds and understand that there are those  who
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe.

       It is really a 'live and let live' situation, but ppl. got to come and crap all over...

       If there's any truth to this, then it's suspicious to me why 'Hawking' pushes atheism

       Hm.  IDK...the evidence here does not appear very convincing.  *to me.

       I do agree with you though --there is a 'push' to atheism.

       We All Should Be Praying. Every Day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a Christian, but I'm not here to evangelize, and I mostly echo Mr. Putin_loves_cats that I probably know nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know that a very very wise guy I know who is older than me and NOT a Christian but is extremely respected in the Conspiracy community and has arguably done as much as anyone alive to push forward alternative news and thinking once told me "The MOST important thing you can do is pray."
      </p>
      <p>
       This man, if not me, is worth listening to. If anyone wants to know who it is so you can investigate his background yourself, PM me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not the end-all of this universe. There are dimensions outside our own limited perspective, beyond time. They listen. I know it. Many others do, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for listening. I'll pray for all of you, and thank you OP.

       "just pray and confess and everything is all gravy
Maybe that's not what Catholics believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe there are plenty of Catholics who are appalled by what happened and stand by Christ's statement that "it is better to have a millstone thrown around one's neck and be thrown into the sea than to harm children".
