       Check out the front page post about Alex Jones on Rogan podcast,
how many hits do you get when searching the comment section for jew? zero. No talk about Alex being citizen of Israel, no mention he has jew wife, no mention that he never talks about the jews running the banks and media. All the conspiracies under the sun, but no mentioning of the jews.

       I know right? How could anyone possibly be an anti-Semite? That's literally the worst thing anyone could possibly be. I mean racism is bad, but not liking Jews is even worse than this. They have never, ever done anything to deserve any sort of negativity. Thank you for your work defending this helpless and beleaguered population that doesn't have any real power in the world.

       Lol wrong. Semite means a group of people who speak or spoke Semitic languages. And you realize Hebrew is a Semitic language. Jesus spoke Aramaic, which is also a Semitic language, and I'm pretty sure he was Jewish.

       lol i'm not. the original semites were arabs. even from the modern definition, arabs are also semites, thus the term anti-semetic doesnt mean shit. would have to be against all semites, which would include arabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       modern jews have nothing to do with the ancient Israelites/Hebrews.
most modern jews are converts in the 8th century, they are a turkish people from the kingdom of Khazar. they later migrated north to germany, and east to former soviet land.

       when most people use anti-semetic they use it in the context of being anti jewish. which is bullshit. saying israel shouldnt steal arab land they say you are being anti-semetic. ehh, if they are both semites, how does pointing out one is hurting the other make you an anti semite?? 
it is a linguistic issue.

       Late reply in the time of the internet's. But it's amazing that you bring up this topic.. 
There is an amazing story I was told by by grandma who happens to be an ashkenazi jew. She says most Jews are not in fact Semites. But in their teachings they are descendants of early hittites. The assyrians which you now know are Semites drove them from their lands many centuries ago. And while most modern jews are european and arab intermixed the term semite does not really apply to jews at all.. but rather syrians, iranians, the turks, and egyptians. 
Not trying to stir the pot but lend some family knowledge and teaching handed down over the years.

when was the last time you heard it used to mean anti-Arab.

       sooo, the state of Israel is the most anti-semetic nation, considering how many arabs (semites) they've bombed, murdered and straight up stolen from... am i being anti-semetic for pointing that out??

       I will settle this once and for all. There's no need for DNA-tests, even though they also prove the semitic heritage of the Aschkenazis. The one and only bullet-proof test you need is your eyes. It's clear as day that they are semites.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       happen to not look semitic, it's because of mixing with Europeans, and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       because of some Khazar-blood, thousand years ago.

       there is also DNA-tests that ties their DNA more closely to Europeans than to Middle-Easterners. And even those tests can be false depending on the premise, are they using contemporary populations as surrogates for ancient populations? if so then have to be skeptical of the tests because whose to say the contemporary populations are the same as the ancient populations. For example Egypt and Libya, the ancient population of those lands are not the same as the modern population.

       I agree, that's why I said DNA doesn't matter, because just by looking at them they are obvious semites. Sure they have European heritage, but that's also my point: the Khazar theory is worthless. You didn't mention it so it's not directed to you, but rather to everyone who always bring it up. Many even imply they are part of us Europeans, but I will never accept that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I think of it, you didn't say anything wrong. It is actually true that arabs are truer semites, since they are less mixed. I'm just tired of the Khazar myth popping up all the time, it's detrimental for us Europeans. Also, I'm sceptical to DNA-science, I don't think we should rely on that because it will be used against us.

        Finally, I will simply say that the utilization of the term “anti-Semitism” as a politically weaponized canard is an attempt to conceal what I believe the truth to be about the doctrine of Jewish racial supremacist ideology as the philosophical underpinning for land thievery, terrorism, and genocide in Palestine, along with the systematic concealment of the evidence of overwhelming Jewish financial and political support in the United States and Europe for fiat money and central banking; globalist trade treaties; Israel’s usurpation of American foreign policy; the overwhelmingly Jewish ownership position in the major media consortiums operating in the West; the amount of Jewish and pro-Israel PAC money routinely buying American Presidential elections and Congressional seats and committee assignments on Capitol Hill; and the provably disproportionate role played by Jewish interests in promoting the Cultural Marxism which has engulfed the United States and Western Europe in my lifetime, especially in the advancement of the LGBT agenda, the abortion industry, the pornography industry, and so forth

        DISCLAIMER

       I have nothing against Jews in particular, I hate every group that tries to be special inside a larger group. So yes that includes all religions and more.

       Loads of shills here, Come on let's not pretend that the Jewish people are the most

       As for Alex Jones, He's sometimes has decent stories, often stolen from this sub, but for the most part it's shit. He's had Jewish ties for a long time. He droped pizzagate but after it got enough fans picked it up again. He's nothing but a guy that wants to get rich. He's not out there to inform you, only you can inform you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that no one here seems to see a link between Trump, Alex and Israel. Why is there no JIDF on the_Donald, Why is Alex suddenly near the white house, why was Trump giving an interview with Netanyahu about greater Israel, a 1 state solution for the middle east that include a great territory and many nation with Israel leading it all. This means that Iran will be attacked and deals where made with Russia and China, Iran's allies, China gets Taiwan Russia keeps Crimea. all for the glory of Israel. But why are the American Jews still against Trump, they know what will happen they are not stupid people. My only guess is that they use Trump to get rid of Iran and afterward they can dump him because the chance from a backlash, for the USA Jews and Israel, about a war with Iran is too risky (imagine all those  angry mobs after few years of real war with Iran all trying to point fingers while millions are dead).
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh for those that think the Jews did 9-11
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes but also Christians and Muslims it was one big happy USA ISRAEL SAUDI project and of course USA was leading it. the question is who? George bush Sr? He is after all, the great CIA man.

I think I read on one of the chans that he used to mention the jew, years ago. Is it true he's married to a Jewish person?

       Umm...He has constantly criticised the nation of Israel but he is not an anti-Semite. He constantly attacks the banks and media as well. Why would he mention his wife's religion? So this makes him a fraud?

       The key will be when Paul Craig Roberts and other credible people find somewhere else to hang.    There aren't that many channels for people to go to.    That's one reason r/conspiracy is so great,  you can find stuff here from all over.    Another good choice is Zero Hedge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy Dore has also started bringing on credible people.    James Corbett is consistently good.    Sibel Edmonds tries hard,  is not a kook or a liar.   Redacted Tonight is more sensational shit,  just adding more noise to a crowded misinformed attempt to cash in on a popularity contest where the lowest common denominator has to be included in order to make a buck.    Notice how Dennis Kucinich,  who is no fool,  went on FOX recently to make a rare announcement.    Its strange out there,  but I can see why he did it,  considering the alternatives.    FOX is better than Alex Jones!!!   Weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah,  Alex Jones is a problem for the truth movement.     People need to boycott that shit.

       I'm sorry to say, Ken is not the real deal either, even though he says great things too and he's one of the closest to keeping to the truth. Around

       he talks about

       . There are other things that give me bad vibes, which I can't express clearly right now. I still think it's worth listening to both of them, I actually don't think they are in on it, they are just dishonest and cowards.

       Yes I had the same concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is strange that a man (Alex) who's so into conspiracies can't see the link between globalism, media control and JEWs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't understand why he's defending israel so much lately....like on one hand he bashes on globalist which are mostly jews...but then defends the israel state...wtf?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       This been said, if he dared to talk somehow about the jews, the mainstream media would have had used it against him. Which is maybe the reason why he doesn't. b/c nothing is worst on this world than been anti-semite.
