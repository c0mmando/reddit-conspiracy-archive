       But why does the awakening have to happen all at once? You would think it would take a long time for it to happen.. and why so many different unrelated subjects at once? Here's an example -

       Because life is an endless feedback loop. Output becomes input becomes output, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       For millennia, there were very few people actively working to innovate, and whatever innovation was achieved took a long time to spread. This connectivity of ideas took a very long time to solidify to such a level that innovation and technological progression on a large scale could be directly observed within a single lifetime. This was probably just a 2-4 centuries ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now, the feedback loop has effectively become a feedback spiral, and much of what is going on is beyond our control (even though certain elements of our society try desperately to keep a lid on it all so they can maintain their power a little longer). Things happen quickly and often organically, through a vastly increased capacity for people to act on behalf of their own ideas and agency, while connecting and sharing these ideas, in theory without limits. A good enough idea today can easily spread from a remote Kasachstani village to every corner of the world without anyone interfering with its spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the PewDiePie fiasco just last week. Something as inane as an edgy offside joke was naively given the spotlight by the MSM in an attempt to reduce his credibility with his ginormous audience, the idea propagated around the world and was immediately met with an even stronger backlash to the original criticism. Because we're all connected so closely today, we run through scenario after scenario, finding truth or at least vigorously dispelling notions of official bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect is the 100th monkey phenomenon, in which an idea seems to explode and spread across the planet once a critical mass of people starts believing in it. The phenomenon is true and observed, but it's mechanism defies current attempts of explanation, but hints at a fundamental interconnectedness of all things, the foundation of collective consciousness. It is often taken as the reason why scientific discoveries so often occur simultaneously in two or more seemingly disconnected studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more we put out, the more we put in, the more we put out, etc. It's our evolution and learning happening on the logarithmic scale, and it is only going to quicken. Either to a point in which it all breaks down (the fundamental idea of the Fermi paradox), or to one in which we collectively transcend our current boundaries and embark on a new, unforeseen era of evolution and discovery (aka. the Singularity theory, Ascension, the age of Aquarius, this idea has many names and many nuances).

       Solid post! But I tend to blame it on internet access, social media, high standard of livening, air conditioning, etc etc. my jr. Co philosophy teacher told us that philosophy flourishes when all the prerequisites of society are met. and I think we're there, it's easy to exist now.

       That certainly makes sense. Flowers blossom the most beautiful too when all their basic needs are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also makes an argument for why certain elite factions appear to aim to maintain artificial scarcity. When the people are preoccupied with merely clinging to existence, they won't have time nor energy to question their authority or even dare to revolt. Only to a certain degree, of course, as too much scarcity means you have nothing to lose, but keep the population placid and lukewarm and you'll be in power for an eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The well-established balance that has kept western populations compliant with an oppressive and regressive system is now upset, as westerners finally understand that immoral overseas actions have dramatic domestic consequences, that the fate and happiness of the rest of the world will establish a baseline for prosperity everywhere. Fucking over the foreign poor for the sake of domestic wealth has finally proved to be a terrible endeavor for everyone involved, except for the powerful few calling the shots.

       True.. but when people release info they have to be considered reliable and trustworthy. Without that people won't look at it. I know this from experience because I tried to get important info out and people had no reason to believe me or do the work necessary to believe me.

       Wikileaks is a symptom, not the cause. The cause is their method of deliverance: the Internet and social media. It's the free information available globally online in an instant. It's human beings merging their lives and their selves with technology in new ways.

       I agree, I think they both worked as a catalyst and also as a confirmation for people that things are very very wrong. Simultaneously you had the US elections, where the media all touted Hillary as winner until the very last minute. Which must've woken a lot of people up too. 
Now, we have enough info to keep digging and find new leads literally everyday. We, the people, have taken the fight to the forefront and the perpetrators are visibly flailing. Which adds even more fuel to the fire. A lot of us have no doubt in our minds that it's all connected, and all real.

       Exactly. I myself am fairly new to the conspiracy community. But once I found out the truth about one thing (in my case sandy hook) I started to question everything.

       No I have always had a feeling that I was being lied to. Or that something was "off". I would just write it off as me being paranoid, so it has been hugely validating to find this community. The only people I knew before that were conspiracy theorist were people on the fringe of society. Now it seems more and more popular.

       TPTB have had this tech since the 50's, don't be duped on this.  When it comes to free energy and our pursuit of free energy, the goal now for tptb is to slowly release this tech to the public in a profitable way.  If the American public were to find out we could be living in an entirely different reality for the last half century there would be a revolt.  That's why Musk is being pushed to the forefront.  He is going to help the government roll out this tech under the guise of "brand new, so much wow" and ensure we all pay for it....The slow, profitable transition from coal and oil...You think they are just going to give us this tech?  Hell no, they want to control the tech, and this is what you are witnessing unfold right now

       But if they have that kind of control you would think they could control who is president or not. Also, Alex Jones has said Trump is going to release all these kinds of secrets. I thought maybe something like the tech above could be tied to Trump.. or maybe Trump would release something even better.

       it's corporations that would destroy this, the free market doesn't exist, there is mass collusion and suppression of new ideas/companies.

       Even if you managed to invent a way to turn grass into diamonds with nothing more than stuff you can buy at WalMart, you would be mocked, harassed, probably fired, and even then, corporations have so much power they can just change the ingredients you used from them or eliminate them all together so you're stuck with just an idea, that they mainstream is painting you a lunatic and thief for.

       So, um, that model he's showing in the news segment is made out of copper and PVC pipe and, I think, other plumbing parts?
      </p>
      <p>
       And setting aside all the "new science" that's he's claiming, the way this thing is supposed to make power is through "photo-voltaic cells"? Seriously? There are going to be mini-solar panels
       <em>
        right next to

       the the little ball of light that's burning at, I assume, a temperature similar to that of the sun.

       And he's going to bother with photovoltaic conversion when such an amazing captive heat source could be used to power a steam turbine or something similar.

       The energy is converted from ultraviolet light into black body radiation    that the photovoltaic cells are designed convert to electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       To use the heat alone wouldn't be good for this system because when you are producing power using conventional methods you need a lot of heat density. This effect he is using doesn't work like that.. it's electromagnetic in nature. Like light... but not in the visible spectrum until it is converted.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it was tricky to produce a system efficient enough to produce power on a commercial scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solar panels used here are collector type.. they are much more dense than conventional solar panels to match with the high density light produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't at the power of the sun.. but it is at many many times the amount of light that hits the earth. But heat will be an issue which is why they need to design the solar panels so they stay cool enough not to be damaged.

       So I'm purposefully not debating the physics behind it because if it is something new there wouldn't be a frame of reference to confirm or deny the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But using the internal logic of the system, if UV light is converted to
       <em>
        black body
       </em>
       radiation...black body radiation means that no (or very little) visible light is being produced. But photovoltaic cells typically operate in the visible spectrum. Why not just have the photovoltaics run off the UV then?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if there were a blackbody conversion...that's basically radiated heat which will contain a certain amount of energy. You can't get more energy out of it than whatever is radiating out. So how hot is this thing then? How much energy is coming out of it? If the "heat density" isn't that intense, then is it like a lightbulb? A tea kettle? That's not something you can run a house off of.

       The reason they use the black body radiator is because they want to convert the UV radiation and the heat to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black body radiator is tungsten I believe.. same as a halogen lightbulb.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are using a power source to produce electricity with water you need a tremendous amount of heat density. I don't know the numbers or anything but this is the explanation Dr. mills gave - the inventor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the suncell produces like 1000 times the amount of light we receive per cubic measure of land on Earth. The heat density is high - 3,700 Kelvin - for the black body radiator -  it just isn't high in terms of what you need to produce power with steam turbines.

       Hey I really appreciate your earnestness in explaining his system and the theory behind it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you know though, some of these physics terms aren't being used properly...for example received light shouldn't be measured per cubic meter. It should be by squared meter. Light doesn't fall onto volumes. It falls onto areas. This might just be a miscommunication though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll watch those videos so I can see what he says himself. It's an interesting claim he's making, and I'm not ruling it out...yet.

       Yeah.. I am not the best person to explain it... I am someone who has studied science and tech on my own for my entire life but I have a lot of holes in my knowledge. I was thinking of meter squared - surface area but just misspoke...
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep in mind... this tech Mills is releasing seems to be very similar to some other tech that I have been studying for a long time - suppressed tech. People are not aware of this connection. This other tech also converted water into energy.. the elements used in the design are identical... I feel that this Brilliant Light Suncell is a commercial version of this secret black technology. I had been writing a book to try to reveal this info to people and the history of it but things are blowing up now so much i may not have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is other info i have discovered as well that hasn't come out... have you heard of the Antarctica revelations that are supposed to happen? It's related to that in a way.

       I don't know for certain that there are major discoveries that will be revealed in Antarctica but Corey Goode and Wilcox claim this info will be coming soon. I don't know that they are legit though. But they have claimed this is why elites have been seen going to Antarctica recently - because there is an orchestrated disclosure of info they have had for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know there was a highly advanced culture somewhere on Earth that was responsible for engineering the Giza pyramids.. which no one knows there real purpose. I don't know if I should give that info out here though because it's one of the last remaining pieces that hasn't come out recently and I need something big to leave in my book igf I go through the trouble of finishing it. You can start going down the path I did though if you are interested...

       I think our government (or tptb, whatever suits your fancy) had a lot of us in a compliant state.  Like we knew we were getting fucked because of the economy and the lack of any real progress for the middle class but we couldn't or wouldn't look behind the curtain.  Then all the leaks started coming up and people were like "holy fuck, if this is true, 9/11 can certainly be true"....We are no longer compliant.  We no longer trust NYT or CNN or Fox or whatever it is you want to turn on.  Instead, we are turning off our tv and asking a fuck ton of questions.  And no one is giving us answers!  Instead our questions are met with resistance.  We notice the propaganda a lot more because, again, instead of answers we get more propaganda.  It's an onslaught from tptb and you have to be dead asleep at this point to not notice our reality is being manipulated by those in power.

       I think the Internet has reached a sort of "peak". Gaming consoles are reaching a peak, and as the years go by, more and more people are able to access information on the Internet with speed, ease, and comfort on whatever device they may have. There is absolutely no need for the msm anymore, and people are finally waking up to how propagandized it is thanks to this election.

       Hacker culture is emerging as a powerful force. It's meme power. Kek. 4chan. What used to be anonymous. Wikileaks. Kim dot com. It's what got Donald trump elected. It was r/t_d. We are seeing a partial decentralization of power simply through a growing Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internet is growing at a faster rate every day with more information being added. Now, all you have to do is
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to
       <em>
        seek
       </em>
       knowledge to get it. And it can be enlightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war on drugs had been all but neutralized with the dark web. Anyone can buy psychedelics online and have it shipped to their doorstep for resale or personal use, decentralizing the drug market. Psychedelics open people's minds, and if it weren't publicly taboo, we could learn a lot from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin nearly tripled its value this year, and it's only going up as economies continue to fail in around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing a massive change, and this is only the beginning. There is a lot we don't know, and this chaos is the result of a struggle for power. We are seeing a heavy crackdown of censorship and shilling across the Internet. They're scared. They're resorting to accusing milo of being a pedo to distract us from the real stuff. It's so recognizable, it's almost sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your head up. Use the chaos as an opportunity to ask questions and encourage others to do the same. Don't let negativity hold you back.

       I do agree with you, and this sort of sceptic/truth movement is certainly growing while little red pills like the deep state, pedo rings, skepticism of government powers hiring the mainstream.

       It's an undeniable global shift. The elites really didn't want to do it themselves because it's a ton of work to enlighten humanity and free humanity from a scarcity based economy and society. They know it's easier to just keep doing whatever the fuck they want at the expense of everyone else so they don't have to worry about us.

       Trump is an aspirational guy and I think he might be the savior for us. He's the catalyst for a people's movement. He's the oxygen, we and our information are the fuel, and now we just need a big enough spark to take it all down and the fire will spread. I think it'll be vault 7, but I don't want to get my hopes up.

       Thank you for this. You are absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something has ignited my motivation to express the truths of society to my friends in the past 2 months than ever before. At times they become annoyed of me, but together, we have become self-aware and continue to grow our cosmic consciousness. The outcome is not fearful of the change around us, I think it's a result of love. At the end of the day, I love you that's why I'm trying to help and share this information with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       "People have to seek out the knowledge themselves." - This is the most important issue in todays society. This encompasses fake news, government, education and much more. However, what I have found out is that some people are not easily open to and inept to change. I can tell my friends, whom I've known for over 13 years, that we all have the ability to telepathically communicate with aliens and on a clear day you can enter a state of meditation and ask for them to appear with their ships in the sky. I can show them my own personal videos of these crafts appearing and I even can show them scientific articles of the power of meditation and proof of Roswell. But still, they deny these uncomfortable facts and avoid a moment of change for a moment of inaction and blissfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all should be skeptical yet optimistic on our journey. I do believe thought creates reality and knowledge is power. I also believe that society, in a way, mimics nature. Your theory on Trump is 100% correct. However, I see it as a forrest fire. Not in a sense of a disaster, but a sense of change and regrowth. We need a vicious, and sometimes frightening glowing blaze to scorch the system to allow new plants to grow. Others jobs are to be that of a farmer, those who lay a foundation for those who to come.

       This movement is apart of our evolution. We have evolved biologically, now it's time to spiritually evolve. This has always been in the works and is now verified with the correlation of earths magnetic field.

       He could certainly be the (or at least, a) catalyst for the cultural shift we do desperately need. It'll just have to burn hot enough to melt steal beams (hah) to bring the system down.

       I'm not trying to sound more pessimistic than I am, and an certainly not sure, but who has the faster pace, I wonder.

       I don't think it's necessarily about pace, per se. The establishment has maintained their position for decades, and, like I said, the Internet is what's driving the resistance. Their old technique was to create an apathetic sort of "awareness" in the people. They would flaunt their devious acts in front of our faces, and we had to sit back and watch. Now, we have a way of instantly compiling and analyzing information on a global scale, allowing more of us to see the truth, and giving us a platform to organize on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say the establishment has been sitting pretty, they've been consolidating wealth and power for decades. Personally, I think that their plan was to globalize the world as quickly as possible (NAFTA, TPP, etc.), destabilize the Middle East to steal the oil and scatter Muslims around the world, and eventually use Islam to completely neutralize the free will of the population. I think that's why Sweeden censors immigration news so heavily, along with the rest of the EU. But, I don't know. Thank god for Trump because if we had Hillary, we'd all be doomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of factors at play, and the only way I think I might have a pretty good understanding of it all is because I've been glued to Reddit, especially r/conspiracy, every single day for roughly a year, and a lot has come out, and I've been studying up on the history of all of this. Getting information from unrelated perspectives and seeing correlations is how I build what I think is the big picture in my head. It's a ton of info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand, man, it's good to be realistic and not get caught up in the buzz of "oh my god it's happening," but it's important to recognize the shift and the forces driving it.

       I've enjoyed this conversation, definitely the highlight of my dazed sick day. Control through the chaos of orchestrated events, exactly what I'm most wary of. If it'd been hillary I would have been reconscripted to work on heli's for the man, and I'm too warm blooded for eastern Europe.

       Also it's a little bit semantic, but stealing oil isn't quite accurate. Promoting instability keeps the price low. Afghan is the exception because it went too far and China can't get rare earth metals out of the mountains, so they called up American debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being surrounded by aware people is very important, but it can give you a false sense of what the larger population is right, somehow it was a close election. Shout truth from the mountaintop, it's our only chance to get other people introduced. What a time when memes are a great tool!

       I don't think the chaos is the result of controlled events though. I think it's more the result of the struggle for power going on right now. I've enjoyed this too, id love to get more in depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the purpose of destabilizing the Middle East was to keep prices low. Have you seen George Webb's series? He outlines the Clinton cabal and the stages of nation conquest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm nowhere near aware people, I use the Internet and mostly Reddit to get my ideas across. That's probably because most of the people on Reddit are
       <em>
        seeking
       </em>
       other points of views and information. The people I come into contact with in the real world would prefer to stay in their box, and once the shift happens, their box will just change without any effort of their own. Effort is what's preventing people from spreading truth.

       I'm more talked about controlled outcome of the chaos; the chaos itself isn't deliberate (usually).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I haven't, I'll look it up a little later. Making my way through a few 5+ hour deals right now, I like the variety and don't mind adding another to the mix. I've seen some interestingly unmarked airplanes in my desert, none quite big enough to efficiently transport oil.

       That's a very interesting idea of the box changing around them, it only takes 10% to start a major cultural shift. I can't remember what essay that was from, I sourced it in my Satanic Principles and Moral Relativism in Culture paper.

       I guess I was referring to "steal" as in controlling the market by controlling the supply. That was the whole reason why they fucked up Syria so bad especially in specific areas, so they could further monopolize the market by building a pipeline from quatar/Saudi Arabia thru Syria and turkey to the EU, ridding the EU from their dependence on Russia for oil, effectively crushing the Russian economy. And Russia knew that, so they fought behind the Syrian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       10% huh. I'd say we're maybe at 4-5% right now, but one catalyst could spike it. I hope vault 7 is the catalyst. I hope the media dies and the public rises up in opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah I see what you mean about the controlled outcome of chaos. But I think that's why we must be aware as much as possible and continue questioning everything and demanding answers as they come out. Disclosure is happening, and it's up to us to demand
       <em>
        full
       </em>
       disclosure. In the end, we can control the result of the chaos with the Internet. The media just needs to die, and for that to happen, pizzagate needs to get blown wide open.

       Considering wikileaks said that they've only released less than 1% of vault 7, I think it may come close to my expectations. But this will take time. Our goal right now should be taking down the CIA and revealing the corruption that has revolved around it for decades. We started a new sub dedicated to this movement. r/OccupyLangley.

       That and I think TPTB got complacent. If you don't subscribe to the theory that Trump is secretly establishment the election was a perfect show of this. They thought they had it in the bag with Hillary from the start but completely underestimated the power of WikiLeaks, 4chan and conspiracy theorists.

       Wow. Never thought about it that way but... I ended up voting for trump because of the wikileaks. Although I had been a life
Long dem, Obama's term and my distaste for Hillary, combined with the alt media I had been consuming since 2012 in earnest, led me to either a third party or abstain vote. Honestly, the pizza gate revelation got me to vote trump just to keep the previous ptb out of power. If enough people were like me and TD isn't controlled opp, it really was that "conspiracy theorists" changed the election. Fucking crazy

       Same here. I was full on left wing just this summer and fully into Bernie. After he lost the primary I reluctantly supported Hillary because "at least she wasn't Trump". Then the story about
       <a href="/u/stonetear">
        /u/stonetear
       </a>
       broke and I watched it get repeatedly deleted and censored all over Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was sort of a turning point. I looked at both sides objectively for the first time and realised I had come to despise the side I thought I supported. After reading r/the_donald a little and looking into the WikiLeaks I completely flipped my political leaning. What really solidified it for me was Hillary's no fly zone in Russia, that genuinely frightened me and made me realise the modern left is simply putting a friendly face on warmongering.

       Huh! Honestly not even worth engaging on, especially in Shillsville ( r/politics). Thanks, it seemed that whatever they were discussing felt contrived and fraudulent. According to this 4chan that's exactly what that was. Fortunately I never followed that milo guy. I think I saw one of his college speeches, or part of it - he seemed a little
Character-y and inflammatory for my tastes. Looks like that hasn't changed at least.

       This!  I never used reddit before wikileaks came out w/ DNC and Podesta emails. It was the one source where I could find an open, hones, uncensored debate about the issues and facts. I think this past year has changed the way people understand reality and discount the MSM forever!

       Big thank you to all redditors and investigators on other places like 4chan etc. Amazing.

       I like the idea that 2012 wasn't the end of days, but a countdown til the end of a rational timeline.  From here it will only get more irrational until this new countdown ends, at which point rationality will return.  I have nothing that can back any word of that up but its fun to think about.

       If you're interested in a more spiritual answer I'd suggest diving into hinduism, buddhism and the more recent knowledge eminating from past civilizations that seems to have left a message for us.

       Here's an interesting read on the Hindu belief of the Yugas (ages)-

       This one really show that the history we're being thaught is wrong. There is also another video wherein they show that there are lots of mathematical constants (such as Pi) built into the architecture of the pyramids -

      <p>
       First sentence. Also, at the end of a  Kali Yuga everything becomes its opposite. Look around. The truth is openly mocked as lies. Lies are being touted as truth. Spirituality is corrupted by material desires. Material possessions, we're told, will save us. Gender is blurring. Man is becoming feminine and Women are becoming masculine. Technology is used to imprison us instead of release us. The evidence is everywhere.

       That's very interesting
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any consensus for when the "end" of this cycle started? Or is it more of a slow build up to the end that could have started decades or centuries ago? (Apologies if this information is in the link posted above! I can't check it out until a bit later.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much of anything about these cycles (yet), but it seems like as good a reason as any (if it's true) why fairly recently my family and I, along with many people on reddit, have felt like we somehow entered some kind of backwards alternate reality or merged with a weird parallel dimension. Nothing seems quite "right".
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is a strange sensation and a bit unsettling. Not a day in the past 5-6 months has passed without me thinking "What the fuck is going on??" and worrying that at the very
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       , tens of millions of people (maybe including me, who knows), have either gone absolutely insane all at the same time, or they're all being mind controlled by someone or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure things started getting stranger than normal earlier than that, but for me and the people I know, it only started to seem very "in your face" recently.

       The article outlines that the current age we're in will end in 2025. But that each age is followed by a 300 year transitional period.
During this period, the Earth seems to go through some sort of cataclysmic event(s). Once at the end of the 300 year period, the next age will start.

       Read the article above that's at Graham Hancocks website. It's mostly about ancient calendars and the periods of transition between the ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're feeling what most are feeling. We're detaching ourselves from the parasitic class we've lived with forever. We're all sick of so called leaders and their lies, selfishness and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't put much emphasis on these cycles as a mathematical calendrical fact. Ancient calendars are too different from each other to create a consensus. I think its more important to realize every culture thinks they're at the end of their time cycle because every culture thinks they can be better, act truer to each other with more humanity, create social institutions that better serve the needs of the people and so on. This turmoil is a good thing. It's hopeful. It shows we all think our situation can be improved and it will.

       Imagine that your government, 60 years ago, established diplomatic relations with an extra-terrestrial / (actually inter-dimensional) species.  Now to make that more believable, imagine that immediately after establishing contact with said species, your government negotiates a deal which is so lopsided and unfair to humans that we would have been better off never running across these ETIs/EDIs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that there are other species out there, and when they find out what your government did they lose their shit.  The initial treaty is held up by the douchecanoe ETI's and the whole thing has to go before some alien beuracratic mess that takes 50 years to resolve (in favor of the humans and positive ETIs/EDIs and against the deep state and negative ETIs/EDIs who made the original deal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, since the negative EDIs and your government have been waging a 65 year war on the populations perception of reality, and the negative ETIs and EDIs have easily found themselves in control of your government, what is the fastest way for these positive ETIs/EDIs, working together with a few in-the-know and friendly humans, to uncuck the entire fucking planet in time for whatever it is that hits our planet in 2022?

       <li>
        The revelation of ancient civilizations on Earth with technology way beyond what the human population currently believes possible
       </li>
       <li>
        The total corruption of the economy, major religions, government, media, and even science (yeah, we knew Einstein was wrong 50 years ago and buried it)
       </li>
       <li>
        The inversion of social order and discovery of 80+ new genders
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is really happening.  The only "rational" explanation I find that does a halfway decent job of explaining 2016 and 2017 is that the "positive" ETIs/EDIs finally got their shit together and are coming to end our shitty way of life.  I assume some of us will get to live if we can get rid of all the sociopaths first.

       Don't forget, Snowden leaked the FSB (KGB) analysis that the US was essentially a proxy for Nazi ETs (who seem to have switched sides just recently praise Kek).

       The tools in question being the media and the means of conveying information across great distances. Look at the way an individual today can shoot a video in their home, edit it, upload it, and share it globally all within a day. Even just a few decades ago, this was a fantasy. It used to require a lot of expensive hardware, investment in infrastructure, specialized training, etc. They could control the message because of this. But now we all have video cameras on us at all times. We're all instantly connected to the entire world. Always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go study some history surrounding the revolutionary changes new media has brought the world. Written language, the printing press, filmmaking, television, the internet, and now social media. I wonder if we have any more revolutions in communications coming. Is there anywhere left to go?

       give a lecture at my university.  He founded

        BrainGate
       </a>
       (among other endeavors), which focuses on giving quadriplegics and others with similar disabilities the capability to use their minds to communicate through operating a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was probably in 2013 so I am a bit vague on the very specific details, but he spoke in a very compelling manner about how the next major revolution (akin to social media) would be in breaking down the language barrier; allowing people who do not speak the other's language to openly communicate.  Nonverbally.

       Yeah, I thought about it for a moment and I think this is the last milestone human beings have with regards to advancing communication. I've heard that there has been work on helping disabled people interact through technology, even with cybernetic implants, but that won't be what we go with until even non-disabled people would want to communicate in that way due to increased efficiency. Until or unless that happens, it'd be like calling a wheelchair an "advancement" in mobile conveyance.

       I actually spent several minutes wondering about that after reading your post. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be to think of a new way of communication that would be better, or more convenient than what we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, we're basically already at the same "level" of communication technology as Star Trek. Even the padds (personal access display device, equivalent to e-readers) in Star Trek are bigger and bulkier than a lot of our smartphones. Our phones even hold far more information than their padds do, and that's 22-24th century technology in that universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subspace communication in Star Trek, which allows for information to travel faster than light speed, is an interesting idea. But even if we could do it, I'm not sure how useful it'd be until we figure out interstellar travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, one thing that could be a communication advancement in the not too distant future is some sort of implant/other technology that would allow information to be shared via telepathy somehow, if it's even possible. I'm not sure how many people would accept or use it though if there was even a chance our thoughts could be heard by intel agencies/government/whoever.

We're in unknown waters here as our society moves into this new era. The free interchange of information around the globe is bringing things to the forefront that would have never happened before.

       It's the opposite. What we're going through is a gradual darkening, that parallels the beginning of the medieval dark ages. Closing borders, religious nuts taking lead positions while kicking out the scientists, wars between the Christians and Arabs - It's another one of the historic patterns that we go through since people don't want to learn from history.

       Possibly it's just a matter of people having more time on their hands?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm coming from an American perspective here, but since '08, there has been an increased number of unemployed and underemployed people with time on their hands. The unemployment figures issued by governments are completely cooked, I suspect the real figure is approaching 20-25%. So, you have a bunch of people with the time to make use of the internet to look just a little more closely at issues for themselves. Add to that the proliferation of alt-media sources, and you have a recipe for a segment of American society "awakening."
      </p>
      <p>
       I would guess there's a number of factors at play here and this could be just one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also been this decline in the formality of culture. For instance, only crazy people would go out of their houses in their pajamas in the 1950s. Nowadays, should you venture into the wonderland that is Walmart, you can see jammies walking around as well as a whole host of other fashion choices that reflect this decline of formality. Another example: in public schools last century, you would never see teachers wearing jeans, or not wearing ties... there was a level of decorum that has been pretty much abandoned recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, onto politics... there is a lack of reverence for the office of the Presidency (I think it crystallized when Bill played sax on Arsenio) that allows people to observe and question motives and actions of politicians in a way that they hadn't in the past. I think it's positive in this respect; politicians are supposed to be public servants, not royalty. Though I'll never live to see it, I look forward to a time when people are woke enough to require neither politicians nor kings.

       Very interesting points, which "point" to our system being naturally correcting (in time). Like having more time on our hands due to the lying of the real unemployment rate, allows more people to research the government. (Well, now that works due to the internet.)

       You actually made me remember something regarding public schools and dress codes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mom was born in 1960 and when I was in my early teens, I found an old class photo from when she was 8 or 9 years old. I can't remember how it even came up, but she was wearing pants in the picture, along with 1 or 2 other girls, while the rest wore dresses. She told me that that year was the 1st year that girls at her
       <em>
        public
       </em>
       school were even allowed to wear pants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see that being the case at a private school, but for some reason it blew my mind that it wasn't all that long ago when girls at a public school
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to wear dresses. Crazy.

       This has a lot to do with new sources of information based around the internet.  Leaks and independent media can now get to as many people as mainstream media can.
      </p>
      <p>
       With independent media, there are so many outlets, and competition is so great, that if people start to think you're not being honest, or you've been bought by political parties, they can easily switch sources.  All in all this makes media and information better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Trump campaign was the big event that really kicked off the next, more matured stage of the internet.

       It is a disinformation campaign. SOME of this info is real, and some is not. If there is too much info, and TPTB can steer people's attention by faking interest in certain topics. These topics are usually provided and steered by the media through "intelligence leaks". Look at what is selected as "Scandals" in the media for example. There is ANY number of topics at a given moment that could be considered a scandal when there really isn't anything to the story, meanwhile REAL stuff is being ignored and discredited through back alleys.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALWAYS be skeptical of MSM talking points, as they are almost ALWAYS diversions. This applies to ANY outlet as well as ANY political leanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to filter the bias and spin and look at objective info (stats are NOT objective for instance as they are prone to multiple layers of obfuscation, from sample selection, question engineering/ordering, all the way to weighting.) Look at the patterns of when major stories are allowed to become headlines (there is a terrorist attack like every other day in the middle east for instance, but only are made headlines to bury other stories.) When a major "scandal" is broken by the MSM, immediately look for simultaneous or ancillary stories that they may be intended to hide. Always remember the media only reports stories TO you... and never FOR you.

       There were both simpler and more destructive paths we could have taken.  The peaceful ones were too simple, and the destructive ones were too painful.  Things could have been resolved quicker, or never resolved at all.  This was the best way with just the right touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity was allowed to live as it was, but eventually, the time had to come for us to elevate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why.  That's why things will continue to progress, even if we still have to put up our fights.

       You leave out so much!  The world is about to descend into chaos.  Growth happens through trials and pain.  Anybody who thinks they are ready for the next 5 years is living a fantasy.  Only those who are willing to embrace the fear, pain and horror will make it through without shattering.  Every human is about to find out who and what they are.

       Cyclical change tends to happen this way. Often times, new movements or ideas emerge at the same time among different people that have direct knowledge of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, western civilization is coming to the last phase of its natural life span, and the Christian era is coming up on 2000 years, which seems to be the cyclical interval for major global religious change.

       I've long pondered this OP, it's been the biggest question on my mind for as long as I can remember and Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves . . . Here's Tom with the weather.

       It's normal.  An awakening can reach a point of "critical mass."  A similar phenomenon exists in the workplace where there's a concentration of people working together, and they all of a sudden go on strike.

       I get that from Antony Jay's "Management and Machiavelli."

       We live in the "Information Age" thanks to telecommunication.  Given time everyone on the planet will be aware of what's happening because of the internet. The Powers that Be will probably create a device that stops time.  Something that can reset the clocks back to zero.

       Its known in history as a pardime shift. It is a mass shifting of belifes. New ideas about what is moral become more important then ever in a fast changing world. The old system clings to life as the plant dies. We have a chance to take a path of redefining  society but thouse in power benefit to greatly from the current system to release power.

       Read up on quantum mechanics - specifically the collapse of the wave function. Reality is nothing like what it seems, and we are entering a NEW PARADIGM. 
It's a very difficult concept to explain, so I'm asking for your trust here. We have allowed the current state of events to materialize. If we persist in attempting to assign blame, instead of accepting personal responsibility for the current situation, we cannot change our path. But if we can visualize a brighter future for all, even the guilty, we may be able to manifest it into reality.

       It's not that it's been wrong - it's predictions have been amazingly accurate. It's that you and I have extreme difficulty visualizing the reality it paints. 
What quantum mechanics is actually telling us is rather simple, however. The world does not exist outside of our perception of it. In fact, the world does not exist UNTIL we perceive it. But our senses aren't objectively real either - they're subject to our beliefs. If we change our attitudes, we change our perceptions, thus changing our  reality.
"Seek and you shall find" is actually "seek and you shall manifest".

       I have seen some indications of this with the elite and how they have tried to manipulate our reality. I think there is truth to that.. or at least the elite believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that makes me wonder about the accuracy of quantum mechanics in terms of the details of the theory though is how physics has hit a wall... for example we don't understand gravity or dark matter. I think that the details could be suppressed by the elites.

       It was once easy to censor print, and those same prints are very revealing today. Books are being burned and rewritten. For so long, so much was hush hush, and easily concealed. People believed what they were told, and didn't have the skills or desire to read between the lines.

       I think the future will bring a renewed sense of self determination and populism. I think we will take great strides yet in the end be handcuffed by climate change. Which is borderline unstoppable at this point. I think the elites will let the people play till the worst is over and many die then pick up the pieces and institute their total dystopia. I think the only thing that can stop this is a total human awakening. We need as many people to tune in and drop out as possible.

       Breakneck technological progress has increased knowledge exponentially, with the interconnectivity of the Internet serving as the springboard for the greatness proliferation of information in our history.  Personally, I suspect that this newfound awareness is not entirely due to the increase in information but also centered upon the conglomeration of worldwide events unfolding all around us that appears to be accelerating towards a climax.  Many of these calamitous events have rightfully created a palpable sense of dread about the future because their negative consequences are overwhelmingly detrimental to the welfare of our collective species e.g. nuclear warfare, global deadly pandemic, supervolcano eruption, severe climate disruption, etc.

       I don't know if what I'm about to say is related to the above, but in my years of research, I have become transfixed on the year 1948.  I had a Youtube link messaged to me a couple of years ago that had Neil deGrasse Tyson and Sylvester James Gates Jr. in it, and Mr. Gates Jr. informed the world that in his work with string theory he discovered computer code created in 1948 by Claude Shannon in the fabric of cosmos.  It is evidence of intelligent design and it coincides with Israel becoming a nation state and the Arab-Israeli war.

       Age of Aquarius, a person is pouring water into the river.  Keep no secrets.  Everyone is pouring their secrets into the river and the river will shift its course.

       It seemed to me that a lot more people began seeing more than what was at face value a few years ago. Thinking deeper, seeing more connections in the world, and not trusting every bit of information they receive as soon as they receive it.
I reckon the prevalence of the internet is helping humanity become more connected consciousness-wise as we're all being affected emotionally by triumphs and tragedies. We aren't getting news of natural disasters and terrorist events through cold, back and white, delayed mediums anymore. We don't rely entirely on middle-men to relay news and censored images to us. When a bomb goes off in a crowded area, the whole world can see the raw images of the horror and gore pretty much as soon as it happens, social media has made us experience things from the other side of the planet in real time, and we feel so much more for the people affected. The whole world watches as things happen, not just the people that happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. That unified emotional reaction to events, be it sadness, anger, joy or confusion, has made us more connected on a deeper level than we've been before.

       The internet is making it possible for individuals to communicate ideas and the truth more efficiently than the elites can suppress them. Since the ability for elites to spread convincing disinformation is diminishing at exponential rates it feels like its happening fast... because it is.

       This is The Age of Aquarius -- everything will be revealed.  The Age of Pisces (the last ~2500 yrs) was all about hierarchy, establishment and religion which is being dismantled right in front of our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Age of Aquarius is all about Technology and empowerment to people which was clearly exposed in the US elections --  2 dynasties were blown apart and Technology helped big league!

       Dunno about 'foretell' but look up characteristics of Aquarius and you'll know what I am talking about.  TPTB are up in arms about Trump.  Believe me.  They've no idea how he got where he got!
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       exactly what Aquarius does!  No need to scratch our heads.  It is what it is.

       BTW, I did see your pyramid doc.  They talk about Astrology all along!

       Here's my theory:  humans take 2 steps forward and 1 step back where we have to start all over again with memories stored in our collective subconscious from the past.  For example, the planes, choppers etc in Egypt heirolography (sp?) have already been shown on cave walls but then we get full ourselves and blow each other apart to start all over again.

       It sounds abstract, but an age of light/love is approaching. And as it approaches, it shines light on all things we humans would consider 'dark or twisted or unfair'. All things that have perpetuated their existence on greed or inequality are being exposed. The light, which is really just 'positive energy', is shining from the outside in and from the inside out. The great awakening is inevitable. And those of us who are still alive are about to witness the most magical, ineffable event this universe has ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly, during an event horizon, we tend to see more bad happening than good. But once the horizon completes itself, we will recognize that the hard work we've been doing to expose truth has been for a much deeper, much real'er purpose.
