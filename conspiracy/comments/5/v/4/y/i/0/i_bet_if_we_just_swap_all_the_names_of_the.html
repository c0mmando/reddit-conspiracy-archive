    <div class="md"><p>That strikes me as backwards. There certainly was a big smokescreen deployed that is working wonderfully to this day, but it&#39;s the Russian hacking story. No evidence presented, no motive proclaimed, but oh so heavily pushed by the worst kinds of people in politics and the news. Everything about this story smells terribly like a smokescreen to me.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the Russian spy agencies are any more deserving of our trust or respect than any of those &quot;allied&quot; to the States, or that there isn&#39;t plenty of disinformation going on within pizzagate circles, just that one theory clearly has substance while the other is being pushed to keep the former claims suppressed.</p>

<p>To my mind, Pizzagate is the trunk of this whole rotten tree and needs to be hacked into so long until the whole thing collapses under its own weight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not inconceivable that the whole Comet Ping Pong / Alefantis story is a scapegoat. I can see some sense in that, and should we only take that part down, we really accomplished nothing at all. The Dyncorp cartel, the remnants of the Clinton Foundation and what may come to replace it, these are the things that keep the system of abuse and blackmail going, and that&#39;s what urgently needs to be eliminated if we want to move forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, OP, but <strong>no credible investigator</strong> would investigate Pizzagate based on the &quot;evidence&quot; PG proponents have, regardless of who the witch-hunt singles out.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti"><em>Corpus delicti</em>,</a> or &quot;body of the crime&quot;, refers to the legal concept stating that before charging a person with a crime, there has to be evidence that a crime has actually been committed.</p>

<p>The most literal meaning of the word would involve finding an actual &quot;body&quot; with evidence of foul play <strong><em>before</em></strong> we can charge someone with murder.</p>

<p>Of course a &quot;body&quot;, <em>per se</em>, is not necessary. However, evidence of some kind of crime has to actually exist:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We don&#39;t charge someone with larceny if we don&#39;t have evidence that property was stolen.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t charge someone with arson if we don&#39;t have evidence that a fire was intentionally set.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t charge someone with murder if we don&#39;t have evidence  that a person was murdered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Haigh">(an actual &quot;body&quot; is not necessary).</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Once evidence of a crime has surfaced, we still don&#39;t charge someone with the crime unless we have evidence tying them to that crime.</em></p>

<p>Pizzagate <del>investigators</del> proponents have demonstrated that they are willing to lie, misrepresent evidence, or sometimes fabricate stories from whole cloth (e.g. the PG &quot;code words&quot;) in order to push their narrative. As it stands, they are advocating for gross violations of our Constitutional rights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First Amendment - They want people to be &quot;investigated&quot; for owning &quot;weird&quot; art</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth Amendment - They want people&#39;s homes/businesses &quot;investigated&quot; and searched before establishing evidence of a crime (i.e. <em>corpus delicti</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Sixth Amendment - They want people to be &quot;investigated&quot; when accused by completely anonymous strangers who are not victims, witnesses, <em>or</em> under penalty of perjury</p></li>
</ol>

<p>PG proponents have nothing but accusations and imagined innuendo. If the government starts &quot;investigating&quot; people based on the &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; (I use that term <em>very</em> loosely) that PG proponents have, we have much bigger problems than imaginary Satan-worshiping pedophile boogeymen. PG is nothing more than a witch-hunt.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Before investigating or charging a person with a crime, first we must prove that a crime has been committed, <em>then</em> we follow the evidence in order to find a suspect/s. Pizzagate has been the exact opposite: they started with suspects and are actively looking for evidence of a predetermined crime.  They want the severity of the accusation determining whether we forgo our Constitutional rights. It&#39;s the same reasoning used to justify the Patriot Act. Only instead of yelling &quot;Terrorist!&quot;, Pizzagate proponents are yelling &quot;Child molester!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Definitely not. I&#39;ve looked at all the evidence presented to me and it doesn&#39;t add up to a child-molestation ring.</p>

<p>which is exactly what i put in my previous comment, here </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v4yi0/i_bet_if_we_just_swap_all_the_names_of_the/de6xnbk/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v4yi0/i_bet_if_we_just_swap_all_the_names_of_the/de6xnbk/</a></p>

<p>i understand the point you are trying to make, but unfortunately for you, it is not plausible to me, unless you can explain where someone got the idea that eating either pasta or cheese would improve their dominos game. </p>

<p>also, who talks like that? when you eat pasta or cheese, do you or anyone you know say that you are &quot;on&quot; pasta or cheese? </p>

<p>i have an entire folder full of documentation related to pizzagate</p>

<p>you say you &quot;looked at all the evidence presented to me&quot;, which tells me that you haven&#39;t actually gone looking for any evidence. i don&#39;t recall having any evidence presented to me. i actually had to go looking for everything that i found. but rest assured, that if you seek, you will find. </p>

<p>while each individual piece can be explained away, the preponderance of evidence points to human trafficking and child pornography. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t think you will like it when we start talking about James Alefantis and his affinity for the &quot;cum panda&quot; niche of child porn. it made me sick, i imagine it will have the same effect on you, unless you are already sick </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>The government appeals to people&#39;s emotions by creating a false narrative. They use it to attack their opponents (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>) and/or to expand invasive/dangerous policies (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy">the PATRIOT Act</a>).</p>

<p>PG proponents are doing the same thing all of the above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The focus on Clinton (and dismissiveness of any possible involvement by Trump).</p></li>
<li><p>The demands that we ignore the lack of evidence (e.g. <em>corpus delicti</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>The demands that we ignore lies from PG proponents (e.g. the made-up &quot;code words&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>The demands that the government ignore our Constitutional rights simply due to the severity of the accusations (e.g. the PATRIOT Act).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pizzagate proponents are following and/or falling for a classic political witch-hunt. It&#39;s sick.</p>
