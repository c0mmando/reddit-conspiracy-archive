       If Pgate is really as big as it may look, I presume some of his cabinet will be implicated and taken down.  I don't get the impression this is a 'one team' issue.  Seems spread across all groups.

       P-gate is a smoke screen. Low hanging fruit. If we want to kill the tree we must concentrate our efforts higher up.

       That strikes me as backwards. There certainly was a big smokescreen deployed that is working wonderfully to this day, but it's the Russian hacking story. No evidence presented, no motive proclaimed, but oh so heavily pushed by the worst kinds of people in politics and the news. Everything about this story smells terribly like a smokescreen to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not to say that the Russian spy agencies are any more deserving of our trust or respect than any of those "allied" to the States, or that there isn't plenty of disinformation going on within pizzagate circles, just that one theory clearly has substance while the other is being pushed to keep the former claims suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my mind, Pizzagate is the trunk of this whole rotten tree and needs to be hacked into so long until the whole thing collapses under its own weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not inconceivable that the whole Comet Ping Pong / Alefantis story is a scapegoat. I can see some sense in that, and should we only take that part down, we really accomplished nothing at all. The Dyncorp cartel, the remnants of the Clinton Foundation and what may come to replace it, these are the things that keep the system of abuse and blackmail going, and that's what urgently needs to be eliminated if we want to move forward.

       It's true, the opposition seems to concentrate on Alefantis when trying to disprove the conspiracy theory. I guess it's harder to debate the fact that pedophilia is rampant in our government agencies whether or not you believe in the pizza shop human trafficking element.

       Nobody claimed it was. Visit them on adblock, I don't care. But you are arguing with common sense and screenshots. The 4chan post never held water anyways. The 4chan post is one of those things were you had to bend over backwards to believe it and then it didn't stand up to the slightest scrutiny.

       Well as it turns out, some of his cabinet has their hand in pizzagate one way or another. Even Trump himself had ties with Epstien and even went of one of Jeff's famous plane rides according to the flight logs. If it really cracks open most of our government and hollywood would be behind bars.

       Sorry, OP, but
       <strong>
        no credible investigator
       </strong>
       would investigate Pizzagate based on the "evidence" PG proponents have, regardless of who the witch-hunt singles out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti">
        <em>
         Corpus delicti
        </em>
        ,
       </a>
       or "body of the crime", refers to the legal concept stating that before charging a person with a crime, there has to be evidence that a crime has actually been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most literal meaning of the word would involve finding an actual "body" with evidence of foul play
       <strong>
        <em>
         before
        </em>
       </strong>
       we can charge someone with murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course a "body",
       <em>
        per se
       </em>
       , is not necessary. However, evidence of some kind of crime has to actually exist:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We don't charge someone with larceny if we don't have evidence that property was stolen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We don't charge someone with arson if we don't have evidence that a fire was intentionally set.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We don't charge someone with murder if we don't have evidence  that a person was murdered
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Haigh">
          (an actual "body" is not necessary).
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <em>
        Once evidence of a crime has surfaced, we still don't charge someone with the crime unless we have evidence tying them to that crime.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate
       <del>
        investigators
       </del>
       proponents have demonstrated that they are willing to lie, misrepresent evidence, or sometimes fabricate stories from whole cloth (e.g. the PG "code words") in order to push their narrative. As it stands, they are advocating for gross violations of our Constitutional rights:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         First Amendment - They want people to be "investigated" for owning "weird" art
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fourth Amendment - They want people's homes/businesses "investigated" and searched before establishing evidence of a crime (i.e.
         <em>
          corpus delicti
         </em>
         )
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sixth Amendment - They want people to be "investigated" when accused by completely anonymous strangers who are not victims, witnesses,
         <em>
          or
         </em>
         under penalty of perjury
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       PG proponents have nothing but accusations and imagined innuendo. If the government starts "investigating" people based on the "circumstantial evidence" (I use that term
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       loosely) that PG proponents have, we have much bigger problems than imaginary Satan-worshiping pedophile boogeymen. PG is nothing more than a witch-hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Before investigating or charging a person with a crime, first we must prove that a crime has been committed,
        <em>
         then
        </em>
        we follow the evidence in order to find a suspect/s. Pizzagate has been the exact opposite: they started with suspects and are actively looking for evidence of a predetermined crime.  They want the severity of the accusation determining whether we forgo our Constitutional rights. It's the same reasoning used to justify the Patriot Act. Only instead of yelling "Terrorist!", Pizzagate proponents are yelling "Child molester!"

       i think you are operating under the assumption that there is no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       if that is true, i recommend you ask yourself what was in the Podesta emails that was so scandalous that it started the PizzaGate scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you don't know the answer to that, or if you try to dismiss what is in the emails, then thats your call, but please don't expect everyone else to follow your lead and ignore the evidence or accept any explanation of the content of the emails

       would you like to offer up an explanation for what dominos cheese and pasta mean in the context of the Podesta emails?

       Definitely not. I've looked at all the evidence presented to me and it doesn't add up to a child-molestation ring.

      <p>
       I think you're operating under the assumption that Podest &amp; Co. are child molesters. I suggest you look at the evidence objectively.

       This is extremely easy to explain. It's like saying, "Do you think I'd perform better on whey protein?"

       another email sent a few months before referencing their games.

       Also, you say things like "dominos cheese and pasta" when that phrase is clearly never said in the emails. Let's keep the quotes accurate here.

       i understand the point you are trying to make, but unfortunately for you, it is not plausible to me, unless you can explain where someone got the idea that eating either pasta or cheese would improve their dominos game.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, who talks like that? when you eat pasta or cheese, do you or anyone you know say that you are "on" pasta or cheese?
      </p>
      <p>
       i have an entire folder full of documentation related to pizzagate
      </p>
      <p>
       you say you "looked at all the evidence presented to me", which tells me that you haven't actually gone looking for any evidence. i don't recall having any evidence presented to me. i actually had to go looking for everything that i found. but rest assured, that if you seek, you will find.
      </p>
      <p>
       while each individual piece can be explained away, the preponderance of evidence points to human trafficking and child pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think you will like it when we start talking about James Alefantis and his affinity for the "cum panda" niche of child porn. it made me sick, i imagine it will have the same effect on you, unless you are already sick

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government appeals to people's emotions by creating a false narrative. They use it to attack their opponents (e.g.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">
        McCarthyism
       </a>
       ) and/or to expand invasive/dangerous policies (e.g.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy">
        the PATRIOT Act
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       PG proponents are doing the same thing all of the above:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The focus on Clinton (and dismissiveness of any possible involvement by Trump).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demands that we ignore the lack of evidence (e.g.
         <em>
          corpus delicti
         </em>
         ).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demands that we ignore lies from PG proponents (e.g. the made-up "code words").
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demands that the government ignore our Constitutional rights simply due to the severity of the accusations (e.g. the PATRIOT Act).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Pizzagate proponents are following and/or falling for a classic political witch-hunt. It's sick.

       It would not be investigated because A.) there is not enough to launch a formal investigation with and B.) Both sides have been protecting pedos since the dawn of time.

       One thing we know for a fact though is Pizzagate would never have been on this sub to this degree if it was the trump admin. People here would be calling it a crazy conspiracy theory with no basis in reality.

       Are you kidding? This conspiracy theory plays into some of the most interesting topics discussed here. Satanic cults, MK Ultra, sex slaves, drug/human/gun trafficking, and shadow governments are just a few of the leading topics PG incorporates. I was honestly highly skeptical at first because my worst fears and beliefs were being validated all in one conspiracy.

       If pizzagators stopped implicating anyone who was anti trump and defending pro trump people it would get a lot more traction. People are sick of it because it came out as just another way to attack Hillary and her group.

       Yes pedos should be stopped, but fuck pizzagate its an obvious political attack just to demean your opponents and its a pretty disgusting tactic. I mean there's other pedos out there like the Hells Angels who are into human trafficking but there's no outcry vs them its just all on democrats which is weird.

       If it's true I would hope Trump would be involved, and supportive of finding and prosecuting every pedo who has engaged in child trafficking. Regardless of political affiliation, obviously.

      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists generally adhere, eventually, to the premise that at this point in time both parties are bought and paid for by a shadow government. We are hoping that to some extent we are wrong about that in regards to Trump. We are not blind Trump-fanboys and I'm sick of every other comment indicating otherwise.

       Yup. Motorcycle enthusiasts pimp children and you never hear a word about it on here. Other big group are African American pimps, watch the doc "American Pimp". If all the posters here cared about children they would be posting about real child trafficking, this pizzagate is a political smear job.

       I 100% disagree. I'm by no means a pizzagate believer, and am very anti-Trump. But no evidence is no evidence. Trump was accused of molestation already, it was never turned into a huge deal because of a lack of evidence, and that got squashed when the alleged victim retracted.

       If you're talking about the dossier, I never said I've been sold on that. It is a reliable source, apparently, but we have nothing corroborating.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean the hacking, yeah we actually have evidence of that. You can argue about how definitive it is, but it is literally many multitudes higher than the evidence for pizzagate. Like, there's an actual, discernible crime. We just had to search for the perpetrator(s).

       Hmmm... Actually that is a pretty good idea! Even if some are implicated unknowingly. It seems to me that TPTB saw the danger in conspiracy theories (or really just the truth behind the wikileaks emails) that they turned the tables and are now playing the conspiracy game. Why not push a narrative that we are after Trump and his cronies for pizzagate? It would unite both sides to a common goal, even if for different motives. When the dust settles, only the innocent should be standing and just maybe we could see a final draining of the swamp...Not holding my breath though lol.
