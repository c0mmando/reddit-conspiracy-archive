<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>So the first comment is back now, but the others are still deleted, and I&#39;m still shadow banned without any message telling me.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the archive of the first comment deleted:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/ZSmuB">https://archive.fo/ZSmuB</a> 23 Feb 2017 02:29:15 UTC</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the archive of it live:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/vmfi3">https://archive.fo/vmfi3</a> 23 Feb 2017 05:12:57 UTC</p>

<p>Still doesn&#39;t explain why it was deleted in the first place (wasn&#39;t because of spam, I didn&#39;t repost it until after the first one was deleted), or why they shadow banned me for just bringing it up, especially now that it&#39;s back in the thread.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p>Also adding a more detailed break down of why I think Ankara was a false flag hoax, from a reply to a comment in v/identitarian at the bottom.</p>

<p>~~</p>

<p>My user page with the comments:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/hTZcT">https://archive.fo/hTZcT</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223031037/https://www.reddit.com/user/sirylj/">https://web.archive.org/web/20170223031037/https://www.reddit.com/user/sirylj/</a></p>

<p>My first comment got 39 upvotes before being deleted. Each one after that was deleted immediately. Before I could make a separate post outside of the AMA, I was shadowbanned without any message.</p>

<p><strong>I made about five archives of the page while posting the comments. They&#39;ve all been deleted.</strong></p>

<p>The quick rundown of the points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The ambassador falls on the ground spread straight backward spread out like a cross, yet in the beginning he crumples and falls to his left. There is also no blood on him or around him.</p></li>
<li><p>Possible crisis actors are all cowering around a corner, still kind of in the gunman&#39;s sight, but there are about 3-4 people standing around the corner, standing straight, not moving or looking worried at all, just watching the others as if they were &quot;directors&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The shooters hand looks photoshopped in several parts. His finger looks about a third longer than it should be when he&#39;s point up, and it looks like he has 6 fingers. There&#39;s also a part where it looks like he is cupping his hand and not the gun, and that it is shopped in behind his hands.</p></li>
<li><p>The shooter is lighter skinned and has longer thin sideburns in the pictures of him alive, but in the pictures of his body, his skin is darker overall without the rest of the picture darkening, his hairline, curls and eyebrows don&#39;t seem exactly the same, and his sideburn looks shorter and fatter, more blocky and bushy, more like a square. It doesn&#39;t go down to the same part of his ear as the earlier pictures.</p></li>
<li><p>The coffin of the ambassador seems empty. There&#39;s a clear gap between the coffin and the fingers of the front two soldiers holding it up. They have their fingers curled in in a way that would hurt them and make it very difficult to hold up the coffin or keep control of it if it did have his body in it (the ambassador looked fairly large and heavy). Yet as they set the coffin down, it bobbles, showing that it looks like they are just holding an empty box.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also quite a lot of symbology throughout the video and pictures, like the ambassador spread out like he is on across, the point up and down (as above, so below), and the dead body has his leg folded in a 4 like the hangman/joker card (can&#39;t remember which).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>edit: sorry about all the edits and versions and archives I&#39;m making, but it still seems like some of the archives are dissappearing. I&#39;m currently saving all of them as .mhtml as soon as I make them. Here&#39;s a timeline from a comment I made below ITT:</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happened:</p>

<p>I made part of the post in advance to post it as soon as the Alex Jones AMA started. It got about 30 upvotes, and someone made a comment under it asking if it was CIA. I responded with the six points I posted here and in other posts (and on my user page) going over why I think the evidence points to the Ankara assassination being a false flag hoax. (I original became aware of this from someone on YouTube who made videos breaking it down. I saved them, but they were later deleted. I have the videos and pictures, but the pictures and raw video are still available online, I just have the breakdown that the person made.)</p>

<p>After I made the second comment with the six points, I added it to the first comment so it was all in one place.</p>

<p>The comment got 39 upvotes, and then someone made a comment saying it was deleted. It was still showing up for me, so I checked it in a private mode browser, and it was deleted, along with the second one. I commented about it to that person and a few others I had just responded to earlier. One of them PM&#39;d me to say it had been deleted.</p>

<p>I then reposted the comment with the beginning and the six points, prefaced with the fact that it had been deleted. I checked the comment in a private browser again right after making it, and it was already deleted.</p>

<p>I did this about 3 more times (five deleted in all, counting the original one I edited and the follow up that I added to it), each time adding at the top the number of times it had been deleted and the number of the attempt.</p>

<p>I also made a couple other comments about the deletions, with links to archives of my user page using Archive.is. These comments weren&#39;t deleted immediately.</p>

<p>After the fifth comment, and 2-3 other comments about this, I started to make a post outside of the AMA about this. But before I could post it, I got a error message that I couldn&#39;t post here. I checked, and the submit buttons were gone, and when I refreshed the submit page, it said I &quot;forbidden (reddit.com)&quot;. I messaged the mods about this right before I tried to post the comment.</p>

<p>I made a AnkaraAssassination sub to post the comment in to make sure other mods can&#39;t mess with it. I made a post in /v/identitarian on Voat because I already had a page open there. When I tried to add the archive links of my post, I realized they were DELETED.</p>

<p>I had made about FIVE archives of my user page throughout this, and they were ALL deleted. I&#39;ve archived the page since then and they are still up right now. I then made the post here, in AnkaraAssassination and BannedFromThe_Donald.</p>

<p>And here we are.</p>

<p>TL;DR comments were deleted, shadow banned, then archives were deleted somehow</p>

<p>~~</p>

<p>Comment I replied to:-</p>

<p>Buddy he could have collapsed one way, then rolled over as he died. He&#39;s fat as fuck and its a 9mm so it probably didnt go through. He could have been bleeding internally without a ton leaking out.</p>

<p>It was on film. Bodies get darker when the blood stops pumping, unless they&#39;re losing all then blood, blood turns blue/darkish as cells use up oxygen.</p>

<p>My response:-</p>

<p>Those are all valid points, but this is also about why they would delete the posts about this in the Alex Jones AMA and why they would shadow ban me for asking them.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>Yes, he is large. The way he fell, it was pretty much directly to his left, crumpling at his knees and waist. He might have fallen at a bit of an angle, but even if he did, he would have had to roll at most 90 degrees or a bit less in a counter clockwise circle to get to the final position he was in. In the picture of him, he is laying straight backwards with his arms completely straight out to both sides. This is a weird position for him to end up in given how he fell. It would be more likely that he was either crumpled or slight straightened out, and point to the left, or a bit of an angle upwards. But his final position is completely backwards in a cross position as if he fell straight back.</p>

<p>He could have bled internally, and I&#39;ll get to the possible body double of the shooter, but given how much blood was in the pictures of the shooter, it is odd that there is not one drop of visible blood around the ambassador. If he fell straight back, it should have pooled at least a tiny bit under or around him, or be visible soaking into the back of his clothes. And if he rolled a bit from his initial position to his final position, it would also be reasonable that there would be at least tiny amounts of blood between to the two positions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the possible &quot;directors&quot;, about 3-4 people who are around the corner of the wall and don&#39;t seem to be worried or panicked at all. There body language does not match what is happening. Someone has just been shot, and everyone else in the picture is trying to get to cover, kind of around the corner with some still in light of sight of the shooter. All of them are cowering down, crouched, hands up for some in a bit of a protective stance. None of them are standing straight, and they all looked worried. And then there is this anomaly of 3-4 people who are all the way pas the corner, and they are all standing completely straight, good posture, arms at their sides or seemingly holding equipment. They are looking at the people that are cowering or crouched, but they have zero reaction, not looking around at anything, standing there seemingly calm and not at all in the same state of distress that everyone else is in.</p>

<p>This picture has the ambassador and these people in the frame, from a position past the ambassador&#39;s podium and farther to the left of it, as if from the top right corner of the room if facing the podium.</p>

<p>Then there is the shooter&#39;s hands. They appear to be photoshopped in several pictures. When pointing up and down, his finger seems unnaturally long, This could obviously just be a long finger, but it seems almost a third longer than it should be. Even if his finger isn&#39;t photoshopped, it appears that his hand is in two other images (one might be the same as the pointing one). It appears that he has 6 fingers, that it is an image of a closed fist with an extra long index finger pasted onto it. When you space out the fingers on his hand, if he only has five fingers, then his pinkie or ring finger end up being twice as thick as any of the other fingers.</p>

<p>In another image with him holding the pistol, it appears that he is cupping one hand in the other, as if playing rock paper scissors, and the gun seems to be photoshopped behind the hands instead of within one hand with the other cupping it.</p>

<p>The shooter also appears different than the last picture of him shot, other than just the skin color, which does appear darker without the rest of the image darkening, but like you said, that could be blood loss (but again that makes me wonder why there wasn&#39;t a single drop of visible blood anywhere around or on the ambassador).</p>

<p>But putting the skin color/shade aside, the hairline, eyebrows and sideburns don&#39;t seem to match up exactly between the pictures of the dead shooter and when he is still alive. The hairline looks just slightly different if a few spots, as well as the flair of his eyebrows. But his sideburn is the one that changes the most. In the earlier pictures, his left sidburn curves on the inside corner over his ear without touching it, and goes down to just above the lobe of his ear. It is fairly thin and long, a bit flat, and looks more like a rectangle with the one inside curve.</p>

<p>In the picture of the dead shooter, though at a different angle, the sideburn appears to be shoter and wider, and a bit bushier. The inside curve is slightly different, and when you rotate and put the images side by side, even at different angles, you can see that the sideburn in the second imaged doesn&#39;t reach down to the same physical part of the ear as the first one. You can see this by looking at the inside lobe and structure of the ear. It&#39;s not much, but it is visible.</p>

<p>After all of this, there was a funeral ceremony. Soldiers were carrying his casket. In close up images and videos of this, you can see that the front two soldiers are holding the casket up with their fingers curled in a fist. There is a visible gap of air between their fingers and their hand, so the weight of the coffin would be entirely or mostly on their fingers and not on their palm or entire hand. If the ambassador&#39;s body was in the coffin, and as you say and I have acknowledged, he is fairly large and heavy, yet they appear to be holding up the coffin with just their fingers curled over with visible air gaps between their fingers and their hands. This wouldn&#39;t really be feasible or practical if his body were in the coffin, especially for maintaining their grip on the casket, which also seems to come into play in the next few moments, As they come forward to place the coffin on some sort of table, they seem to bobble it for a moment as they lower it. In video and repeating gifs of this moment, you can see the coffin quickly move up and down before they regain complete control over it, and it seems as if the coffin is empty, as it wouldn&#39;t move in the same with if it were weighed down by the ambassador&#39;s body. It looks like an empty box just shaking for a moment.</p>

<p>Aside from all of the above, there is also some occultish symbology throughout. This obviously doesn&#39;t add as much to the case as anything above does, but the ambassador&#39;s body is in a crucifix position, the shooter points up and down at the same time (as above, so below), and the dead body has the leg curled over in a 4, like the hangman or joker card, I can&#39;t recall which right now. Like I said, this isn&#39;t nearly as tied to center of this case as the rest of the above is.</p>

<p>And in the end, there&#39;s the question as to why this was deleted multiple times, and why I was shadow banned without receiving the normal temporary/permanent ban message, and why the question wasn&#39;t allowed to remain in the thread, unanswered or not.</p>

<p>Sorry for the length, I&#39;m just trying to get all the details in.</p>
