       I'm looking for eyewitness accounts of this supposed day where the queen accidentally revealed herself to be of reptilian decent in front of a massive crowd in London! The internet has been scrubbed of all accounts and I would LOVE to hear from anyone who was there that day, or who maybe saw, first-hand, the royal family's website press release article discussing what everyone saw (that was immediately removed, but has been screen grabbed!) I want to believe this, but struggle with the lack of evidence other than a rather fake looking screen grab of the "royal website".. Please, anyone who has any knowledge of this day, or if you were there, or know someone who was there and saw everything, or even just saw the website article with your own eyes, respond here or e-mail me; I can post it once I get some comments on here! No spam or you will be blocked and deleted! Thanks again! -AMG

       someone posted one above, but it's very hard to find any proof behind it, and google doesn't really show much other than a link to a site that isn't so reputable.. but i know i have read articles about it before, they just seemed to vanish so that's why i figured reddit would be the way to go with digging deeper into everything; this has puzzled me for a while now and i want to get some proof to see because this seems like something that legitimately happened and legitimately scared a lot of people, twitter trends are great ways to see what is occuring in the masses quickly, so the fact that something like that blew up online during her public event right there just tells you that something really did frighten those thousands of people and i want to know why nobody has come forward with proof.. is it out of loyalty and respect to the empire? do the english not care if they are led by a non-human entity? it seems very likely from the tone of that press release!

       looking more for personal accounts, like someone on here who was actually there the day it happened, i mean, it was a pretty busy day in london, and also, it's possible someone who saw something strange like that would reach out on a public forum like this for answers or possibly to meet someone else who experienced the same thing, simply because it's easier to hide on reddit compared to other social media sites; is anyone on here commenting from london? maybe you heard something from a friend? or heard something on a local news or radio station? any help on this would be appreciated!!

       True.  Building a supporting user base does give a larger number with a margin of error but we can assume that some are factual.

       it's just the royal family's website accidentally posting that press release.. it just seems too strange, something must've happened that day for it to be completely erased from history.. does anyone know what she was speaking on or doing?? it may be easier to find footage that way!

       it's definitely been completely scrubbed because even on deep web search engines, i can't find a single thing other than that article the guy posted above and youtube videos of youtubers discussing said article/website and twitter trends and screen grabs; keep upvoting this and let's get this trending so we can reach people far away!

       but if that were so, the accounts would have existed in some form before june 2016. yet there is no history of any of them. it's convenient that the article says the accounts were "instantly removed" yet the author was able to get screenshots of all the tweets?

       i know that you can find deleted tweets. accounts themselves, i'm not sure. yesterday someone was looking for a deleted podesta tweet and I found the link still on google, then open a cached version of the link, and the full tweet could be viewed

       well think about it, if i saw a crazy tweet like that, and other people were saying the same thing and it was blowing up on twitter, i would totally screenshot it; i screenshot everything! and it wouldn't be deleted instantaneously, just when you refresh the page or scroll a certain amount up or down

       a few years back; check out the link the gentleman posted above, it's just about the only thing out there on the event besides references to the trend on twitter about a lizard queen and the hashtag along with it, and people who reported seeing these tweets literally being deleted in front of their eyes as they popped up in the feed!

       yeah i read that way back! thanks for reposting though, much appreciated! looking for photos, videos, possible eyewitness accounts; personal proof of the event, proof that possibly may not have been posted online before but has just been hiding in a computer file or something lol i'm hoping to reach out to people who saw what happened that day, either in-person or on television!

       guys, i'm calling complete bullshit now on this entire story and that website and everything; they just started circling THE EXACT SAME STORY.. but just switched out the queen for caitlyn jenner!! same deal - missing twitter profiles and screenshots of "disappearing tweets" and some secret, "high-profile" source, who chose to remain anonymous, who saw these tweets disappear before his/her eyes and managed to get some screen shots before they were all gone... IT'S THE SAME FUCKING STORY!! what a sham; sorry to everyone who was seriously curious about this post because it seems as though we have been duped again by another unreliable website with random, shock journalism with zero known sources or photographic evidence!! one story of such widespread viewing of high-profile shapeshifting was difficult enough to believe already.. this just made it 10 times harder -___-

       So.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refound the video I tried to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a video of the Queen Shapeshifting, but! It is an interesting video, and after this discussion, i can understand why it's called what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just take a peek - it's definitely putting me into a bit of a hole to research this John Walson guy.

       never said i believed it, just said that twitter trends don't lie and it's not likely the thousands of people who saw the tweets and then saw them get deleted would all lie! every video has been deleted including just plain old news casts of the event! june 11th, 2016 help us research it no judgement necessary in trying to figure out something we don't understand

       explain the trending #reptilianqueen hashtag and thousands of people posting at the same time saying they saw the queen look lizard/snake-like with scales and grotesque features that made people terrified and sick; apparently to the extent where she felt it was necessary to speak with these people afterwards explaining that she still loved her "millions of subjects", but someone dropped the ball.. or maybe he/she didn't.. but regardless, someone let it get out on the royal website and i think we deserve answers about these people we are supposed to love and revear!

       loooooooooool i'm sorry guys i just love discussions about conspiracies and using the internet to try to find answers from random people; i mean, think about it.. if it's out there, it could be possible that someone that does know something about that day, or who was there and saw something strange, stumbles across this website and adds valuable information to futher said conspiracy down the rabbit hole! no need for negativity because we are all just curious people wanting to know more; just ideas floating between random people across the globe (yes, i know we live on a globe LOL and i'm about to destroy my credit on a disgustingly expensive non-computerized telescope to prove it to a BUNCH of people 🤣🤣)

       don't get me wrong, either everybody! i love the queen and i respect her 100% because i believe that even though she could possibly be a "high priestess" or what have you.. she is still part-human, and she still cares for the human race, especially children; we all saw the story about her real christmas message that she was forced to change and how supposedly that cold she got after the video was really her on house arrest because of that! btw guys i found a video of that day and i couldn't see much but there was one last shot that was extremely strange and her face did NOT look normal..

       sorry, i just love to keep up with all these crazy events/stories so they all kinda start to blend together when discussing conspiracies; the queen supposedly wanted to reveal something dark that was happening to the children of the world and how she hoped her subjects could forgive her because she had no control over it being the age she is!

       world, during her christmas day speech*
she is! but apparently, the royal family would not allow her to speak on the matter and basically said she was on house arrest until she agreed to not speak a word about the children*

       Wish there was something with slightly more resolution than potatoe. It looks like an old woman not really a reptile. There is one shot where her face does look distorted but again it is shit quality video

       it seems like the time when she really transformed is not on video but honestly from some of the images i have seen, something seems extremely fishy with her, but i do think she is a good person surrounded by a lot of bad in the royal family today

       Let me propose this. We are living in times were people's ability to achieve clairvoyance has become greater. There is a consciousness shift going on. What everyone in the crowd saw was her astral body which reveals what she is inside, a cold Ahrimanic demonic being or she is just possessed by one. The lizard theory is way to simplistic but not entirely devoid of truth. This story to me is more proof of this consciousness shift than Elizardbreath II! Think about it.

       guys, i'm calling complete bullshit now on this entire story and that website and everything; they just started circling THE EXACT SAME STORY.. but just switched out the queen for caitlyn jenner!! same deal - missing twitter profiles and screenshots of "disappearing tweets" and some secret, "high-profile" source, who chose to remain anonymous, who saw these tweets disappear before his/her eyes and managed to get some screen shots before they were all gone... IT'S THE SAME FUCKING STORY!! what a sham; sorry to everyone who was seriously curious about this post because it seems as though we have been duped again by another unreliable website with random, shock journalism with zero known sources or photographic evidence!! one story of such widespread viewing of high-profile shapeshifting was difficult enough to believe already.. this just made it 10 times harder -___-
