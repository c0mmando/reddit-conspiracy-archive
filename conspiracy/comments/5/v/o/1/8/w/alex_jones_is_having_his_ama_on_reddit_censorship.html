       "Hey Alex, Since this AMA deals with reddit censorship can you shine a light on r/GMOMyths a subreddit dedicated to brigading any thread speaking ill of Monsanto. The majority of their subreddit just redirects to threads they do not agree with, then they brigade the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over a year ago this list of Monsanto Shills was made. Many of them frequent r/GMOMyths. Many users listed still regularly post nothing but pro Monsanto/GMO fluff.

       Unbelievable that people still focus on Monsanto, they've managed to trick numerous governments around the world who tried to "ban" Monsanto through smart rebranding as well as acquisitions.  The fact that Alex Jones is still focusing on Monsanto makes it seem as though he is at worst, completely compromised, or at best, completely ignorant.

       Because his focus on a specific company without mentioning the tactics they are using to avoid boycotts and bans through subsidiaries and rebranding, without naming them, makes it seem as though he is either superficially ignorant regarding the issue, or is distracting from these new methods of manipulation.

       That's actually a very good point but it could also be about when broadcasting a message it's easier for the listener to focus on names rather than methods and concepts.  Once someone is interested in going down the Monsanto rabbit hole then they will learn about these other entities under their control.

       I actually believe that this is exactly what Monsanto is exploiting.  So many people now seem to equate Monsanto with evil seed conglomerate, they hear that they're losing lawsuits, they hear that they're being banned in Europe and they think a difference is being made.  If they were doing further investigation then they would realize that nothing has actually changed.  Monsanto's sleazy business practices have helped them to prepare for these eventualities which aren't even being brought up by "mainstream free-thinkers".  They've managed to pull the wool over people's eyes yet again and focusing on the name "Monsanto" as somebody who is supposed to be waking the sheep (whether or not you agree with him) is incredibly shallow.
