        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I have no YouTube videos or documents proving my theory. It&#39;s just a theory based on my own observations. </p>

<p>I was in the military for fifteen years. During which time, I deployed to several countries, conducting or supporting various operations for various reasons. Relating to this specifically, I spent two years in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>One of the major missions that was advertised as having been done there, was eradicating the growth of heroin poppies, and stopping the production and global distribution of Afghan heroin. I will state categorically that we didn&#39;t eradicate anything, and it isn&#39;t stopped. </p>

<p>During my time there, I worked with(but not in) the DEA, DIA, CIA, and several OGA&#39;s in the furtherance of this mission. We knew where all the poppy fields were, because the Afghans didn&#39;t hide them. Some of them were so big, you could smell the poppies a hundreds of feet in the air from a helicopter. But we never burned a single one. In fact, there were several FOB&#39;s and COP&#39;s that were directly adjacent to large poppy fields. </p>

<p>Now, the war there is largely over as far as advertised US involvement goes, the majority of troops have been pulled out, and all of a sudden, around the same time....we experience a heroin Epidemic. More people are dying now of heroin overdose than from firearms deaths, and that includes suicides. And having worked counter drug missions in Latin America, I can say they don&#39;t produce enough heroin down there to create this type of situation here on their own. </p>

<p>Now, had the CIA not imported cocaine into the US, causing the Crack Epidemic of the nineties, I might be more skeptical, and less inclined to connect the dots I&#39;ve seen. I firmly believe that agencies within the US government, but not necesarrily with the knowledge and approval of the government, are importing heroin into the United States from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I am no longer in the military, but currently work a counter drug mission on our southern border. The percentage of heroin(compared to other drugs, weed, meth, coke etc...) that we confiscate doesn&#39;t indicate,  to me at least, that the problem is coming from that direction. </p>

<p>I only want to call attention to what I suspect. Because if it&#39;s true, it is unequivocally wrong and dishonorable. I will discuss what I can, but I won&#39;t discuss classified/secret material. I have signed many a NDA, and take those very seriously. Don&#39;t even bother asking for that type of info.</p>

<p>Where did you get this info? The taliban were the ones burning fields and making it illegal to grow. Crops were at record lows before the US invaded. The US paid farmers and protected fields. leading to record yields..its common knowledge at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! It&#39;s become damn near epidemic, and many -otherwise- truly good people are struggling and dying every single day because of such things.</p>

<p>-ATTENTION: TEXT WALL and Personal Experience AHEAD!-</p>

<p>I myself am actually a recovering addict, from early 2008-2013, I struggled greatly with it and was in and out of rehabs. I had been a drug user throughout college but it sort of hit its zenith when I had done just about everything listed on the Vaults of Erowid, except H. So I had an opportunity to try it in late 2007 and then by 2008 I was into needles and was using just about every day. And I had a &quot;really good upbringing&quot; for some reason after High School though I became really into the exploration of <em>inner-space</em> and experimentation with my mind and psychoactive chemicals. </p>

<p>And so Heroin is popular because it works, it REALLY works, it&#39;s like synthetic heaven, for a while at least, and then you want more, and then your tolerance gets increased so you need even MORE to get off, and then you begin using just to feel &quot;Normal&quot;. And when an addict is in active addiction it&#39;s not that they become horrible people, what is happening is that their/my brain has become literally hijacked by the drives the  limbic system and the centers responsible for pleasure/reward and the synapses connect the concept of Heroin with Happiness and literally Survival. So that&#39;s what and why addicts turn on family members and friends and seemingly turn into &quot;Other-People&quot; that do not at all reflect the true and honest values that individual actually believes and embodies within. So then eventually through that, all of ones possessions and money is spent on that drug-of-choice (for me it was heroin), and all pursuits for getting money are merely means to get more <em>junk</em>. Sadly, I sold almost an entire (at that time in the late 2000&#39;s) Criterion Collection of dvds I had acquired over many years, and most of my really awesome Record Collection and a very nice (PRS) Guitar and (Fender blues) Amp that my mom and dad got me for my bday many years back, and yet although I regret selling those things, they are just that, &#39;<em>things</em>&#39;. And luckily for 3+ years now I have remained clean and able to lead a happy, successful and free life that previously seemed impossible to have when I was at my worst amidst my active-addiction. Thankfully due to harm-reduction programs in my city I was able to get clean needles and be what I considered to be a &quot;sanitary junkie&quot;, as much as someone can be. But it showed me the importance of needle-exchanges and other forms of harm reduction, that yes is a fine line between enabling but also altruistically allows someone to, if that&#39;s what they are doing, to do it safe and not be furthering the spread of disease and the danger therein. </p>

<p>And sure, I can understand how some people, who haven&#39;t experienced such things nor knows anyone else in their life who knows anyone who has endured such a struggle of an affliction that it should be some form of tough-love &quot;social Darwinism&quot; that weeds out the <em>&quot;scum&quot;</em> like addicts and alcoholics. Yet that&#39;s a bit of a &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot; (ie, Seeing someone else’s faults should be a cue for us to examine our own imperfect lives.) Plus, from my experience, and from what I know about myself, <em>most</em> addicts are actually really awesome people when they aren&#39;t being controlled by their drug-of-choice, usually very big-hearted, sensitive, intelligent, cool individuals. Of course, in the same breath there definitely are many who are not and do truly act with malicious apathy for the world around them. However, I and many of the people I knew were not those people. Maybe it was a heroin thing, we just kept to ourselves and did what we did. From my experience, usually Meth users become some of the most malicious and dangerous types. Perhaps it&#39;s the Upper vs Downer dichotomy.</p>

<p>Anyhow, between the detoxes and the rehabs and some hospitalizations, over 15+ (and counting) friends/people I got to know throughout the journey eventually dying and succumbing to their addictions (varying from other opiates/pharmaceuticals, alcohol -arguably the biggest slowburn of a killer-, benzos -like xanax/klonopin-, crack/coke, meth, even food etc) I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m sharing all of this I just kept writing and realized that if anything this exhibits or rather I am an example for how far and wide the reach of this is for many human beings, from all walks of life, demographics, population densities, and backgrounds. And it&#39;s been growing exponentially even since I myself have been &quot;out of the game&quot;, so I can only guess how it&#39;s continued to ravage and wreak havoc on countless others. </p>

<p>All that (and more), because shadowy phantom groups at the top of some floating capstone of a proverbial <em>pyramid</em> want to make a lot of dirty money. Many people get into heroin through Big Pharma&#39;s painkillers and then they like the feeling of it, and use beyond what they&#39;ve been prescribed, and then getting into the subculture learn that there&#39;s this thing, heroin, that is significantly less expensive, and is capable of being even MORE <em>effective</em> in voiding some perceived <em>pain</em>. It is most definitely the &quot;D&quot; in the G.O.D. of the &#39;Powers-That-Be&#39;, &quot;In G<em>old</em>/O<em>il</em>/D<em>rugs</em> THEY Trust!&quot; indeed. It&#39;s at least a $100+ Billion dollar a year industry. And probably works to create a sort of slave class, kicking the stool from under otherwise potentially bright minds that could in fact act to be combatants and activists to fight globalization. Obviously increasing the probability of automatic depopulation, specifically in poverty stricken areas. It&#39;s an unfortunate truth. And I&#39;m truly fucking grateful and thankful that I am no longer under it&#39;s spell, no longer being controlled and enslaved by the invisible prison that addiction creates. </p>

<p>(Apologies for rambling, I just felt compelled to write this for some reason, Thanks for reading.)</p>

Black bag ops need black budgets free from congressional prying eyes, arms/drugs/people trafficking is something our <em>company</em> guys learned from the Brits, with a side effect of destroying lives of the people they don&#39;t like (for the Brits it was the Chinese in the opium wars 1/2), while also creating a dependency that keeps the doughflowing. Thats Why they don&#39;t like marijuana because its not nearly as addictive or life destroying, but it will be legal as soon as they manage to patent every variation of the genome.</p>

<p>Never forget the <em>company</em> got its start on wall street as the OSS and learned what they knew from MI5/6... and that the Brits never have been true friends as far as I can tell from Carroll Quigley writings.</p>

<p>Their currency is much stronger than ours. America does their dirty work for them war wise.

Where does the IRS send our money? </p>

<p>And why is there a statue of George Washington in the middle of London? </p>

<p>But it&#39;s a vast country with large uninhabited parts. A clandestine runway wouldn&#39;t be much trouble to construct. </p>
