       Here is a little conspiracy close to home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Byron Macron's body was found yesterday by a kayaking man in Chippewa Lake
       <a href="http://fox8.com/2017/02/22/chippewa-lake-body-identified-as-bryon-macron/">
        source

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a Lafayette county trustee who has been working to stop the Nexus pipeline. Interestingly, his fellow trustees Lynda Bowers and Michael Costello wrote "...there is no evidence to support the rumor that the Nexus project is in any way connected to Bryonâ€™s disappearance." Prior to his body's discovery.
       <a href="http://fox8.com/2017/01/05/lafayette-trustees-speak-out-urge-anyone-with-info-on-missing-trustee-to-call-police/">
        source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that he went missing December 16th, 2016 and the pipeline's timeline was to submit an implementation plan and receive final agency clearances -- the timing is suspicious.
       <a href="http://nopipelies.org/resources/nexus-pipeline-information/">

      </p>
      <p>
       There was definitely foul play, as they found his office with the lights on, signs that a struggle took place, and blood. They also found blood in his SUV which they found prior to discovering the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who are not Ohio residents, Chippewa lake is fairly large and frozen over for most of the winter. Which would explain the long delay in finding the body. I'm sure there have been people at the lake daily (especially with this uncharacteristically warm weather). I wonder if any local residents noticed anything peculiar.
      </p>

       Just wanted to post and see if you internet sleuths could dredge up some more information on this!

       He's been missing for like 2 months, that's a long time for a body in the water. Hopefully cold temps preserved as much evidence as possible. Will be an interesting autopsy

       I've been following the local news coverage and none of them go into the Nexus Pipeline - very interesting and adds much more to the story. Feel sad for this man's poor family.

       I guess it's Bryon.  His name seems to be spelled wrong about half the time.  Anyway, it seems local police really fucked up the investigation.  The didn't send divers into the lake or anything (and I don't think it was frozen at the time) even though his car was found nearby.  The family hasn't even gotten the autopsy report, and WKYC had to sue to get it made public.

       Yeah -- it's pretty ridiculous watching this story "develop". They won't even say that it was homicide, even though he has self defense wounds on his arms and was obviously stabbed. Even if the stabbing wasn't the final cause of death, there is definitely foul play at work here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ridiculous that the autopsy hasn't been released, and the prosecutor seems to want everybody to just shut up and forget about it. He keeps saying that the investigation is ongoing, but honestly I doubt the family will ever know what happened to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       His death was obviously political and related to the pipeline to anyone who pays attention or looks into it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been considering doing an update on this post, but nothing much has really developed.
