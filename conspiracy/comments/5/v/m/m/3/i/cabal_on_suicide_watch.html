        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">558</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is it. We made it to the beginning of the end of the cabal. Too many people know about them. They are Satan worshipping, child eating, child killing, child abusing, child sacrificing, child snatching, war mongering, Mafia mentalitied, ruthlessly selfish, misery spreading, human slave masters that see us as lamb for the slaughter. </p>

<p>Mossad did 9-11. Mossad has videos of all the real pedos and so they control the many pedos in DC (what is it? 80% pedo now?). They also set up politicians with 16 year old Mossad spies posing as 18 - 21 year old drunk girls at the bar who end up flirting and tricking legitamite politicians into having sex with them while Mossad records the whole thing. Basically, they are also manufacturing pedophiles to control the US. </p>

<p>The federal reserve kept quite about the way it&#39;s built to bankrupt America and we found out. </p>

<p>The shill team is failing although they have had some success. They are simply too expensive and like the Afghanistan war, they will never win. They spend millions on shill propoganda instead of using that money to uplift the economy or help the homeless. They are running the drug trade while fighting it through law enforcement to maximize profit for the corporations they serve. They tried to pass a clearly destructive and enslaving TPP which was laughed at by everyone who read it but it was also insightful into the cabals long term plans of mass enslavement. </p>

<p>The masks have fallen and Hillary herself mentioned how important it is to have trust with the public and that she doesn&#39;t know how to restore it back to what it was right on her own promotional commercial. </p>

<p>There are rumors of one of the top puppetmasters making a run for it. McCain looks nervous, shitty, and sweating bullets like a pig because he knows his days are numbered and that he is a treasonous bastard who is about to be found out. Bill Clinton is now a widely known rapist and pedo. Soros blew up in the public as a dark, sinister overlord who feasts on the souls of Americans for power and domination. Whistleblowers are popping up all over the place. People on the street seem to know about all that we talk about on this sub. Heroes are rising up from every corner who pursue the public interest with Pizzagate like George Webb. </p>

<p>Yup, this is what I was waiting for. Welcome to the beginning of the end of the cabal. The stage is set. The people are roaring so loud that the cabal can hear it all the way in their underground conclaves. Every single day something pops up that needs covering up. It is impossible to cover all this shit up. It&#39;s just a painful waste of time at this point. </p>

<p>South Koreans are peacefully rampaging against the cabal, the U.K. citizens are too, and we are catching up quick here in the US. Mossad is probably on a massive damage control campaign and any minute now someone is going to rat out the cabal in hopes for forgiveness. </p>

<p>Lastly, 1500+ low level pedo traffickers have been arrested and the mid range level ones are just being picked up now. Let&#39;s see how far up we can go with that. </p>

<p>All that we really need to worrry about now is the massive propoganda machine called MSM which is falling apart as we speak. CNN reputation is in shambles. MSNBC is suicididing themselves like dumb bafoons. Fox team members are all heading in different directions like confused weasels. The propoganda works but it&#39;s losing it&#39;s effectiveness. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of clean up work left to do but I think these are all good signs for what&#39;s to come. This might end up being a peaceful revolution after all and social media is dead center of it all. </p>

<p>You want to know something else crazy? It&#39;s starting to enter into the collective consciousness. Rick 7 Morty Season 2 Episode 9</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR2DBb_P8YE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR2DBb_P8YE</a></p>

<p>forward to 12:42, a revolutionary character decides to go after the Elite, enters one of their mansions where they are all eating dinner, and just starts fucking killing of them.</p>

<p>&#39;Christ&#39; is a level of consciousness that Jesus obtained, reflecting absolute love. The Christ consciousness. It is non-polarization.</p>

<p>Anti-christ is the opposite of this. It is a polarized consciousness, reflecting pain, fear, trauma etc... This is what the Cabal stands for... satanists and luciferians. Both the &#39;christ&#39; and &#39;anti-consciousness&#39; are choices for humanity. We must strive to be Love and to understand that we are all ONE - this was the true message of Jesus.</p>

<p>John 1:10-14
He was in the world,
and the world was created through Him,
yet the world did not recognize Him.
11 He came to His own,
and His own people did not receive Him.
12 But to all who did receive Him,
He gave them the right to be children of God,
to those who believe in His name,
13 who were born,
not of blood,
or of the will of the flesh,
or of the will of man,
but of God.
14 The Word became flesh
and took up residence among us.
We observed His glory,
the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father,
full of grace and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was unique because of his mission in his incarnation, and the state of consciousness he attained. I&#39;m not trying to ruffle any feathers but Jesus taught Oneness and unity - that all creation is part of God...That we are ALL co-creators of our reality. </p>

<p>He did not want to be worshipped... The Church co-opted his story to focus on his suffering, fear of the afterlife, and moral contradictions. Roman Emperor Constantine rewrote much of the bible, and while there are divine truths in the bible, the Church is a control system for the mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Constantine did NOT rewrite the Bible.  Early manuscripts, that have turned up, verify the New Testament remains essentially unchanged, and changes that have occurred are noted in the actual Bible in the citations on each page if you have a study bible. JESUS&#39; teaching are recorded in the gospels:  Matthew, john, Luke, Mark and expounded in the apostles&#39; letters (epistles).  You can read them anytime yourself. You will not find the ideas you putting in His mouth there. God created creation. He is NOT creation. It reflects Him, points to Him, speaks of His greatness. God wants spiritual fellowship and to be one with us, through faith in His sacrifice, which restores our fallen spirit to be able commune with God.  Again, this is discussed in passage quoted. </p>

<p>You will notice the verse you quote has word &quot;gods&quot; in lower case, for a reason.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 2:9-12
But we do see Jesus — made lower than the angels for a short time so that by Gods grace He might taste death for everyone — crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering in death.
10 For in bringing many sons to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God — all things exist for Him and through Him — should make the source of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 11 For the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers, 12 saying:
I will proclaim Your name to My brothers;
I will sing hymns to You in the congregation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your positive attitude, but you&#39;re missing the point on Christ Jesus.  Jesus stated, &quot;Why do you call me good? &quot;No one is good--except God alone.&quot;  Yet Jesus of Nazareth still wants us to make Him Lord of our life.  He told the twelve himself:</p>

<p>“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</p>

<p>For I have come to set a man against his father,
and a daughter against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</p>

<p>and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.</p>

<p>Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus wants us to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ for this is the greatest and first commandment while the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</p>

<p>Lastly your quoting of Psalm 82 is a twisting of Scripture.  Psalm 82 is a rebuke to the elohim in his divine council.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.  Peace be with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really needed this today. Got into a debate today about peaceful protesting since it is the last day at standing rock. He has done activism work for years and we have always been divided on the effectiveness of these types of protests. I used the metaphor, how do you convince a person whose family for generations has obtained enough power and wealth to hand over the keys to his castle and give up their source of wealth?  I was totally in the state of mind that it is impossible but you are right by uncovering all of this about them and exposing them to the light is the ultimate peaceful protest. It&#39;s a protest that hasn&#39;t really been attempted, otherwise it is just crazy to keep trying the same thing over and over and expect a different result. It doesn&#39;t work and hasn&#39;t worked since before I was born.  Thanks for turning me around. </p>

I personally know a few people in the military all of which did it in order to help people and have good hearts. A lot don&#39;t agree with how things are running any more than the rest of us. Look at what happened at standing rock with the vets. I am sure there are good people within the government.

We need to keep it up, however.  We need to keep our eyes on the prize - and the prize is liberation.  We cannot sleep.  We cannot allow ourselves to be fooled more.

<p>They are simply too expensive and like the Afghanistan war, they will never win. They spend millions on shill propoganda instead of using that money to uplift the economy or help the homeless. They are running the drug trade while fighting it through law enforcement to maximize profit for the corporations they serve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing. The whole operation is being run on the backs of the peoples, with the American people being the first target of their blood sucking ways. For a lot of people, they&#39;re finding out that they can&#39;t <em>afford</em> to have their &quot;blood sucked&quot; so much.</p>

<p>I see on the web, more and more people are talking about cleaning up and dropping their addictions. Getting in shape. Eating right. Giving up porn. &quot;Red pilling&quot; themselves and others. All of these industries - sugar, junk food, alcohol, tobacco, porn, narcotics, &quot;sick&quot; care - have been go-to sources of the hydra&#39;s funding.</p>

<p>I, myself, have decided that I can&#39;t <em>afford</em> to have lazy, apathetic, negative people in my life. I&#39;ve had the realization that those sort of people are dragging me down. I can&#39;t &quot;afford&quot; those kinds of relationships. It&#39;s too &quot;expensive&quot; for me. And I&#39;m better off for it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really refreshing to see the American people deciding to stop being cucks. That decision is going to go a long way towards the demise of the hydra and the associated networks which feed off of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an older person, it gives me hope. I knew you kids could do it! I&#39;m so proud of you! A few battles have been won, but we can&#39;t get too cocky. Not until these people are behind bars or better yet, no longer existing in this dimension--where they can never hurt another person--especially a child. I&#39;m so ashamed that many of them are from closer to my age. A lot of evil, selfish people with no compassion. I keep telling the kids I know, these bastards like Soros will be gone soon enough, so when it&#39;s your turn to take over, please be better people. And for Pete&#39;s sake, don&#39;t let Soros&#39; sons take over from their evil father! Don&#39;t ever turn your back on these people or let them pull the wool over anyone&#39;s eyes ever again. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably why CNN will be put on blast tomorrow. Trump needs to show what&#39;s going on behind the scenes that way when the high profile arrest come the media can&#39;t twist it into a Trump is taking out political opposition.</p>

<p>Trump is 2 steps ahead by taking out the medias credibility first so that way when the arrest happens that narrative is now shot.</p>

<p>This would not be pedophilia imo. Of course it&#39;s getting caught in an uncompromising situation and is likely illegal now, but tricking a man into sleeping with an underage girl that claims to be of age isn&#39;t evidence of that man being a pedo. It certainly shows poor judgement and would be effective enough blackmail most individuals that don&#39;t want to lose things that any politician would lose if it were exposed they were having sexual relations with 18 y/o interns or something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They are Satan worshipping, child eating, child killing, child abusing, child sacrificing, child snatching, war mongering, Mafia mentalitied, ruthlessly selfish, misery spreading, human slave masters that see us as lamb for the slaughter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who, exactly, do you think is &quot;Satan worshipping, child eating, child killing, child abusing, child sacrificing, child snatching&quot;?</p>

<p>This is something I just don&#39;t get. There&#39;s basically zero evidence  that there&#39;s any significant number of &quot;Satan worshiping, child killing&quot; people in the world, let alone among powerful people.</p>

<p>Why does anybody believe this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mossad did 9-11. Mossad has videos of all the real pedos and so they control the many pedos in DC (what is it? 80% pedo now?). They also set up politicians with 16 year old Mossad spies posing as 18 - 21 year old drunk girls at the bar who end up flirting and tricking legitamite politicians into having sex with them while Mossad records the whole thing. Basically, they are also manufacturing pedophiles to control the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While some people may have fallen for honey-trap blackmail schemes, 80%? Really? If it&#39;s so easy, why would Mossad be the only ones doing it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... They are running the drug trade while fighting it through law enforcement to maximize profit for the corporations they serve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think there&#39;s one group running the drug trade? Seriously?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They tried to pass a clearly destructive and enslaving TPP which was laughed at by everyone who read it but it was also insightful into the cabals long term plans of mass enslavement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh ... what? There were certain aspects of the TPP that I didn&#39;t like, such as the Investor-State Dispute Settlement system, and some things related to copyright, but I must have missed out on the &quot;mass enslavement&quot; clauses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...Soros blew up in the public as a dark, sinister overlord who feasts on the souls of Americans for power and domination. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feasts on the souls? What does that even mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... South Koreans are peacefully rampaging against the cabal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think the same cabal is in charge in South Korea???</p>

<p>This is like one of the free-association rants you see on the streets written on cardboard torn from boxes.</p>

<p>Why is anybody voting this up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever been to a Bull Fight?
The Matador creates confusion with his cape.
When the Bull has mentally and physically exhausted all the different possibilities of freeing himself from the Hell he has found himself in. The Matador drops his Cape and shows him his sword of Destiny. I would rather calculate all those possibilities of escape instead of walking blindly down the corridors of life only to find someone standing at the end with a Bolt Gun and a Hoist. 
Peace</p>
