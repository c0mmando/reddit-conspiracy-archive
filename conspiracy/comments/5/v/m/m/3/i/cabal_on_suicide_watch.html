       This is it. We made it to the beginning of the end of the cabal. Too many people know about them. They are Satan worshipping, child eating, child killing, child abusing, child sacrificing, child snatching, war mongering, Mafia mentalitied, ruthlessly selfish, misery spreading, human slave masters that see us as lamb for the slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad did 9-11. Mossad has videos of all the real pedos and so they control the many pedos in DC (what is it? 80% pedo now?). They also set up politicians with 16 year old Mossad spies posing as 18 - 21 year old drunk girls at the bar who end up flirting and tricking legitamite politicians into having sex with them while Mossad records the whole thing. Basically, they are also manufacturing pedophiles to control the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal reserve kept quite about the way it's built to bankrupt America and we found out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill team is failing although they have had some success. They are simply too expensive and like the Afghanistan war, they will never win. They spend millions on shill propoganda instead of using that money to uplift the economy or help the homeless. They are running the drug trade while fighting it through law enforcement to maximize profit for the corporations they serve. They tried to pass a clearly destructive and enslaving TPP which was laughed at by everyone who read it but it was also insightful into the cabals long term plans of mass enslavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The masks have fallen and Hillary herself mentioned how important it is to have trust with the public and that she doesn't know how to restore it back to what it was right on her own promotional commercial.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are rumors of one of the top puppetmasters making a run for it. McCain looks nervous, shitty, and sweating bullets like a pig because he knows his days are numbered and that he is a treasonous bastard who is about to be found out. Bill Clinton is now a widely known rapist and pedo. Soros blew up in the public as a dark, sinister overlord who feasts on the souls of Americans for power and domination. Whistleblowers are popping up all over the place. People on the street seem to know about all that we talk about on this sub. Heroes are rising up from every corner who pursue the public interest with Pizzagate like George Webb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yup, this is what I was waiting for. Welcome to the beginning of the end of the cabal. The stage is set. The people are roaring so loud that the cabal can hear it all the way in their underground conclaves. Every single day something pops up that needs covering up. It is impossible to cover all this shit up. It's just a painful waste of time at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       South Koreans are peacefully rampaging against the cabal, the U.K. citizens are too, and we are catching up quick here in the US. Mossad is probably on a massive damage control campaign and any minute now someone is going to rat out the cabal in hopes for forgiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, 1500+ low level pedo traffickers have been arrested and the mid range level ones are just being picked up now. Let's see how far up we can go with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that we really need to worrry about now is the massive propoganda machine called MSM which is falling apart as we speak. CNN reputation is in shambles. MSNBC is suicididing themselves like dumb bafoons. Fox team members are all heading in different directions like confused weasels. The propoganda works but it's losing it's effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of clean up work left to do but I think these are all good signs for what's to come. This might end up being a peaceful revolution after all and social media is dead center of it all.

       The unravelling of evil forces is definitely something we can unite for, and have united for (even if it was under false flag pretenses, it proved to all that unity is possible)

       Eventually, the golden age of man. But we have to work to make that happen. We can't just wait for it. The faster we work, the faster we get there. We need to clean up first and then implement major changes once the coast is clear although major changes will pop up here and there while we clean up. The hardest parts are behind us but we're not out of the woods yet. We only pierced the cabal so far and now they have to bleed out while we pull acrobatics to dodge their attacks.

       This is a little misunderstood in my opinion...
      </p>
      <p>
       'Christ' is a level of consciousness that Jesus obtained, reflecting absolute love. The Christ consciousness. It is non-polarization.
      </p>

       Anti-christ is the opposite of this. It is a polarized consciousness, reflecting pain, fear, trauma etc... This is what the Cabal stands for... satanists and luciferians. Both the 'christ' and 'anti-consciousness' are choices for humanity. We must strive to be Love and to understand that we are all ONE - this was the true message of Jesus.

       No, JESUS is unique. He is the only begotten Son of God Almighty. Only one sinless as He was a worthy sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       John 1:10-14
He was in the world,
and the world was created through Him,
yet the world did not recognize Him.
11 He came to His own,
and His own people did not receive Him.
12 But to all who did receive Him,
He gave them the right to be children of God,
to those who believe in His name,
13 who were born,
not of blood,
or of the will of the flesh,
or of the will of man,
but of God.
14 The Word became flesh
and took up residence among us.
We observed His glory,
the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father,
full of grace and truth.

       Jesus was unique because of his mission in his incarnation, and the state of consciousness he attained. I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers but Jesus taught Oneness and unity - that all creation is part of God...That we are ALL co-creators of our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did not want to be worshipped... The Church co-opted his story to focus on his suffering, fear of the afterlife, and moral contradictions. Roman Emperor Constantine rewrote much of the bible, and while there are divine truths in the bible, the Church is a control system for the mind.

       Constantine did NOT rewrite the Bible.  Early manuscripts, that have turned up, verify the New Testament remains essentially unchanged, and changes that have occurred are noted in the actual Bible in the citations on each page if you have a study bible. JESUS' teaching are recorded in the gospels:  Matthew, john, Luke, Mark and expounded in the apostles' letters (epistles).  You can read them anytime yourself. You will not find the ideas you putting in His mouth there. God created creation. He is NOT creation. It reflects Him, points to Him, speaks of His greatness. God wants spiritual fellowship and to be one with us, through faith in His sacrifice, which restores our fallen spirit to be able commune with God.  Again, this is discussed in passage quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice the verse you quote has word "gods" in lower case, for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrews 2:9-12
But we do see Jesus — made lower than the angels for a short time so that by Gods grace He might taste death for everyone — crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering in death.
10 For in bringing many sons to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God — all things exist for Him and through Him — should make the source of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 11 For the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers, 12 saying:
I will proclaim Your name to My brothers;
I will sing hymns to You in the congregation.

       I like your positive attitude, but you're missing the point on Christ Jesus.  Jesus stated, "Why do you call me good? "No one is good--except God alone."  Yet Jesus of Nazareth still wants us to make Him Lord of our life.  He told the twelve himself:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
      </p>
      <p>
       For I have come to set a man against his father,
and a daughter against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
      </p>
      <p>
       and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus wants us to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ for this is the greatest and first commandment while the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly your quoting of Psalm 82 is a twisting of Scripture.  Psalm 82 is a rebuke to the elohim in his divine council.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.  Peace be with you.

       Jesus called his associates his "brothers"; they were also "sons of God". Anyone with Christ consciousness is a "son of God". We all have it, too. It's just unreachable to some or most.

       If they had come to JESUS by faith, they were MADE into sons of God, by the power evidenced by the resurrection. We CAN all have it, but it must be accepted, acknowledged.  God's fellowship can only be accessed "in spirit and in truth", through His Word (scriptures) and His Holy Spirit Who indwells and teaches believers about Himself.

       I really needed this today. Got into a debate today about peaceful protesting since it is the last day at standing rock. He has done activism work for years and we have always been divided on the effectiveness of these types of protests. I used the metaphor, how do you convince a person whose family for generations has obtained enough power and wealth to hand over the keys to his castle and give up their source of wealth?  I was totally in the state of mind that it is impossible but you are right by uncovering all of this about them and exposing them to the light is the ultimate peaceful protest. It's a protest that hasn't really been attempted, otherwise it is just crazy to keep trying the same thing over and over and expect a different result. It doesn't work and hasn't worked since before I was born.  Thanks for turning me around.

       Hmm... Interesting.

       It won't necessarily be peaceful for every single person (murderers and criminal subversives need to be distributed their justice)
      </p>
      <p>
       but not everyone involved in the inner workings of the castle are bad (to use your analogy) If the gatekeeper, guards, butlers, and knights are on the side of the public, they will let you enter rather than protect a tyrant.

       That's an interesting addition to my thinking. I have often thought that some or most on the knights would be on the right side of this. I personally know a few people in the military all of which did it in order to help people and have good hearts. A lot don't agree with how things are running any more than the rest of us. Look at what happened at standing rock with the vets. I am sure there are good people within the government. I really want to be positive about that but honestly at this point I don't think anyone really knows how far down the rabbit hole all this goes. It all seems pretty massive and global.

       We don't have to kill/hang the elite international criminal bankers.
(In fact I'd advise against it since they can place innocent patsies and such.)
We can just imprison them for life, strip assets and give it back to the people, and broadcast the truth about what they have done to humanity to prevent it happening ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, they can man up and strike us a deal.
Screw off to Rothschild island and don't ever come back.
It's too nice of a punishment considering they've killed countless people for money, but I'm feeling kind today. (lol)
(And maybe this way would be faster, but they'd still have to give us nearly all their assets and be named/shamed.)

       I don't exactly know if I would be quite as optimistic as you seem to be about an implied inevitability of the cabal's defeat, but it does seem like the public is gaining a certain level of momentum - and that's a good thing.  We need to keep it up, however.  We need to keep our eyes on the prize - and the prize is liberation.  We cannot sleep.  We cannot allow ourselves to be fooled more.  We need to keep pushing for more and more disclosure to come.  TPTB are certainly not freely giving that disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to keep getting that disclosure by TAKING it; by uncovering more and more of their nefariousness.

        They are simply too expensive and like the Afghanistan war, they will never win. They spend millions on shill propoganda instead of using that money to uplift the economy or help the homeless. They are running the drug trade while fighting it through law enforcement to maximize profit for the corporations they serve.

       That's the thing. The whole operation is being run on the backs of the peoples, with the American people being the first target of their blood sucking ways. For a lot of people, they're finding out that they can't
       <em>
        afford
       </em>
       to have their "blood sucked" so much.

       I see on the web, more and more people are talking about cleaning up and dropping their addictions. Getting in shape. Eating right. Giving up porn. "Red pilling" themselves and others. All of these industries - sugar, junk food, alcohol, tobacco, porn, narcotics, "sick" care - have been go-to sources of the hydra's funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, myself, have decided that I can't
       <em>
        afford
       </em>
       to have lazy, apathetic, negative people in my life. I've had the realization that those sort of people are dragging me down. I can't "afford" those kinds of relationships. It's too "expensive" for me. And I'm better off for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really refreshing to see the American people deciding to stop being cucks. That decision is going to go a long way towards the demise of the hydra and the associated networks which feed off of us.

       They are probably trying hard to 1-fuck things up big time with a Trump assassination and trigger the civil war they've been wanting for years, now. 2-Provoke big disaster/earthquake (california?)using their high energy wave systems 3-Bluebeam or big disclosure (which many are anticipating for different reasons) 4- OR FUCK THAT. WE JUST HANG THEM and shake them out of their luciferian/nephilim/anunaki/enoch/marduk and send them straight to the big karma they deserve.

       I think they'd use an event like 1 to invade syria/iran, not to drive to the US to civil war. Although that may be an unintended consequence. I don't see why they would benefit from civil war except to distract people, but that's a high price to pay for a few years of distraction

       The civil war may act as the kickstarter to push (more) UN intervention on US soil. But true.. Trump is falling into the cabal trap by having Iran as target. And to trust Israel. #OhShitThereGoesTheAntiSemiticTriggerSignal

       Yeah I don't think the zionists want America to be destabilized, it's their cash cow! As long as Trump (or his replacement pence) are moving in the direction of overthrowing iran/syria, and the American people aren't forcing a revolution, then I see little reason why the zionists would
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       America to be destabilized.

       The oligarch want to break the american spirit and the 2nd amendment. It's the only country that grants its citizen the right to self-defense and protection at its core. The endgoal is to create an extra-national centralised power with every country erasing their borders (the mocked NWO), hence Soros' «Open Society». If they can create a civil war, the UN unelected creeps will unleash its China white helmets to intervene to restore «peace»  (read invade and occupy). #ButLetSstayPositive

       As an older person, it gives me hope. I knew you kids could do it! I'm so proud of you! A few battles have been won, but we can't get too cocky. Not until these people are behind bars or better yet, no longer existing in this dimension--where they can never hurt another person--especially a child. I'm so ashamed that many of them are from closer to my age. A lot of evil, selfish people with no compassion. I keep telling the kids I know, these bastards like Soros will be gone soon enough, so when it's your turn to take over, please be better people. And for Pete's sake, don't let Soros' sons take over from their evil father! Don't ever turn your back on these people or let them pull the wool over anyone's eyes ever again. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

       Israel should not be getting aid from America
to kill/oppress Palestinians and steal their land.
How people can ass lick that fascist state is beyond me.

      <p>
       Nothing against Jews/Israelis at all, it's the fascist zionist politicians
that annoy me, who use race cards e.g. "WHY YOU ANTI SEMITIC BASTARD, HOW DARE YOU CRITICIZE BIBI SATANYAHU FOR HIS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!
WHY YOU RACIST ELITIST SCUM. WE ARE THE CHOSEN PEOPLE."
to play evil politics. Lol absurd stuff. :/

       Although the zionist politicians, bankers and corporations don't always give a damn about innocent Jews. Many would even throw innocent Jews under bus if it suited their agenda. I think Soros admitted to doing something like that in WW2.
It's all politics. It's possible the elite have some kind of satanic Judaism hybrid religion....or it's just an excuse to do evil shit.
Who knows. They should hire some psychiatrists, it's not like they can't afford it lol.

       If Trump is somehow "partially" a double agent,
sorta, kinda, helping us and trying to stop (some) of the cabal,
why is Netanyahu a strong ally of his?

       Don't get ahead of yourself. You really think people are gonna rise up? I mean don't get me wrong, i would love the people to take their power back, but it isn't that easy.. We cannot just leave our fate up to more strangers in suits though. The majority of people are too focused on their jobs and slaving for money. We are far from free, so don't be so quick to believe we're almost there. The worst part hasn't even started yet..

       And exactly what family was she referring to? It looks like she is referring to the Clintons, but what if she has a greater family in mind that that? It seems to me if the pizzagate scandal blows open all the way to the top, then her own family might be in the crosshairs.

       This is probably why CNN will be put on blast tomorrow. Trump needs to show what's going on behind the scenes that way when the high profile arrest come the media can't twist it into a Trump is taking out political opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why you've seen McCain and the like being so openly against Trump. Their play was the have the media paint their arrest as retaliatory and it would be painted by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is 2 steps ahead by taking out the medias credibility first so that way when the arrest happens that narrative is now shot.

       This would not be pedophilia imo. Of course it's getting caught in an uncompromising situation and is likely illegal now, but tricking a man into sleeping with an underage girl that claims to be of age isn't evidence of that man being a pedo. It certainly shows poor judgement and would be effective enough blackmail most individuals that don't want to lose things that any politician would lose if it were exposed they were having sexual relations with 18 y/o interns or something.

       Have you ever been to a Bull Fight?
The Matador creates confusion with his cape.
When the Bull has mentally and physically exhausted all the different possibilities of freeing himself from the Hell he has found himself in. The Matador drops his Cape and shows him his sword of Destiny. I would rather calculate all those possibilities of escape instead of walking blindly down the corridors of life only to find someone standing at the end with a Bolt Gun and a Hoist.
