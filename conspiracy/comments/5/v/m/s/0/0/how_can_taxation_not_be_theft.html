<p>It&#39;s slowly happening across all industries. Luckily that Kraft Unilever deal fell through. As corporations gain more power at the political level they lobby for lesser restrictions and regulations on how they are allowed to wheel and deal until you have handfuls of companies controlling everything. You don&#39;t need it to be one guy, and that was a poor example for me to use, when you can have 5-10 control all the assets in an industry and agree to non-competitive pricing. And like you say, sure a new company pops up and under cuts the big boys and starts building a brand. Well the benefits of being a big boy is having pockets deeper than the marianas trench. The new little guy is offered a big buy out and his company is absorbed into the big guys, sometimes they will keep the brand sometimes not. If you want a real life example look at the Canadian telecommunications industry. </p>

<p>Canadians pay more for their cellphones than almost anyone else in the world </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3717093">https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3717093</a></p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/3613139">http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/3613139</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/why-are-canadian-cell-phone-rates-among-highest-in-world/amp">https://www.google.ca/amp/vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/why-are-canadian-cell-phone-rates-among-highest-in-world/amp</a></p>

<p>And if you look at their telecommunications industry the reasoning becomes quite clear. There are only 3 major cellphone companies in Canada. Bell, Rogers, and Telus. The first two being much bigger than the third </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Canada">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Canada</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telus">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telus</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the full list of companies in Canada</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_mobile_phone_companies">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_mobile_phone_companies</a></p>

<p>As you can see all the major ones are owned by Telus Rogers and Bell with some smaller regional ones being independent but none that have a significant market share of cellphone contracts</p>

<p>Next look at the prices that Bell Rogers and Telus offer. All identical plans. No competition whatsoever </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Cell_phone_plans">http://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Cell_phone_plans</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogers.com/consumer/wireless/smartphone-plans">http://www.rogers.com/consumer/wireless/smartphone-plans</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.telus.com/en/on/mobility/plans/">http://www.telus.com/en/on/mobility/plans/</a></p>

<p>Build the same plan on all three and I guarantee they will come out to with a few dollars of each other. I would just be wary of creating a climate like this for any industry </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the customers would get pissed and stop doing business with them, therefore making the company lose money. They will either need to change, or they will go out of business and have to sell assets to another company. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s and example that would cover what you said. Scenario:</p>

<p>A greedy company is charging a shit tonne of money for people to cross the bridge. People are pissed, but they need to use it to get to the other side. So, one day a man says &quot;I&#39;m going to create a ferry business, fuck this. I hate my day job anyways.&quot;. Approaches some other people to invest and creates a business. Charges people significantly less and brings them to the other side faster. People start using his service, and his company grows from one ferry, to two ferries. He&#39;s created jobs and providing competition. He&#39;s not taxed, so he and his employees are making all their profits. </p>

<p>The bridge company will have to lower the price, or he will eventually go out of business and then someone else buys the bridge. So, this starts to happen (prices level out). Some people choose the ferry and some chooses the bridge. It&#39;s a natural economic correction.</p>

<p>What your saying would happen, if the government was there stealing from the small business and giving incentives and tax breaks to the bridge company. Therefore making it either impossible (regulations) and/or non-profitable (regulations and taxes).</p>

<p>Markets are free, not fair. Huge difference. Same thing with life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Corporations are responsible to their boards, who rely on their customers. Yes, without government intervention, the people truly have the regulatory power to make or break a business.</p>

<p>May seem not possible, but that&#39;s just because we&#39;ve been brainwashed thinking the US is a Free Market Capitalist country. It&#39;s crony-Capitalism and damn near State Capitalism or Fascism.</p>

<p>The companies and government collude to make it too hard/expensive to start a brand new telecom company. This is the point. They lobby the government, who then create the rules and regulations in which companies have to abide by. How is this not making sense? Don&#39;t mean to be mean, or anything. But, it&#39;s a pretty basic concept. Corporations want less competition (equals more money), and greedy/corrupt ass politicians want kick backs, money, cocaine, and strippers. Each party profits handsomely from the collusion.</p>

If the 10 big companies own the routes that are needed for everyday American life to carry on then how will they ever go out of business? You can just boycott the roads they are needed, and it would take and insane amount of time and money for the smaller companies to build alternatives, and these alternatives would have to be in places where current roads didn&#39;t already exist, precluding pretty much all the best routes. You don&#39;t seem to get that you&#39;re &quot;world&quot; is far more complex than you think it is. The fact that you think the markets would just right themselves if government was cut out is just insane.

    <div class="md"><p>In a perfect society it is not theft if you are paying for something and then gaining something in return. It is theft because there is so much corruption that we can not see our return. </p>

<p>I live in Philadelphia and we just implemented a &quot;soda tax&quot; that is meant to &quot;fund public school programs while encouraging the community (and children) to choose healthier drink options&quot;. 
LOTS of problems in this new tax. They changed the allocation budget at the last minute so we can&#39;t trust where the funding is going or the amount, they implemented the tax on the distributor so businesses are affected directly then pass the tax along and they don&#39;t have a proper code for mark up value, other drinks are being included in this tax like alternative milk and &quot;low calorie&quot; drinks that are not in line with them wanting the public to choose healthier options.
Regardless of them taxing the healthier options as well, if their tax is successful and the community spends less money on sugary drinks, wouldn&#39;t it reduce the revenue intended for our school programs? </p>

<p>Just from this magnified example I can agree by seeing how many &quot;goods/services&quot; taxes could just be political garbage and flat out theft.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy is that most of these taxes don&#39;t go to social service, but to pay off the debt from the Federal Reserve banking system, where the government burrows from the &quot;federal&quot; reserve at interest... meaning every cent in existence is debt and can never be paid off. You can only postpone the collapse with ever ending printing and expansion. There&#39;s a reason drugs are illegal (raise price floor), they are used to fund a ton of secret government projects, not enough money can be made via legal means. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>There were some famous people that stood and to the IRS, they were arrested and sent into the whole and black-out of the media, just like Dread Pirate Roberts from the Silk Road. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Then there&#39;s the property tax. If you have to pay a property tax, you don&#39;t own it, you&#39;re just a tenant renting it from the government. If you think you own your home, try not paying those taxes and see what happens. Supposedly they&#39;re to pay public school systems, lol do we have to have a discussion on those big daddy government Prussian model brainwashing prison daycare centers that don&#39;t teach kids any real skills? </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Then there&#39;s the &#39;social security number&#39;. Which always gave me a weird feeling, like livestock tag. There was a recent big compilation of research posted here regarding the conspiracy of the Birth Certificate and social security numbers belonging to a secret corporation owned by the Rothschilds. Need to look more into that.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The funniest part of all is that they want your tax returns and claim you can get  &#39;refund&#39;. Lawl. They steal your money then give you some pennies back. Fuck you. There was a good Aaron russo clip that claimed women&#39;s &#39;liberation&#39; and the destruction of the family was fueled by the desire to tax the other 50% of the population and increase consumption. That seems to have great merit. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Then there&#39;s the Car Registration, a tax disguised as a fee. Supposedly this another scheme like the income tax, enforced with and men with guns to keep the masses compliant. Need to look more into that. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>There&#39;s probably more I forgot. </p>

<p>If the services are not performed,  or services not requested undertaken,  then that is graft,  fraud,  corruption.    Since failure to pay taxes is punished,  the term extortion is better than theft.    Like paying the mafia,  only government is the top mafia.

<p>It happens,  right or wrong,  correct?    Sometimes a minority rules a majority too,  correct?   </p>

<p>If there are laws that are followed,  and people are allowed input to the laws,  the laws tend to evolve,  based on the character of the people,  their values at the time.    By definition,  its a matter of legal and illegal.    In any given society,  it may include some good stuff,  some bad stuff.     I don&#39;t believe in religion or god,  I have seen how dogs and animals settle stuff.    I am not looking for an ideology to believe in.   And the killing of Jews is over rated compared to the killing of anyone else.</p>

<p>As far as people who don&#39;t mind being robbed on the street,  get real dude.   Hypothetical silliness is Sam Harris kind of stuff.    I am over it.    Case law was a step forward,  common law.   Precedent.   You don&#39;t have to turn your life over to a rigid absolute.   Blind justice doesn&#39;t exist,  and moral people are the most monstrous of all.    All dictators claim to have the moral high ground.   All dogs and all people are scoundrels,   but some are loyal to their friends.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of people who own no land.</p>

<p>All the land suitable for growing food and decent shelter is already owned by someone. It is quite conceivable (and quite real already) that there is large portion of the population that owns nothing and has nothing to offer to the owner class.</p>

<p>And the biggest regulation of them all are private property laws.</p>

<p>Re-read my earlier comment. Owner class has absolutely no obligation to provide jobs for everyone. Ideally this problem would be solved by non-owner-class people not lucky enough to be employed creating their own jobs such as growing food and building shelter for themselves.</p>

<p>But there is a catch. You need to own or have access to some land to do that. And if that land is already owned by someone who has no use for you we back at square 1.</p>

Things like the quality of your water and air become set by market forces and you get China. Eventually the Chinese middle class will demand taxation is used to improve air quality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think voluntary participation in some kind of tax is totally welcome but outside of that i think a manority of people could do these things better voluntarily. If we want these things so passionately that we fund an entire government to do them, why couldnt people voluntarily join together to do whatever it is they are forcing on others through governmenment. Our country existed for a long time without the income tax. Its just redistributing slavery from one group of people to everyone. Our taxes arent even plenty enough to pay the interest owed on each dollar created. Its a nonsensical and immoral system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take a hypothetical, well-off town. I&#39;ll call it Socialville. The economy of Socialville looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales tax: 5% (this will come into play later)</li>
<li>Property tax: 2.0%</li>
<li>Median house value: $500,000</li>
<li>Average home insurance plan: 0.3% of the value of the house. (so, $1,500)</li>
</ul>

<p>The current average rate for a 30-year mortgage is 4%. With that rate, your monthly payment, plus taxes and insurance, would break down like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Principal and interest: $1,910</li>
<li>Taxes: $833</li>
<li>Home insurance: $125</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total monthly payment:</strong> $2,868</p>

<p>Your balance sheet, assuming you just bought the house and put 20% down, would look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assets: $500,000</li>
<li>Debt: $400,000</li>
<li>Equity: $100,000</li>
</ul>

<p>You and a few Ayn Rand types get together, split off of Socialville, and incorporate Libertown, setting the property tax to zero and declaring that all income will come from sales taxes. Nobody votes to change the sales tax. Unfortunately, Libertown can&#39;t fund any schools, libraries, or parks with that income, so those go away. But the majority of people in Libertown don&#39;t have kids, so they don&#39;t care. Further cuts need to be made to the local government, so the police force is trimmed down to a couple of cops (Barney Fife and Officer Barbrady, I presume), social services are reduced to keeping the streetlights on, and the rest of the residents are urged to buy guns, alarm systems, and hire their own private police force.</p>

<p>Sounds great, right? Well, let&#39;s look at what happens after those drastic cuts are made to your new town.</p>

<h2>The value of your home plummets</h2>

<p>Their former $500,000 homes are now only worth $250,000. In an instant, each resident loses a quarter million dollars in equity. Using the example above, your <em>new</em> balance sheet looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assets: $250,000</li>
<li>Equity: $100,000</li>
<li>Debt: $400,000</li>
</ul>

<p>(Congratulations! You&#39;re now $150,000 underwater on your mortgage.)</p>

<p>The insurance companies get wind of this, so the home insurance rates in Libertown quadruple. You have a fixed mortgage, so thankfully your principle and interest remain the same. Your home insurance, on the other hand, now eats up almost a sixth of your new monthly payment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Principal and interest: $1,910</li>
<li>Taxes: $0 (yay!)</li>
<li>Home insurance: $500</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total monthly payment:</strong> $2,410</p>

<p>But, you may say: my monthly payment is lower, so Libertown is a success, right?</p>

<p>Not so fast, kid. You forgot the fees.</p>

<h2>Don&#39;t forget the fees</h2>

<p>Libertown has no state hospital access anymore. All ambulances are now privatized. You could pay $10,000 for an ambulance pickup after dialing 9-1-1, but that wouldn&#39;t be prudent, so the new private ambulance sells you an insurance plan: for $60 per month, you get one free ambulance pickup per year.</p>

<p>Now you need to pay the private police. Your neighborhood organizes a meeting and finds a private police force that will only charge each household $300 per month for security protection. It only protects your neighborhood, so let&#39;s hope those pesky thieves don&#39;t have access to a vehicle where they can simply drive out of your jurisdiction after robbing you.</p>

<p>Wait, you forgot the firefighters! Your bank requires you to have home insurance, but your home insurance threatens to drop you if you don&#39;t live in a neighborhood without access to a fire patrol. Luckily, Libertown finds a friendly for-profit fire patrol willing to come to your house for a one-time payment of $7,500, or you could buy their insurance plan for $45 per month.</p>

<p>Now your new monthly payment looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Principal and interest: $1,910</li>
<li>Taxes: $0</li>
<li>Home insurance: $500</li>
<li>Private ambulance insurance: $60</li>
<li>Private security force: $300</li>
<li>Private fire patrol: $45</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total monthly payment:</strong> $2,815</p>

<p>Again, you might say: I&#39;m saving $53 per month! Ah, but you&#39;re forgetting the roads.</p>

<h2>Paving those darned roads</h2>

<p>State governments typically hire contractors to pave the roads for small towns. Hell, they use contractors to pave highways nowadays. Those guys don&#39;t come cheap. The cost to pave an area the size of a driveway for a two-car garage can approach $6,000 or more. Since contractors typically set their rates based on what they can get from the largest nearby government, Libertown gets no discount.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s say Libertown buckles down and decides to finally fund the maintenance of roads. Sadly, that 5% sales tax can&#39;t fund any new roads. Let&#39;s raise revenue the libertarian way -- raise the sales tax! It goes from 5% to 10% overnight.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re paying 5% more for goods than the people in Socialville. That $53 you were saving vanishes in less than a week. Worse yet, people in Libertown are venturing into Socialville and buying the goods there to save paying 5% more in sales tax, inadvertently raising revenue for Socialville and starving Libertown into bankruptcy. You can&#39;t sell your home because nobody wants to buy a house that isn&#39;t in a good school system. You can&#39;t walk away from your mortgage because you&#39;re underwater.</p>

<h2>Endgame</h2>

<p>You declare bankruptcy, and the few people who fooled you into joining Libertown buy your property from the bank (with whom they own shares in) for pennies on the dollar, knock it down, and turn it into a private prison, all while laughing at your naïvete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me taxation is a situation you will always get when money and greed mix. You always get conspirators and conspiracy,: people prepared to conspire with others to take as much of the tax revenue for themselves as they can. Always has been and always will be. Tribal , governmental, or private money. Labels don&#39;t matter. Its humans being humans. Its the price of using money but until someone comes up with something better we are stuck with it.</p>

<p>Just got to be vigilante and stand up against it. Get enough people on your side and your going to get change. When you live in a democracy your supposed to be able to talk about such things and protest about them. You can use the courts our taxes have paid for to file lawsuits, etc... (feel sorry for those who live under totalitarian regimes who can&#39;t do this and the only option is armed revolt)</p>

<p>Having a society where there is no taxation and no government is Utopian and has never worked.  All you get is dictators/warlords, people who are crooks and will conspire with others to take tax revenue they get for themselves as the government did before them at the rate they demand.</p>

<p>Taxation is essential. Taxes pay for roads, schools, hospitals, police, etc... These big corporations (whose political puppets cry out against taxation so their masters are more profitable with bigger bonuses for executives) wouldn&#39;t be as profitable if they had to educate their workforce from scatch, build the roads to supply their customers with their products/services,  unable to sell product and services to the goverment due to the institution being broke, etc...</p>

<p>For me, it is politicians promise of tax cuts being the usual form of con game or conspiracy these days. Means big tax breaks for the rich while minimal tax relief for common people while these common people payout more for private schooling for their kids, pay more for their health at private hospitals, pay more for transportation using private toll roads and bridges, etc.. so any miniscule tax relief they received is gone and their paying 200% more for things the government provided freely using taxation to pay for them. The rich people who got the big taxation breaks, any government cutback means nothing as they&#39;d always been able to pay insurance for private hospitals, been able to afford to send their kids to the best private school, etc... </p>

<p>When and where government and politicians publicly tell people they need you to pay X dollars in taxes to do Y thing and then use the tax revenue to accomplish Y thing there is no conspiracy. Sure their may be some small conspiracies involved on the side over trivial matters but if the government delivered you can&#39;t call it  conspiracy.</p>

<p>How does the majority have the right to rule the minority?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It happens,  right or wrong,  correct?    Sometimes a minority rules a majority too,  correct?   </p>

<p>If there are laws that are followed,  and people are allowed input to the laws,  the laws tend to evolve,  based on the character of the people,  their values at the time.    By definition,  its a matter of legal and illegal.    In any given society,  it may include some good stuff,  some bad stuff.     I don&#39;t believe in religion or god,  I have seen how dogs and animals settle stuff.    I am not looking for an ideology to believe in.   And the killing of Jews is over rated compared to the killing of anyone else.</p>

<p>As far as people who don&#39;t mind being robbed on the street,  get real dude.   Hypothetical silliness is Sam Harris kind of stuff.    I am over it.    Case law was a step forward,  common law.   Precedent.   You don&#39;t have to turn your life over to a rigid absolute.   Blind justice doesn&#39;t exist,  and moral people are the most monstrous of all.    All dictators claim to have the moral high ground.   All dogs and all people are scoundrels,   but some are loyal to their friends.</p>
