<p>Have you guys seen this? I went to see if it is legit, I went to google.com and typed in naturalnews.com and it is not even appearing. What the fuck is going on?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Cv0KaP9.png">http://i.imgur.com/Cv0KaP9.png</a></p>

<p>Note the top link I clicked on. It goes to some bogus advertising website that looks sketchy as fuck. They completely obliterated all instances of naturalnews.com</p>

<p>This is a modern day book burning.</p>

<p>Edit: Below are some details.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>over 140,000 instances of naturalnews.com have been purged from Google.com search engine</p></li>
<li><p>His other websites he owns, like censored.news still appear, and his search engine, good gopher, both still show up when you type them into google.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing in &quot;NaturalNews.com&quot; on Google only brings up his Facebook, and other instances, mostly websites attacking Mike Adams, as well as bogus advertisement websites (like natural.news as seen in my photo linked above)</p></li>
<li><p>According to Mike, he was threatened recently (2-16-2017) to run a &quot;smear campaign&quot; against Alex Jones and his website, InfoWars.com</p></li>
<li><p>Mike refused, and went public with this threat on his website which you can see linked here</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-02-16-health-ranger-threatened-by-left-wing-media-goons-destroy-alex-jones-or-we-will-destroy-you.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-02-16-health-ranger-threatened-by-left-wing-media-goons-destroy-alex-jones-or-we-will-destroy-you.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Now, as of today, Google purged all his instances and search terms off Google search engine (except his other websites, Facebook, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Mainstream media do not like Mike Adams (his nickname is the Health Ranger) because he is on Team Trump (even though he doesn&#39;t post many political articles)</p></li>
<li><p>Big Pharma do not like him because he his anti Mercury/Thimersol in vaccines, and goes on about the other dangers of some medications etc</p></li>
<li><p>Monsanto and the like do not like him because he does a lot of work and research on the dangers of GMO&#39;s</p></li>
<li><p>Mike Adams has done a lot of great work for his fellow man. He tested water samples for free in cities across the nation after the flint water crises (which is still happening by the way)</p></li>
<li><p>He is offering to do free water sample testing of Native American lands close to Oil Pipelines</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone can have their opinions on Mike Adams. Opinions don&#39;t matter right now.</p>

<p>What matters is Google took censorship into their own hands and purged information like this, which sets a scary and dangerous precedent.</p>

<p>Let us know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but this means much more. Yes natural news sometimes have click bait titles and it&#39;s easy to brush them off. But Mike Adams (he calls himself the health ranger) is a man of the people. He&#39;s done so much for us. He has publicly and freely tested public water supplies, he&#39;s offered to test the water sources of reservations where pipelines are. He provides ample amount of coverage on alternative media and is a respectable guy.</p>

<p>I truly appreciate what he&#39;s done and while I&#39;ve brushed him off in the past, he needs our help now.</p>

<p>If Google can just freely purge information like this, how can they even be trusted as a company? Especially when all the information purged is related to vaccines, health and wellness, etc.</p>

<p>I seriously compare this to burning books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, aside from the fact that there is no Mercury in any routine vaccination (except trace amounts in the influenza vaccine - well and truly below concerning levels and in the much less dangerous form of thimerosol), he also attempts to spread fear and misinformation about science-based medicine in order to appeal to the naturally suspicious.</p>

<p>He does it purely to sow distrust and fear to sell his alternative products. In any case you cannot deny the massive conflict of interest in running a news site that is based around criticising science based medicine, whilst simultaneously selling the items he proposes as an alternative on the very same website</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying but I gotta compare the hypocrisy here..</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry does the exact same thing that you just described.</p>

<p>They release bull shit medical journals and release advertisements about their crap medicine all the while saying anything other than that is dangerous.</p>

<p>It goes both ways.</p>

<p>Anyway, I see the point you&#39;re trying to make but I see Mike Adams as a true American. He&#39;s done a lot of lab research for free, and has done countless water sample testing for cities around the US after the flint water crises.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to paint someone black or white, and there&#39;s more to Mike and his natural news than bad or good guy. He makes mistakes. He helps out, and seems to mean well for us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical journals are peer reviewed. All modern medicine undergoes independent peer review at the research level before being approved by an independant organisation prior to being sold.</p>

<p>Regardless of the problems that exist with that system, it is still a far far more thorough vetting system than is utilised by NaturalNews or any other alternative medicine advocate site.</p>

<p>You&#39;re comparing apples to oranges</p>

<p>I &quot;knock&quot; him because he spreads pseudoscientific nonsense and claims it as truth. No amount of other good deeds can make up for the incredible danger of spreading anti-vaccine rhetoric, for example. That literally endangers lives</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical journals are often paid for by the pharmaceutical companies themselves. You really think that&#39;s accountable?</p>

<p>Mike Adams strikes me as a man that means well and is trying to help his fellow man.</p>

<p>He has his own verified labs for gods sake. He has a food forensic analysis lab. He has all this research, certification, and awards under his belt.</p>

<p>I trust his research and open approach to medicine more than a giant conglormation of big pharma that keeps you treats you instead of cures you.</p>

<p>Any med school freshman can tell you the difference in danger when ingesting a toxin vs. injecting it (not to mention it&#39;s combined with Polysorbate 80 which thins the blood-brain barrier and allows the virus and other vaccine adjuvants such as Aluminum to cross it more easily).</p>

<p>First, I said there is no Mercury of any form in any regular vaccine but thimerosal, which is in trace amounts in the influenza vaccine. Not thimerosal AND Mercury as your post implies.</p>

<p>Injected or otherwise doesn&#39;t matter, that amount of Thimerosal in the influenza vaccine is totally harmless.</p>

<p>It worked fine for me but I use encrypted.google if I actually need their results which might not work the same. There&#39;s always startpage.com.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones also got blackballed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, InfoWars was blackballed by AdRoll.com, an online advertising distribution company. According to Alex Jones, the blacklisting by AdRoll will cost InfoWars $3 million in annual revenues, possibly causing InfoWars to abandon plans of opening a Washington D.C. bureau to cover the Trump administration with real news (instead of the fake news from CNN and elsewhere).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there is a war going on right now to silence alt media and keep fake news propaganda going</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike Adams owns Natural News.</p>

<p>Alex Jones owns InfoWars.</p>

<p>Both men are friends, and both run alternative news websites.</p>

<p>Mike Adams (the man who owns natural news) was recently threatened to start a smear campaign against info wars (Alex jones)</p>

<p>Mike Adams refused and went out with that information. And now, because of that, Mike Adams website (naturalnews.com) is purged from Google.</p>

<p>And no worries man I can understand how it&#39;s confusing especially first hearing about natural news.</p>

Instead of believing that corporation&#39;s and governments are capable of inhuman levels of competence, collaboration, and secrecy, consider that groups like NN visibly profit from selling all kinds of ineffective crap after undermining conventional medicine.</p>

I totally believe in a lot of the popular conspiracies and love reading about them and keeping an open mind, but I have an extremely hard when it comes to vaccines.  I mean fuck, the guy that started the whole &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; thing lost his medical license and had that article retracted because of how damaging it was.  Studies are showing that signs of autism are apparent before the children are even born and definitely before they receive their first vaccines.  Every Biology professor I&#39;ve ever encountered has talked about how damaging that report was, how important vaccines are, and how it&#39;s just unfortunate people think vaccines can cause problems like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Germany if you get sick from vaccine the government will pay all your health care costs forever. But if you get sick because your parents didn&#39;t want to get you vaccinations the health insurance will kick you out at the age of 18. So the anti vaxxers that believe so much in not needing vacations fake them so they could claim that a child got sick because of a double faulty dose. If a physician is found to fake that he of course will lose his license.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m just gonna agree to disagree.  Being skeptical of something is totally within ones rights and I have no problem with it.  The problem comes when people ignore facts just to keep pushing their opinion.  Like the whole anti-vax thing started because of the supposed link to autism, but when that was debunked it just shifted to the vague &quot;it might have undesirable effects&quot; claims.  While it&#39;s entirely possible, at that point it&#39;s just people wanting to be anti-vax and clinging to any possible reason against it.  They aren&#39;t anti-vax for any real reason other than distrust, which is fine, but call it what it is.  No reproducible results have shown that vaccines cause autism, and I haven&#39;t seen any showing that they are to blame for anything really.  There is no rational discussion because the reason behind anti vaccines at this point isn&#39;t rational (I don&#39;t mean that as an insult).  It isn&#39;t based on any science or study, it&#39;s fear based. Despite the science showing that it isn&#39;t really causing any issues, especially the initial one of autism that started the whole movement, people are still against it.  You cannot have rational arguments against something when there is practically zero science supporting your claims, I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s like arguing that cigarettes aren&#39;t that bad because there is no discussion of their benefits.  Or global warming is debatable because the anti-climate change people aren&#39;t getting enough air time.  Meanwhile, vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough have seen rises.  I write this as peacefully as possible and am not trying to flame anyone or start anything overly negative &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After intense pharmaceutical lobbying, the NCVIA was passed in 1986, all liability from vaccine injury was removed from manufacturers.  This means the government and the CDC became liable for paying out vaccine injuries.  By 2000 there were so many vaccine-induced autism claims at the VICP they calculated that paying out a good portion of them would cost over a trillion dollars.  The CDC was essentially duped by these corporations.  Now they can never admit a connection between vaccines and autism because doing so would make the government insolvent.  </p>

<p>The current head scientist of the CDC has already admitted that he was forced to present fraudulent data in a study to coverup a causal link between MMR vaccination and autism.   <a href="https://morganverkamp.com/statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">Here is the legal statement made by his lawyer.</a> There are also many recorded phonecalls with a fellow scientist, Brian Hooker, where he clearly states there is a causal link and he was forced to alter the data.  This study, by the way, is the most cited study used by others to push the lie that there is no link.  Thompson&#39;s confession invalidates a ton of now debunked studies.  It was also the study used to push the omnibus bill to throw out all VICP court cases of vaccine induced ASD.  This is despite the fact that the VICP had already paid out millions of dollars to individuals suffering brain damage from vaccines, resulting in an ASD diagnosis.  </p>

<p>Now, that leads me to what ASD actually is.  There is no blood test to diagnose ASD, nor is there a genetic test.  An ASD diagnosis is purely behavioural.  So what causes the behaviours seen in ASD patients? Widely speaking, brain damage.  ASD is essentially a behavioural gauge for different levels of brain damage.  Now, how does brain damage occur that causes ASD? In a variety of ways.  What I&#39;m trying to get at, is that ASD is such a broad set of behavioural characteristics, that a lot of different issues can be the cause.  For instance, improper prenatal development of the cerebellum or early childhood cerebellum injury is stated to be one of the major factors in an ASD diagnosis.  Now, encephalitic fever is an admitted side effect of many vaccines.  I know this because my brother nearly died from an encephalitic fever caused by the MMR.  Sometimes the brain swells up so much that it causes permanent brain damage.  And guess what diagnosis is common after suffering brain damage?  The effects of autism can be broadly defined as an impairment in the development of the brain, that is why autism doesn&#39;t suddenly manifest in adults, once the brain is developed a trigger cannot onset autism.  And that is the reason why we see so much regressive autism now, a normally developing child with a predisposition can have a bad reaction to a vaccine, which will act as the environmental trigger for the onset of autism.  Yes, they have found a certain gene that, when transcribed improperly, predisposes an individual to autism.  Similar to many diseases, autism has a genetic factor that can become expressed through an environmental stressor.  The claim that autism is purely genetic is absolutely bunk for a couple reasons: autistic people are much less likely to have children, so we wouldn&#39;t be seeing such an explosion in prevalence.  Some of this increase in prevalence is definitely due to the change in diagnostic criteria for ASD, asperger&#39;s and autism used to be classified differently, now they are two parts of the same spectrum.  I can see this accounting for a 2-fold, maybe even up to a 10-fold increases in prevalence, but we have seen a <strong>400-fold</strong> increase in prevalence over 30 years.  This is an epidemic, and purely genetic diseases don&#39;t cause epidemics.  </p>

<p>So, what about environmental stressors?  Thimerosal is a bit of a red herring.  It is a potent neurotoxin, but it has always been more implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders like tics, I believe it was only a contributing factor to ASD, not the cause.  Besides, it was the MMR that has always been the main culprit in ASD regression (TDAP to a lesser extent), and I don&#39;t think it has ever contained more than trace thimerosal.  I don&#39;t think any one ingredient in vaccines directly cause the ASD, but I do think some of them synergise and work like a perfect storm.  When companies began removing thimerosal from most scheduled vaccines, they compensated by upping the dose of aluminum.  Aluminum is another bioaccumulative neurotoxin that has similar effects in the body as aluminum.  If you didn&#39;t know, manufacturers often used to use live-virus vaccines.  They worked well, but the problem with a live virus is the innoculated can often become a vector for transmission, also called shedding.  So they began using dead or acellular virus vaccines, the problem is that sometimes the immune system won&#39;t recognize the dead virus as a threat.  So, manufacturers added in aluminum, a potently toxic heavy metal that invokes an enormous immune response.  This allowed the immune system to recognize the virus, but it had consequences. </p>

<p>&quot;Aluminum causes an oxidative stress within brain tissue.[13] Since the elimination half-life of aluminum from the human brain is 7 years, this can result in cumulative damage via the element&#39;s interference with neurofilament axonal transport and neurofilament assembly.&quot;
Blaylock et al suggest that the heterogeneous symptoms of autism spectrum disorders have a connection with dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain along with enhancement of excitatory receptor function by proinflammatory immune cytokines as the underlying pathophysiological process.&quot;</p>

<p>Aluminum adjuvants are put in vaccines because they provoke an enormous immune response, and research suggests in some individuals they provoke a prolonged autoimmune response. Aluminum in the brain disrupts glutamatergic neurotransmission, and provokes a prolonged inflammatory response by immune cytokines, <strong>this is exactly what Blaylock et al describes as the physiological processes involved in autism.</strong>  </p>

<p>So, similar to mercury, the neurodegenerative effects of aluminum are the same as what we see in autism.  There&#39;s actually a lot more to this.  Aluminum is used to essentially trick the body into recognizing a virus, sometimes this process works a little too well.  There are many other adjuvents in vaccines: MSG, egg albumen, peanut oil substrate; aluminum can also trick the body into recognizing these as threats.  It&#39;s a perfect explanation for the massive rise in allergies.  For what is an allergy? An unnecessary immune response to a foreign substance.  In fact, I believe this is an underlying cause of a whole host of autoimmune conditions on the rise such as asthma.  Vaccines and the concept of autoimmunity are inextricably linked.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s one last part to this: <a href="https://www.vaccinationnews.org/sites/default/files/DailyNews/2003/June/25/Singh25.pdf">I&#39;d like to point you to this study.</a>  Like Wakefield, many other researchers were noticing massive gastrointestinal inflammation in autistic patients.  The study found that the body was essentially mounting a prolonged inflammatory assault against what it thought was measles, except measles wasn&#39;t there.  Another instance of autoimmunity.  This is what I mean when I say a perfect storm.  In genetically predisposed individuals, a hyper-immune response will be mounted to vaccine strain measles virus.  This prevents the gut from absorbing nutrients to send to the developing brain.  Along with this, aluminum travels to the brain in a cumulative fashion (it&#39;s half-life is 7 years) and causes neurodegeneration.  This is why we have so many reports of young children that start off with sensitivities to vaccines but they continue developing normally until they get the MMR, where the inflammatory response in the gut and the toxic load in the brain becomes too much for it to continually developing normally.</p>

<p>Essentially, you can identify the changes leading to autism by comparing brain development between the ages of 6 to 12 months.
So essentially, autism has already started way before vaccines are given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting article.  Please don&#39;t think that my post is trying to infer that <em>all</em> autism is caused by vaccines.  I would say that a very low percentage of overall autism cases in a certain subset of genetically predisposed or hypersensitive individuals are caused by vaccines.  Like, maybe even as low as 1 in 500 autism cases.  That article only had a sample size of 100 individuals.  Really, it is similar to the point I made about improper development of the cerebellum being another big predictor of autism.  </p>

<p>The only study we need to put this issue to rest is a study on autism prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, but the CDC refuses to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of studies are designed to get specific results, I&#39;d have to see the study itself and assess conflicts of interest of the authors.  One thing I can say is the study only started testing at 2 years of age.  The Thompson study found increased risk was directly related to age of receipt of MMR and it was the younger kids (12-15 months) that were at increased risk.  The fact that this study starts at 2 years when first MMR receipt is usually 12-15 months is the first red flag I see.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013411002212">Studies say a lot of different things.</a> </p>

<p>You are absolutely right, though.  Lots of large population cohort studies show no link between MMR and Autism, that is why I say the association must be rare.  I&#39;ve looked into some of them and more than a couple reference Destefano studies.  Frank Destefano was the lead of Thompson&#39;s team and was the specific person to force Thompson to alter data and destroy the original data.  If others are using Destefano&#39;s data in their studies I would immediately question the validity of that data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Thompson study showed a greater risk in vaccinations between 24 and 36 months not 12-15.</p>

<p>&quot;The overall distribution of ages at MMR vaccination among children with autism was similar to that of matched control children&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Similar proportions of case and control children had been vaccinated before 18 or before 24 months&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More case (93.4%) than control children (90.6%) were vaccinated before 36 months&quot;</p>

<p>Not that the study showed an increased risk, it showed that parents of case children more slightly more likely to have had their children vaccinated between 24 &amp; 36 months.</p>

<p>This fits with the methodology shown.</p>

<p>&quot;Because the recommended age of first MMR dose administration is 12 to 15 months, and 4 to 6 years for the second dose, relative risks (RRs) were estimated to compare ASD status in children receiving 1 dose of MMR at ages 2, 3, 4, and 5 years and 2 doses at age 5 years vs those who were unvaccinated at those ages (2-dose RRs at age 4 years would only include those children who received the second dose by their fourth birthday). Separate RRs were estimated for children with older siblings with and without ASD. Since no children were lost to follow-up before reaching age 5, unadjusted RRs were reported as cumulative incidence rate ratios by taking the ratio of the proportion of children who had an ASD diagnosis in an exposed group (either 1 MMR dose or 2 MMR doses) to the proportion of children who had an ASD diagnosis in the unvaccinated group at a given age.&quot;</p>

<p>I can explain that study by 1. it doesn&#39;t show them consistently found elevated in autistic children. It showed some autistic children had elevated antibodies in a population of 88.
The best explanation is the comprehensive review including that study which shows there really is no causal link. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946709000075">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946709000075</a></p>

<p>Finally, given that that structural changes in the brain resulting in autism are being formed between 6 to 12 months of age and that the MMR receipt is given after 12 months pretty much puts the nail in coffin between any links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post.  I&#39;d only add that the information left out of the initial 2004 report was that African American males vaccinated before 36 months were at a slightly increased risk of autism.  When Hooker published his now-redacted re-analysis, he said that African American males vaccinated before 36 months were 3.4 times more likely to have autism.  </p>

<p>Adding to that, many experts slammed his re-analysis.  Don&#39;t feel like summarizing so here&#39;s what one site said: </p>

<p>&quot;Experts say Hooker’s study was fundamentally flawed. There’s no mention of how many children were included in his analysis –- an omission that Vanderbilt University biostatistician Bill Dupont called “extremely rare” –- and he failed to properly control for factors known to contribute to autism risk.</p>

<p>“All he did was one analysis and said there are no other variables that might be impacting this,” said Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at UH Rainbow Babies &amp; Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. “You can’t just analyze data without asking questions.”</p>

<p>Experts said it’s also not clear how Hooker used the CDC data set, which was not designed for the type of statistical breakdown he performed, to draw his conclusions.</p>

<p>“The general rule of statistics is that the way you analyze the data needs to follow from the way data was collected,” Dupont said. “Hooker ignores [the CDC’s] study design entirely.”</p>

<p>Dupont said the data set wasn&#39;t ideal for either study because it didn&#39;t include when the children were diagnosed with autism. Some of the children could have been vaccinated after they developed autism –- a possibility that Dupont said would have prompted an overestimate of the risk of autism associated with the MMR vaccine.&quot;</p>

<p>Another important note is that Thompson says no matter what, he thinks vaccines save countless amounts of lives, that he would never suggest a parent avoid getting their child of any race vaccinated, and that the risks are vastly outweighed by the benefits.  Not too invested in this topic at this point so gonna end here, but I&#39;d just say that while there might be a link to vaccines and autism, I think that vaccine-induce autism has a very small chance of happening, and certainly not frequently enough to say to hell with vaccines.  It probably would occur in someone predisposed to the disorder.  Either way, hopefully research continues to be done and hopefully there will be more studies showing a possible link (as the ones you pointed to were from like &#39;03 and &#39;04).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I don&#39;t think vaccine induced autism happens that often, and there is a lot of study that would rule out vaccination being the major factor causing autism.  The problem is: the absolute complete denial of a link whatsoever.  And the crucifixion of anyone who suggests this link, no matter how rare it is.  It is so blatantly anti-scientific.  </p>

<p>These people are attacking Hooker, but Hooker was bound to the confines of the study itself.  He wasn&#39;t controlling for confounding variables because they weren&#39;t there in the study.  The attack on Hooker is extremely disingenuous.  If you look more into it there are a lot of recorded phonecalls between Hooker and Thompson, everything Hooker found was exactly what Thompson was trying to point out.  Thompson also released the original records for the study, which clearly show other members of the CDC forcing him to alter data points to get the statistical significance down.  The fact that they saw the connection from the beginning and did everything in their power to cover it up.. it&#39;s an affront to science.  It&#39;s absolutely disgusting.  In the study itself, the white population also had an increased risk, but it fell just within the limit of not being statistically significant. There was another way of looking at the dataset and looking at &quot;isolated autism,&quot; which I believe was autism cases without any other neurodevelopmental disorders, these isolated cases were extremely correlated to the MMR shot, like 700% odds ratio or more.  </p>

<p>The CDC knows that the one study they must do to settle the debate for good is autism prevalence in vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations, but they refuse to do it.</p>

<p>I am as well, but we should also recognize how the free exchange of ideas can be used to subvert the very ideals it is trying to uphold. When people lack adequate access to good sources of information they&#39;re vulnerable to group-think and external manipulation. Both of these are apparent in sites like Natural News, that is knowingly and purposely spreading misinformation and pseudoscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look through my post history and you&#39;ll see my consistent efforts to do exactly that.

<p>The truth on vaccines is that their benefits are tangible, measurable, and have a solid scientific and medical foundation. There may be issues around the monetization and distribution of those vaccines, but the <strong><em>OVERWHELMING</em></strong> weight of evidence is in favour of their efficacy. People pushing a counter-narrative based on anti-establishment distrust and faulty science are causing a real, measurable harm to the safety of our communities. I know that might be hard for someone emotionally invested in the counter-narrative to accept, but people with the requisite medical knowledge to form truly reasoned and informed opinions on this issue have (independent of pressure by big pharmaceutical companies) looked at this stuff and determined it&#39;s legitimacy. </p>

Just to clarify, I am no stranger to conspiracy, I&#39;m not a dismissive type of dude, and I personally entertain some of the most radical possibilities out there, but every time I&#39;ve seen Natural News, it&#39;s been absolutely blatant hogwash, lowest common denominator sorts articles that I would pretty much expect any sensible person to be able to identify immediately on sight. This isn&#39;t meant to be an insult to you or anyone else, and I&#39;m sorry it sounds so harsh, but there&#39;s really no other way I know how to communicate the severity of what I am talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure Natural News had a fairly sensational to e but if you dig into the issues it pretty much nails it. No offence but most people do not set aside enough time to understand that western medicine is a giant scandal, especially not doctors. I am telling you this as a fact. The thing is you have an exaggerated sense of western medicine being uncontroversial, well established fact and yet it is blatantly pseudo-scientific because it is corrupted by a lobby and is behilden to money. The same allegation can be levelled at science in general. Science and medicine could be so much better than the corrupt shit we see today. </p>

<p>Give specific examples. I wanna hear you back this (ridiculous) claim up. Because I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t. </p>

<p>Western medicine follows evidence-based treatment protocols. Meaning all their treatments have been evaluated through the scientific method, and have undergone at least some scrutiny in scientific journals. Eastern medicine on the other hand is based on made-up concepts that have no actual basis in anatomy, physiology, or pharmacology. </p>

<p>There has been a concentrated effort to eradicate polio ala smallpox through vaccination. Vaccination is much more effective at lowering disease.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Vaccines aren&#39;t 100% effective. Nothing ever is. I also now want to look into the data of when the largest antivaccine push started and the cases of stuff like that. </p>

<p>significant pockets of people not vaccinating could cause the percentage to drop below the amount needed for herd immunity, which significantly breaks the system down, and possibly makes it nigh useless.</p>

<p>They sure don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think they make much of a profit on vaccines. Considering the first vaccines were done with cow pox pustules... it for sure works. </p>

<p>The real money is in a bunch of drugs thta they have no idea how they work but they just seem to &quot;work&quot; Neurontin is one. Shit doesn&#39;t do fuckall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. What&#39;s trippy is on his article he says that a few days back he recieved a threat to smear Alex jones and InfoWars or something would happen.</p>

<p>So instead of doing the smear campaign he went public with it and posted it on natural news instead.</p>

<p>Now, his website is completely purged from Google.</p>

<p>I find that highly suspicious.</p>

<p>Also, it was over 140,000 mentions of naturalnews.com that is a massive purge and that isn&#39;t an accident.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is alarming. Thanks for replying </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re like the antithesis to mainstream media.  By far the largest monetary supporter of the MSM is the pharmaceutical industry.  The MSM has become largely a platform to sell pharmaceutical drugs through commercials, &quot;news&quot; segments, and fear mongering.  They won&#39;t touch topics like medical error, pharmaceutical deaths and vaccine whistleblowers.  Naturalnews is completely funded by the natural health industry, they promote supplements and nutrition based health.  They definitely sensationalize these natural cures, but they are good for reporting medical/pharmaceutical corruption that you will never hear from the MSM.  </p>

We cannot comment on the individual reasons a page may be removed.

They won&#39;t call out pharma on really anything. Why? Because of direct to consumer advertising. Many of these &#39;news&#39; organizations are literally on the payroll of pharma. They won&#39;t publish stories that could damage their sponsors. This is why alternative health news site whether you agree with them or not, are more important than ever.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on that goddamn bullshit. I bet they record your response times so even if you&#39;re using a proxy (which causes Cloud<strong><em>Front</em></strong> ReCaptcha blocks <strong><em>everywhere</em></strong>) they can still tell who you are. And they started it all off with the innocent-sounding cover of &quot;digitizing all the books ever&quot; which turned into &quot;identifying the addresses on every house ever&quot; and pretty soon will probably be &quot;match the names of each famous politician with their faces&quot; and then &quot;match the names of your friends with their faces&quot;...</p>

<p>I am not endorsing naturalnews.com, but I know that putting trust for this type of censorship in the hands of search engines like Google is a horrible mistake. It can easily lead to censorship of dissent. </p>

<p>Why are we so prone to misplaced trust in authority? What is wrong with our species? Is it a deficiency in perceiving, understanding or appreciating nuance? It seems that all it takes is a clown or one extreme to convince us to sell our future to corruptible authority to ameliorate it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. What&#39;s trippy is on his article he says that a few days back he recieved a threat to smear Alex jones and InfoWars or something would happen.</p>

<p>So instead of doing the smear campaign he went public with it and posted it on natural news instead.</p>

<p>Now, his website is completely purged from Google.</p>

<p>I find that highly suspicious.</p>

<p>Also, it was over 140,000 mentions of naturalnews.com that is a massive purge and that isn&#39;t an accident.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is alarming. Thanks for replying </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Germany if you get sick from vaccine the government will pay all your health care costs forever. But if you get sick because your parents didn&#39;t want to get you vaccinations the health insurance will kick you out at the age of 18. So the anti vaxxers that believe so much in not needing vacations fake them so they could claim that a child got sick because of a double faulty dose. If a physician is found to fake that he of course will lose his license.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m just gonna agree to disagree.  Being skeptical of something is totally within ones rights and I have no problem with it.  The problem comes when people ignore facts just to keep pushing their opinion.  Like the whole anti-vax thing started because of the supposed link to autism, but when that was debunked it just shifted to the vague &quot;it might have undesirable effects&quot; claims.  While it&#39;s entirely possible, at that point it&#39;s just people wanting to be anti-vax and clinging to any possible reason against it.  They aren&#39;t anti-vax for any real reason other than distrust, which is fine, but call it what it is.  No reproducible results have shown that vaccines cause autism, and I haven&#39;t seen any showing that they are to blame for anything really.  There is no rational discussion because the reason behind anti vaccines at this point isn&#39;t rational (I don&#39;t mean that as an insult).  It isn&#39;t based on any science or study, it&#39;s fear based. Despite the science showing that it isn&#39;t really causing any issues, especially the initial one of autism that started the whole movement, people are still against it.  You cannot have rational arguments against something when there is practically zero science supporting your claims, I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s like arguing that cigarettes aren&#39;t that bad because there is no discussion of their benefits.  Or global warming is debatable because the anti-climate change people aren&#39;t getting enough air time.  Meanwhile, vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough have seen rises.  I write this as peacefully as possible and am not trying to flame anyone or start anything overly negative &lt;3</p>
