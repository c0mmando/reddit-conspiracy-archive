<p>Milo unequivocally advocated for pedastry. I don&#39;t think the shock and outrage over that is manufactured at all.</p>

<p>Personally, I will never be OK with 30-something adult saying that a sexual relationship with a 13/14 year old can be a good thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what views are you promoting? It sounds to me like the same ones propagated by the MSM. There is a BIG difference between a person condoning consensual sex between an adult and a 13 year-old, than condoning an adult raping a 5 year-old. </p>

<p>Unless <em>you</em> have evidence of Milo raping a kid, please take your garbage talking points elsewhere. There are plenty of anti-Trump subreddits for you to vent about T_D. </p>

<p>I, and many others here do not give a shit about T_D, but I would imagine that they are protesting the MSM&#39;s forced exaggeration of this controversy. Try reading beyond the article headlines and you might come to realize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure, but it is very clear that some kind of majority in the sub has been pushing PG for the past few weeks, and others have been accused of being Pedophiles, including Sarah Silverman, due to some un-funny jokes she made; and yet, here we have Milo, poster boy for T_D saying some pedo shit, and instead of adding him to the rest of the people they have classified as pedos, they instead defend him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was his own decision to resign. Milo himself said he regrets the comments he made and breitbart condemned his comments as well. I&#39;m not arguing that what Milo said was okay. I&#39;m saying that this was a coordinated effort to bring Milo down. It&#39;s not hard to find something Milo has said and make it the news of the day that runs through AP and all the major news networks. This is what MSM is in the business of doing. Notice how when a huge story &quot;breaks&quot; every MSM headline is nearly identical. EVERYTHING runs through reuters or AP. It&#39;s not in breitbart&#39;s best interest to fight this, especially when they condemn the comments themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Milo said a disgusting thing. He is also a victim of pedophilia, who no doubt has tried to rationalize it alongside his flamboyant persona... it&#39;s messed up. I&#39;ve only ever supported Milo on the issue of free speech. I think some of his opinions are harsh.</p>

<p>I think Pizzagaters are angry that the MSM knows he&#39;s not a pedophile, yet has used his comments to distract from what the world should actually be looking at.... the stuff with Maher and Takei is just showing the hypocrisy behind the Milo attack... Pizzagaters are, and should be, only concerned with the real monsters.</p>

<p>Why do insist on changing the narrative like that? Literally no one is attacking Milo <em>because</em> he is a victim of child abuse.</p>

<p>They are attacking him for VERY CLEARLY advocating for sexual relationships between young teenagers and adults. Something that 99% of our society finds repugnant. </p>

<p>How is that hard to understand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason people (including myself) defend Milo is if because you watch the full interview and other press releases of his you can see he was talking about his own sexual abuse by a priest. If you don&#39;t believe me in the Huffington Post itself they talk about Milo&#39;s sexual abuse as a child:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Another man said, “You are advocating for cross generational relationships here, can we be honest about that?”</p>

<p>Milo: “Yeah, I don’t mind admitting that. I think particularly in the gay world and outside the Catholic church, if that’s where some of you want to go with this, I think in the gay world, some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys&quot;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;This sort of arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent, which totally destroys you know understanding that many of us have. The complexities and subtleties and complicated nature of many relationships. You know, people are messy and complex. In the homosexual world particularly. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can’t speak to their parents. &quot;</p>

<p><strong>Milo supports pedastry.</strong></p>

<p>Your false narrative doesn&#39;t hold up too well. It&#39;s tragic and unfair that Milo was abused as a child. But that doesn&#39;t make it OK for him to say that other teenagers should be abused.</p>
