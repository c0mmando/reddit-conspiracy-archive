        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: I am an Australian that does not support Trump, or Hillary. I am simply posting because I am annoyed at the idea of propaganda becoming the norm on reddit due to shills. I am using the political issue as an example.</p>

<p>As I&#39;m sure you have all noticed, Trump is getting a lot of negative feedback in the media due to his actions, and much of this negative feedback is posted on reddit. I am not debating whether he is making justified actions as president or not.</p>

<p>My problem, is that every day I open up reddit, and within the top 5-10 spots on r/all there is at least one negative Trump post from the sea of anti-Trump subreddits that seem to be popping up overnight. </p>

<p>A brief look at most of the accounts posting the negative feedback or links shows quite clearly they post negative Trump content on a daily basis, occasionally posting in other subreddits (most probably to not seem suspicious). Many of these accounts are over a year old.</p>

<p>Has reddit really got to the point of allowing shills to control the narrative? I get that Trump doesn&#39;t seem to be making great decisions but i doubt people are going to post all day every day without some kind of financial or ulterior motive. I am also sure that this happens in a much wider scope than merely anti-Trump posting.</p>

<p>The site that I love seems to have become a giant political shit-fest that does not even come close to the original idea of allowing general users to decide top content with votes.</p>

<p>It is quite possible the admins are in on this or at the very least aware of it and are deciding not to take action for one reason or another.</p>

<p>I am interested to hear others thoughts on this topic (assuming I am not shadow banned or this post is deleted).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree that the manipulation is all about the Benjamins. If it was wouldn&#39;t they just allow it to operate naturally keeping the actual most popular items at the front instead of force feeding material that that actually isn&#39;t popular but fringe topics?  I think the manipulation has more to do with an agenda than straight up ad revenue.  That agenda may lead to more income in a round about way but it wouldn&#39;t make sense to have all this manipulation to increase viewer count.</p>

<p>We can put laws on advertising and restrictions on marketing, and we&#39;ve successfully done so in the past. And for argument&#39;s sake, the &quot;narrative police&quot; would be enforceable legal repercussions. </p>

<p>We have to expect more out of ourselves and others, but at the moment there are no negative consequences that one faces for artificially pushing information into the social media narrative. </p>

<p>Notice that I did not say that there should be consequences for pushing artificial information, as that is our first amendment right to say whatever we want, wherever we want, even if we know it&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>But there could be consequences for &quot;artificially pushing&quot; that information. Vote manipulation, comment-bots, native advertising... we could regulate and restrict those types of actions, <strong>IF</strong> (big, bold &quot;if&quot;) we had a government that was in any way interested in legislating in the interests of the people. </p>

<p>Currently, we do not have that, thus we can be assured that any legislation that attempts to control the flow of information on the internet, or other media outlets, will be beneficial solely to the corporate interests that currently own and operate our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2016, America has <strong><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/">11.1 million</a></strong> unauthorized/illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>Of those, <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/unauthorized-immigrants/">3.1 million</a> live in states with ID requirements to vote (AZ/GA/KA/KS/IN/MS/ND/OH/TN/TX/WI), which leaves <strong>8.0 million</strong> <em>possible</em> unauthorized adult voters.</p>

<p>Of those, <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/reports/107.pdf">12.6%</a> are unauthorized children, which leaves <strong>7.0 million</strong> <em>possible</em> unauthorized adult voters.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume (as Trump does) that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2017/01/25/donald-trump-claims-none-of-those-3-to-5-million-illegal-votes-were-cast-for-him-zero/">100% voted Clinton</a> and <a href="http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/864793780">0% had rejected ballots</a>.)</p>

<p>Therefore, according to Trump, <strong>between 42.9% and 71.4%</strong> of unauthorized adults -- who live in utter fear that authorities will notice them -- registered and voted fraudulently. (Whereas <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/voter-turnout-2016-elections/">just 58%</a> of Americans voted.) And not a <em>single one</em> was reported for doing so: there were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/01/0-000002-percent-of-all-the-ballots-cast-in-the-2016-election-were-fraudulent/?utm_term=.900788866f87">just four</a> verified cases of voter fraud this election -- three of them for Trump.</p>

<p>And perhaps more importantly: After orchestrating the illegal votes of 3-5 million adults, Democrats <em>forgot</em> to put them in Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>TLDR: 3-5 million illegal votes sounds <em>really</em> plausible, Mr. Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thought out response. Id maybe argue about how successful we have been in putting laws and restrictions on advertising, but you already acknowledge half of my argument. That most of the laws or restrictions benefit corporate interests. The other part is that the more restrictions we put on advertising, the more creative they get. An example would be product placement in movies and entertainment. My argument is this advertising is even more effective because many of us don&#39;t even realize we are being subjected to an ad. We let down the normal filters or guard that we would have in place when being subjected to a regular commercial.</p>

<p>I have no faith that in a capitalist country that our government will ever put the peoples interest in front of a corporations. That is why my solution is to educate consumers and put peer pressure on ad execs and marketing companies. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree with this. I just didn&#39;t agree with the implication that the onslaught of internet brigading isn&#39;t something that could be addressed legislatively. It absolutely <em>can</em> be, and I believe that it <em>should</em> be, but unfortunately, our government is made up of corporate puppets. Until that is resolved, I question the intentions and motives of any and every piece of legislation flowing through DC.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really curious what you think of r/the_donald. Do you think they&#39;re pure of heart, <a href="http://heatst.com/world/how-russias-twitter-bots-and-trolls-work-with-donald-trump-campaign-accounts/">or are they shills too</a>? </p>

<p>In a recent poll, <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/02/americans-now-evenly-divided-on-impeaching-trump.html">46% of Americans said they want to impeach Trump</a>--and it&#39;s not even clear that he&#39;s done anything impeachable yet. </p>

<p>I like how you&#39;re boldly repeating Trump&#39;s sourceless crybabying as fact. </p>

<p>Did Trump also have the biggest inauguration of all time and win the electoral college by more than anyone since Reagan? Is the murder rate higher than it&#39;s ever been, as the president stated despite statistical data saying the exact opposite? Was unemployment at 40% during Obama&#39;s administration? Are women allowed to get abortions the day before the baby is due?</p>

<p>You&#39;re simultaneously saying &quot;more than half of all illegals in the country voted exclusively for Hillary Clinton illegally and not a single one of them got caught&quot; and when pressed with the fact that you have literally zero evidence to support this, you say &quot;Well no one really knows...&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say that the lack of evidence one way or the other means that it&#39;s equally likely for this outlandish thing you&#39;re claiming to be true or not true.</p>

<p>Basic logic dictates that outlandish claims <em>must</em> be assumed to be false <em>unless</em> there is credible evidence supporting said claim. Assuming outlandish shit is true despite lack of evidence guarantees that you believe a lot of ridiculously false things to be true.</p>

<p>Literal Translation: illegal aliens voted, and so many of them voted that it&#39;s possible for Trump&#39;s 3 million voter deficit to have been made up by them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I claim the fact are system is broken and we have no idea how many illegals voted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying &quot;I don&#39;t know for certain&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that every single possibility is equally likely. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;It could have been no illegal aliens voting, it could have been 5 million of them&quot; puts each of those statements on an equal standing when we know for a fact that they are not. Even if illegal aliens voting was <em>rampant</em>, which there is no evidence for, it would still be ridiculously unlikely that their amount of votes would be that high.</p>

<p>If you apply <em>basic logic</em> to your thinking, you would be able to assign probabilities to things you don&#39;t know and determine whether they are <em>likely</em> or <em>unlikely</em>. And if something is <em>ridiculously unlikely</em>, and you have no evidence to support it at all, then basic logic dictates that you originally assume it to be false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it should be obvious to anyone that its all fabricated outrage, that if one takes a completely objective look at what Trump has done and said so far, there is nothing near worthy of the outrage he has been reaching. </p>

<p>This is exactly like the fringe community who, when Obama was elected, screamed non-stop about how he&#39;ll establish a socialist caliphate. Now this once fringe group has spread and become mainstream, with all the backing from the establishment, the entertainment industry and the MSM. The new message is that Trump&#39;s a fascist who will establish a totalitarian state where minorities are sent off to the gas chambers. </p>

<p>Zoom in on the crowd. It is completely full.  The photos presented to you by the media showed two different times. Obama&#39;s photo was taken during the speech while Trump&#39;s was taken hours before his speech.  There were also gates shut down due to protesters which led to a slower fill up of the site.  </p>

<p>Oh come the fuck on. Were you around in 2009? There wasn&#39;t a &quot;fringe&quot; community against Obama--there was a much-hyped &quot;Tea Party&quot; movement that lit up Congressional town halls the summer after Obama was in office--and his approval rating was significantly better than Trump&#39;s at that point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly worth the uproar being raised over this. The Republic can withstand bad, weak, ineffectual, even morally corrupt leadership. The real threat is when the bureaucracy is bad, weak, ineffectual, and even morally corrupt. Which it is.</p>

<p>Just consider; however unusual or abnormal you find Trump, impeaching him AND ousting him would be unprecedented. You&#39;re just playing into someone&#39;s game to fan the flames. And that someone isn&#39;t Trump.</p>

<p>The word any is really vague. It calls to mind the Flynn resignation. There was nothing there; it was all just intimidation and political pressure, and the American public was left upwards of a week assuming Flynn had somehow negotiated a contract whereby Russia hacked the election.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to impeachment and ouster if the truth warrants it.</p>

<p>But I would want to see the evidence. If we&#39;re asked to support impeachment based on allegations, rumor, innuendo, and evidence we&#39;re forbidden from seeing because &quot;lol natsec,&quot; I cannot support impeachment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that last bit which I think is going to be the problem here, and given that the narrative is already pushing an emotional and irrational response on this, I strongly suspect we the people will never see one shred of credible proof of Trump&#39;s alleged &quot;guilt.&quot;</p>

<p>No, Trump is literally one of the worst and most dangerous presidents in living memory. </p>

<p>He informs himself with partisan cable news while ignoring security briefings. He appointed a white supremacist as his chief adviser and  lets him run the show. He has done more damage to the US&#39;s international relations in the month he has been office than we&#39;ve seen in decades. </p>

Nothing but a bunch of puppets for the PTB.<br/>
Also, virtually all liberals were opposed to the Obama Administration after his first term. The people who supported the Obama Administration into the second term were the MSM-brainwashed centrists &amp; new-age fascists.<br/>
A lot of people think their <em>I ♥ LGBT</em> T-shirts make them liberals. They couldn&#39;t be more wrong.</p>

<p>Then I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re naive. Anything trump gets clicks and we all know how people in this website will do stupid shit simply for karma, not money, karma. Sure maybe there are a couple accounts getting paid to submit anti-trump links or a couple accounts that are doing so to gain street creed and be able to sell their account or their services to those organization paying to spread anti trump links, but I believe most anti-trump links on the top of r/all got there because people upvote that shit genuinely. </p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that the dude is the most hated president on recent history and doesn&#39;t even have 2 months in the white house, not to mention the fact that he lost the popular vote, not to mention the fact that most people that voted for him don&#39;t frequent this website, not to mention the fact that he has been a controversial figure for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has always pushed a narrative, that&#39;s what it&#39;s here for. They pushed atheism and good old gay marriage. Atheism was a default sub for a while and every other damn post started off with &quot;I&#39;m an atheist.&quot; Then they all patted themselves on the back and started a new religion based on anti-religion.</p>

<p>Gay marriage had it&#39;s poster boy NPH. So many top posts of pictures of him, his husband, and their kids with titles like &quot;this is what a real family looks like&quot; etc.... Also anything by the creepy old George Takai. </p>

<p>None of this is surprising if you pay attention to how they operate. They try to push their website as a community and that somehow redditors are better than others. Everyone thinks this way, if you don&#39;t there&#39;s something wrong and you must be harassed until you see things the hive minds way.</p>

<p>They are very much aware of it; to the point that the CEO thought it would be funny to modify user posts directly within the database, on a thread that was later used in (I recall) the Washington Post to paint an anti Trump narrative within T_D sub.</p>

<p>Not the only time they have tinkered with this site for their own narrative, fatpeoplehate went along with a few more subs because people are too immature to use close a tab and ignore sites/subs they do not like (ad revenue being the reasoning, good luck though considering ad block plus and similar add-ons).</p>

<p>Then there was the questionable events around the closure of pizzagate that I&#39;ve collated a few pieces of into a short post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v6p4y/milo_yiannopolous_disinvited_to_cpac_after/de09tmx/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Reddit as you know it, mate, is not the same as Aaron Swartz intended on its foundation. The rest of the board are just along for the ride and we are in limbo as a viable alternative is made that can handle the web traffic (same as what happened to another site prior to Reddit, Digg).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re showing a fundamental lack of understanding about this past election. People didn&#39;t all of a sudden begin loving Hillary Clinton. For most people, this was an election of voting against person you hated the most.  Did you think liberals would just vote for someone who had a running mate like Mike Pence? You need to take a step back and be a little objective about the situation.</p>

<p>Thus my disclaimer/signature, no matter how many times it triggers people. See my post history, I cop a few down votes and occasional flak from people too emotionally invested in this site.</p>
