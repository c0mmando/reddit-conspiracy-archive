        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before his forced stay, his hair was freshly cut and uncolored. After the stay, he has a few inches of &#39;fro, and a stark blonde patch over his frontal lobe. Possible electro shock manipulation? Can that even cause hair growth? (I would assume the reverse would happen, scorched hair &amp;/or burns/lesions)
Also, do you believe he is breaking his programming? Several high ranking celebrities have, whether by accident or deliberately, broken their programming only to seemingly &#39;lash out&#39; (literally coming back to their own mind, where they were left before disassociating due to programming imo) &amp; then taken to UCLA only to come out a week later zombiefied and drained. Brittany, Lindsey, Amanda, even Justin Bieber had an outburst period where he had off the wall  mannerisms &amp; actions, only he didn&#39;t go to UCLA, he had a short stay in jail.
Scott Mescudi (kid cudi) has been battling &#39;internal&#39; demons for years and shortly before Kanye&#39;s outburst mentioning him &amp; Scott being the &#39;aliens&#39; Mark Zuckerburg went looking for, re admitted himself under suicide watch.
I think there are forces working for good just as much as bad, and I think the elite are getting sloppy and aren&#39;t caring about keeping the puppets well kept enough for them to keep their mouth shut and not out the programming that still continues. Your thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think dude was just under a lot of pressure. He has just finished 30+ shows and signed on and started 30 more. Also, his whole brand requires him to rant at concerts and the crowd cheers and records when he does this. This causes a cycle of him trying to gain recognition from the crowds by ranting whatever comes to mind and constantly trying to one up himself. This is very evident if you&#39;ve ever been to one of his concerts. </p>

<p>Also he&#39;s talked a lot about the pressures of celebrity. As far as the hair growth, he was away from the media for more than enough time to grow his hair naturally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never attended his shows, and I actually was very against him and the way he portrayed himself. I felt before the outburst he played hard on occult symbolism, trying to promote it almost, along with Jay Z and Beyonc√©. Make it cool, issue it subconsciously through branding, and gain a following that didn&#39;t even understand they were wearing occult symbols. And then his outburst.... it changed my mind completely. I felt as if who he was in the beginning of his career has been totally flushed, and a new, disassociated version of himself took its place. His occult album art and the songs on it took on a new meaning after he directly insulted everything he was built on in his infamous rant. I truly believe he may be trying to alert the few who will listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree i believe Kayne really lost his way and was lashing out the best way he knew how, i just know something sinister is going on behind the scenes with all mainstream music. Its a trip brainwashing the masses is what its about and then we he turns on them boom reprogrammed. AHHH its just a trip the more and more you read into this all the rabbit hole goes deep!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something definitely happened to him after speaking out. I think the UCLA / reprogramming story makes a lot of sense given all that we now know about this now. The Kardashians are probably also used as tools in a celebrity psi-op program, which would explain the non-stop media saturation with them.</p>

<p>I also think there is a possibility that the most famous and most influential people could be subjects of human cloning... </p>

<p>just look at the events of 9/11/16, where Hillary collapse at the 911 Memorial - her death was reported on the news - Then she reappears later in the day with a completely different body type and face. <a href="https://youtu.be/lD7-naYIDyA">https://youtu.be/lD7-naYIDyA</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, you&#39;re into something with the cloning theory. 
But I am firm in my belief that MK programming is continued at UCLA. Justin did a good job of staying out of that joint, but couldn&#39;t get away from legal trouble (which in the cases of these people is MUCH better than a forced UCLA stay) He went in, then came out and acted as Micheal Jackson did, and spoke eerily of his charges and the way the media portrayed him during he time. He has since teetered back and fourth between secrecy and publicity, deleting his instagram and covering himself with Christian images and words. Maybe he is trying to defend himself against reprogramming? He&#39;s worked closely with Scott and Kanye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One aspect of this I don&#39;t see mentioned is that he was <a href="http://www.vogue.com/article/kanye-west-gosha-rubchinskiy-moscow-russia">in Russia</a> a few days before. If I was less suspicious, he biggest challenge would have been jetlag, but in this case, I think he received some information in Russia; something that really bothered him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know that bit of information, thank you for that. Who in Russia do you speculate he could be meeting, and what kind of information? As an entertainer I don&#39;t see who of high stature could be giving him such detrimental information that he feel the need to whistle blow &amp; cause himself such a debt to pay by losing the rest of his contracted shows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright as an artist myself I think its ridiculous how many people think celebrities are &quot;programmed&quot;. Sure they might know some shit they don&#39;t expose for fear of brand destruction, however some may be just as ignorant as another person. Have you ever met a celebrity? I dont even like the term celebrity cause its literally just a person with a creative outlet who has built a platform. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he got MKULTRA&#39;d in a sense at UCLA because he did come out acting funny but I think itnwas probably more of a distrust and disapointment/paranoia of the people around him for letting him go through that. Who knows what really happened in there for sure though. Loads artists are awake and aware and loads of artists are simply sheep making a living off talent. These are literally regular people with a spot light on them, average people? No but just regular people. Shit I could share my music here and people would like it but people would still make their own assumptions about programming and shit.</p>
