       I saw her at an urban highschool and it was held in a gymnasium. Not nearly as many people as at the Bernie rally and not nearly as outwardly policed as the RNC. There was def big time security there though and a whole lot of apathetic journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music was blasting and they made us wait through several bouts of it while people like Ted Strickland rocked the mic.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were originally pulling people from the crowd personally to stock the stands immediately behind Hillary (ViP). I sat in corner stands and somehow managed to get an American flag to wave. Got bored with it though and gave it away. Mostly ppl were apathetic as usual, other than the full-time Democrats. The highschool classes in the stands were like "lolwut?" Being mostly stocked with young cholos, white trash, and other such inner city youth groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the rally was over everyone just breathed a collective sigh of relief and farted. Then Hillary's weather machine kicked into action and I got wet waiting for my ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my story of my participation in American democracy. All in all the RNC was funner.

       Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the 'news' on the radio this morning was speaking about her coughing fit in a positive light!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what they said, and I shit you not:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the US, Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has had
        <em>
         another
        </em>
        one of her
        <em>
         famous
        </em>
        coughing fits. Part way through the untimely cough, she managed to tell everyone the reason it was happening &lt;plays the clip of her saying shes allergic to Trump&gt;.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was all said in a positive, comedic frame. Like oh shes got such a good sense of humour, shes such a good lady. Famous coughing fit? I could not fucking believe it. Can you imagine what they'd say if it was Trump having a cough seizure on stage.

       I saw her in Cleveland two Hillaries ago and the two ladies next to me were doing crossword puzzles. Other than that pretty normal.
They encouraged people to stand behind her and hold signs. People in general get pretty pumped at the idea. 15 minutes of fame, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       TV makes people subconsciously think: hey if I can get on TV, I'm big-time just like Hillary!
      </p>
      <p>
       [Oh and one thing I noticed: at those rallys they blast loud pop music while you awkwardly wait to see the candidate. Anything to disrupt your brainwaves.]

       CTR doesn't come in to this sub unless the post gets a lot of upvotes. I think this is because they'll see posts in this sub on their front page or on r/all, but none of them bother coming to this sub in particular and that's the only way they'd be able to find this relatively small self-post.
