        weird fact, the name of the video is "storefront-trigger-video-3931.mp4"

       <p>
        Another edit: at this point I am just guessing, a search for 3931 yields several results including addresses, flights and a
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3931">

       <p>
        I could not find any metadata on the video or the images that the website uses. It is interesting that the logo used as a poster image on the video only uses 3 colors (gray, white and black) while the tiny logo at the top left of the page uses 5 (3 shades of gray, white and black). Black is not actually completely black, it is just very dark gray. The image logo.png is exactly 255 bytes.

        Fun fact: the CSS of that website is using some clever tricks to fix display issues on Internet Explorer for Mac (that browser is as old as time and nobody else uses it anymore).

       So first of all, I'm a coder for web.  I would NEVER put shit like that in a javascript unless it's meant to be seen.   Posting their conversation...I mean, hows that happen?  They are trying to write a screenplay inside of js comments (also, why not using a coment block instead of single line comments...sloppy).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's highly unprofessional to the point that no one does this type of thing.  They are building a narrative.  This is like a lame version of the blair witch project in javascript nerd form.  The nerdshill project.

      <p>
       My suspicion is that this whole thing itself is a psychological operation to spook you.

       Obviously,  bc I am an avid Nosleep user, I will be totally OOC.
The author of the Story decided to write about a company.  To make the company seem even more realistic,  he made a website which includes a creepy video, and an option to sign up.
This is common - many writers on Nosleep produce other layers of media to further develop the World they are writing about - videos of ghost sightings,  pics of creepy places, multiple accounts posting within the same universe etc.
THIS user had the knowledge and resources to create a cool video as well as a cheap website, therefore leading more credence to his post. 
Ta da.

       It's really, really not. The site itself is 16 days old and extremely simplistic in terms of design and framework; a company looking to actually reach a broad audience would more likely be using something like Bootstrap to design their site. Between the coding and the Trebuchet font, this site is out of the mid-late 2000s and probably took about 20min for the person to make, tops. Another poster has already linked to the template that was actually used, cutting the time to make everything down to virtually nil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is a lot of repeating frames, visually speaking, so again not too difficult. The "demonic" frames may seem threatening, but they're not: it's mostly Kabbalic symbolism... the Tree of Life has had a heptagram (symbolising perfection, because it has 7 points and the earth was created in 7 days) superimposed on it. Behind that there is a generic Semitic script.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video quality is too poor for me to read, but it looks to be a part of the Dead Sea Scrolls that has had the colour inverted. I might be able to tell you what part it is specifically if a better quality version appears, but at this point I am willing to bet the farm that it is either Psalms, the Book of Isaiah or the Temple Scroll since they're so heavily photographed; if the creator was/is particularly dedicated and knowledgable, it might be the Apocryphon of Daniel. At this point, I'm not entirely convinced s/he even created that particular segment, being that documentaries concerning the "apocalyptic" nature of the Dead Sea Scrolls are a dime a dozen compared to actual scholarly archaeological/theological analyses of the literature (spoiler alert: it's no more or less apocalyptic than any other religious literature, and is a lot of the same stories you can read in a Bible printed yesterday).
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, all the resources used here are free, readily available. An experienced individual might be able to churn out a finished product like you're seeing in an hour or so.

       I hate to burst any bubbles of dreams here, but this is nothing more than an elaborate /nosleep story.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this was an awesome effort for a NS story, it would have been much more believable if they didn't try to sell Gray and Dean Research as one of the nation's leading research institute around since the 1900s, but rather as a new research institute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are several reasons to support this story being fiction:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are zero search results for "Gray and Dean Research" outside of their own website.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Per Whois, the domain was created on August 19, 2016. An institute 116 years old just got around to creating a website two weeks ago?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The copy on the website is not remotely professional, but regardless, the website is a straight copy of a free design template (including the main image and the "logo"!) found all over the web:
         <a href="http://all-free-download.com/free-website-templates/download/business_design_2007_template_1141.html">
          http://all-free-download.com/free-website-templates/download/business_design_2007_template_1141.html
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       (So two developers spent all that time having chats back and forth, but used a plug and play template?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are many more points, but these were my main three from a quick view of their website, a reverse image search and a Whois search.

       While I personally believe it's somewhere in the middle, I lean closer to fiction, probably a simple plot to troll a bunch of people with emails and fake phone calls. They definitely are going a bit far, and phone numbers and emails can go a long way.. let's hope it's fake though.

       This is a very elaborate troll for emails. Yea, it's no sleep, yea, it's obviously staged, cause the account that posted it has comments like 'OMG! I love cats!' But there's much easier ways to troll for emails.

       I surely hope it's not what it advertises either, but you have to admit this all does seem a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       bit overkill. It's almost like they're looking for a really specific kind of person. Coming to Reddit in the first place, having the reputation of having 'isolated young males' already kind of makes this really weird. I'm not saying I believe it's for hypnosis, but whatever they're trying to pull here seems a little out of the ordinary for just a cheap email scam.

       Forgive me if this post is not allowed, but: This is obviously the rabbit hole for an old-school ARG (alternate reality game), a la ilovebees/The Beast. For more information about ARGs, I recommend unfiction as a good place to start! It's got lots of good tools to help decode tricky stuff hiding in-game. Enjoy! :)

       What's making people doubt that the story is fictional is that there's an actual website, professional and all, along with a weird video that would take a long time to make. I don't think OP would go to all this trouble just for his nosleep story.

       I've been subbed in nosleep a long time. There are a number of people that have jump started their writing careers from there (which provides financial incentive). There are some submitters that have put probably hundreds of hours of work into the stuff they have submitted over the years. Don't let the amount of work threshold be what convinces you this is different because it isn't.

       This is seems to be at least a little true. Multiple people have gotten phone calls:
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude lets all become blacked out hypnotized murdering psychopaths together &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;3
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Edit 7:I know you have all been waiting patiently, and god knows I have been impatiently waiting by my phone all night but still no call, now I did want to swing by to reveal a little more info. Apparently not everyone got accepted. Now I am trying to ponder over what makes them decide who gets accepted. Is it random? Also I didn't sleep well last night. I had a nightmare that we drove off the top of a casino in Vegas and I just watched from the back seat as we plummeted to earth and I woke up before it hit. Now listen I am the type to leave that shit to coincidence buuuuuut I don't get nightmares. The last nightmare I had was probably 4 years ago after my mom died sooooo, I am feeling wierd about the whole situation. Whelp now to stare at my phone and hope today is the day. To all of you following this, thanks for the support pray I don't die
Edit 8: ok I'm officially freaked the fuck out. Got a call and they said Sean and gray research blah blah stay on the line, then I hear a wierd voice saying all these weird things that sound like a tape going backwards and then at the end the guy says "shopkeeper are you there" (brief pause) goodbye. I am not even sure what to say, I am not even sure how this is research at all, and I am at a store dear god I hope I don't black out man I'm in public will get home in a bit then I will read my email to see if it says anything, along with check the website. I'm so scared
Edit 9: ok so I didn't go on a mass murdering rampage or black out or anything, so that's a plus, but I haven't heard from them since either. I am not sure what to do at this point because my instructions were answer the call, yet the call was a bunch of wierd shit. For now I wait for day 3 and hopefully a chance to know more about this strange research and the "compensation" . Love peace and chicken grease I'll see ya tomorrow

       story, other people have reported phone calls too.

       Edit: is the thing I made a little broken for anyone else?(I think it'd be a codeblock, I don't format stuff on reddit too often
       <br/>
       Edit2: Should be fixed now
