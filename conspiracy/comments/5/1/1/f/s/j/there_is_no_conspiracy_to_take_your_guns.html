       You're getting a lot of shit which means you must have really struck a chord. Obama is literally the best thing that has happened to the gun industry in quite some time. If that doesn't make you pause and think then I'm not sure anything will. Why is the right wing media and the NRA using fear and lies to help set record gun sales?

       If there is they're doing a shit job of it gen in all reality it wouldn't be hard.  They could do it in a day if they actually wanted.  Let people have all the guns they want, it's constitutional.  Instead make the selling and manufacturing as well as ownership of ammo illegal.  Constitution doesn't say shit about ammo!  But they won't even talk about a solution like that because it would work.

       If Obammy was trying to take your guns, well he's had 8 years to do so and he still ain't done it.  Some truly non sense regulations to keep up appearances, but nothing meaningful.  It's like they're not even trying!!

       Obama already tried to get Hitlery Clinton to sign an arms trade agreement within the United Nations that would ban gun sales between countries.  However, the house still had some balls at that time and reminded the president he didn't have power of treaty.

       Anyone who thinks that, at this point, the US can somehow be made free of guns in private hands, is a complete gibbering simpleton. They COULD make millions of people into criminals overnight by making their guns illegal, which would be very handy for getting rid of undesirables later in "no knock" 3AM raids.

       Sheeit.  If it's some sort of ploy from the NRA to sell more guns, then by golly,
       <em>

       You're half right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an agenda towards disarmament of the general world population.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy in the US is different. The plan is to fill the powderkeg till it overflows and then hit it with a flamethrower.
      </p>
      <p>
       America's Civil War II will facilitate the invasion of the US by a multilateral group of our "allies" under the pretext of restoring democracy. Really it'll just be a chance to make a lot of money by doing to the US what the US has done to its colonies for the past century.

       Blood will run in the streets meanwhile the elite will be in their golden palaces abroad or in luxury bomb shelters below ground playing the latest iteration of call of duty that's been linked up to mind controlled cybermen... And I've gone of my rocker.

       It could be so.
They have plenty of ways of killing you from way afar and en-mass. Your guns are toys. It would only help the police state incoming to do its thing, but when all the cards will be out a gunned rebel army will be of no consequence.

       That's one thing people don't seem to understand.  It doesn't matter how many guns and bullets you have,  they have more.  And drones.  And tanks.  And snipers.  And Gernades.  Your ar or ak ain't shit to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fear of losing guns works well.  In the comments above people are writing me off, even aggressive about how wrong they think I am.  These are the same people they call others sheep, never realizing they are already brain washed.  The program is a smashing success.  You'd think I said the earth is flat, hollow,  ran by lizard wizards, and made if cream cheese after reading how some people react.  Truly ironic.
