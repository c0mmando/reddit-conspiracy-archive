    <div class="md"><p>I was gonna open a thread about this same thing. There&#39;s been tremendous controversy here in Puerto Rico over the government wanting to spray naled to fend off the mosquitoes. There&#39;s been a huge outcry against it and AFAIK, the chemical was already in the island ready to be sprayed. My mother described a strong smell that went through her throat and made get nauseous, the smell same suddenly. We&#39;re both inclined to believe they&#39;re spraying and not telling anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please listen to me, fellow colony brother. I&#39;m from Guam, where the US still denies using agent orange, though we now have literally one of the most toxic places in the world, rising cancer rates, many many deaths directly related to this. </p>

<p>THEY WILL LIE. They will spray it on fed and mil land without telling you, as well. They will kill your asses for fun, believe me. They will spray it near water sources and it will poison everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are US citizens. The difference is that we are indigenous, so we get treated just like Native Americans. </p>

<p>What happens to towns, cities, states, it really doesn&#39;t compare at all, like you think it might, but we are treated FAR worse. We are killed at a FAR higher rate. Look at us or the Navajo to see the difference. Our rates of cancer and neurological disease dwarf yours, just like our suicide rates. This is not a coincidence, it&#39;s a literal genocide. </p>

<p>To compare us to you is to not know the facts, as unfortunate as it is (for us). What is happening to us has never happened to you, I promise. Flint is the garden of Eden compared to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just follow the link I put in my OP. That&#39;s only half of it, though. They started mass spraying DDT since the end of WWII. This whole island is toxic. </p>

<p>Furthermore we are the biggest target in Asia, again because of the US military. My grandparents spent 3+ years under japanese occupation, and NK always shouts us out. China and Russia both do fly-bys on Guam (just like the Japanese did before they attacked.). They fucked our whole shit up and tell us to be happy because they freed us from a situation that only happened because of their occupation. </p>

<p>Beyond that, the US killed more chamorros, at a higher rate, than Japanese concentration camps and slave labor did. I swear, we think about which caves are closest to us in case of emergency, because we know the US will let us die.  </p>

<p>TLDR: if this wasn&#39;t my ancestors home, and I had a choice, I would have got the fuck out of dodge a long time ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate how people use his ignorance to cover their own. This adds nothing to the discussion besides showing how dumb your own (our, lol) country is. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s actually a great metaphor for what is about to happen when those marines arrive. The strain on our utilities will sink us, and the insane money they make for housing totally fucks up the market for locals.</p>

<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist, but that was spun so fucking well for the military. Now every time we try to tell people how bad it will be, they just bring that up and the subject is derailed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my area, it is supposed to be *announced&quot;. </p>

<p>What a joke! They sprayed by truck and the next night all the community and kids were rolling and laying in the grass.</p>

<p>May I ask you a simple question while taking your serious concerns in hand? </p>

<p>That shit lingers for days but the <em>Authorities</em> will not release the latent effects?</p>

<p>DDT? Anyone...?</p>

<p>Do you spray your Lawn and Sidewalk like a Weekend Warrior with really nasty advertised Weed Killers and Lawn Warrior Spray Bottles, from the Big Box Advertising? The Trusted Name Brands? </p>

<p>If you do this , you&#39;re most likely dispersing ever greater  chemical toxins to yourself, your loved ones, your community. </p>

<p>&quot;Big Travel&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Big Water</em>.</p>

<p>Same I saw last night...</p>

<p>Glyphosate shows up in prime American Wine Country? Impacts the Vintners Local and Global Sales.</p>

<p>Same toxin shows up in breast milk, feed the kids <em>canned processed powdered milk</em>!</p>

<p>Forgive me if I&#39;m off base and wrong but your post has my short hairs on alert!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of my city&#39;a green areas get sprayed with crap regularly during the warmer months. The same little warning sign appearing on lawns all over, from the same company. What a killer racket that must be.</p>

<p>I can barely breathe walking by those sites. You&#39;re supposed stay off of those areas for a week, same with <em>all</em> areas after the regular mosquito blanketings we get. Of course people dont stay off those areas, and of course all the wildlife ignores those warnings.</p>

<p>Really just disgusting, all of it.</p>
