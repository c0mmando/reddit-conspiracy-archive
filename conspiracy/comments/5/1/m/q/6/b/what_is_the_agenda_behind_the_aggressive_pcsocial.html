    <div class="md"><p>Seems like I&#39;ve struck a nerve. I&#39;ll adress your points one by one.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter</p>

<p>One bit of evidence is that it is mentioned often on conservative sites and not so much by the primary media outlets. </p>

<p>Not true. Mainstream media in inherently left leaning. Even fox news has been sliding more center and this election cycle shows that complete media bias.</p>

<p>Another is/was the announcement that the Republican party was engaging in a big effort to gather votes from the African American community and that effort involves two approaches: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>separate the AA vote from the Democratic Party,</p></li>
<li><p>divide the AA vote. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Part one I agree part two not so much the only people dividing the African American people in this situation are the Democrats by supporting the entitled millennial and socialist radicals and creating a victim culture. Also being the party of the KKK doesn&#39;t help matters.</p>

<p>BLM has been used to attack Democratic candidates and policies. </p>

<p>Rightfully so because the Democratic party is a big part of why things are the way they are for black people right now.</p>

<p>BLM is in conflict with the long standing methods for promoting a more inclusive and equal environment for POC. </p>

<p>This whole social justice idea is a problem right from the start. If &quot;POC&quot; deserve their social justice so do the Irish who at one point in time were treated as bad if not worse than &quot;POC&quot;
Social justice is bigoted idea. Not sure what this had to do with this being pushed by conservatives.</p>

<p>I also believe this is a program conservative Allen West is advancing, the division of the AA vote. </p>

<p>I showed you proof of the Soros connection please do the same.</p>

<p>It is no different than when way back in history, Nixon used racism to divide the white working class vote. </p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s like how LBJ started the downfall of the black community and made a giant portion of your country reliant on big government hand outs and I don&#39;t mean just black people there of course.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter is a deliberately provocative name and to some people it seems menacing and threatening for that reason, as we saw with the also created push back, All Lives Matter,(but white lives matter more) /s, </p>

<p>OK it&#39;s a provoactive name doesn&#39;t prove anything (accept for maybe your a racist). </p>

<p>The term Black for African American is almost exclusively used by conservatives writers, not as often from the few liberal pundits still allowed in the dialog. </p>

<p>Not true. Once again I don&#39;t see what this has to do with anything but I see all media using both 100 percent.</p>

<p>There is more, and you will claim the evidence is thin and I will agree and I will also note, the evidence that there is an organization with such a name being given millions of dollars of funding is non existent except as talk. </p>

<p>So what we are doing is exchanging opinions about the name.</p>

<p>*ore/more</p>

<p>I actually agree with you on this one but felt compelled to respond although when you see protesters holding signs that say #BLM that are professionally done at a print shop (come on even you know about paid protesters) someone is getting money.</p>

<p>Just for good measure here&#39;s an article from 2015 about BLM  protesters being made because they weren&#39;t getting the cheques promised to them by Soros funded groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No longer true, the Government had to set up a new program and it was added last min like to the ACA.  Why? </p>

<p>Because that summer of 2010 after the taxpayers bailed out the banks the banks refused to make new student loans. Guaranteed student loans. *typo</p>

<p>It was a crisis for students and the colleges and universities.</p>

<p>So what was Liz Warren and Bernie railing about then? The old loans and their old rates? And, if so, how stupid that the govt. doesn&#39;t just allow those old debts to get moved to govt. loans that pay off the old debts and move the debtors to a new and better rate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liz is quite anti-Obama, for one thing. </p>

<p>As for moving the existing loans back to the government  I don&#39;t think it will be an easy task to bully the Banks into surrendering  $1.2 Trillion in student debt.  Remember these loans were privatized from government direct loans to for guaranteed for profit loans way back in the 1980s. </p>

<p>or is this a sign of the times?</p>

<p>What does that even mean? Traditionalist values are universal and timeless because they are founded in physical reality. Political correctness and social justice are universal failures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it is a movement, who is funding it (you need money to do these things) and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jews; they hate Christianity and whites.</p>

<p>media and a few loud voices</p>

<p>Bingo!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history of the tension between European jews and European christians has been well documented. Jewish &quot;charities&quot; and organizations are the major culprit in pushing political correctness, pornography, immorality through the media, mass immigration and gun bans. If you would like to research it for yourself there are far more knowledgeable people out there then you will find in this comment section. They push these things on the US anr Europe but practice and encourag3 traditional values in Israel and their own communuties. The end game well if Americans stood strong and instilled traditional morals and principles in their people then the US would refuse to support Israel, and without our support Israel would dissappear.</p>

<p>Aww, the poor widdle progressives don&#39;t like it when the new right creates its own terms to describe their various insanities. The progs want to be the only ones able to make up new terms of derision and abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t like white nationalists either, I stopped believing in your cause when I started seeing the levels of both censorship and viciousness that are utilised against anyone who disagrees with you.  There is a lot about 4chan which can genuinely detrimentally affect my physical health if I spend too much time there; but the entire reason why that negative material is there, is because the one main difference between the Left and Right that I know of and have seen consistently here, is that the Right will not attempt to punish you for disagreeing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not you individually, no; but five years of Reddit has taught me well and truly to view the Left as the enemy, in collective terms.  I live with progressives offline, and granted they are extremely different to what I see on here; but the behaviour of the online Left have still made it very, very difficult for me to trust them.  I&#39;ve also never seen a group more fundamentally hateful, anywhere, than seperatist lesbians.</p>
