       I've heard horror stories about people who have come up with these tremendous breakthroughs with types of motors that don't require gas or improvements that made engines more efficient. Then, unknown peoples come and do their "legal black magic voodoo" and the idea disappeared never to see the light of day again.
      </p>

       I'm curious about what you have ever heard and what your thoughts on the matter are.

       When people talk about "them" "they" etc. It's hard for many to realize that "they" are comprised of
       <em>
        real people
       </em>
       <br/>
       You listen to some talk about an institution or system and you may have noticed that they're not really grasping the concept that it's a reality. There's not any humanized vilification. It's just... "them" . No documentation, just a vague acknowledgement.

       Just look at the stigma put on the electric vehicle market. You don't really need to look at the fringe topics to find the evidence of corruption in the energy market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how the US treats solar energy or off grid power production. We are currently living in a moment in time where solar cells are the cheapest and most efficient they have ever been yet there's no push from the government to move towards solar production for the private home owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only projects I've seen in the solar energy production market is from private investment groups and small scale production for use by local government.

       Depends on what you define as the "oil industry".
      </p>
      <p>
       The government makes more off oil than the companies, by far. Then you have the people like Rockefeller, Noble and the Rothschilds who made vast fortunes off oil. They influence the government heavily in many fields. I'd assume the vast amount of activity to inhibit alternative energies come from these two holders of the oil industry.

       In extreme and rare cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's much more institutionalized than that. Mark Twain went to Europe and saw the efficiency of masonry heaters and wrote about it. More than 100 years later, masonry heaters are rare in the US. They can reduce your fuel use by 1/3.
      </p>
      <p>
       A college I know not far from here was granted millions to work with solar panels, and multiple millions to make an energy course available as a trade. The panels cost more than getting electricity from the grid and don't do much good.
      </p>
      <p>
       For less money and effort, they could have encouraged the schools to teach masonry heater courses, subsidized some machinery, encouraged competition making firebricks and reduced fuel use by 2/3s.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the government will never do that. The more expensive a solution, the better the government likes it. As long as it keeps you dependent on the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In situations like Tesla, the government will be sending men in black suits. But in most cases:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. no one will fund the projects,
      </p>
      <p>
       b. self-funded projects leave people poor and desperate (willing to sell out cheaply to a major company who can then bury the tech),
      </p>
      <p>
       c. aren't properly educated in the first place.

       They buy politicians and PR firms, sponsor scientists, hire others to discredit inconvenient science, buy patents and bury them, bully journalists.  Oil money starts wars.   Oil money is behind the nuclear energy panic.  And whatever Big Oil wants, Big Defense is right on board with them, because they run on oil and profit from the oil wars.

       I know its so sad. They "fixed" the city center because thats where the money comes in with tourism but the rest of N.O. they have let rot. The 9th ward is horrible -- and this isn't the first time in the history of N.O. that they've LET the 9th ward flood and then did nothing. Early in the 1900s they had a hurricane coming in and they were going to lose downtown to flooding....so what do the assholes do? They decide that part of town is too important and purposely breached the levees near the 9th ward so it would flood there instead of downtown and then once again proceeded to offer no help. Sad, sad, sad.

       I had a friend that said he knew someone that discovered something and then was intimidated into stopping his research. I didn't follow up to learn much about the guy though, so all I have is hearsay also when it comes to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting topic though. The oil industry is absolutely terrible for the environment. Alternatives, exist and yet they aren't as mainstream as they should be.

       That's similar to a conversation I had with someone. They knew a guy who had a brilliant concept and was then approached by "them" and bring naive sold his ideas which were buried. Once he realized this they intimidated him and threatened legal ruin if he pursued further etc.etc.
      </p>

       My friend who told me the story ended up making a scaled down version of the original design, and just like the old man claimed, the engine worked... Perfectly. The guy was old by then (this took place in the late 80s early 90s) said if he had it to do over again he would have taken his chances and fought to succeed. 
It's a calamity how many world altering innovations are buried and shelved by corporate machines.

       Iirc; guy builds engine that runs on fucking WATER. She'll oil was offering him millions, but he knew they were going to shelve his design so he refused.

       Holy shit, I went to recheck his wiki page to see the exact cause of death, suicide or o.d. But the Wikipedia page has been stripped down to almost nothing. Wow. Good luck finding anything, dude.

       Seriously though; next time the question is posed "who is Jon galt?" Offer the answer of Tom ogle.

       Are you aware that certain types of efficiencies of technologies, like solar panels, batteries, 'free energy devices', if submitted to the patent office and found to have high efficient levels of energy creation/storage/harvesting, are given secret clearance and disallowed to be viewed or worked on.
