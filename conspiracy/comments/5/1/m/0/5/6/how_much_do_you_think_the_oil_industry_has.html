You listen to some talk about an institution or system and you may have noticed that they&#39;re not really grasping the concept that it&#39;s a reality. There&#39;s not any humanized vilification. It&#39;s just... &quot;them&quot; . No documentation, just a vague acknowledgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at the stigma put on the electric vehicle market. You don&#39;t really need to look at the fringe topics to find the evidence of corruption in the energy market.</p>

<p>Look at how the US treats solar energy or off grid power production. We are currently living in a moment in time where solar cells are the cheapest and most efficient they have ever been yet there&#39;s no push from the government to move towards solar production for the private home owner.</p>

<p>The only projects I&#39;ve seen in the solar energy production market is from private investment groups and small scale production for use by local government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you define as the &quot;oil industry&quot;. </p>

<p>The government makes more off oil than the companies, by far. Then you have the people like Rockefeller, Noble and the Rothschilds who made vast fortunes off oil. They influence the government heavily in many fields. I&#39;d assume the vast amount of activity to inhibit alternative energies come from these two holders of the oil industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In extreme and rare cases.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s much more institutionalized than that. Mark Twain went to Europe and saw the efficiency of masonry heaters and wrote about it. More than 100 years later, masonry heaters are rare in the US. They can reduce your fuel use by 1/3. </p>

<p>A college I know not far from here was granted millions to work with solar panels, and multiple millions to make an energy course available as a trade. The panels cost more than getting electricity from the grid and don&#39;t do much good. </p>

<p>For less money and effort, they could have encouraged the schools to teach masonry heater courses, subsidized some machinery, encouraged competition making firebricks and reduced fuel use by 2/3s.</p>

<p>But the government will never do that. The more expensive a solution, the better the government likes it. As long as it keeps you dependent on the government. </p>

<p>In situations like Tesla, the government will be sending men in black suits. But in most cases:</p>

<p>a. no one will fund the projects,</p>

<p>b. self-funded projects leave people poor and desperate (willing to sell out cheaply to a major company who can then bury the tech),</p>

<p>c. aren&#39;t properly educated in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know its so sad. They &quot;fixed&quot; the city center because thats where the money comes in with tourism but the rest of N.O. they have let rot. The 9th ward is horrible -- and this isn&#39;t the first time in the history of N.O. that they&#39;ve LET the 9th ward flood and then did nothing. Early in the 1900s they had a hurricane coming in and they were going to lose downtown to flooding....so what do the assholes do? They decide that part of town is too important and purposely breached the levees near the 9th ward so it would flood there instead of downtown and then once again proceeded to offer no help. Sad, sad, sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s similar to a conversation I had with someone. They knew a guy who had a brilliant concept and was then approached by &quot;them&quot; and bring naive sold his ideas which were buried. Once he realized this they intimidated him and threatened legal ruin if he pursued further etc.etc. </p>

<p>My friend who told me the story ended up making a scaled down version of the original design, and just like the old man claimed, the engine worked... Perfectly. The guy was old by then (this took place in the late 80s early 90s) said if he had it to do over again he would have taken his chances and fought to succeed. 
It&#39;s a calamity how many world altering innovations are buried and shelved by corporate machines.</p>
