        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After this whole rocket explosion I&#39;ve been trying to piece these things together now.</p>

<p>Please, this is all hypothetical and I&#39;m not looking to get into debates about this I just want hypothetical/honest reply&#39;s.</p>

<p>So a lot of people are saying that the Facebook satellite that was being launched by space-x that blew up was actually targeted by a UFO. If you haven&#39;t seen the video here it is:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arIc1NlHvV0&amp;amp;ebc=ANyPxKqW9712u79rH3KFqym9C_uvUCfTzCMV1W9REa8e3tA8wCEfwugmmzPffZ6DJikjSNS61uxp">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arIc1NlHvV0&amp;amp;ebc=ANyPxKqW9712u79rH3KFqym9C_uvUCfTzCMV1W9REa8e3tA8wCEfwugmmzPffZ6DJikjSNS61uxp</a></p>

<p><strong>One posted: &quot;If between the left tower and right tower there is at least a quarter mile and the so called bug beamed from one end to the other in 1/4 second. 
&quot;That bug is at least going 3,600mph minimum. Its not a bird, its an alien with a laser that destroyed the rocket. You can tell it is not a bird or a bug. Look at how the left tower hides the UFO behind it when you slow it down near the top. this indicated the UFO is behind the tower and not in-front of the camera lens dropping the possibility of a bug. 
Garry Ermoloff added: &quot;It&#39;s too bad this slow version wasn&#39;t the full video because that is not the only time that orb appears.
&quot;It is in many frames and there are also birds flying by but the speed of the orbs and some crazy manoeuvers so fast that unless you quickly stop each frame to divide them you almost don&#39;t even see the orbs but the birds give something to compare with the orb flying past.</strong></p>

<p>Ok now that that is out of the way what I&#39;m getting at is, if an alien did supposedly blow up the rocket, it would have been for malicious purposes (the Facebook satellite that is) because &quot;hypothetically&quot; aliens are here to help us and if they wanted to destroy us they could have by now.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is what is the conspiracy behind the Facebook satellite?</p>

<p>It seems like it had good intentions but was there something more sinister planned?</p>

<p>The ability to bring internet access to tens of thousands of Africans would have improved literacy rates and help them connect and compete with the world.</p>

<p>But was there something more sinister behind it? Because why else, would a ufo supposedly blow up a good sounding thing like that?</p>

<p>There had to be a more dark side to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to link it together but I need your guys help.</p>

<p>Was there anything else sinister that has been revealed or brought to light about this Facebook satellite that was going to be put into orbit?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and thanks for responding if you do. I&#39;m not really here to debate, this is all hypothetical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have been thinking... it&#39;s less about facebook (lost nothing - was only a promised subscriber of service) / israeli based spacecorp (lost nothing, was insured)... </p>

<p>... and more about elon must and spacex.</p>

<p>who is elon/spacex threatening?</p>

<p>boeing / lockheed martin -- coincidentally, these are the same companies that are long-rumored to receive black budget money for the purpose of developing anti-gravity drones (and related tech).</p>

<p>if i had to guess, i would say it&#39;s boeing / lockheed martin trying to give elon/spacex a bad time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking along the same lines. Aren&#39;t they called united launch alliance or something like that?</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got this huge market for launching stuff into space. You&#39;ve got a group of established players from the MIC. Now along comes SpaceX trying to grab a piece of the action.</p>

<p>If anyone had the technology and resources (and motive!) to mess with the SpaceX launch, these would be the most likely suspects. </p>

<p>A 3,600 mph vehicle with some kind of particle beam or laser? I could see Boeing or Lockheed having something like that up their sleeve for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working on a theory. </p>

<p>It goes like this. </p>

<p>Humanity is used for parts, blood or toys.</p>

<p>In the past we were straight up slaves. Our masters used free energy ( the pyramids of Giza, the pyramids of the grand canyon ). Eventually, the slaves rebelled or weren&#39;t usable for the purpose required due to stress.. ( animals in captivity have high stress levels and don&#39;t act natural ).</p>

<p>The pyramids in the grand canyon were destroyed and the history hidden for obvious purposes. It was then gutted and we were told it was water erosion ( it wasn&#39;t ).</p>

<p>So the next iteration of slavery we were given the illusion of free will and the illusion of choice.</p>

<p>This is why all presidents are decided for us.</p>

<p>We are contained in a controlled environment. This is why NASA lies about space. Think of a huge terrarium. </p>

<p>Whomever runs this joint is able to flood it and start over again.</p>

<p>Who knows how many times this process had to be restarted with changes made to keep the illusion of free will working nominally.</p>

<p>The idea of religion and free will was most likely started by our masters.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this iteration is about to come to an end because they are losing control.</p>

<p>I also think a certain bloodline of people  are gatekeepers of this place. Maybe they have direct contact/connections with the owners of this place off world.</p>

<p>I think the gatekeepers have a guide on how this whole thing plays out ( the bible end times  ). Even though it&#39;s not true, they have to follow this storyline. It&#39;s the blueprints they were given to start the next iteration of this human zoo we are in.</p>

<p>The Masons, the satanists and the jews are pawns for something bigger. They are the curtain hiding the wizard of Oz. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of fail-safes to not see who is really running the show.</p>

<p>The pyramids line up to start constellations for a reason. These pyramids are all over the earth. Our masters tell us they are just tombs and they hide the real history.</p>

<p>Who knows how many times resets were performed. Their goal is to have a natural habitat where the human doesn&#39;t suspect containment. </p>

<p>The truth is trickling out so I suspect a reset soon. </p>

<p>Many just think this is rich greedy people behind this. I think it&#39;s much bigger than that.</p>

<p>Spit balling here, I think that CERN is a working portal device. Probably to usher gatekeepers to other areas in the universe. Maybe to areas the pyramids point to in the sky. I think off world civilizations exist and gatekeepers are in the know.</p>

<p>The whole Cern sacrifice thing is just disinformation to make people think satanists are behind this. It&#39;s a show to hide what is really going on.</p>

<p>We live on a prison planet or plane or who the fuck knows. Some advanced space terrarium that serves the needs of another advanced civilization. For some reason I don&#39;t think we can comprehend how advanced that civilization is.</p>

<p>Any current tech we have now has been around for probably thousands of years and just trickled out to us to conform to a timeline that&#39;s  predetermined.</p>

<p>I think if someone thinks the Elites are the end all be all to this life/world they&#39;re missing the point/still sleeping.

<p>Who would have something to gain from that? I feel like if these people in control of something like that with this kind of technology they could just synthesize or make robots or something instead of waste time trying to control us like that, see what I mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it would make sense that Israel would have an interest in making sure it can develop its own satellites so they don&#39;t have to rely on other countries for their needs.</p>

<p>Is this what you are getting at? I&#39;m new to this area of information so I read through that article slowly but I&#39;m trying to understand the connection you&#39;re making here.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is another thing I was thinking about!</p>

<p>It&#39;s so trippy to think about.</p>

<p>My question is do those industries have these kind of technologies and where did they learn about them? Did ET&#39;s give them the technology which I feel isn&#39;t the case because why would they give such a heartless group of people that kind of technology?</p>

<p>Did they develop this themselves? I&#39;m just now getting into this information and it is so cool to research!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the full world of politics and who did what to who but when you have big players like this moving this kind of technology around there&#39;s obviously going to be sabotage in this kind of day and age.</p>

<p>So if Iran did take our Israelis rocket like this, and Israel killed those nuclear scientists, what&#39;s the end goal here? Why are they doing this to each other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some things we know:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was an Israeli communications satellite. Facebook was just renting some bands, that&#39;s super-common, NRO satellites do the same. You have secret squirrel stuff and feel-good projects compartmentalized, but all going up together.</p></li>
<li><p>It was meant to replace AMOS-2, which is retiring. AMOS-5 was meant to replace AMOS-2, but it went incommunicado and is inoperable.</p></li>
<li><p>Spacecom, responsible for the AMOS line of satellites, agreed to be purchased for $285M by a Chinese company last week, with the Chinese company assuming their debt.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So many possible conspiracies here, legit possibilities (could both sats have been sabotaged?) - and everyone in these forums is all &quot;herf-derf Facebook.&quot; It&#39;s kind of telling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just now learned it was an Israel backed communications/observation satellite and some people are claiming there was laser technology hidden inside to be able to be weaponised from space.</p>

<p>Could this be the reason?</p>

<p>And I have much information and research to conduct on Israel and why they seem to dip their hands into everything.</p>

<p>Why do they seem like such a sinister country? Pardon my ignorance on the subject it&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to look more into but havnt.</p>

<p>Why does Israel always seem to be so god damn evil with their intentions?</p>

<p>So this is all starting to make sense now.</p>

<p>I just wonder why they would need a weaponized space laser, who were they planning on taking out?</p>

<p>but the interesting thing is, on coast to coast am and a lot of documentaries and interviews, the abductees that came back to tell about it almost all were healed some how.  like cancer went away or they could suddenly bear children.  i imagine there were many who didn&#39;t come back to tell about it.</p>

<p>several channels state that the dark hats didn&#39;t leave when agreed upon several years ago and there was a war near the sun which is apparently a stargate; and they finally all left or were exterminated/re-absorbed into Source by the higher dimensional beings who control the balance of light and dark on the earth just a few weeks ago.  apparently these parasitic ETs just literally left our plane of existence.  </p>
