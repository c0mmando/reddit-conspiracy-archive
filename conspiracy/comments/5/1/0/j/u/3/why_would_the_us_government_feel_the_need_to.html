        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to claim the US government had no involvement in 9/11, I just don&#39;t see what they would&#39;ve gained by secretly planting explosives. I get that the fear generated by the attacks allowed the Bush administration to pass the Patriot Act and justify a war in the Middle East, but the plane thing alone was enough to accomplish that. 9/11 wasn&#39;t scary because the twin towers were completely destroyed, it was scary because domestic aircraft were hijacked and flown into two of the most iconic buildings in NYC. What would the government have gained by blowing up the towers after crashing planes into them? If anything the smoky ruins of two partially destroyed towers would have made for some pretty powerful imagery. I understand that some experts have come out and said the footage looks like a controlled demolition, but this is an unprecedented event. Maybe when you crash an airplane into a skyscraper it resembles a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Bonus question: If the government did in fact feel the need to completely destroy the towers, why the need for secrecy? They could have just done it the next day. I&#39;m sure the public would&#39;ve believed the towers were no longer structurally stable after having airplanes crashed into them. Or if they really needed the towers to be gone that day, why not just say Al Qaeda planted the bombs? </p>

<p>WTC already doomed.</p>

<p>That grandiose Titanic called the World Trade Center, which had been planned to last for at least a century, soon revealed itself to be an engineering stupidity and technological embarrassment. The facade, made of cast aluminum, had been directly connected to the steel superstructure. This caused a battery-like electric flow between the two metals resulting in what&#39;s known as galvanic corrosion. This problem had been text-book predictable in the marine-air environment of lower Manhattan, hence the embarrassment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not even touching the economic aspect.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein made 2 Billion off of the insurance fraud. The asbestos renovation would habe costed millions. And he probably sold millions of dollars in insider information so that investors can prepare.</p>

<p>Watch Loose Change for the majority of the economic information. </p>

<p>There&#39;s even the political aspect of the CIA wanting to pass the Patriot Act. They tried to pass it with the 1993 WTC Bombings carried out with the help of the FBI. And then again in 1995 with the OKC Bombings. Everyone knew those were inside jobs yet why not 9/11? </p>

<p>And of course there was the need for a false flag to invade r he 7 countries already on their list. The day 9/11 happened they immediately sent in troops for G.O.D. Gold. Oil. Drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silverstein still would have made his $2 billion with the plane crashes alone. If you have the resources to pull off an operation like this then surely you have the resources to bribe/threaten an inspector to say you&#39;ve gotten rid of the asbestos, which seems a lot simpler and cheaper than hijacking 5 airplanes and staging a secret demolition. And if somehow it really was necessary to crash planes and bomb the building why try to keep the bombings secret and risk exposure? Why not just say Al Qaeda planted the bombs?</p>

What evidence are you basing that claim on?</p>

<p>Even if what you say is true, controlling the media doesn&#39;t guarantee you can get away with saying you crashed a plane into a building, when thousands saw you didn&#39;t. You&#39;re still leaving things to chance. People have means of communicating outside of the main stream media.</p>

Those plans alone would not take down a whole building. There a lot more into it that just the government. There is financial gain and many other aspects that go into it. Its just sad that it had to happen. The real people who caused this should be prosecuted!</p>

If they had not collapsed the likely demolition method used would&#39;ve been beam by beam removal, taking years.  Not to mention the time they would wait to get permission to do that. </p>

<p>Remember the clean up effort removed steel from the site immediately, with the goal of rebuilding, as a cover story,  every &quot;patriot&quot; could support. </p>

<p>While the real probable intent was to disrupt the investigation of the collapse and hide evidence that something other than the planes were involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say what people saw. I was surprised there not more witnesses. Explosions, video edits, interviews, could all be woven together to give the impression to a TV viewer that planes crashed into the towers. A false flag of this magnitude was orchestrated by the highest powers, with all major news networks complicit in the cover up. We have all seen the BBC report of WTC 7 being reported destroyed 20 minutes before it actually fell. I think many people heard explosions, which is highly documented, and several eyewitnesses saying they saw a plane, not a passenger plane, with some video editing of amateur footage, one could easily present to a TV audience, a cut and dry story. But, we all know 9/11 is not what it appears to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the actual news clips are incontrovertible truth, I&#39;m saying just the opposite. Study the news clips closely, the news clip videos are CGI overlays. The videos don&#39;t make sense. How could a flimsy aluminum wing slice through steel columns? Impossible. TV video shows the planes vanishing into the towers. Impossible. The videos may show planes hitting the towers, but they are not real because the planes defy physics, it&#39;s an illusion, CGI video. All fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my <em>favourite</em> 9/11 conspiracy theory. I can&#39;t be bothered arguing with any others these days, but I still jump into this on occasionally. </p>

<p>Ignoring the technical impossibility (which is what I know most about) of faking the 7 lives broadcast shots that captured Flight 175, the better point against this theory is that <strong>nobody in their right mind would sign off on this scheme!</strong></p>

<p>We are talking about Flight 175 - the second plane that hit the most prominent building in New York City about 15 minutes <em>after</em> a plane had hit the first tower.</p>

<p>By that time it was easy to predict that potentially hundreds of thousands of people would be staring at the huge disaster unfolding at the WTC. Some number of those people would have cameras, and a portion of those people would be photographing or recording at the moment the second impact takes place.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re in charge of this supposed plan you are apparently going to sign off on a plan that could be disproved by a totally unpredictable number of photos or videos taken by any number of people. Some of which may not come to light for years.</p>

<p>It would be an insane thing to go ahead with!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>$680 Billion Dollar Military Budget + Black Ops Budgets estimated to be another $50+ Billion, I&#39;m pretty sure there is technology the military has we are not aware of. Twin Towers were designed to take a direct hit by a jet passenger plane. The lattice was never wide enough to allow a jet engine to pass through, much less the very weak nose section. Aluminum wings would not have cut through the steel framework. It&#39;s a complete illusion, done with CGI, and presented to the TV viewing public as reality. All the video was edited prior to being shown on TV, the planes and entry into the towers were all fabricated. Holograms may have been used. This was a military operation of the highest order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. To what end? The group, probably military operation, behind this horrific attack don&#39;t have one ounce of morals or conscience. Their goal was to gain power. We were warned of the Military Industrial Complex by more than one President. The last concern they had was for innocent people who got caught in the middle. Think of all the people that jumped from the towers. The firefighters trapped in the towers. All the passengers were disposed of to avoid any leaks. Where and how, only the criminals behind 9/11 would be able to answer that question.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s another that demonstrates that the &quot;nose&quot; that comes out the far side isn&#39;t actually the same size and shape as the plane&#39;s nose: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg99pOniOw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg99pOniOw</a></p>

<p>As a little extra - as someone who&#39;s been professionally using the Avid Symphony software that Ace Baker cites in his video for well over a decade, I can state with absolute certainty that it can&#39;t do what Ace suggests in his video. </p>

If you have the resources to pull off an operation like this then surely you have the resources to bribe/threaten an inspector to say you&#39;ve gotten rid of the asbestos, which seems a lot simpler and cheaper than hijacking 5 airplanes and staging a secret demolition. And if somehow it really was necessary to crash planes and bomb the building why try to keep the bombings secret and risk exposure? Why not just say Al Qaeda planted the bombs?</p>
