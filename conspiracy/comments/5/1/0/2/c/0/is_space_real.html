       I need help here, r/conspiracy.
       <br/>
       Remember the flat earth theory? Remember how (almost) everyone on the internet condemned this theory to fiery Oblivion, never to be spoken of again?
       <br/>
       Well, I am one of those (fools) who decided the flat earth theory had some credibility. I mean, if you really think about it, there are some good points. If the Earth is curved, why are you able to see the Statue of Liberty from so far away, farther than what the curve would allow? Why is it that, no matter how high up you go, there is NEVER a curve? Why did a NASA worker confess to photo shopping the "blue-marble" photo of the earth? Why is Antarctica so heavily guarded, and why does every nation on the planet have a treaty to keep it that way? Why has every NASA astronaut that has been to space, ALSO been a high ranking Mason?
       <br/>
       These questions have tortured me. And to make matters worse, I stumbled upon the findings of an independent research team. This team sent a craft into the atmosphere, in an attempt to see how high they could go. They found that as they left the atmosphere, flying farther and farther from the Earth's surface, radiation levels also grew. So essentially, this team discovered that the higher up you go, higher levels of radiation exist. If this were true, what would that mean for space travel? Do NASA's spacecrafts use some technology that prevents the radiation from seeping into the craft? Is such technology possible? Is spacetravel even possible??
       <br/>
       I ask this in all seriousness. When I look up in the night sky, at all the stars and the moon, and all the glory, I am overtaken with images of beautiful, multicolored galaxies, red giants, black holes, FTL travel, human colonization, the f***ing Star Wars movies. I want all of this to be real, but my psychotic mind can't help but question it. I want to look at pictures from the Hubble Telescope and think "my goodness, I can't believe we discovered this!" instead of "what a pile of photoshopped garbage". So, will someone out there, PLEASE present me with some kind of evidence that space DOES exist, that there IS something out there for us to discover? I am beyond trusting anything NASA says, so none of that. What I'm looking for is discoveries of independently run research teams, discoveries that give credit to the "space frontier" ideology.

       Well, if you go to the beach, gaze over the ocean, what is the reason you cant see land in the horizon if the earth is flat? Even if you brought your biggest telescope, you wouldn't be able to, because the earth is round. That's why when you see ships on the horizon, they will dissapear quickly after a certain length has been traveled, as they are now... well curving. If you want to see the curvature of earth yourself, it is possible to see it from hot air balloons, if you know of a place where you can lend one of those. Alternatively, go "sky-diving" with a parachute, go see the wonderful world we live on for yourself :D
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the radiation stuff, well yea, we know there is radiation in space, and even with very little knowledge of science, you would know that most radiation is stopped by objects. Alpha is stopped by paper (alpha is the biggest of the radiation particles (and the most dangerous one), and is therefore stopped by very small objects), beta stopped by stuff like bricks or thick alluminium plates, and gamma is stopped by stuff like lead (gamma is also the least damaging type of radiation, and travels the furthest). Nasa knows there is radiation in space, and the spacesuits are made of a fabric that protects the wearer, much like people working in nuclear power-plants

       I'm totally playing the devils advocate for the sake of OP's point of view. But real flat earthers will say that everything in your first paragraph is explainable by the law of perspective. There are plenty of videos that show a ship "sinking" below the horizon only to "reappear" once a telescope or some other optical zoom is applied. The last paragraph OP will surely just dismiss as evidence supplied by the lying Nazi's at NASA. Just saying.

       Let's look at the law of perspective!  It's just some highschool math.  Take the top of an object (we'll call it point A), and draw a line striaght down to the ground (point B), then follow the ground to where you are (point C), then back to A.  We've just made a right triangle.  Give me a distance between points A and B that would give you a negative angle (tan
       <sup>
        -1
       </sup>
       (Line AB / Line BC)).  You can't, it would always appear over the horizon.  That's the law of persepctive.

       The law of perspective is very well understood, and we can apply it with some trigonometry.  Let’s just use some high school math, and the assumption that the world is flat, and prove that the earth can’t be flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m standing near the south pole which, on a flat earth, is actually a rim around the edge.  I’m looking directly toward the north pole, which is now the point in the center of the circle.  It’s the equinox, so the sun will be directly above the equator (a circle with half the radius of the southern polar circle).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my friend standing at the 45 degrees longitude to make a measurement for me.  He’ll measure the angle to the sun at his local noon, but it doesn’t really matter where he is, as long as he’s at the 45 degrees longitude (north or south won’t matter).  He’ll measure that the sun is 45 degrees in the sky.  This means that we can construct a right triangle to the sun, and get a figure for the height.  We’ll draw a line from my friend to the point on the equator closest to him, and then draw a line from there to the sun, then from the sun back to my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a right triangle with one forty five degree angle must, by definition have a second 45 degree angle (because the angles have to add to 180 degrees), we know that the two legs of the triangle have to be exactly the same length.  We don’t care about the length of the hypotenuse (for the curious it’s the length of the leg times the square root of 2).  A quick google search tells us that it’s about 3000 miles from 45 degrees to the equator, which means the sun must be about 3000 miles in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great, now I can use that information to predict where the sun should be from where I’m standing.  But, I’ll wait until midnight my time to do it.  This way, the sun will be as far away from me as possible.  It will be on the opposite side of me, but still over the equator, since it’s still the equinox.  A quick google search shows the distance to the equator from the south pole is about 6215 miles, so we can triple that figure to get the distance to opposite side of the equator, 18645 miles (once to get from the south pole to the equator, again to get from the equator to the north pole, and a third time to get from the north pole to the opposite side of the equator, where the sun is).
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the sun must be 3000 miles high, so we can construct another right triangle and get the angle we should expect to see.  We can take the arctangent of 3000/18645 (the ratio of opposite over adjacent on our right triangle) and get that the sun should still be about 9 degrees over the horizon at midnight on the south pole.  The sun, at its farthest point, should still be about the width of your fist at arm’s length above the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the simple laws of perspective, the earth can’t be flat.

       As far as the nature of space goes, it's hard to say. NASA has lied so much to the world that sometimes it's hard to separate fact from fiction. I'm fairly confident we've never been through the Van Allen belt that surrounds the earth, though.

       Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.

       The reason I don't quite like the theory is because there's so many people with a lower security clearance than the top people that could leak even a inch of significant evidence. Instead we don't see
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       . I can't think of any person with significant being an advocate of this theory. Maybe I'm asking for too much but it seems to me that this is far greater than what we can expect from a conspiracy. It just seems ridiculous to be able to keep a secret like this from the public for so many years without a inch of slightest evidence other than "why am I able to see beyond the curve?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I am an advocate of the UFO-Conspiracy so maybe I'm being hypocritical saying it's far too great to hide away.

       No, because I have multiple sources, friends, and relatives who have been to Hawaii, Alaska, Asia, etc. I could catch a plane and end up anywhere on this globe. BUT I have never met a person, nor will I ever meet a person, who has been to space. I don't have the opportunity to go to space, and neither does anyone else unless they have MONEY or POWER.

       Because that is the only sure way to prove to myself that something is true. If I don't see it with my own eyes, I have no valid evidence to support it in my own mind. and this isn't JUST space that makes me feels this way. When it comes down to it, my consciousness is all I'm REALLY sure of, so I can't even prove that the world around me actually exists.

       okay, so when I go to the airport, and I'm presented with a slew of destinations I can travel to, and I see that I can get on a plane to go to Asia, SURE, that's proof enough for me that Asia exists. Yeah, I didn't go see the Great Wall of China, but I am ABLE to. Let me know when I can book a trip to Mars through Delta, and I'll let you have this one.

       You are right earth is flat. I'm working on a new theory as for why NASA lied and our human history that is buried and lied about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the Truman Show has a bit of truth in plain site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider we are under a dome with ice walls on the outer edges. Consider the reason NASA lies about space is to give us the illusion we aren't contained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider these gatekeepers who code mysterious truths in media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that Ancient pyramids across the globe are aligned with particular star constellations for a reason. These pyramids were built by the original slave masters of this planet paying homage to their original location in the star system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider we are in an huge, advanced human breeding enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Animals who know they are contained no longer act natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original iteration of this "matrix" we are trapped in didn't work out. Probably a slave rebellion that destroyed the ancient cities. Same goes for all ancient societies who disappeared and whom have had their past buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your current reality was originally rebuilt with the idea of "free will" which is where the myth of religions came from. To assemble some sort of order.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living in a time right now where this world we know is about to be "reset" to maintain order before things get out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The freemasons are free because they are the gatekeepers of this prison planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flood myths are true because floods in the past have been used as a tool for mass extinction and reset of society to maintain order. They use floods so survivers think it is natural and that a particular religion was actually true all along. This makes it easier for them to be reset into the next reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things seem so crazy right now because they are testing human emotions to the extreme before the finale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans disappear in mass yearly because they are used for parts, blood or toys.

       Neither the official globe model nor the flat earth model work.  The trick with flat earth is that it uses proofs against the official model as proofs of the new model, but this is a logical fail.  Disproving one thing does not directly prove another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Concave Earth model does not suffer from the Southern problems that the flat earth model does.

       One of the key points to understand is that light does not travel straight through the atmosphere, but we interpret images assuming straight light.  An experiment that shows light always bends upwards through the atmosphere:

       </a>
       When we interpret our long range visual observations in this context we find that objects we see on the horizon straight in front of us must actually be above us.

       I have issues with behavior of the most visible proponent of concave earth theory, Steven Christopher.  Given his actions, I think it is possible that he is playing a cointelpro type role in blackwashing this issue.  But the credibility of a proponent of an idea has no direct bearing on the validity of that idea.  Ideas stand separate from people.

       An example would be lighthouses.  The visible distance for lighthouses is much too far for the dimensions of the earth we are given assuming straight light.  There would be massive humps of water in the way.  In order for this to work, light would be required to bend by an amount nearly matching the supposed curvature.

       Airy's failure showed that stars move relative to a stationary earth rather than the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider is how the atmosphere is supposed to work.  If the earth is moving at 1000mph at the equator, what is the atmosphere doing?  Does it move in lockstep with the earth, maintaining the same radial velocity out to the edge of space?   If not should there not be a massive wind blowing constantly in one direction?  At the poles there would be 0 radial velocity, so here the atmosphere does not move at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the barrier between the atmosphere and space?  How does the force of an infinite vacuum not suck it all away?  The force of gravity we are told exists is an incredibly weak one in comparison.

       There is no "force of an infinite vacuum". Air moves from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure, trying to find an equilibrium. The atmosphere's  pressure with respect to the vacuum of space is counterbalanced by the pull of gravity towards the Earth. Gravity does not have to fight against some infinite vacuum force because that's not how vacuums work.

       Is the moon also flat? Are all other objects we can observe flat?

       The law of perspective is very well understood, and we can apply it with some trigonometry.  Let’s just use some high school math, and the assumption that the world is flat, and prove that the earth can’t be flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m standing near the south pole which, on a flat earth, is actually a rim around the edge.  I’m looking directly toward the north pole, which is now the point in the center of the circle.  It’s the equinox, so the sun will be directly above the equator (a circle with half the radius of the southern polar circle).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my friend standing at the 45 degrees longitude to make a measurement for me.  He’ll measure the angle to the sun at his local noon, but it doesn’t really matter where he is, as long as he’s at the 45 degrees longitude (north or south won’t matter).  He’ll measure that the sun is 45 degrees in the sky.  This means that we can construct a right triangle to the sun, and get a figure for the height.  We’ll draw a line from my friend to the point on the equator closest to him, and then draw a line from there to the sun, then from the sun back to my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a right triangle with one forty five degree angle must, by definition have a second 45 degree angle (because the angles have to add to 180 degrees), we know that the two legs of the triangle have to be exactly the same length.  We don’t care about the length of the hypotenuse (for the curious it’s the length of the leg times the square root of 2).  A quick google search tells us that it’s about 3000 miles from 45 degrees to the equator, which means the sun must be about 3000 miles in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great, now I can use that information to predict where the sun should be from where I’m standing.  But, I’ll wait until midnight my time to do it.  This way, the sun will be as far away from me as possible.  It will be on the opposite side of me, but still over the equator, since it’s still the equinox.  A quick google search shows the distance to the equator from the south pole is about 6215 miles, so we can triple that figure to get the distance to opposite side of the equator, 18645 miles (once to get from the south pole to the equator, again to get from the equator to the north pole, and a third time to get from the north pole to the opposite side of the equator, where the sun is).
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the sun must be 3000 miles high, so we can construct another right triangle and get the angle we should expect to see.  We can take the arctangent of 3000/18645 (the ratio of opposite over adjacent on our right triangle) and get that the sun should still be about 9 degrees over the horizon at midnight on the south pole.  The sun, at its farthest point, should still be about the width of your fist at arm’s length above the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the simple laws of perspective, the earth can’t be flat.
