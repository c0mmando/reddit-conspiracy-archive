<p>Big pharma really doesn&#39;t want weed legal, y&#39;all. </p>

<p>Arizona residents can register to vote online at <a href="https://servicearizona.com/webapp/evoter/selectLanguage">THIS LINK.</a> Do it. </p>

<p><strong>I know many don&#39;t believe voting matters. And, for many things Congressional, those assumptions are likely true. However, the good voters of Colorado, Washington State, Alazka, Oregon and DC would probably disagree that voting is entirely useless. They aren&#39;t getting arrested for possession anymore.</strong></p>

<p>But, I shouldn&#39;t have implied that voting is unnecessary.  The voters should be aware, though, that there is the constant possibility that their votes may not be counted.  </p>
