        I know many don't believe voting matters. And, for many things Congressional, those assumptions are likely true. However, the good voters of Colorado, Washington State, Alazka, Oregon and DC would probably disagree that voting is entirely useless. They aren't getting arrested for possession anymore.

       As I said in the text of my post, the good voters of Colorado, Washington State, Oregon, Alaska and DC would likely disagree with you that your vote doesn't matter. Sure, one vote for one candidate out of 430+ Representatives and 100 Senators is pretty meaningless.

       In a race where the establishment is in a must-win situation, the election will be rigged.

       But, I shouldn't have implied that voting is unnecessary.  The voters should be aware, though, that there is the constant possibility that their votes may not be counted.

       Except this legalization bill sucks. It allows localities to enact zoning if they feel its "dangerous".
