       Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that
       <strong>
        the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center's designers anticipated

        FEMA's Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.
       </a>
       Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity

      <p>
       Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707

        Statements by Engineers
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698">
         Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">
         The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">
        One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.
       </a>
       Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.

       Fine,  but even if they weren't,   the recorded explosion of those two buildings could not have been caused by the planes.    They would not have come down in the way they did even if they were severely compromised by the planes.

       Towers were designed to withstand a 707.. they were hit by a bigger faster 767.. they are similar but the 767 is bigger. And faster.. With I think 2 titanium  6 ton engines.... So that's a shit ton of heavy metal going 500mph through a building.

       those are what non-demo collapses would look like, not uniform fall through path of most resistance. they would be steaming piles of steel still standing straight but leaning over because of the warping of steel. Can't believe people think the twin towers fell naturally, it just boggles my mind how people can be that stupid.

       Seriously!!! I can't believe it, but that's the first time I've actually examined pictures of the surrounding buildings. They all look incredibly more damaged than building 7 and, what do you know, they all still look generally like buildings rather than a pile of powder in their own footprint. Absolute mind blowing that people are willing to look at that shit and still try to defend the official version.

       Physics says collapse would take more than 1/10 of a second per floor.   Only way they came down that fast is demolition,  removal of support structure,  by explosives.    Simple physics.

       If they can drop a 47 storey skyscraper into it's own footprint, i don't see why they couldn't do the same to the twin towers.

       They exploded them motherfuckers to to give weight to a theory they wanted to push, aircraft collapsed them because hijackers, if they had done a conventional demolition, bottom down, then it wouldn't have made any sense.

       You dont have to agree with it. Its fact. Plenty of testimony that explosions and flashes were heard at or near ground level before the collapse.

       Theres even video of pyroclastic clouds rolling out of the complex before the collapses happened.

       Anti-science?

       This is what happens when amateurs try to contradict professional engineers with statements like "clearly" and "naturally, this is the case". If you haven't taken courses in mechanics of materials, fracture mechanics and metallurgy like i have, you are not entitled to believe this trash.

       Yeah,  why don't you critique it line by line then?    Cause you cant change the laws of physics,  that is why.    Even NIST and FEMA ignored the documented video evidence of what happened,  and played avoidance,  and make believe.    Deal with the numbers,  or shut up.

       I should have been clearer: I want actual dynamic calculations, not figures drawn in Microsoft Paint. Kids drawings do not convince a professional engineer who studies materials failure for a living.

       Show me an example of your calculations showing how the buildings came down in 10-11 seconds,  1/10 second per floor while there was still substantial remaining steel structure below the level of damage.    Set an example as a professional engineer.    I predict you can't,  and won't,  and will employ another diversion tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The observed materials failure behavior on video documents something beyond jet impact,  fires,  and gravity.   Have you seen the videos?    Are you  not concerned with what you saw?    There are dozens of anomalies.    And then you apply the math,  and look at the cover up performed by NIST and FEMA,  the bogus 9/11 commission.

       Yes, I would expect brittle failure particularly assisted by enormous sudden heating (which reduces the strength of materials, in case you didn't know) to cause sudden collapse like that.

       It's not beyond the realm of possibility that the design of a very tall and important building would include safefty measures for a high speed impact. Fires, too, obviously.

       Leslie Robertson
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson
       </a>
       who do you think it was?
Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber. He concluded that the towers would remain standing despite the force of the impact and the hole it would punch out. The new technologies he had installed after the motion experiments and wind-tunnel work had created a structure more than strong enough to withstand such a blow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly how Robertson performed these calculations is apparently lost -- he says he cannot find a copy of the report. Several engineers who worked with him at the time, including the director of his computer department, say they have no recollection of ever seeing the study. But the Port Authority, eager to mount a counterattack against Wien, seized on the results -- and may in fact have exaggerated them. One architect working for the Port Authority issued a statement to the press, covered in a prominent article in The Times, explaining that Robertson's study proved that the towers could withstand the impact of a jetliner moving at 600 miles an hour. That was perhaps three times the speed that Robertson had considered. If Robertson saw the article in the paper, he never spoke up about the discrepancy. No one else issued a correction, and the question was answered in many people's minds: the towers were as safe as could be expected, even in the most cataclysmic of circumstances.
      </p>

       There were only two problems. The first, of course, was that no study of the impact of a 600-mile-an-hour plane ever existed. ''That's got nothing to do with the reality of what we did,'' Robertson snapped when shown the Port Authority architect's statement more than three decades later. The second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires that would inevitably break out when the jetliner's fuel exploded, exactly as the B-25's had. And if Wien was the trade center's Cassandra, fire protection would become its Achilles' heel.

       they both were responsible.  skilling hired robertson in 1957. in 1966 he was picked to lead the team of wtc. a year later he made partner. but robertson did the heavy lifting. "you have to understand, I worked long hours, seven days a week on this project back when I was young and energetic." probably the reason they made him partner. further, robertson says, "As the fire raged it got hotter and hotter and the steel got weaker and weaker," he says, adding that building a skyscraper able to handle such a blaze would not have been viable, financially and functionally." source for both quotes:

       Leslie Robertson is no longer a credible source, he has made some massive contradictions in his statements that go against the historical record, all of them post 9/11
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        they both were responsible
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There exact responsibility's are unknown, what the historical record shows though, is that Leslie Robertson was never referred to as chief/head/lead etc engineer pre 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robertson claims that the building was designed to only survive plane crashes at speeds of 180 mph post 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the historical record has Leslie Robertson on record stating...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “A previous analysis, carried out early in 1964, calculated that the towers would handle the impact of a 707 traveling at 600 mph without collapsing” - Leslie Robertson
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This a a massive contradiction, Robertson is lying. Also suspicious is the fact that he said in 1984-5 that there was...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “little likelihood of a collapse no matter how the building was attacked.” - Leslie Robertson
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       NIST is also contradicted when they claim that there was...
      </p>
      <p>
       “No evidence to indicate consideration of… thousands of gallons of jet fuel”. - NIST
      </p>
      <p>
       This statement is clearly false. See John Skilling’s statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698">
         “Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire… The building structure would still be there.” John Skilling
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Robertson is also on record, 21 days after 9/11, with this claim
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://911review.com/articles/griffin/nyc1.html#_ednref33">
         “As of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and
         <strong>
          molten steel was still running
         </strong>
         ”
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Years later he claims that he had...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “never run across anyone who has said that they had in fact seen molten metal.” - Leslie Robertson
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This statement is again a complete lie, the fact that Robertson himself claimed to have seen it in a published news report! This contradicts his own statement about seeing molten metal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so although it appears they designed the building to withstand the a 600mph jet hit they didn't design to withstand the fire.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Robertson says that the building was not designed to survive jet fuel fires, but there is no historical record of any statement made pre 9/11 that supports this quote...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire - Leslie Robertson”.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This claim is suspicious for two reasons: why would they design the towers to survive plane crashes without considering the jet fuel? And more importantly,
       <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698">
        John Skilling claimed in 1993 that they did consider the jet fuel when they designed the buildings.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, fires did not collapse any of the three skyscrapers on 9/11, there are now peer reviewed scientific papers that categorically confirm this.

       Here's a lesson in how to skeptic.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How much trust can we put into that analysis of a hypothetical situation that would have been
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       difficult to model?
      </p>
      <p>
       The NIST reports that the 1968 New York City building code — which the towers were intended but not required to meet when they were built - required a two-hour fire rating for the floor system.  How long and how hot did the fires burn in that analytical model that conclude they wouldn't collapse?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the NIST report:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The fire conditions in the towers on 9-11 were far more extreme than those to which floor systems in standard U.S. fire rating tests are subjected," Sunder says. "Our investigation's final assessment of how the floor system performed in the WTC fires also must consider factors such as the combustible fuel load of the hijacked jets, the extent and number of floors involved, the rate of the fire spread across and between floors, ventilation conditions, and the impact of the aircraft-damaged towers' ability to resist the fire."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Did the model they ran that concluded "no collapse" effectively cover the range of possibilities?  Given that it would have been done long before widespread CAD, even before finite element analysis (aka finite difference modeling) was much known outside academic circles,
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       it's a safe guess that the model was entirely too simplistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there any other differences between the the scenario declaring them safe and what happened in 2001?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice. Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those margins apply to
       <em>
        expected
       </em>
       conditions.  Which has nothing to do with the airplane crash scenario, an unexpected condition. (No, a plane crash is not that type of "dynamic load")  As it is  irrelevant to the case they are trying to make, and in fact serves only to muddy the water, bringing it up only serves to arouse my suspicion. As it should yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, were the buildings built
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       as designed?  No need to go search for the answer, I can tell you right now they weren't.  The design called for asbestos and midway through construction they changed to other materials.  That analysis mentioned earlier?  What fireproofing material did they use in the analytical model? Some of the new materials hadn't even been fully tested yet so it is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       unlikely those material properties were in the model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the fireproofing properly applied?  According to
       <a href="http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-10/world-trade-center-disaster/volume-ii-the-ruins-and-the-rebirth/fireproofing-at-the-wtc-towers.html">
        this page at fireengineering.com
       </a>
       , no.
      </p>
      <p>
       An excerpt:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Top and bottom chords and truss web members were exposed, and the red lead on the trusses was clearly visible in many locations. Photo 1 shows a truss with fireproofing missing from its end where it meets the outside wall. Also, the fireproofing was frequently thinner than the 3/4 inch described in the Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded ASCE BPAT report on the collapse of the towers. Many of the problems observed were clearly the result of poor workmanship.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Next, was the fireproofing material that
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       installed still in place?  Again, according to that fireengineering.com page, the answer is "no."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I inspected core columns up to the 78th floor but was unable to access them above that point. These inspections revealed that the bond of fireproofing on core columns had failed in many locations and the fireproofing was falling off the columns in floor-high sheets. Photo 3, taken in 1994, shows a core column from which the fireproofing had fallen off in a sheet that is several stories high.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That page lists several other cases of missing, damaged, misapplied, or just plain fucked up fireproofing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the NIST report cites "fireproofing material displacement" which may be have occurred due to the force of the impacts, such displacement exposing even more structural elements .  Did the model account for that possibility?  "No" would be a very good guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus endeth today's lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       * I was introduced to FEA/FDM when working for a USDA watershed research center at a large university, in the mid 80s.  The literature at that time was full of faulty models, predicting things that aren't physically possible / unexplainable by the analytical models. People rapidly gravitated toward the computational method though, because the analytical models  are frequently ... intractable, let's say, if not downright unworkable.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETA: Bonus lesson in skepticing.  So the planes might have been fairly similar, so what.  Stipulating that there were no significant differences between the planes used in the original analysis and the ones that did crash into WTC, doesn't imply that something is rotten in Denmark. "WHOA it must be due to [conspiracy theory N]!" is NOT a necessary or even warranted conclusion.  A much better place to look for an explanation for the discrepancy is asking whether the original analysis may have been flawed, or even applicable. IOW, if the
       <em>
        planes
       </em>
       weren't substantially different between the analysis and 9/11,
       <em>
        what else
       </em>
       <strong>
        was different

        The seismic events, therefore, must have resulted from causes of a different type. The best (and probably only plausible) candidate for these causes would seemingly be explosions in the basements of the Twin Towers, for which there is abundant physical and testimonial evidence.

       They are simply proving wrong the official narrative that the seismic waves were caused by the airplane impacts.

       The official narrative needs this because they have no logical explanation for massive explosions going off in the buildings

       <p>
        Defending its claim that the Twin Towers were brought down solely by the plane impacts and the resulting fires, NIST argued that there was no evidence that they were brought down by controlled demolition and that, in particular, there were no explosions below the floors on which fires burned.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2006, engineers Craig Furlong and Gordon Ross showed that the plane impacts could not have caused the seismic signals attributed to them by LDEO, because they originated several seconds before the 9/11 Commission’s radar-based times of impact.
        <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/point-tt-7/#EVIDENCE">

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The article clearly states that the seismic readings in question were ones that were attributed to the plane impacts by LDEO, which occurred
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the 9/11 Commissions stated times of plane impact and before the buildings collapse.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The frequencies of the waves are much too low to have been caused by plane impacts
        <strong>
         and building collapses

       People shouldnt concentrate on steel melting/warping points I dont think.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it is far more worth while to look at how/why so many joints/beams/support colums failed at roughly the same time almost uniformally, in 3 different buildings. There was a far greater percentage of steel, joints, columns in those buildings that wernt damaged by fire etc yet they all failed just as easily as the damaged stuff.

       What the report fails to take into account is wear and tear from maintenance  (or lack of), weather and age.

      <p>
       The towers might have been built to withstand the top aircraft at the time it was built, but technology changes as the years go buy, the fuel could be a higher mixture than planes in the 60s used.

       if the building was completely empty, you could be right, but you don't stop and take into account the weight of office furniture, and misc. furnishings on each floor and how much additional weight they can add.
      </p>
      <p>
       just a few grains of dirt could add up. when the office equipment caught fire and those flames mixed with the jetfuel, it put added pressure on load bearing beams that hold up the floor, those beams might not have been rated to the advanced weight and pressure put upon them.

       Are you serious? I've never heard of a debunker with a worse understanding of physics. Comparing the weight of the furniture to thousands of pounds of reinforced structural steel. I think you need to finish High School before you go around debunking, you clearly don't understand the problem at hand.

       Wow, I can't believe the engineers totes forgot to account for all the furniture that would be in the buildings! Oops, their bad!! Or maybe they were accounting for 1960s furniture because they had no way of predicting how drastically different today's furniture is?? I dunno, but sounds like they goofed big time, guys!

       That's totally contradictory.  It has happened, at least 3 times, as we saw on 9/11.  Just because you don't want to believe it, doesn't make it any less real.

       No it's not, and this is not a difficult point.  He is contrasting theoretical possibility with alleged incidents.  And the 3rd time the collapse involved no impact, either.

       WTC 7, when observed in slow motion, shows a "crimp" in the roof just before collapse. The "crimp" is a telltale sign of explosive demolition, highlighting the moment the central support columns are blown in concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC 7 has been marked as a controlled demolition by experts in the field.

       codes have gotten extensively stricter. Buildings have not lost any integrity, they are now building efficiently with different materials and techniques not known to design engineers 4 decades before the collapse. Lighter does not always mean weaker.

       What? No, I'm agreeing with you. Buildings in the 60s and 70s may lack the fancy technology that we have now, but it doesn't mean that the engineering wouldn't hold up. They're actually probably stronger with all the steel that, by today's standards, might be unnecessary because we have more efficient technology now (doing more with less, sleeker, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: ok maybe it wasn't a great analogy lol. I was thinking Smart Car vs. 1970s Charger. Smart car has more advanced technology, but it doesn't mean that the Charger wasn't a brick of steel. Buildings now might be more efficiently designed, but it doesn't mean that buildings back then weren't strong.

       Even if their calculations were somehow incorrect and plane construction changed so drastically in the 30-year interim as to damage the building structurally, it still doesn't explain the free-fall speed at which all three buildings fell or the fact that all of the tons of concrete were reduced to powder. That's not a failure on the part of the engineers to imagine future plane technology.

       Due to the forces exerted upon the structural framework that it was never intended to endure, it collapsed.

      <p>
       Are you insinuating if it somehow "fell slower" that it would be okay that it collapsed?  Gravity took over and did what it does, it pulled the structure down when the supports could no longer support it.  The supports don't need to disappear instantly, they simply need to bear a load beyond their design and beyond the strength of the framework, and then they fail and crumple.

       What's hilarious is a few years ago these types of canned responses would have been upvoted, but we are beginning to see more and more that we are actually the majority, those of us with our eyes opened who can think for ourselves.

       You do realize thousands of pounds of structural steel, the force in Newtons that would be required to create a uniform collapse through the path of most resistance for WTC1 &amp; 2? You clearly don't even understand rudimentary physics, are you even for real? What on earth can provide that much force? The buildings fell as if they were made of paper, what caused that? You understand what I'm asking you?

       That seems doubtful but what's worse? Watch a couple of those conspiracy vids about switching the White star ships with the intent for insurance fraud. I would have never believed it but when they show you the differences in port windows and top and which ship survived it's tough to ignore.

       those are what non-demo collapses would look like, not uniform fall through path of most resistance. they would be steaming piles of steel still standing straight but leaning over because of the warping of steel. Can't believe people think the twin towers fell naturally, it just boggles my mind how people can be that stupid.

       People shouldnt concentrate on steel melting/warping points I dont think.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it is far more worth while to look at how/why so many joints/beams/support colums failed at roughly the same time almost uniformally, in 3 different buildings. There was a far greater percentage of steel, joints, columns in those buildings that wernt damaged by fire etc yet they all failed just as easily as the damaged stuff.

       Wow, I can't believe the engineers totes forgot to account for all the furniture that would be in the buildings! Oops, their bad!! Or maybe they were accounting for 1960s furniture because they had no way of predicting how drastically different today's furniture is?? I dunno, but sounds like they goofed big time, guys!

       who do you think it was?
Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber. He concluded that the towers would remain standing despite the force of the impact and the hole it would punch out. The new technologies he had installed after the motion experiments and wind-tunnel work had created a structure more than strong enough to withstand such a blow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly how Robertson performed these calculations is apparently lost -- he says he cannot find a copy of the report. Several engineers who worked with him at the time, including the director of his computer department, say they have no recollection of ever seeing the study. But the Port Authority, eager to mount a counterattack against Wien, seized on the results -- and may in fact have exaggerated them. One architect working for the Port Authority issued a statement to the press, covered in a prominent article in The Times, explaining that Robertson's study proved that the towers could withstand the impact of a jetliner moving at 600 miles an hour. That was perhaps three times the speed that Robertson had considered. If Robertson saw the article in the paper, he never spoke up about the discrepancy. No one else issued a correction, and the question was answered in many people's minds: the towers were as safe as could be expected, even in the most cataclysmic of circumstances.

       There were only two problems. The first, of course, was that no study of the impact of a 600-mile-an-hour plane ever existed. ''That's got nothing to do with the reality of what we did,'' Robertson snapped when shown the Port Authority architect's statement more than three decades later. The second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires that would inevitably break out when the jetliner's fuel exploded, exactly as the B-25's had. And if Wien was the trade center's Cassandra, fire protection would become its Achilles' heel.
