        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m doing a project for Marketing class about the Plant known as Kratom. Kratom is a leaf from a plant, which when ingested provides an opiate-like buzz. Low doses = Energetic high, much like caffeine + adderall, higher doses = Codeine/Morphine style buzz.</p>

<p>Kratom is currently legal for purchase in Canada, however, after September 30th, 2016, it will be classed as a Schedule 1 Drug in the US. Meaning it is as &quot;dangerous&quot; as LSD, Methamphetamine, and Heroine (and funnily enough: weed).</p>

<p>The argument the DEA has put out is that as Kratom is used to treat Opiate addiction and withdrawal, it poses the same threat as an Opiate itself. Kratom has a potential for addiction, but it is practically harmless as NO DEATHS HAVE BEEN RECORDED due to its use. 15 people have died while on Kratom, however it was due to overdoses of drugs used simultaneously.</p>

<p>Why am I talking about this?</p>

<p>This is concrete proof that the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) is in the pockets of Big Pharma. You see, until recently, Kratom was of no concern to the DEA. However, pharmacies have just developed a new Opiate to treat the same conditions as Kratom was used.</p>

<p>How is this relevant? Well, first and foremost, companies cannot patent a plant, since it grows naturally. Monsanto has been pushing for the Feds to allow patents for plant genetics, so it might be coming soon, but for now it is impossible to &quot;own&quot; plant species. That being said, big pharma must compete with individual growers of Kratom to make money: the market is split. With Kratom out of the way though, only pharmacies are capable of producing complex chemicals (which can be patented!). And since there is no alternative, they can charge whatever they want for the product.</p>

<p>A month&#39;s supply of Kratom (assuming 3g dose/day) would cost, in Canada, around 50$. A month&#39;s supply of pharmaceutical-grade opiates cost upwards of $1000. Not to mention the damage opiates cause to the body, more specifically the liver and kidneys.</p>

<p>With this, you can now see why Cannabis is Illegal.
You can now see why Psyllocibin Mushrooms are illegal.
You can now see why DMT-rich plants are Illegal.
You can now see why coca leaves are illegal.</p>

<p>Because you CANNOT patent a species, the only way to make money is to remove it from the market and provide a substitute, regardless of the medical risks the drugs pose. This is a win-win for everyone except the people. Big Pharma makes a quick buck off of addicts and the sick, Private Prison Complex makes cash from incarcerating people for owning a plant (govt subsidies &amp; etc.), DEA gets cash from cash/product seizures as well as Govt. grants for &quot;fighting the rise in drug crime!&quot;, Big Govt gets cash from political donations and sponsorships. Meanwhile the public pays the price, both financially and physically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DEA and FDA involvement is so sketchy. They set it as an emergency ban with outright false information, kept it secret until daya ago so citizens couldn&#39;t organize a united front in time, and they&#39;re refusing to permit any public comment because it is &quot;unnecessary.&quot; They&#39;ve clearly overstepped their power, and I keep telling myself that the organizations and lawyers looking at this have a fighting chance, just as they fought and won at the state level over the past year ( see NC and FL I believe). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get back on Big Pharma&#39;s puppet strings to manage my chronic pain, but they&#39;ve taken my alternative away. Not that this is anything new, but we can&#39;t trust those in power to give a fuck about our quality of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actuallly worse than that--worse than the &#39;money motivation&#39; aspect of what you&#39;re proposing.  Although that IS true, everything you&#39;ve said is factual, and therefore it&#39;s easy to make that statement that they &#39;cannot patent a plant&#39; and therefore they fight it as a competitor to their other drugs, but it&#39;s actually, far, far darker agenda at play.</p>

<p>OP, I&#39;m going to throw out some things your mind might immediately reject (might, you seem smarter than that), but I can back it up with source if you require.  For brevity I&#39;m just going to say them and it might come across as glib and inflammatory</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/41yzur/nih_study_shows_that_three_repeated_sessions_of/">Psychedelics cure opiate addictions</a>.  Ibogaine, for example, cures opiate addiction with 50-75% success.  It&#39;s not a good choice because its dangerous (cardiac).  Ayahuasca, psilocybin may work much better because they are safer (<a href="http://maps.org">maps.org</a> has data on this) for curing addiction.  Preliminary info is astoundingly promising).  Ketamine also works for <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/41yvys/ketamine_psychedelic_therapy_treats_alcohol/">alcohol addition</a>.</li>
<li>Drug dealers of opiates don&#39;t want an antidote on the market--that&#39;s why psychedelics are illegal.  That and they also <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=psychedelics+illegal+mind+control&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">break mind control through cultural conditioning.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3zgj35/cannabidiol_or_cbd_is_a_nonpsychotropic_medical/">The establishment is fighting CBD--cannabidiol</a>, because it&#39;s an alternative, non-addictive painkiller that would compete with their established empire of heroin/opiates/milk of the poppy</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076481-tiny-doses-of-opioid-could-be-first-fast-anti-suicide-drug/">Ketamine works for suicide.  I know this first hand.  Instead, though, they want to push &#39;tiny amounts of opiates&#39; to stop suicide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>from janus face of war on drugs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: But one doesn&#39;t even need to be on painkillers to become hooked on opiates by doctors, since tiny doses of opiods are now being given as a fast anti-suicide drug, despite the fact that a much better drug for treating suicide--ketamine--has already proven itself to be a game-changer in this usage, and it is extraordinarily safe, and far less addictive, if at all. Of course, ketamine is rarely mentioned or lionized in the mainstream media for its merits, and there&#39;s a reason for that: ketamine can cure opiate addiction with 50% efficacy.. A coinflip any heroin addict would take to get off this horrible substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who is &#39;they&#39;?  It&#39;s the fifth columnists within our intelligence agency</p>

<ul>
<li>The CIA work with MI5 to sell cocaine, heroin, cannabis and other drugs around the world.  This link describes the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43xrjd/the_straight_dope_on_painkillers_heroin_gateways/">Janus Face of the War on Drugs</a><br/></li>
<li>They&#39;ve been doing so for a 1000+ yrs (british empire, which was taken over by rome 2000 yrs ago and by germanic-french / normands 1000 yrs ago).  The mentality is empire building.  Empire means ships, ships means mercantile fleet, fleet means tradecraft and tradecraft means contraband.  The templars moved gold, spices, swords, slaves, sex traffic, art, books and drugs.  They&#39;ve been doing this forever.<br/></li>
<li>The above actitivity is now being run by intelligence agencies</li>
<li>Intelligence agencies are international and cooperative--through ECHELON, they share intelligence, which enables them to get away with crime, while everyone believes them to be <em>fighting</em> said crime.<br/></li>
<li>The doublecross is a symbol that means the same as its name, the spies use the double cross, the two X&#39;s, and the double headed eagle to represent their TWOFACED / Janus-faced nature.  They take money from governments, and they double cross them.</li>
<li>Freemasons and elite secret socieites like skull and bones are a networks that coordinate the spies and provide secret meeting places to coordinate wide scale efforts, such as drug / sex / pedo trafficking</li>
<li>Knights of Malta and other knight orders are a privileged gentry class that are entitled to interact with both kings and high level clergy, so they act as a group that &#39;manages&#39; these actitivies, by passing directives down into the freemsaons and secret socieities so as to create a perfect &#39;plausible deniability&#39; for the crown and cross, by having an anonymous, secret network &#39;take care of it&#39;.  In other words, freemasons are outsourced &#39;mercs&#39;  (mercantile / mercenary)</li>
<li>This cadre of drug dealers seems to have divided the world up into different producers: there&#39;s a poppy group (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4gwozu/uk_royalty_saxecoburg_goetha_george_bush_started/">once Vietnam</a>, now it&#39;s Afganistan) and a coca group, a coffee group, a tobacco group and they don&#39;t mingle.  If you grow the wrong thing, the USA will spray it with Monsanto products (see: colombia/mexico poppy fields in the &#39;janus&#39; link)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what bothers me the most about government banning anything. Back in 1918 when the government wanted to ban alcohol they knew that the constitution didn&#39;t give congress the power without an amendment (change to the constitution). In 1919 the 18th Amendment was ratified by 2/3 of the states. In 1920 they banned alcohol and the Prohibition Era began. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s overreaching government doesn&#39;t seem to care what the Constitution says, they simply ban what they want to ban. Not only that but congress doesn&#39;t even pass a law or get involved with these bans. They let non-elected alphabet departments like the ATF, FDA, EPA, etc. make the laws telling us what we can and can&#39;t have. This leaves the citizens with no representation (voice) on what is legal or illegal to own.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way it works is a company will research what kratom does and then mimic it synthetically. Then the next phase of the game is to get the plant banned so that their profits are maximized.

<p>Please sign even if you don&#39;t use kratom. There are many people who use kratom to treat legit health conditions like chronic pain, Crohn&#39;s disease, and anxiety. And, of course, there are the ex-heroin addicts who are using kratom to stay off the hard stuff. There&#39;s going to be a lot of suffering and even deaths if the DEA&#39;s decision goes through.</p>

<p>Additionally, the American National Kratom Association&#39;s <a href="http://www.americankratom.org/national_call_to_action">National Call of Action</a> page has a list of government officials you can contact to voice your complaints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FDA is doing the same thing to vaping for Big T. Destroy the market thriving outside of the massive corporations based on false pretense  &quot;save the kids!&quot; and scientific data funded by Tobacco companies. Meanwhile ignoring the peer reviewed studies showing opposite results. Than kill the competition via enormous fees to get products approved that a small business cannot possibly afford. </p>

<p>It&#39;s completely ludicrous. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Big T vaping products get grandfathered in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone I know who has been down the Kratom Path now can&#39;t function a single day or half day without dosing.  It is as addicting as opiates come and turned many I know into dependents in denial constantly spouting how much good it does them and pushing it on people without telling them any of the bad parts because they deny it has any and note its legality as reason to believe it isn&#39;t that bad.</p>

<p>truth be told no substance should be illegal but kratom is far worse than pot</p>
