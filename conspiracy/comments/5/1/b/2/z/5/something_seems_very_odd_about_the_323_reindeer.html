       I find that story difficult to believe. I have never heard of lightning strikes killing hundreds of people or animals like that..and if that happened, why do the ones in the photo not show signs of massive burns? Strikes often exceed 500,000 volts and the air temperatures generated can be 30,000 degrees Celsius or higher - nearly twice the heat needed to melt steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that quite a few of those reindeer would have been burned beyond recognition, but I could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       When lightning strikes a tree it often vaporizes the sap instantly. The tree literally explodes from the generated steam and enormous heat. I have been unable to find even one recorded instance of multiple simultaneous deaths from a lightning strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous strikes over a centralized area have been known to kill dozens of people individually, like the lightning that killed 70 to 90 people in India -- but
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       all at the same time, so how could that happen to 323 animals at once?
      </p>

       I'm not a scientist or meteorologist so if anyone can explain, please post. Thanks!

       They bunch up in storms, they were wet. There are photos of cattle, 40 plus head killed by lightening hiding under some low trees. Another around a metal feeding bin and I looked hard to see if I could find massive burns in all those photos. I didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       It most likely exited through their hooves? Or kinda boiled their wet innards? I also questioned it but don't see anything.

       So, I'm not far behind you in years, a toddler when JFK was shot. It really had a tremendous impact on my father and when Nam went hot, his two eldest sons were both gonna hit 1-A...we left Texas headed to the Alaskan bush. That had a tremendous impact on all my families lives!
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad had already looked at John Birch stuff prior to leaving Texas. There was never a dull conversation allowed.

       When 9/11 hit, I knew it was extreme BS but my life was upside down. When I finally had time, and hi-speed internet to look closer, I never felt more alone, fearful, outraged and lost!

       Over six years now in here, many of the original people were incredibly helpful, considerate, often giving other angles and resources to check! There are some great people in here still! We don't always agree or view things the same but we can still pull one another along!

       I'm always happy to hear stories like this. Many of us who believe there are alternative stories, and that the MSM is complete bullshit, seem to feel alone often. We are typically NOT surrounded by like minded, openly minded, individuals at work - rather they are all of the sheep mentality and what's worst, if you trip and tell any one of them the smallest alternative story, you might as well kiss your job goodbye...

       There were seven children, two adults, so it was an exodus process. Three teen boys and four girls, my father and stepmother. It was one helluva adventure from point

       According to the story for this particular case the animals were in an area "50 to 80 meters in diameter" and were killed by "ground currents". About as plausible as the 9/11 myth of buildings brought down by planes.  But why?

       I thought so too. The number reported by several MSM outlets (in Norway) was actually
       <em>
        322
       </em>
       . Given how this number is prominently featured in the Skull &amp; Bones logo and given how important

       seems to be to the Illuminati, I immediately became suspicious when I saw the first media reports on this event.

      <p>
       Several experts said they'd never seen anything like it, and couldn't explain how this happened. The official explanation is lightning, but some experts seemed hesitant to even suggest such a thing.

       That 322 thing is really very interesting. I doubted the official story (obviously) enough to make the post. It did not add up, especially after I found no other incident, on that scale, of multiple deaths from lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I see how manipulating and lying our media and govt are, the more I doubt much of what I read...and that's sad that you can no longer have trust. It is all too "big brother" and secret organizations.

       What strikes me as odd is why, when all the local Norwegian sources cited precisely 322 reindeer, the UK/US media stories all reported it as 323 (because they sure as hell didn't fly someone over to Hardangervidda to do a re-count).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the whole lightning strike excuse is fishy. You can see from the images, the dead reindeer were spread out over a wide area - not huddled, and there is no sign of burning.

       Actually the increase in lightning is a global phenomenon, see the people killed in Bangladesh and France as examples... the question is what is causing this?
      </p>
      <p>
       One theory is that decreased solar wind is interacting with the ionosphere to cause this. Whatever the root cause is probably involving space.

       In February, 13 Bald Eagles were found dead on Washington's Birthday. I figured that was no coincidence either.

       The 322 number set me off on this tangent. Super interesting that the number was changed for the USA.

       Could be a similar situation to what happened to a group of reindeer in northern Siberia about a month ago. Apparently they died from anthrax or something like that

       I have seen articles about people who get struck by lightning and it will travel through their bones and while they may look fine on the outside the bones and tissue next to the bones has been cooked. 
I'm not saying this event with the reindeer is normal or not suspicious but lightning will do a lot of unseen damage.

       Word on the street is it was an assassination attempt on Rudolph. Take out the whole herd with a directed energy weapon, make it look like an accident. The sick bastards probably used his glowing red nose as a target. Prancer has been positioning himself to take over the gang for a while now; it was most likely an inside job.

       This story set my BS meter on overdrive as well.   If you read it all the animals weren't that bunched together, they were spread over an area "50 to 80 meters" and killed by "ground currents".

       A direct strike to a
       <strong>
        single
       </strong>
       person, without being distributed through the ground to hundreds of others, has a 75% survival rate.
      </p>

       I grew up in Florida and went to HS in Tampa, the lightning capital of North America and maybe the world.  Everything outside there gets hit, repeatedly.  Lightning rods are not 100%, so we had 3 strikes inside the house.   If it can kill hundreds of things at once when conducted by the ground, how is everything in Florida not dead?

       The REALLY WEIRD story is the HUGE group of animals that died/ are dying in Siberia... Many think some sort of virus was thawed from the ice as temperatures continue to rise.

       They must be testing a new death ray.
I seen this one video where middle eastern citizens are on the side of the road with a car and a beam of light homes from the sky and everything just gets disintegrated or something like that.. I don't know what video that was there or where it is but it was some sort of a death ray
