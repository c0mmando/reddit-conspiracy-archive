       Impossible to say everything. But I hear what you are trying to say. They are both terrible choices. We get 50 choices for Miss America and 2 to 4 for president.. not a great system.

       He's a fraud because he's a smart businessman that has simply taken advantage of the piss poor policies put in place by greedy 1%ers and crooked politicians lining their own pockets?
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough Trump bashing, he's admitted that he has done things he's not proud of because it was better for business (including having Trump clothing line made in China).

       Answer me this, outside of an ego boost what exactly would DJT benefit from by becoming president?  Now Hillary?  Exactly

       He has money he should have by selling products and services people wanted.  Please explain to me how a career civil servant who farms nothing, makes nothing, provides no service becomes worth 200 million USD?

       He is not a 'smart businessman'. He's a crook who gets rich by stiffing his contractors and suppliers, then declaring bankruptcy when the venture collapses in on itself. If he's so smart why isn't he a lot richer? Seriously. If he had invested his inheritance in FTSE 100 companies and left it there he would now be TWICE as rich as he says he is. He is an ignorant loud-mouth, a bully, and a petty tyrant. The entire world outside America hates him.

       If I had to guess, I'd say that in the past he's done what  MOST business men do and manipulated his taxes "within the law" to pay
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       below what he was supposed to. He's probably seen how it's derailed other campaigns and has decided to take a stand there

       Trump has real, active business investments. Not just money on a stock or the such. If the huge well financed anti-Trump attack machine got a hold of Trump's business details they could attempt to damage them. Think of the headlines during the election "Trump's current business deals are failing, do we want him as president?"...After they sabotage his business deals...   This is my opinion.

       This is already out in the open - Trump's constant business failures and pay-for-play schemes are all over the news, Clinton's constant pay-for-play makes mainstream news...both candidates use their "charitable" foundations for graft and bribery...but for some reason, no one fucking cares.

       Has it ever been any more obvious than in this election cycle that these people are literally just actors?  And not even good ones.  I start to think that maybe they're such babbling buffoons on purpose just as a test of how gullible the public is.  If it is indeed a test, I think we've failed and are failing pretty spectacularly.

       His income and the fact that he pays no taxes is my bet. Also, where the money he does take in comes from (don't forget who has bailed him out in the past -

       oligarchs) - they're likely not the only ones. If you look at his giving to his "charitable" foundation, he stops giving very much in
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-portrait-of-trump-the-donor-free-rounds-of-golf-but-no-personal-cash/2016/04/10/373b9b92-fb40-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb_story.html">

       and stops giving at all in 2009. He was likely using big donations to his foundation to reduce his tax burden - so we can assume he found other ways of doing this around that time. He received the STARS exemption, which is only given to those with incomes less than 500k, so we can assume he managed to get his income down past that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - someone recently mentioned many of his companies are S-corps, so income passes through - so releasing his tax returns would show also how horrifically they've done, how deep in debt, etc. and would likely show some shadiness. There's a likely reason he's been audited for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, though, I care less about this and more about the fact that most of the country is covering up and justifying either his or Clinton's every fraud and crime. What does this say about us?
