<p>Enough Trump bashing, he&#39;s admitted that he has done things he&#39;s not proud of because it was better for business (including having Trump clothing line made in China).  </p>

<p>Answer me this, outside of an ego boost what exactly would DJT benefit from by becoming president?  Now Hillary?  Exactly</p>

<p>He has money he should have by selling products and services people wanted.  Please explain to me how a career civil servant who farms nothing, makes nothing, provides no service becomes worth 200 million USD? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His income and the fact that he pays no taxes is my bet. Also, where the money he does take in comes from (don&#39;t forget who has bailed him out in the past - <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/saudi-billionaire-responds-to-trumps-photoshopped-attack-i-bailed-you-out-twice/">Saudi</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-2016-russian-ties-214116">Russian</a> oligarchs) - they&#39;re likely not the only ones. If you look at his giving to his &quot;charitable&quot; foundation, he stops giving very much in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-portrait-of-trump-the-donor-free-rounds-of-golf-but-no-personal-cash/2016/04/10/373b9b92-fb40-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb_story.html">2007</a> and stops giving at all in 2009. He was likely using big donations to his foundation to reduce his tax burden - so we can assume he found other ways of doing this around that time. He received the STARS exemption, which is only given to those with incomes less than 500k, so we can assume he managed to get his income down past that.</p>

<p>Also - someone recently mentioned many of his companies are S-corps, so income passes through - so releasing his tax returns would show also how horrifically they&#39;ve done, how deep in debt, etc. and would likely show some shadiness. There&#39;s a likely reason he&#39;s been audited for many years.</p>

<p>At this point, though, I care less about this and more about the fact that most of the country is covering up and justifying either his or Clinton&#39;s every fraud and crime. What does this say about us?</p>

<p>Both candidates are supremely, fucking <em>comically</em> unfit. They&#39;re both crooks and liars. How the hell did we get here? </p>
