       If it's ever brought up as a subject, which is rarely, it is often poo-pooed quickly and ignored.  I've even seen the argument that if we all stood shoulder to shoulder in one place, we wouldn't take up much space.  That's not why overpopulation is an issue.  It's an issue because of
       <strong>
        finite resources
       </strong>
       and damage to the environment.  I really would like to see some thoughts on this matter.  Thank you.

       I'm not saying that.  But I personally opted not to bring another person into this world.  Neither did my SO.  It needs to become trendy.  In only about 50 years, we could have a lot fewer people.  I know it'll never happen though.  There's far too much religious bullshit wrapped up in the topic.

       You're playing into their hands. Being self serving but believing you're being kind to some unborn child. Meanwhile they reduce their competition without having to lift a finger. Your mind isn't yours at this point, you're going to be depressed soon enough and you won't know why. It's because you're not thinking or acting on your behalf.

       They profit from scarcity. It's simple economics with a fear multiplier. Scarcity is real but so is the waste and price controls used by government to "manage" it. Everyone In The world currently could live comfortably in Texas, do you realize how much land that leaves for food production?

       By forcing people to destroy products to keep prices artificially high they keep a tight grip on economies. That's a big part of the reason China pisses them off. China floods the market with cheap shit driving down prices and they aren't happy with that.

       If they can convince enough of us that there are too many people then they can justify high costs for living, wars, famines, and all sorts of sadistic shit.

       Our resources are destroyed and limited because of evolution. As we evolved into a greedy industrial based capitalist society we begin to horde and drain resources quicker than our population grew.
      </p>

       You have two choices. Kill off a large portion of the population or stop being greedy fucks. It will probably end up being the first.

       It's pretty clear this is a completely taboo topic.  One everyone thinks about, but can't admit to themselves.  Our population has doubled in my lifetime.  "Answers" here are so silly it's pathetic, taking into account only humans, not our ecosystem and other species.  I was even accused of being agenda 21, and told to kill myself several times.  So much for rational discussion.  I have even less hope our problems will ever be solved.

       Overpopulation is going to be ignored until the last of the Jews hated enemy, the white race, is extinguished, then the rest of the worlds population will be ruthlessly managed, like a farm. It's the  the Zionist global slave state. Right now it's being used as a weapon to drown out Europeans.

       It's not about just food though, but point taken.  We do waste a lot.  There are other species, and they all play a part.
