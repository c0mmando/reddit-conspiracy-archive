       Personally how would you feel if someone you love wasn't letting you control them? Your crush making love to your worst enemy? Your mother cheating on your father? Your brother sleeping with your girlfriend? Your leader acting with infidelity and deceit? Loving too intensely, too much or without stopping is unhealthy and induces suffering like jealousy, fear, hatred and feelings of betrayal. The intensity of the emotion does not determine the quality of it. The quality is determined by how well the role you love something for matches it's expected behavior. The key to staying in love without suffering is being open to changes in the role you love by relaxing your emotions then releasing them again on the new role. The higher the intensity of your love the more psychological damage changes to your loved roles does. A static emotional orientation towards a role makes change without suffering impossible. We have the ability to be totally open to changes in roles of what we love when we are relaxed, but the more intense the emotions you have towards the roles you're expecting the more difficult and painful these changes become. This process is the same for all emotions and the roles filled with them. I say take every emotion to every level, explore every role and path so you can find out what it means to be human, but if we don't relax after we've sensed our current roles we can't adapt to new ones and end up damaged that way. A lot of people intuitively know how to relax in order to do this, but manipulative people will intentionally let you down slowly before changing into someone else in order to keep you from attacking them. Change to much or too fast outside your expected role and tribalistic instincts like aggression kick in. The government is getting us to stop caring first before they change things by intentionally being disappointing. Once we are mostly indifferent and disappointed the Clintons can substitute any new form of government they want and we will be greatful for it. If they changed without letting us down first we would attack them.

       I didn't like this government from the start and I definately won't like any other forms of Government. Government is an institute that commits some of the worse war and humanity crimes imaginable.

       If Wikipedia isn't up to your rigorous standards, find a dictionary and look up 'machine'.

       The original claim was that our consciousness does not exist in machines.

       I use my body every day to transmit force. This is my proof, anecdotal though it may be.

       Evidence of that, not that the body is a machine. It's not technic nicely a machine, at least not by Merriam Webster or oxfods definition, but I understand what you're getting at.

       Well my evidence, is that neither in waking, dreaming, meditation, or through the consumption of copious amounts of hallucinogens, have I ever experienced consciousness outside of my observable body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which may merely be evidence of how deep within illusion I am trapped.

       Does that mean machines? And for future reference, not that I'm disagreeing with you, but that would be considered self testimony which is far from reliable. It's why we don't trust every dude that says he experiences some divine intervention

       Based on that definition I would say my observation leads me to believe that my body is indeed a machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on my only having experienced consciousness from within this body, I'm left to assume that this body contains this consciousness.

       Weigh it against your experience.

       If there is a way to experience consciousness from a different point of reference then return and retain memory I'd really like to try it.

       We won't get there. As robots begin to replace more and more jobs virtual reality of somekind will probably take over. As the government is a greedy and dominating institute this virtual reality or whatever system comes next will be used to brainwash individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind control has become a reality. The basics are already perfected give them 10 years and they will be able to brainwash masses of people through frequencys (if they cannot already).

       Government is becoming a serious threat with a serious arsenal of control. Our future is in danger and our ability to fight back is becoming non-existent.

       For sure it's an edited repost from something I wrote earlier. The word love can be substituted for any feeling towards anything that has a role in your life. Bill and Hillary are a one two punch. Bill lowered the presidencies expectations by cheating on his wife, lying about it and still being excepted. Hillary is doing it already with email scandals. They are going to keep lowering the bar until we are ready to except any solution. They are trying to overthrow the government.

       No they are the government. Government is filled with people like them. Corrupt, greedy liars reign surpreme in all government agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't trash this government because its already a criminal shithole. You can't trash a criminal shithole it trashes itself. The next government we be another "great step forward" for about 10-20 years until very slowly the cracks begin to show again and reveal underneath what kind of scum is directing the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government attracts greed and corruption, it enhances the class divide and even adds a new layer (political class). It helps the rich dominate the poor legally, It brainwashes the masses by creating a trust then abusing it and turning everyone against everyone else so their given truth becomes the only accpetable truth.

       Government needs to die.

       Most people have already fully embraced their new governors, tv and the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our existing government does an excellent job of cracking down on those who don't fully embrace a docile life in front of the screens.

      <p>
       If you look to government for a solution you'll always find yourself living at its whim.
