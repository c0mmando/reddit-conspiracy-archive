        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Personally how would you feel if someone you love wasn&#39;t letting you control them? Your crush making love to your worst enemy? Your mother cheating on your father? Your brother sleeping with your girlfriend? Your leader acting with infidelity and deceit? Loving too intensely, too much or without stopping is unhealthy and induces suffering like jealousy, fear, hatred and feelings of betrayal. The intensity of the emotion does not determine the quality of it. The quality is determined by how well the role you love something for matches it&#39;s expected behavior. The key to staying in love without suffering is being open to changes in the role you love by relaxing your emotions then releasing them again on the new role. The higher the intensity of your love the more psychological damage changes to your loved roles does. A static emotional orientation towards a role makes change without suffering impossible. We have the ability to be totally open to changes in roles of what we love when we are relaxed, but the more intense the emotions you have towards the roles you&#39;re expecting the more difficult and painful these changes become. This process is the same for all emotions and the roles filled with them. I say take every emotion to every level, explore every role and path so you can find out what it means to be human, but if we don&#39;t relax after we&#39;ve sensed our current roles we can&#39;t adapt to new ones and end up damaged that way. A lot of people intuitively know how to relax in order to do this, but manipulative people will intentionally let you down slowly before changing into someone else in order to keep you from attacking them. Change to much or too fast outside your expected role and tribalistic instincts like aggression kick in. The government is getting us to stop caring first before they change things by intentionally being disappointing. Once we are mostly indifferent and disappointed the Clintons can substitute any new form of government they want and we will be greatful for it. If they changed without letting us down first we would attack them.</p>

<p>Government attracts greed and corruption, it enhances the class divide and even adds a new layer (political class).
