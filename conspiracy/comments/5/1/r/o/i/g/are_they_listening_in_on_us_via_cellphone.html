I started to notice that whenever I said something to someone else about maybe trying out x or y sometime, I&#39;d coveniently got e-mails, ads or flyers promoting a deal for x or y. Even when I didn&#39;t Google it or text someone about it or anything like that. Just a simple mention in a conversation. Could be about Credit cards, jewelry, going to a specific gym, ice cream, items of clothing, recipes with specific ingredients, you name it. Then I realised that every single time I had my cellphone nearby..<br/>
So it got me thinking. Would they just record everything we&#39;re saying, pick up specific words then automatically send us some form of advertising about it? Is that even legal (I&#39;m living in Europe)?<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this or am I just completely paranoid?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short story:  We dropped my son off at college. It was a very large apartment complex, off campus, with stores, restaurants, and offices at the ground floor level.</p>

<p>We grabbed lunch at Bobby&#39;s Burgers.  Ordered, took our seats, my phone in hand.  We began discussing Bob&#39;s Burgers vs Bobby&#39;s Burgers, when my wife made the connection and said, &quot;Oh... Bobby Flay&quot;.</p>

<p>After a short discussion about who the hell Bobby Flay was, I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it, so opened my phone, typed in a &quot;Bo&quot; and up comes all the suggestions:  &quot;Bobby Flay, Bobby Flay&#39;s Burger Empire, Bobby&#39;s Burgers...&quot;</p>

<p>Wifi and Location are always OFF on my phone, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to freak my wife out because I&#39;ve showed her four of five instances just like this, recently.  There&#39;s probably and reasonable explanation, somewhere... But on the surface, it just really looks like they&#39;re listening.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well you can upgrade that theory to fact, because that patent has been on the books for some time now.</p>

<p>And yes, they do listen in on your conversations in multiple ways. You don&#39;t even need the phone to have physical power (though that is highly dependent on the internal wiring of the phone.) in order to use it for directed surveillance (They are already targeting you, and your phone is on you, but powered off.)</p>

<p>Lots of passive methods exist, which exploit, primarily, the app marketplaces for Apple, Android, etc. markets. There are quite a few LLC that make &quot;games&quot; that are just fronts for &quot;you know who.&quot;</p>

<p>Companies also use this for the reasons you describe, but the reason it is allowed, so prevalent, so well protected legally, is to allow for more pervasive spying. Always wrapped in plausible deniability...</p>

<p>And they are proud of their prevalent surveillance... and honestly, it is impressive. It&#39;s also insane and tyrannical, but it&#39;s still impressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is weird. I think Signal may be the only app I really keep up to date. I know all of the Google apps I remove, and don&#39;t use, try to update all the time. I don&#39;t use Chrome on here, please F off.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one reason I think the only real solution, is a fully open source, encrypted, cell phone. (We had that for a while, then a few people died... and everyone forgot about it.) Open source hardware schematics, and DIYs so we could buy verifiable components, and build our own damn phones, and load our own damn community firmware and OS onto the phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup. It is blatently obvious if you log into fb via chrome instead of app. Advertisements connected to conversations had seems to pop up all the time. Example: I had a random conversation about boat licences in Norway. The phone was switched on but for some reason I hadnt even put in the password when I had that conversation. I am not into boats, have never googled boats or anything related to boats. I log into my phone, open fb in chrome and the first ad was offering me boat licencing opportunities in the area??? getting creepy</p>
