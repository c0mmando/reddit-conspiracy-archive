       Gobekeli Tepe is dated back to 10,000 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are civilizations found off the coast of India which go back even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's now becoming clear that advanced civilizations ( more advanced than we are now ) most likely have come and gone maybe more than once in Earth's history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this disprove the Bible?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to think the Bible was one of the many ideas of control by the people who own the world. Because it was created by them, they have created the ending, which they are currently carrying out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have done this before and I think they told us this in plain sight in the scene from matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Neo is speaking to the architect and he is saying how the matrix was reset 3 times because the balance was off and the people in the matrix resisted ..
      </p>
      <p>
       Art imitating life no doubt, humans in this version are pushing back against the system as the religious control mechanism isn't functioning as it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient Egyptians had their society reset no doubt before us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are everyone's thoughts on the architects of our reality, the matrix connection and the role of the bible in this reality.

       The Jewish and Hopi (and for all I know others) peoples both say there were four or five "worlds" before this one. Even the Bible says there were times before our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear SOMETHING was going on with the movement of huge, carved stones, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm increasingly thinking this world is a flawed creation of a demiurge, an inherently broken material balance of the "Good" and "Evil" that humanity discerned through some original sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Christian, I've resigned myself to the fact that God is far far far beyond my comprehension. God has tried to connect with me, and humankind, in a way that we can understand. And yet many still do not understand, Including, perhaps, me.

       the reality is, no civilization in humanities history has survived, all are doomed and fail from the start, no matter what the ideology, beliefs, religion, spirituality, or none of the above, it doesn't matter what we base our societies on, the fact remains, it has a shelf life and will end. The bravado that people believe we now live in an indestructible society is based solely on the lack of knowledge of the past, Every Society Ends, no matter what. This world will collapse just like the Romans, just like the Egyptians and those who came before them, whether man made or just natural events taking course, the end will come and something new will come along. the only thing a bible changes, is the hopes that when the new society comes along, the religion will survive through them when one or more pick up the religion and spread it.

       The Bible and the Matrix are equally true. They are both allegorical tales. One is used to control stupid people, the other makes stupid people think they have seen behind the veil. Which one are you?

       You're a bit quick to say "no doubt" there. For something to have no doubt, you gotta have some strong evidence. Which you've yet to say what that is.

       My reasoning for saying they were wiped out. Look at their civ, it's lost. Pyramids in shambles. Their pyramids on grand canyon defaced and in ruin. Not longer stationed in Australia. No longer around in Kentucky and Arizona.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they were wiped out similar to the American Indians and just like the Indians they were given a piece of land to call their own when they used to be wide spread.

       Egyptian civilisation was in Aus?

      <p>
       So far all you've said that the Egyptian civilisation is now lost. But that doesn't justify your claim the no doubt had their society reset. Civilisations come and go, doesn't mean something reset them.

       Of course not. The Flood in the Bible is the historic account of the Younger Dryas event that flooded the entire world at the end of the last Ice Age. Civilization is quite plainly recognized to have existed before The Flood.

       Smoke weed and take magic mushrooms, they're natural and they definitely helped me uncover it. People claim they have bad trips on such things but I think it's because they don't have open enough minds. I've never had a bad trip, I've been forced to think about a bad thing once but that's because I was neglectful to it. Grew off of it, I used to smoke da ganja every day but now I don't do anything except eat very healthy and I feel great :) Will go back to the ganja soon tho. But I do actually suggest it when/if you are in a good state of mind.

       Again, complete bullshit. Watch Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age and Revelation of the Pyramids. Not a damn thing about the First Civilization was more advanced than what we have now. At

       –and this is just complete conjecture–it could have just been on the cusp of hitting the Iron Age, maybe, and only in parts of its expanse.

       so what you're saying is, the reality that the pyramids and other structures along the planet, many of which were pre-deluge, aligning and otherwise encoding complicated mathematical ideas well past the threshold of "random" isn't evidence of a global, pre-deluge civ?  mmhmm.  whatever you say.

       well it's good that you admit there was a prior global civ.  that's a starting point.  your statement that there is no evidence of them being more advanced i'd think is a bit off the mark.  they were advanced enough to have a global civ.  they were advanced enough to align their monuments with great mathemetical precision according to a non-obvious, non-trivial arrangement that encoded phi, pi, the sizes of the moon, sun and earth, and the speed of light.  they were advanced enough to build giant monuments that we have yet to do anything equivalent to.  sounds rather advanced.

       And so you're illiterate or something? The page itself disproves you, and this is ✡Wikipedia✡ we're talking about here.

       I don't think your giving humanity enough credit. The fact that you buy the narrative that the Giza pyramids were just tombs is just wrong.

       so what you're saying is, the reality that the pyramids and other structures along the planet, many of which were pre-deluge, aligning and otherwise encoding complicated mathematical ideas well past the threshold of "random" isn't evidence of a global, pre-deluge civ?  mmhmm.  whatever you say.
