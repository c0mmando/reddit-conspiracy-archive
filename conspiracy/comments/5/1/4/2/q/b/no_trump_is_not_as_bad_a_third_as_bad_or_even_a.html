If you don&#39;t like Trump, great. But stop acting like he is the Republican counterpart to Hillary. You are just insulting everyone&#39;s intelligence. He is against most all of the negative policies that she supports, and it is a fact that simply cannot be argued. Just looks at the scandals that are practically dripping off Hillary&#39;s body every single damn week and look at the media strain at Trump gnats while swallowing Clinton camels. Get a grip on reality, please.</p>

Pro carbon tax, open borders, pro TPP, anti gun veep, wants more refugees. 
In an interview last week he sounded more like Lena Dunham than Jesse Ventura when whining about the term &quot;illegal immigrants &quot;
I honestly think most of the people voting for Johnson have no idea what he stands for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes he absolutely is as bad.  So how about you people get a grip on reality for once instead of ignoring all of trumps absolutely awful policies because you like stupid frog cartoons.  </p>

<p>I do not support Patriot act.  I do not support NSA.  Trump supports both of those things.  </p>

<p>I do not support a 40% tax cut for the wealthiest 0.1%.  Trump does. </p>

<p>Trump wants to support Israel and give them more money. </p>

<p>I do not support putting more boots on the ground in the middle east, I do not support the drone program like trump does and like you people apparently do so why the fuck would I support trump or ever stop bad mouthing the ignorant bozo?</p>

<p>His policies are god awful.  And if not then prove me wrong.  Go ahead and show us all how wonderful his policies are!</p>

<p>I am the only one who knows how I want the country to be run. Every political party have some views that I don&#39;t like. Every party &#39;makes mistakes&#39; since no one is perfect.</p>

<p>And whenever I say to people that I don&#39;t want to vote for any particular party, they judge me as &#39;Against the democracy! - would you rather have a dictatorahip?&#39; No one really thinks about the bigger picture in this situation, they only think about &#39;our roads suck so we should vote for these guys!&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality I see is that Trump has been intentionally prepped for a presidential run for a very long time. He&#39;s been inserted into the daily lives of US citizens for over 30 years. He&#39;s an &quot;established&quot; name in politics since he was inserted into the 9/11 story. He&#39;s been prepped for this run by the establishment media(CIA), who trained him during his television show.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anyone here who has said they would vote for Hillary. It&#39;s a moot point to compare the two. Seriously, what established conspiracy contributor has tried to persuade you to vote for her?</p>

<p>The problem is that you think you are choosing the lesser of two evils but they are just heads of the same beast. Their masters are the same and they both bend the knee to the bosses who control their fortune and power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is this framed as an either or?  They are both horrible.  I wouldn&#39;t vote for Hillary Clinton if you put a loaded gun to my head and threatened my life.  Same goes for Trump.  First off, I don&#39;t like Trump because he is a divider.  We already had plenty of that with 8 yrs of Obama, and look at the state of race relations in America today.  A leader needs to be able to unite poeple, not stoke racial tensions for sport.  If Trump somehow made it into the White House it would be an unmitigated disastor for race relations in America.  At a time when we desparately need to come together, he would tear us apart.</p>

<p>Further, Trump has zero experience in government.  Zero.  Nada.  Zilch.  The way his campaign is being run there is absolutely no way the Electoral College will annoint him, unless you replace it en masse with a bunch of White Nationalists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this election is we actually have a sane choice...someone who <em>is</em> demonstrably qualified for the job, with a track record of success in both buinsess <em>and</em> government, someone who isn&#39;t known as a prolific liar, and someone who&#39;s mental and phsyical health is not in question. </p>

<p>Gary Johnson in 2016!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy, he&#39;s anti-immigration, anti-TPP, and anti-criminality. All things that HIllary supports. I believe that he can keep his word, provided that the people who put him in power hold him accountable. But I don&#39;t think he will have much trouble doing so anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen Donald Trump in other contexts, long before this election.  Not a lot, perhaps; but enough for me to feel entirely certain that he is colluding with the Clintons, and he made an agreement with them to forfeit the election in order for Hillary to win, so that it would still appear that Hillary won legitimately, while in fact being a dictator.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes that Trump is a serious or genuine candidate has been deceived.  I am not going to call you names, insult you, or be vindictive towards you, because I know that a lot of otherwise very well intentioned people have fallen for this; but let me assure you that both Trump and Bernie were decoys, and neither of them were intended to win.</p>

<p>There is a permanent aristocracy in Washington, and said aristocracy decides who is going to become President.  The only real reason why they have attempted to make it appear as though there were a few more &quot;independent&quot; candidates this time, is because they screwed up with W in particular, and their preselection process became a little too transparent.  So they had to insert a few more figures this time, in order to create a more realistic pretense of actual choice.</p>

<p>However, in reality the whole thing is controlled, and it always has been.  Go and look up the genealogy of sitting Presidents; the evidence is there.  American democracy does not exist, and never has.</p>

<p>Trump hurt some feelings with the truth.</p>

<p>There is no way to compare the two, Hillary is a psychopath megalomaniac</p>
