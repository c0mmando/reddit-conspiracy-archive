      <p>
       I'm working on a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity is currently farmed for parts, blood, testing, toys or maybe even pets.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past we were slaves with absolutely no rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to slave conditions, the slaves rebelled or weren't usable for the purpose required, due to stress levels. ( animals in captivity have high stress levels and don't act natural ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The slaves in captivity were also no good for testing ( pharmaceutical, psychological, ect ) because once again, knowing they were in bondage didn't act natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past our masters used free energy ( the pyramids of Giza, the pyramids of the grand canyon ) or maybe the pyramids were used as off world communication devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       They realized the free energy model of the human zoo wouldn't work. People had too much time to expand their conscious and humanity when there was unlimited free energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids in the grand canyon were destroyed and the history hidden for obvious purposes. It was then gutted and we were told it was water erosion ( it wasn't ). Most don't even know there were ancient Egyptian pyramids in the Grand Canyon.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next iteration of slavery we were given the illusion of free will and the illusion of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why all presidents are decided for us and this is why we are told we live on a globe and not a limited flat encloser. We are contained in a controlled environment. This is why NASA lies about space. Think of it as a huge terrarium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whomever runs this place is able to flood it and start over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how many times this process had to be restarted with changes made to keep the illusion of free will working nominally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of religion and free will was most likely started by our masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling this iteration is about to come to an end because they are losing control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think a certain bloodline of people  are gatekeepers of this place. Maybe they have direct contact/connections with the owners of this place off world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the gatekeepers have a guide on how this whole thing plays out ( the bible end times  ). Even though it's not true, they have to follow this storyline. It's the blueprints they were given to start the next iteration of this human zoo we are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Masons, the satanists and wealthy Jesuits are pawns for something bigger. They are the curtain hiding the wizard of Oz. Some of them might not even know the true extent of the situation and be involved for strictly religious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bunch of fail-safes to not see who is really running the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids line up to star constellations for a reason. These pyramids are all over the earth. Our masters tell us they are just tombs and they hide the real history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how many times resets were performed. Their goal is to have a natural habitat where the human doesn't suspect containment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is trickling out so I suspect a reset soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many just think this is rich greedy people behind this. I think it's much bigger than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spit balling here, I think that CERN is a working portal device. Probably to usher gatekeepers to other areas in the universe. Maybe to areas the pyramids point to in the sky. I think off world civilizations exist and gatekeepers are in the know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole CERN sacrifice thing is just disinformation to make people think satanists are behind this. It's a show to hide what is really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live on a prison planet or plane or who the fuck knows. Some advanced space terrarium that serves the needs of another advanced civilization. For some reason I don't think we can comprehend how advanced that civilization is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any current tech we have now has been around for probably thousands of years and just trickled out to us to conform to a timeline that's predetermined.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason our masters dont want us knowing that the star Sirius was important to our past. One of the reasons the Sphinx was defaced and the dog head was replaced with a human head. They also never make mention that the pyramids are aligned with a star system. All of them, the ones in Egypt and the ones on North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some more info:

        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOa2eccPVk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This info is buried because it throws off the narrative that ancient Egyptians were a primitive people who didn't travel or expand to other continents. They were highly advanced and harnessed free electricity.

       Replace it with sphere earth. Shit, who says we are even on a sphere or flat plane. Could be a fucking galactic terrarium like prison farm.

       As far as the archon demons are concerned, this is a farm on which they raise humans and make them suffer, which provides the frequency of energy which sustains them. They slaughter a few for the especially delicious suffering of horrible death, but over-all they prefer to keep us alive and producing a small and steady harvest of everyday suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       But perhaps unknown to them, is that their legit rivals, which feed on love and joy, are, under their very noses, developing a genetically superior strain of human that is resistant to their mind control, and naturally loving and joyful, which is even now quietly spreading through their farm.

       I have heard a theory that the way out is not going into the light at death. If you don't go into the light and you know you are the universe you are free maybe. I'm not sure but I believe in the after life and I bet it's filled with deceit just like this life is.

       I'm theorizing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny the bible says it.. but I think the true owners of this planet planted that data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know if the satanists running shit think that. Might just be another pawn in the game. Or maybe the satanists know it's all bullshit but use it as a control mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe God is absolutely real. But being enclosed in a dome, makes me think God could be a humanlike organism larger than the planet with a terrarium on his desk with us in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just imagine what we must look like to a microbe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a dome, and it's not to protect us, but enslave us. The ice walls are to keep us away from it.

       I hate how nobody questions things anymore, everything is taken at face value. I wonder if we've always been this oblivious to things or "they've" just mastered various forms of deception.

      <p>
       Did we try to nuke the dome during the cold war/space race?

       Is this dome selectively permeable? Maybe that's how a bunch of dickheads got into absolute control.

       I mean it would make sense in a "zoo world" kind of way. Would explain our disregard for anything else on this planet and our total evolutionary dominance that seems front-loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Play thing to me sounds vague enough to be misinterpreted; are/were a harvest of sorts perhaps? Maybe both spiritual in a way? They feed off of negative human emotions and all that?

       sounds good. imo, the so-called "junk DNA" has been "activated" for us to wake up, although the EMF's, cell phones/new tech toys, etc. are thwarting this, not to mention the fluoride/chemicals.
