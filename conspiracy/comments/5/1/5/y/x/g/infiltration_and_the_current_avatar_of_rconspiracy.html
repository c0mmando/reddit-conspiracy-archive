       I feel like since conspiracy theories went mainstream, their current agenda is to poison the well so nothing that "conspiracy theorists" talk about turn into anything meaningful and most of it amounts to amusement or entertainment. These people are amongst us in the here and now. Am I the only one who feels this way? Thoughts?

       Yes there's an effort to derail, obfuscate, ambiguate legitimate ideas and groups.  All the time.  They'll copy tactics and try to look like the things they're trying to subvert.  Here's the thing - when you're not acting out of fear, and with genuine care for others, you're led to the truth anyway.   If you seek the truth, you'll thank the disinfoists for any smells (often legitimate!) they send your way.   They're doing legwork for you.  Just don't get caught up in models of division, be responsible-minded, and you'll be fine.

       There is a lot of fear mongering going on here which in itself is bad for your psyche and turns people away or to inaction. I think fear is the achilles heal. While it is necessary to wake people to the urgency of the matters we face, we should be weary of being bogged down with fear!

       Occasionally you find gems, and that's the only reason I come here, to get my share of affirmation. I still am completely unable to do anything about the situation. There are times I tried being vocal, but nothing good ever came out of it. Hence I stopped and am so passive to what is going on lately, putting my energy in my career and future. Sometimes I couldn't give two shits and feel like humanity deserves the fate that is coming for us. I don't really know what else to do. I see so many good people here try to wake people up and inspire and motivate the community. I really admire those people that still put up a fight, but overall its been a downhill slope.

       Here is something I been working on they have really been trying to bury. I think it hits too close to home.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity is used for parts, blood, testing or toys.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past we were straight up slaves. Our masters used free energy ( the pyramids of Giza, the pyramids of the grand canyon ). Eventually, the slaves rebelled or weren't usable for the purpose required due to stress.. ( animals in captivity have high stress levels and don't act natural ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids in the grand canyon were destroyed and the history hidden for obvious purposes. It was then gutted and we were told it was water erosion ( it wasn't ).
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next iteration of slavery we were given the illusion of free will and the illusion of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why all presidents are decided for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are contained in a controlled environment. This is why NASA lies about space. Think of a huge terrarium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whomever runs this joint is able to flood it and start over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how many times this process had to be restarted with changes made to keep the illusion of free will working nominally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of religion and free will was most likely started by our masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling this iteration is about to come to an end because they are losing control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think a certain bloodline of people  are gatekeepers of this place. Maybe they have direct contact/connections with the owners of this place off world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the gatekeepers have a guide on how this whole thing plays out ( the bible end times  ). Even though it's not true, they have to follow this storyline. It's the blueprints they were given to start the next iteration of this human zoo we are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Masons, the satanists and the jews are pawns for something bigger. They are the curtain hiding the wizard of Oz.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bunch of fail-safes to not see who is really running the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids line up to start constellations for a reason. These pyramids are all over the earth. Our masters tell us they are just tombs and they hide the real history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how many times resets were performed. Their goal is to have a natural habitat where the human doesn't suspect containment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is trickling out so I suspect a reset soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many just think this is rich greedy people behind this. I think it's much bigger than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spit balling here, I think that CERN is a working portal device. Probably to usher gatekeepers to other areas in the universe. Maybe to areas the pyramids point to in the sky. I think off world civilizations exist and gatekeepers are in the know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Cern sacrifice thing is just disinformation to make people think satanists are behind this. It's a show to hide what is really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live on a prison planet or plane or who the fuck knows. Some advanced space terrarium that serves the needs of another advanced civilization. For some reason I don't think we can comprehend how advanced that civilization is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any current tech we have now has been around for probably thousands of years and just trickled out to us to conform to a timeline that's predetermined.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason our masters dont want us knowing that the star Sirius was important to our past. One of the reasons the Sphinx was defaced and the dog head was replaced with a human head. They also never make mention that the pyramids are aligned with a star system. All of them, the ones in Egypt and the ones on North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some more info:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This info is buried because it throws off the narrative that ancient Egyptians were a primitive people. They were highly advanced and harnessed free electricity.

       I don't think rejection of Concave Earth theory without investigation necessarily indicates shilling.  It requires a certain world view to begin questioning things like cosmology.  Most people do not consider deceptions of that scale possible so looking at the details is not necessary for them.

       You can also view youtube footage of many others who have done so.  There is a problem with this, however.  The video is a long range visual observation and it must be interpreted in the context of the behavior of light within the atmosphere.  When our brain interprets images it makes the assumption of straight light.
      </p>
      <p>
       But light does not travel in straight lines through the atmosphere, it bends upwards and we need to interpret images with this in mind.  Here is an experiment with surveying devices which demonstrates this behavior:

       I'm not a shill and I believe a lot of things here. But dude the earth is a sphere. For proof you can take photos yourself where mountains or large building are partially hidden due to the curvature on the earth. I will gladly read you proof though and offer counterpoints. I just don't see the point of faking something like the shape of the earth. What does it achieve? I get hiding things like ufo's which I've seen but why would they lie about that? What is the purpose? If the earth was concave we could see things from a much greater distance.

       If you think if it's possibly the other way you realize it'd be the exact same results. The earth is a sphere, but we live on the inside of the earth. You can see too far for us to be on the outside.

       Ships disappear over the horizon because of perspective my friend. You see the ship getting smaller and smaller until it's gone. Why does this simple physics perplex you so much?

       Interesting. I don't believe in NASA and couldn't care enough to find out the true shape of the earth on my own. All I know for fact is that NASA and the space agencies are a lying sack of shit.

       But bummer you can't feel it... not even if you travel across from the equator to the north pole where theoretically you are rotating slower than at the equator. You just have to believe! Sound similar?

       You don't feel it because you are not accelerating, but going a constant speed. It's the exact same thing as going 150 mph on the highway in a car,  from your perspective, if doesn't seem like you are moving.

       No you can't, this is because the human body doesn't feel speed. The human body can only feel acceleration,  whether it is positive or negative acceleration. If all of your senses of sight and hearing where cut off, you would not be able to tell if you where going 50 mph, 200 mph, or completely still.

       So what you're saying is that you don't know what acceleration is.

       Here's a question. I'm in my car doing a steady 100mph. What's my acceleration?

       I'm at the equator spinning at however much mph. What's my acceleration?

       Oh so basically you're saying I will always feel 0 acceleration no matter if i move across the earth which also has its own net acceleration (universe is expanding remember) When I'm travelling at a constant 100 mph, my acceleration is 0. But the second I start speeding up, I should feel positive acceleration, which I do. In much the same way, your acceleration technically increases when you travel up the latitudes. I have a Bach in aerospace engineering and work as a computer programmer. I would like to know your credentials before you accuse me of not knowing what acceleration is lol

       For the nth time, you CAN feel acceleration. Press the pedal harder on your car next time and tell me you "CANT" feel it accelerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why many educated people question the status quo and turn "conspiracy theorists" is because we know more than the average retard that goes on gulping every piece of propaganda they read/watch/hear and confuse indoctrination they receive in school for education. The more you know, the more you know how much you don't know. Its fucking easy to parrot everything you learnt in school. Try questioning the once widely accepted facts, and thats when new discoveries are made. All the great scientists did just that. Are you also naive on how scientific and critical thinking work?

       Oh apparently you're not so quick to the draw with the "retards" now. And apparently you opened up wiki goddamn pedia, realized your embarrassing mistake and edited your previous dismissive comment about me completing the 4th grade.

      <p>
       And now you "don't want to fight"?

        Which is exactly my point. You should feel more acceleration at the equator than the poles.
Buddy, when i'm going at 150mph I can feel myself moving. Not sure what the fuck you are talking about.

       That's not a call for transparency, that's a call for someone to correct you, what the fuck are you on about.

       Anyhow who am I to stop your retreat. Go on.

       You missed the part where I said

       . You truly shouldn't believe everything a

       Stay sane. Don't believe everything you hear. Check sources. Listen to people who prove themselves credible over a long time.

       You can also view youtube footage of many others who have done so.  There is a problem with this, however.  The video is a long range visual observation and it must be interpreted in the context of the behavior of light within the atmosphere.  When our brain interprets images it makes the assumption of straight light.
      </p>
      <p>
       But light does not travel in straight lines through the atmosphere, it bends upwards and we need to interpret images with this in mind.  Here is an experiment with surveying devices which demonstrates this behavior:
