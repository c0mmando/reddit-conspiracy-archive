    <div class="md"><p>Islam, chriatianity, and Judaism are all said to be Abrahamic. They are all pretty similar with each one saying that they are the one true religion. The Christian holy bible says that the others will try to destroy the religion. The Jews are still waiting for a messiah which the holy bible says through inference will be the antichrist. Muslims believe that Allah will come and have them kill all the nonbelievers. Only Christianity fully explains the craziness of the world and all the evil in my opinion. </p>

<p>Christianity doesn&#39;t make any sense either except for the morals and parables. Not that any christian follows the bible these days they just pick and choose paragraphs and mold them into an easier religion with less sacrifice.</p>

<p>I just follow the unoffical story of the world and see if it makes more sense than the real one. If it does and some proof is behind the claims I consider that the truth. But I will change my perspective if someone offers better, harder truths.</p>

<p>I have always thought Truthers like that are the real deal in that he believes to the point where he takes action. I know they have mind control and I believe they will use it against us but I don&#39;t have the courage or desire to be seen in a tin foil hat. So maybe he is just the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are the first person on this thread that actually answered my question rather than put me down or go off saying something that relates but misses my point. 
i find the theories behind mind control, and cell phone surveillance to be very interesting and convincing. 
im the kind of person where yeah i like my privacy but in turn you arent going to find much out hacking into my phone in that way. 
the tin foil hate is very courageous but he doesnt care much about appearance, so im sure if people look at him the wrong way about it its not so hurtful to him. 
see i look at it the way you do, with my own beliefs, i want to believe that what i feel is true, unless something comes along with better, more tangible evidence. 
thank you for the insight. </p>

<p>There is no higher authority in existence, than his interpretation of God&#39;s will, which is actually a malleable (easily changed) delusion. It&#39;s just his own will.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s because it was impossible to not be wrong, given the situation. If he fails at something, it&#39;s because a conspiracy against him, has somehow unfairly penalized him, making the situation impossible.</p>

<p>He&#39;s never at fault, because then he would be wrong, which is impossible. Other people make mistakes because they aren&#39;t him. And all knowledge that he is unaware of, is either &quot;easy to learn&quot; (though he won&#39;t learn it) or is dismissable as &quot;useless&quot; because he doesn&#39;t perceive the value in that knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. It can make any kind of professional relationship quite difficult. You can either &quot;play along&quot; in his delusional world, and hope to achieve some sort of validation, or expose him, which pretty much ends badly. DunKs can rarely handle criticism.</p>

his business wont flourish so he believes something has intercepted and is messing with his landlines.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only real cure is an undeniable event, that forces the DunK to experience humility. And even then, it&#39;s not a guarantee.</p>

<p>Say that he runs a red light, on camera, and rear-ends an occupied cop car. That&#39;s going to be one of those &quot;undeniable events&quot; where everyone agrees, he fucked up. He&#39;ll use every excuse in the book, to defend himself (A fly was in my eye. The cop was illegally parked. The light was yellow. etc)</p>

<p>This proves to the DunK that he might be wrong, and if they have the ability (or maybe the desire?) to reflect on that situation, they may be able to see the error in their ways, which is the key to exposing the true cause of the problem. I think they have to be humbled in order to learn what they are doing to those around them, and themselves.</p>

<p>Conversely, I know a particular DunK in my city that speeds thru school zones every morning. When the stars align and an actual cop is present... they wave at him. They don&#39;t pull him over (I&#39;m sure it happens, once...) or even flash their lights at him. They merely wave... because (per a LEO friend of mine) he is the older brother of the current DA. So sometimes, DunK is incurable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have read up on the theory, but a few things. 
1. as much as i do care about privacy, and feel its wrong to run surveillance on peoples cellular devices like that, if you do so to my device you will find nothing of interest. so it doesnt bother me to such great extent. 
2. i had a friend breaking federal law on his cell phone that he had under his name, and IP address, and now he isnt &quot;scamming&quot; anymore, but if they were recording his activity on his device wouldnt they have caught him from the first time he did so? which only means if they did tap everyones phone, its too large of a scale for them to worry about monitoring anyone small time, so unless you are doing something extreme (which my boss claims to be a law abiding american) you would typically have nothing to worry about. </p>
