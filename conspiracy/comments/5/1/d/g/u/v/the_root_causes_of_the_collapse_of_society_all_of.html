        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Relating self-worth with accomplishments is a good motivator most of the time. This belief makes for a good social system, which is why it&#39;s so prevalent in successful societies. However at the individual level it has festered in some negative ways, especially in light of the economy being so bad. </p>

<p>A need to justify self-worth through accomplishments creates a motivation, it tilts the table toward a certain type of behavior. What is considered an &quot;accomplishment&quot; is decided by the culture, which is often managed by the authority. Completing highschool is an accomplishment. Going to college is an accomplishment. Getting married is an accomplishment. The list of potential accomplishments is endless. Have you been skydiving? Traveled to Europe? Gotten an office job? Bought a new car? You can check off those particular &#39;accomplishment&#39; boxes, which are provided by our culture. </p>

<p>Accomplishments matter, and they&#39;re how we distinguish the good from the bad. So says society and our authorities, and so says our culture. So we believe it ourselves. Our society is competitive, and ranked. </p>

<p>Again, this is a generally good system with generally good results. However in this time of economic turmoil, it creates individuals who are unable to find jobs, because there are simply less jobs than people. These unemployed people now are given this burden of needing to prove their self-worth through alternative means. </p>

<p>If deprived of real work that is regarded as a positive accomplishment, then a person loses their sense of self-worth and can fall in to a depression. This story is extremely common in many western nations today. </p>

<p>I look at the cats laying in the sun. Most animals don&#39;t do much all day, and their instincts largely drive their actions. Are they worse off or more unhappy than us because of it? Not usually. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The idea is you are never good enough. Not even to yourself. So in order to stop hating yourself, and to get everyone to stop hating you, you start doing things that society says you should do. You never reach contentment though, because you must <em>always</em> be accomplishing things without end, or else you are considered a failure by society (in your mind) and thus are considered a constant failure to yourself. This is where all the anxiety and depression comes from that is so frequent in our society.</p>

<p>We are unable to sit like the cat in the sun. We are unable to have  long stretches of time where we do nothing, and <em>be happy about it</em>. This is our true nature that has been stolen from us. Our ability to enjoy doing nothing. We are constantly made to be in a state of upset, to accomplish the goals of the socio-economic system and the people who run it. </p>

<p>The carrot is self-worth, and the stick is self-hatred. We have internalized these values because they are echoed throughout our society over and over, and we believe them. Ego is a powerful motivator. Especially if this is all you are taught from a very young age. </p>

<p>So we go about, fervently &quot;accomplishing&quot; things, trying to regain a good opinion of ourselves, not ever fully understanding our place in the world. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as it is said. Sometimes the best action to do, is to do nothing. We, and our society, are terrible at doing nothing. We always engage instead of letting go, because of our need to justify our self-worth to ourselves and others by &quot;doing something.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>“The Buddha said that suffering was caused by desire, we&#39;d learned, and that the cessation of desire meant the cessation of suffering. When you stopped wishing things wouldn&#39;t fall apart, you&#39;d stop suffering when they did.” ― John Green</p>

It was always 10,000 ways to ask me &quot; your so quiet what&#39;s wrong&quot; until I would just give up and ask questions about her day. It seemed to confuse her that all was quite well and I was just enjoying the quiet or at least trying to in-between her voice breaking through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory, leisure after accomplishing necessities is a good thing. We don&#39;t need to waste resources on empty the gs that only superficially please us. However, as history has shown, time and time again, the tribes that live this way don&#39;t compete against the parasitic tribes. Sure, they may be happier and healthier and we may want to join them, but their ambitious neighbors invade their territory for slaves and resources. It&#39;s a sad viable possibility of this reality that I wish could be removed.</p>

<p>Many believe that a race of parasites with reptilian features invaded this planet many thousands of years ago. They are believed to be still in control of it. They don&#39;t want the inhabitants to know they are there. They want to slowly, subtlety corrupt the inhabitants while they simultaneously feed on the life force energy, the spiritual energy, the emotional energy, that fuels our awareness to animate our bodies. They do this by causing life to enter states of fear and suffering. It is believed that this group of beings is what has caused such a separation of man from his environment, slowly and subtly, through corruption of DNA, empowerment of minions with even more corrupt DNA, and the creation of scarcity, disease and war.</p>

<p>It is believed that this is the reason why we haven&#39;t had formal contact with any ET race, despite the frequency of UFO sightings. The beings with care for others, that are not purely self-serving machines like these reptiles, would tell us of the reptilian parasites and upset their apple cart of feeding on our joy of life. </p>

<p>It is believed that their endgame is to assimilate us through technology merging with our bodies and minds and controlling our society. Then, well become much like the Greys, large headed, technological, nonspiritual, easy to control with fear, and useful tools for their ambitions of further enslavement and parasitic behavior on creation. There is a reason why these beings are seen as demons. Another name given to them is archons. They are why we suffer so much and why we worship outside deities rather than standing on our own two feet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Candles are really nice. Lighting a stick of incense can sometimes totally change my mood for the better. Good smells have a lot of power over mood as well, scientific studies have shown smell to be one of the senses most closely associated with mood, and the wiring layout of our brain reflects that. It&#39;s neat how you can make yourself feel ways by creating situations. You can kind of play your body and mind like a fiddle once you get wise enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think it was dumb, but have you ever gone in for a massage somewhere and smelled how good it smelled and been super relaxed? You can just bring that home. I got one of these types of things from my sister for xmas: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/URPOWER-Essential-Humidifier-Adjustable-Waterless/dp/B00Y2CQRZY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1473139159&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=essential+oils+device">https://www.amazon.com/URPOWER-Essential-Humidifier-Adjustable-Waterless/dp/B00Y2CQRZY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1473139159&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=essential+oils+device</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s just like a little spinny motorized thing, you put water in there, then a few drops of whatever essential oil you want, and it lasts for a few hours. I&#39;ve really enjoyed mine, lavender and sandalwood always chills me out and puts me in a better mood. It&#39;s worth a try for $20 total. One little $3 bottle of essential oil will last like a year. </p>
