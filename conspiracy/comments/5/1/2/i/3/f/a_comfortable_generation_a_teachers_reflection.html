      <p>
       I just want to tell you that a treasured lifetime friend of mine who taught elementary school most of her life passed away two years ago.  I was devastated, still am.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when she was a bright young teacher early in her career. I helped her haul all of her classroom decorations and education stuff to decorate her classroom the weeks before school started so everything would be just right when the kids walked through her door for the first time. She was probably right about 27 at that time. She spent her own money and unpaid time to make that happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       She used to bring home tall stacks of papers to grade _every_day, the tan pulp tablet paper with 3 big lines that little kids use to learn to write their letters. She'd divide the papers up into manageable loads and give all of us roommates red pencils to grade the papers. Each paper got a happy red star and a nice comment for the student. We did this nearly every night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later she went on to become a teacher in the gifted and talented program. (Why do they always give the best teachers to the best students? They should give the best teachers to the
       <em>
        struggling
       </em>
       students).
      </p>
      <p>
       In later years she became the principal of her school. I'm sure she was the best principal any school ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was a beautiful woman of 6' tall with a fine shape, long blonde hair, and a fabulous smile. I adored her completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       When she passed at 71 two years ago I was sure that education would never recover from the loss and that schooling in general was doomed without her.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here you are. At 27. Doing it again. Maybe you are my friend reincarnated come to save the children she loved so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for posting.

      <p>
       Thanks very much for your write up. Personally, I value highly the perspective of teachers such as yourself since you are able to see the progression and annual variance of young minds at an intimate level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, I've been attempting to shift my thinking towards solutions for the many astute and troubling observations we see in this sub. So allow me to try to answer your points with suggested direct actions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Food at our fingertips:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We should stop buying manufactured foods. Do not purchase anything that you would not find available on a farm or homestead. Of course there can be occasional exceptions but they should be exceptions and not part of a family's regular shopping list.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Everything is a legal issue now:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Kids will get hurt. In the end this is nobody's responsibility except the parents and kids themselves. If a kid falls out of tree and breaks their arm, they should learn how to climb trees better, or the parents should tell them not to climb trees. If they still climb a tree, then it's the kid's fault.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Putting too much trust in our children:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All adults need to actively play their roles as leaders, educators, and protectors of children. This includes holding the assumption that kids don't know what they're doing, so we need to show them the right way to do things. Currently, adults are dodging this responsibility by assuming that "children know best".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Comfort trumps all:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Adults have made comfort their priority, so children have adopted this same attitude. Adults need to man up and show them that comfort is not a ruling factor. Stop buying and using creature comforts. Use a fan not an AC. Sleep on a basic mat not a "Comfort-pedic" bed. Don't use an electric appliance when some elbow grease will do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are being entertained to death:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Throw out the fucking TV. Allow young kids access to books but not computers, phones, or tablets. Seriously, they don't need those things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why are we only teaching academic skills?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Academic skills are only being taught because these are the skills that lead to money. Adults need to learn and then teach that money should not be a primary motivator in life. Character, personal relationships, and intellectual and spiritual enlightenment are the priorities. These are the things that lead to happiness and progress.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Critical thinking and evaluation is the framework in which "knowledge" functions. Logic, philosophy, discussion, and analysis need to be a teacher's priorities rather than rote memorization and regurgitation of facts.

       Ironically, I think what we all need to do is forget about "the bigger picture". Starving kids in Africa and rebel fighting in Syria have about zero pertinence to a regular American's every day world. This isn't to say individuals can't influence larger issues, but what's happening is the larger issues distract everyone from the local issues where they can
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       affect change. Feed the poor who live across the street, not the ones living across the ocean.

       This is a big issue, and I think its solution lies in some of the previous points. Self-comfort promotes self-worship. Social media promotes self-idolatry. Modern entertainment promotes self-absorption. Basically, everyone - including adults - has lost the sense of human interrelationship and community. This is a tough one, but throwing out the TV and getting off social media is a good start.

       Fantastic write up. Couldn't agree more.

       I think every child should have to spend one month a year on a farm. Feeding and caring for animals, hauling water from a well, no tv or internet, making their own fun in their off hours…and at the end…helping to slaughter an animal for food.

       We live in a world where, right now, there's a kid somewhere in North America, who has no idea that milk comes from cows. They have lost all connection to their humanity.

       Yes, I am finding more and more even miss out on the experience of getting jobs as teens or young adults. This may be hard to explain, but I was one of the few of my friends who had to work in high school to pay for my phone and stuff. Then there was a point where I no longer had support from my parents and had to work shifty waitress jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find even the poor don't appreciate that type of work anymore. I've gone out to eat with some of my poor friends, and they make a huge mess and say, "Don't worry the waitress will clean it up." I'm saying poor because I live in a poor area and that's the correct label for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can go a lot of directions with this and it's 2 am so I'm probably not writing clearly, but my students have no idea what hard work means.

       Well, in fairness, in the future no one will know what hard work is. Those jobs will be increasingly done (and much sooner than we think) by machines/robotics.

       Humanity will have to decide what it means to be human in a world where hard work is no longer even a concept.

       Your write up is quite spot on. Every day I see young children using smart phones and tablets, as young as three.

       What are your thoughts as to the detrimental effects on imagination due to the overuse of technology?

       You look at these CEO's from the best colleges and you wonder where they got the idea that giving away the natural resources of countries for short lived gain was a good idea. Have they never learned that everything has consequences? Not when the teachers themselves are afraid to show them any.

       Appreciate the post and the education of our children is a very worthy topic! In my experience people who have escaped the system tend to educate their children differently. Those fortunate enough use home schooling while others simply add on additional instruction to counteract revised histories and such taught in public schools.  It would be great if a curriculum that included many of the issues you mentioned along with a more balanced history was developed and available. Education is a tool of the elite to produce the citizens they want. It needs to be devolved back to parents because the government will never provide the education people deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education needs so much change in N. America. The Finns are doing some great work actually and getting lots of international attention for their system. Still an elite controlled system thou.

       I will admit that the level of misanthropy that I have at times felt towards most Americans born after around 1990 that I have seen, has had detrimental effects on my physical health.  At the same time, if people my own age are giving their children poor education, placing iPhones in their cots, and raising them on junk food, then said children themselves can hardly be held responsible.

       </a>
       of hermetics will also do a lot of good, provided, of course, that said grounding does not include the white supremacist rubbish which often threatens to choke it these days.  These are foundational; but said foundation can be used for the comprehension of any other subject, and that is the main thing which the corporate psychopaths and their predominantly Marxist servants wish to confiscate from the majority, and which they largely have.

       Wow, not following you around.  Persecution complex much?  I respond to things I find stupid.  You've demonstrated an inability to understand a simple sentence.  If you don't like being called out, stop writing such stupid shit.  Not my fault you lack an education yet are continuously espousing the value of your own idiotic opinion.  It's really quite simple, stop being stupid and shortly thereafter you'll stop being paranoid that people think you're stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I write something better every day, because I have the ability to take accountability for my own actions and have a sense of ethics, you lack both, therefore you're content to ramble on reddit thinking you're doing something productive.

       Because I don't desperately cling to my ignorance in the few places it would be validated?  It seems as though you've fallen into the typical American trap of being comfortable with your ignorance rather than having it challenged.  The fact that you're somehow responsible for the education of others makes me incredibly worried for their futures.

       I have more empathy than you could possibly imagine.  Just because I challenge people to do something other than wallow in their own ignorance in echo chambers on the internet doesn't mean that I lack empathy.  The fact that I can understand why you are so comfortable in your willful ignorance is actually a demonstration of that very empathy.

       Disagreeing with the way somebody lives their life when it has a damaging impact on society isn't unempathetic.

       Just because you've been failed by everybody in the world who has tried to educate you in the past doesn't mean that it's somebody else's responsibility to "reach you".  You could try to educate yourself rather than regurgitating absurdities in echo chambers where you know they'll be accepted in order to feel comfortable in your ignorance.

       No, I was being sarcastic. Sympathy means you feel bad for somebody. Empathy means you can put yourself in another's shoes.

      <p>
       Let's say I really am as ignorant and stupid as you claim I am. Then, if you had sympathy, you'd probably just feel bad for me and maybe be a little nicer. If you had empathy, you would put yourself in my shoes and appeal to how I feel.

       Exactly.  It's because I have empathy that I feel the need to vigorously shake you out of your stupidity.  There is no other way to get through to people like you.  You don't even have the ability to read a paragraph of an article before forcing it to conform to your own biases, you deserve to be called out, and should take that as a reason to improve yourself.

       Your mind is unchangeable, you believe that the universe has changed around you in order to avoid admitting mistake.  You basically believe you are omnipotent, living an existence of things you'll never forget or misremember.  Why would I try to appeal to your kind of mindset, all you believe is that you're infallible.

       This isn't a debate, the fact that you consider it to be once again speaks to your arrogance of assumption.  I'm simply telling you that you are ignorant, there is no debate about that.
