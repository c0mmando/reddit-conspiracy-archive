       My two cents: Homosexuals are being turned away from Christian places of worship because they are sinners, right? The doctrine that Christian's follow insists that we are ALL sinners, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the fuck are all the other sinners welcome to church and a chance at salvation, but gays aren't?? That makes absolutely no sense, and a church that doesn't pay taxes should rightfully be sued if they refuse to offer anyone a chance at salvation. I'm not saying that people who cause disruptions and can't handle themselves during an hour long service shouldn't get kicked out, but gays who are just going there to worship do not fall under that demographic.

       What he's trying to say is no soldier fought to free the Jews etc. from mass murder. They fought for their country and to stop the "bad guys". The Holocaust wasn't really known to anyone until after the war.

       Listen, you're making a joke out of yourself. You strawman'd me first, and I returned it in kind.

      <p>
       There is plenty of proof for concentration camps. Plenty of it. Go visit one, read one of the journals of the soldiers who uncovered them. Listen to Nazi officers CONFESS to their existence. For God's sake your mind is SHUT, and it is embarrassing to see another human being acting that way.

       The term "holocaust" in relation to the treatment of the Jews in WW2 did not become widespread until the 1970s, and can be attributed largely to the broadcast of this miniseries.

       Neither Churchill, de Gaulle, or any wartime leader used the term when writing about their wartime years.

       Hey man, if you'll look at the actual conversation I attempted to have with this guy, I never even brought up the word Holocaust....

       Just so you know. He claimed that there were no concentration camps, and no deaths at said camps; I simply stated that he was wrong.

        The American liberators made sure that residents of Dachau and other towns were forced to confront the horrors of the concentration camps. According to Harold Marcuse, in his book "Legacies of Dachau," after the liberation a group of Dachau Nazi elite was forced to tour the Dachau crematorium on 8 May 1945.

       Great argument. Meanwhile not a word of that proves your claims, and my statement still stands, since
       <em>

       was the first meaningful discussion of a "genocide".

       If the Jews understand the OT and realize that homosexuality is not an abomination, shouldn't we Christians? After all, Jesus was a Jew.

       Ooh, do you think that the jews "believe everything we do, except the new testament"? Because news flash: they don't believe the Old Testament. They don't even believe in the Torah anymore. The Talmud is all that governs their lives.

         You're doing a fucking terrible job of blending in, moishe.
        </em>
       </strong>
       You just destroyed every single aspect of your statements. Second of all, the jews broke the covenant. You know those loan papers you love to draw up so much? Notice how there's a fuckton of fine print therein? Of course you do; you relish in putting it there. Notice that in that fine print there are clauses which protect the debtor from abuse by the bank, but ALSO protect the
       <strong>
        bank
       </strong>
       from damage by the debtor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know why? Because if EITHER party breaks the agreement, the agreement is off. God (OY FUCKING VEY, the whole word! And not even YHWH, because your demon isn't God) made an agreement with the jews. They were to follow certain terms, and in return received His protection. They broke the agreement by refusing to abide by the terms. Thus the covenant was broken, the jews were kicked out of the Holy Land, and roamed the Earth ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment of Israel had absolutely nothing to do with God or His promises and everything to do with the works of ✡man✡.

       Your copy pasta from your other posts, does not an argument make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument for Revelation 3:9 does not condemn Jews. In fact, Revelation 21:12 refutes your argument nicely. Why would G-D have the 12 tribes inscribed had they been banished?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you state frequently that the Jews follow Talmud. Do you listen to pastors, priests, read biblical commentary? Talmud is from Rabbinical texts used as a guide for daily living.

       The Talmud is the holy book. The Torah is a bunch of "stories", not taken as gospel by jews. And don't start your fucking pilpul about the use of the word 'gospel'; you know what I mean when I say that.
