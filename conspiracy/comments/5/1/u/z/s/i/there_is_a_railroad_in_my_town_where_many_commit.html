        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>But the newspapers have stopped reporting on it because it is just too many now. There&#39;s no room in the newspaper.</p>

<p>I live in an area with a lot of homelessness. My dad told me once a he gave a  homeless man a dollar. The dollar blew out of his hand, and as he was running to catch it, his pants fell off. He didn&#39;t care. That dollar meant everything to him. He once gave a 20 dollar bill to a homeless family and they broke down in tears. It isn&#39;t about the money given, but the hopelessness of some of their lives.</p>

<p>I am a teacher. One of my students came up to me and said, &quot;Ms. Blank. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t at school. My mom&#39;s boyfriend raped me last week.&quot; 6th grader. At the beginning of class. This is just one of the few stories that has formed concrete in mind. Ask me about the girl who shot her dad.</p>

<p>I was a waitress for many years. I&#39;m white. My tables were mostly Native American. A Native man once asked, &quot;Why are you being so nice to us?&quot; This question rings with me even today.</p>

<p>I once cried because I was having a lousy shift. Nobody was tipping me, and I was holding back my tears waiting on some tables. A family left a dove folded into a 5 dollar bill. I will never forget that.</p>

<p>My own mom is severely suicidal since her cancer diagnosis, and is currently institutionalized. I wish I knew how to help her.</p>

<p>The other day I was driving to take some photos (I love photography) on the reservation. I drove past a man covered in blood. As a women, I was scared. I stopped. He had been beaten. I am not exaggerating when it looked like half his face was gone. So many people passed him without helping him (I do not blame them. It was a huge risk for me to stop) I called the ambulance. The man told me I shouldn&#39;t be helping him, but I did, and he thanked me.</p>

<p>I was reading about a post on <a href="/r/Mandelaeffect">/r/Mandelaeffect</a>. It doesn&#39;t matter if you believe in the effect or not. However, one user noted they remembered the Columbine shooting happened at a different time because they spefically remember asking the teacher why. The teacher said, &quot;Well if it can happen here [a good community], it can happen anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>As a teacher that works with impoverished students, that struck me. That&#39;s why people cared. Let&#39;s not talk about all that school shootings that don&#39;t make national news. Let us only care if it is a &#39;good&#39; community.</p>

<p>I can go on and on. There are too many stories; these are the ones that just popped into my mind.</p>

<p>And I won&#39;t. There is so much more, and we ALL have our stories. Rich or poor...black or white...suffering or not.</p>

<p>The conspiracy here is that we are currently in a world where this is little lack of empathy for others. I am going to be honest. I never saw such pain and suffering until I moved out here. And you can make it a race issue. But it is NOT.</p>

<p>It is deeper than that. And that&#39;s the conspiracy. &#39;They&#39; want us to believe that we should be at war with each other.</p>

<p>But there is no reason for the poverty in this country...or anywhere.There is no reason for the terrible education system. There is no reason for such suffering. </p>

<p>I am not naive or too idealistic. I understand suffering comes with life, but I do not support unnecessary suffering. In my opinion, the United States is now at a point of ridiculous comfort for some, and unnecessary suffering for others.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this because I am sad tonight. Still, I also feel a glimpse of hope with you all here. I really do.</p>

<p>What is your story you want to share?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always found it quite fascinating how much people hate change, the word is pretty fascinating isn&#39;t it? Those in need ask for change, be it change in the sense of overall change or pocket change to buy some food but the vast majority of us are completely against it. Be it because we think it isn&#39;t as good as we have it now or something like we&#39;re scared it will be abused for something sinister. The word has so many meanings and implication its kind of insane to wrap your mind around it isn&#39;t it? All people want is change, even if they have some in their pocket they will still resist it out of fear.</p>

<p>Empathy is very real but at times it almost feels punishing when trying to adapt to the &quot;real&quot; world. Almost like its a ruse from the start. So much information and disinfo its hard to tell where to turn to or what to believe in. Its all very odd to the point of feeling almost worthless. Yet here we are trying to figure it out.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even know where I was going with this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found most don&#39;t really want change. Even those suffering because even suffering can be comforting.</p>

<p>We all want the familiar at times. Life is often scary and messed up. Comfort is key. And even comfort takes on many meanings.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with this either</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right most don&#39;t want change. I think they don&#39;t because they fear that change will bring worst suffering to them. In the case of the wealthy, yes change for them means they&#39;ll suffer (relatively from where they&#39;re currently at in life) but for the rest of us change would ease the suffering. </p>

<p>What nobody understands is that change is a constant and their resistance to change is what causes the suffering and anxiety. </p>

<p>Even if we don&#39;t realize it, change is always happening and it&#39;s the pace of that change along with the direction that everyone is adverse to. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to live as if there&#39;s no tomorrow but that&#39;s what we all think, rich or poor. It&#39;s one of the only things everyone except maybe 20 people on this planet have in common. </p>

<p>Other people dictate our thoughts, actions, likes, dislikes, customs, habits, social groups, everything about &quot;real&quot; life is either forced or coerced onto all of us by an infinitesimal minority.</p>

<p>Even the &quot;Illuminati&quot; or &quot;ptb&quot;, &quot;elite&quot; or however we label them, they&#39;re followers of something other than their own selves. They differentiate from the majority of the population by the accident of being born into a wealthy family or having natural qualities that align with wealthy families goals (sociopath, psychopath, narcissist etc) </p>

<p>They may have mental control of large numbers of normal people but they themselves are following the guidance of someone or thing outside of themselves.</p>

<p>I apologize for the lenght of this response but I needed to get those points across. I know where I was going with this and think I know where you and the others were going with your statements. </p>

<p>People want self determination, free will free of coercion. They don&#39;t have that and most don&#39;t consciously realize they don&#39;t. Subconsciously, deep down they know they don&#39;t own themselves and it hurts. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not exactly that people want or don&#39;t want change it&#39;s more like people want to change at their own pace but are fearful and ignorant of how to go about it. </p>

<p>I hope this made sense and wasn&#39;t too long. If you take anything away from this then let it be this; slow down, you don&#39;t have to fix everything or even yourself. You just need to listen to yourself and when you hear your own voice, pay attention. Once you do that others will follow your lead and you won&#39;t have to put any extra effort into teaching them. They&#39;ll learn by example. </p>

<p>TL;DR He who knows himself knows God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I left a lot out but I&#39;m glad it made sense. I like to think that the world&#39;s not cruel but some people are. It&#39;s not possible for one person to change the world but relatively easy for people to change. It keeps me optimistic and able to understand the cruelty without having to accept it or become apathetic to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is key isn&#39;t it. We&#39;ll go day to day even being miserable because its comforting because nothing threatens it even if its objectively bad for us. We all make choices that move forward in one direction or the other but more often then not its selfish and pointless. Be the change you want to see they say but committing to it is difficult compared to living the comfort route. It all just seems so strange and manufactured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your experiences. I have many, as well. This world is definitely fucked up and I think that is the purpose. One experience that really stuck with me was, I was in the city in my younger years, and I was approached by a woman asking for some money. I gave her far more than what she asked for. She cried, and said thank you, nobody else even looked at me, or said anything. I said, well, I&#39;m glad I was here at this moment. I turned to a friend, and kind of gave a nod to give some money, and he said &quot;huh?&quot;. I said this woman needs some help. He said what woman? I said her, then turned around. The woman was gone. Like she just vanished. Ever since then, I&#39;ve felt a presence of kindness and protection. We know so little about this experience that we call life. There are evil beings, and good beings. Good always trumps evil in the end. Pain and suffering yes, but it does prevail. Peace and love!</p>

This is what people need to know, we are not alone, but are confined/scared because of various societal borders (they have created). I think we are tested constantly and that is the point for achieving higher ascendance in the spiritual realm. The spirit being is naturally good, but this realm is all about testing the authenticity/endurance of that. That experience was a true turning point in my life. Everything happens for a reason, and we are but kids playing in a sand box....</p>

I had an experience in Chi-Town, similar to yours (I wrote about it on here and <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>). The &quot;person&quot; was not a person, but something out of this realm. They left a mark on me... Another user brought up Fae people and folklore. I think there is something to that... Truly trippy shit...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It changed in the early 20&#39;s, for reasons I do not know. Red is fire, lion, dragon. Masculine. Blue is passive, calm, like the ocean for the most part.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. It doesn&#39;t matter where you grew up or where you end up now, communities have changed for the worse. People don&#39;t interact with each other any more. Empathy is a large part of what&#39;s wrong with the country.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been told why we should ignore the problems of others and that&#39;s all most of us care about. As long as someone feels justified in their fears for their own safety they will allow another individuals suffering to continue.. even if that individual is bleeding out in their own front yard.</p>

<p>It sounds like you are trying to be the change that you would like to see. A good person does not care about their own personal safety if it means that they are helping another individual in dire need.</p>

<p>A good person doesn&#39;t care if they are late to work if it means that they are possibly saving someone&#39;s life or their family&#39;s ability to survive another day.</p>

<p>No matter how many times an individual goes to church on Sunday, if they don&#39;t take action when challenged by fate they are no better than the evils they fear.</p>

<p>I hear you. I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve read on the internet &quot;you are not entitled to (such and such)&quot; whether that&#39;s love, money, sex, an easy life, people seem proud to make this statement. But I find it cold and heartless. I understand that it&#39;s sometimes directed at those with legitimate entitlement issues but when it&#39;s spoken in general I feel that the statement can be expanded because it exhibits a lack of caring for others. You are not entitled to shelter, so freeze in a ditch. You are not entitled to food, so starve on the streets. You are not entitled healthcare, so suffer in pain. You are not entitled to respect, so take my abuse. You are not entitled to human dignity, so suffer my oppression. I fear that&#39;s where we&#39;re going.</p>

They want us to only see our differences and not our similarities. The sooner we can start working together as human brothers and sisters the sooner we can band together and stand up for our rights. To say no to big pharma, big business, the military industrial complex, etc. We are led to believe that we need their protection from eachother, that we should be afraid of eachother, but we need to protect eachother from them. We need to help our friends and neighbors and be confident that our friends and neighbors will be there for us.</p>

Winslow, Arizona? </p>

<p>Grew up in Winslow. My dad is an engineer for BNSF railroad. He has hit multiple people on the tracks in Holbrook. Unfortunately, it takes a mile to stop a train. He has a hard time even driving through Holbrook to get to the station anymore. </p>

<p>But I know the situation over there. Homelessness is rampant. The reservation isn&#39;t too far away. Nothing about it in the newspaper... it is more than sad. </p>

<p>In fact, traveling through any of the reservations, or small towns around the reservations, it&#39;s really sad.</p>

It&#39;s just crazy how close your story hit home. </p>

<p>Only other place I know that is really close to tracks is twin arrows, or flagstaff. Or the other close rez I know is whiteriver, up by pinetop. Used to work for blue bell ice cream, I would deliver up there once in a while. I&#39;ll be damned if their land out by hawley lake isn&#39;t the most gorgeous landscape I have ever seen though. Truly amazing.</p>

<p>If you are anywhere nearby, stop by Christmas tree / Hawley lake. Watching the herds of wild horses is almost magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always considered myself to be painfully average.
I grew up in a middle class home, my mother being a high school gym teacher and my father being a banker. For the good part of my childhood we went to church every Sunday where my brother and I were involved in the youth group there. We went on family vacations together, we always had dinner together, I was involved in band whereas my brother got more into sports and computers. My senior year of high school my dad divorced my mom. They had been together for twenty seven years. At that point my life began to get worse with each passing year. I went to college on my parents&#39; dime but two years into it I still didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do so I dropped out. I moved back home right as my brother went off to the finest engineering school in the country. I got a job through one of my dad&#39;s clients at a fast food place and worked there for about three years, and since then I have worked random dead end jobs since then. I still live with my mother but doing so has made our relationship worse. She told me tonight I have one month to get my things together and move out on my own. I&#39;m 25. I still don&#39;t know what I want to do with my life. All I know is that I want to help people be happy. I know I can&#39;t blame it on anything because doing that just makes me a whining freeloader who can&#39;t make right what he got wrong. More and more I&#39;m beginning to think that I should drop everything and leave. Make it look like I ran away even though I&#39;m a grown man. From there I&#39;d probably find some sort of gun and a ditch where no one will ever find me and do the unthinkable. It&#39;d be easy for me to fade oit of everyone&#39;s lives that way and if there ever was a funeral, not that many people would be there besides my family anyway. I think that&#39;s my best option at this point because all I ever do is let the people I love down. I&#39;m not really good at anything and my attention span is like a goldfish so I hardly remember important things. Plus, having been aware of how awful our world is for the better part of five years, I don&#39;t want to have to live through what fresh hell they decide to send our way when society collapses. And love is just a chemical after all, it isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s funny how your parents &quot;love&quot; you and &quot;love&quot; each other until you&#39;re a quarter of your way through your life and don&#39;t have anything to show for it. Hopefully hell doesn&#39;t exist because if it does I&#39;m definitely headed there.</p>

<p>You said you always wanted to help people. I think right now you, even with all the crap you&#39;ve been through, the fact that you still want to help people shows something about you.</p>

<p>Just know that this world often feels terribly mad. I definitely wrote this for people like you. Don&#39;t lose hope, as cliche as that sounds. I promise you&#39;re not alone, and it sounds like you have a good heart. Having a good heart in this world is really, really hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do not take your life!  There are places where a person like you could fit in and live a simple life of service to others.  I can&#39;t think of any of the top of my head, but I will happily do some research into the possibilities if you would like. ( And if you really can&#39;t stand living any more, do us all a favor and go out in a blaze of glory doing something meaningful, like burn yourself alive for a righteous cause.  [But don&#39;t actually do that, keep living!] )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t change who you are. There aren&#39;t enough people in the world like you. I helped an 84 year old woman, who was taking forever in front of me at the drugstore. She was walking her cartfull of stuff out to her car, and I was rushing to get to my car, as now I late for work because of her. I stopped, put my stuff in my car, and walked over to her. I asked if I could help her by loading her stuff in her trunk. She said thank you as I finished loading everything and took her cart back inside. I felt good for do I g something nice for someone else who needed help, but didn&#39;t ask. This is how we should act, not be angry this person made me late, but help someone who is obviously alone and struggling. I hope it made her day to have a complete stranger offer help, even when she didn&#39;t ask for it. Be kind, pass it forward, and don&#39;t look for a reward for being a good person. Do a good deed for the sake of making someone&#39;s day a little brighter. The smallest acts of kindness can be huge in someone&#39;s else&#39;s life. You don&#39;t know their situation, but everyone deserves to be treated respectfully and will generally be surprised someone is doing random acts of kindness. You never know when a small gesture can make a huge difference in someone else&#39;s life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America is a civilisation which is currently experiencing its&#39; terminal phase; and in addition, the current generation are the end product of close to a century of research into mind control and social engineering.  The Millennials have been purposely designed to be cowardly, apathetic, willfully stupid consumers who act in completely pre-determined and predictable ways.  The only thing Millennials care about is how they will be viewed by the rest of the herd.</p>

<p>As a result of all of this, the society is fascist, dystopian, and a source of enormous despair for those of us who still possess sensitivity or intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corporations have tired to keep us trapped within the 50s ever since that decade ended, because that was the only real time when they had the sort of complete predictability and control that they wanted.  The Keynesian socialist experiment really ended when the Cold War did, however, which means that American economics is currently headed back to where it was just prior to the passing of the Federal Reserve Act.</p>

<p>The push is on for a new form of corporate feudalism; and although it doesn&#39;t look quite like they&#39;re going to get it, we&#39;re nowhere near being out of the woods yet.  The one saving grace is the number of people who used to believe in the benevolence of corporations, but are realising the extent to which they have been betrayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If what I have read about Common Core is true, younger generations will most likely be even more fucked than the Millennials.  Then again, that is only true if people decide to keep their children within corporate or state-run education, and I think there&#39;s enough opposition to that, that keeping state education mandatory will become increasingly difficult over time.</p>

<p>The new kids are also strange; many of them seem to be coming in with stronger claims of reincarnational memory and other odd things, than we have seen before.  It may be that some of them have various forms of resistance or immunity to the new programming; ultimately we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>I think more than anything else, Millennials need to start to realise that contrary to what they&#39;ve been taught, the mobile phone is not their friend.  They need to stop using them, not only for their own sakes, but for future generations as well.  The mobile phone was, I think, introduced by the same people who have a lot of sick intentions for humanity in a lot of areas; essentially a form of enslaved transhumanism which could be very difficult to break out of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the gender identity issue is concerned, as I said in the comments on a recent video regarding the degradation of art; I see practically every day here on Reddit, a continual procession of Millennials who think their behaviour is completely fine, and that anyone who disagrees with them is an anachronistic bigot.  At this point, after five years of trying to reach them, I&#39;m slowly starting to accept that for the sake of my own sanity, and even my ability to remain a decent person in general, I have to simply withdraw and let them do what they want.</p>

<p>Now, understand something here.  I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> for one moment necessarily agreeing with the idea that &quot;as long as it doesn&#39;t overtly harm anyone, then it&#39;s ok.&quot;  I am actually saying that although my initial desire regarding Millennials was to help them, I ultimately became so savagely misanthropic towards them, that it threatened to destroy what was left of my own integrity in the process.  I can&#39;t remotely call myself a good person, if I experience genuine, seething hatred towards anyone, which is what I was starting to experience towards most of the people I saw here on Reddit.  The two subjects which have caused me to genuinely consider suicide, have been transhumanism and the Millennials.</p>

<p>I will never truly be part of the society in which I was born.  It is sad, but it is a simple fact.  My priorities have always been greatly different to almost everyone else around me, but I have realised that one of those priorities, in the past, was compassion.  Millennials are superficial, apathetic, narcissistic, and above all, totally and utterly collectivist and anti-individualistic.  The only thing they care about is what they think their collective approves of, or thinks of as looking good.  That is what virtue signalling is about.  Millennials do not genuinely care about the real <strong><em>substance</em></strong> of compassionate or principled behaviour at all; they care about creating a <strong><em>pretense</em></strong> of engaging in those behaviours, because they hope that that pretense will win them approval from the rest of the group.</p>

<p>That is all it is, however.  They constantly view themselves as being in front of an audience, and the only thing that matters to them is how that audience reacts.  My two and a half years within <em>World of Warcraft</em> tried to brainwash me into viewing myself as an aspirant celebrity, although while getting to know my internal Batman equivalent ultimately proved very beneficial, I did not become quite as narcissistic as it was probably intended.  I recognised that said narcissism was futile.</p>

<p>But I must let them go.  I do not use a mobile phone, although I have one now, which I will probably put in the rubbish bin eventually, because it gnaws at my conscience.  I have let them go, and aside from the few people that I know offline, my life now consists primarily of solitary wailing in the dark.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the fundaments are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such circumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers to take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger, since he cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides his worth and withdraws into seclusion.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>The answer to degeneracy and insanity is not to inadvertently join it by twisting ourselves in hatred of it or those who engage in it, but to flee and preserve ourselves as best we may.  As a child and young adult, I idealised renunciation.  Now, in truth, I no longer particularly want it, but it seems to be the only path open to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right on track with your thoughts. I am very scared for the younger generations, and I have written a lot about it on reddit.</p>

<p>I honestly believe it is pure narcissism. I think more and more people qualify as narcissists because it has now been normalized and technology has desensitized us.</p>

<p>You said it all pretty clearly and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m adding much to the discussion.</p>

<p>I think school has a big impact on students feeling they they are so &quot;special&quot;. Everything in education about appealing constantly to them in every single way. </p>

<p>For example, I tell my students sometimes it&#39;s good to be bored and to realize life is not constant entertainment...</p>

<p>I just find it ridiculous I have to tell them that now because they are so used to being entertained.</p>

<p>I could go on and on. Thanks for taking the time to write out something much more thorough than I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ate some e-coli laced spinach salad from a health food co-op. Go figure!</p>

<p>Only problem was, I thought I had been hit by a fecal borne disease from an explosion of a client. Nobody, the night before made any effort to clean the mess. </p>

<p>So, I kinda flipped my shit! Very stressed. Ten, fifteen other people could have cleaned up in teams!</p>

<p>I walked into this beautiful facility and the stench damned near put me on my knees. I was always first in and I never allowed any of our clients to be humiliated or shamed, nor had I ever shirked at helping.</p>

<p>I ate the salad about six hours later. The next morning, down in the garden with my grandson I got very, very sick. That was a Friday. By Sunday I was mostly wanting to be dead and the CDC called me to tell me what it was, not my doc, not the hospital...because I worked at a facility classified as a Health Care, I was not allowed to return to work until I had a clean sample. That took two and a half weeks and then the CDC called back to say they needed more testing.</p>

<p>In nearly seven years I had only ever had three sick days. On my return, I was fired. </p>

<p>I miss the clients, not my employer, nor the selfish staff that refused to stand up and support the clients that were harmed by shitty practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a powerful a story you&#39;ve told here and it especially rings true for me. My family and I have been fighting tooth and nail to escape poverty. My daughter was actually born in a homeless shelter. We are doing everything we can think of to better ourselves and escape. But poverty is like a black hole that sucks you in and is very hard to escape. </p>

<p>As to your point about race not being the issue and that the deeper issue is a lack of empathy, that is 100% true. Empathy has been bred out of u s by society. We are taught suffering is ok, that poor people are poor because they are drunks or drug addicts. We are taught to identify differences between ourselves and others and to ignore the common ground between us. Separation and isolation are the keys to manipulation.</p>

<p>Soon, I hope, we the citizens of Earth, will decide we all pretty much want the same things in life, to be free and prosperous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>I actually made a really long post about race but it wasn&#39;t very popular.</p>

<p>It said basically what you said. Poverty and sociology are way bigger influences than race, but race is easier for people. It&#39;s easier to divide people that way.</p>

<p>Sounds like you are doing what you can. I wish I could help more, but just know that I read your words and they mean a lot to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I dropped out of a decent school and somehow ended up working at a bank. As a former biology student, I had no idea how finance worked or even what a mortgage was. In the 3 months I was there I got to glimpse how the system works against lower and middle class clients and families. We were essentially expendable, and forced to hard sell loans, credit, overdraft to people who were desperate and would obviously struggle to pay anything back. I only lasted 3 months because I refused to practice this and bring my numbers up. A week before I was fired one of the better supervisors called me in to discuss my horrendous numbers (maybe 1 sale). At one point she asked me what my dreams were, I replied that I wanted to go back to school, study root systems/fungi and save the world. She flatly told me my dreams would never pay the bills before making me sign something and walking out. 
I bounced around working in a small university town before finally returning to finish my degree. 
It hasn&#39;t been easy and I have constant battles with myself over what&#39;s realistic and what my direction should be. 
I&#39;m still working away at it, working part time with kids with developmental disabilities and hoping I land on my feet at somepoint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely get what you mean. I was born and raised in a pretty diverse city in CA so I always thought maybe the reason I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the whole racism thing was because I&#39;ve never known anything different than a diverse city. It&#39;s only recently that I&#39;m starting to think that maybe it&#39;s TPTB that are trying to provoke this race/class stuff or if not outright provoke, then they&#39;re at least egging it on. I&#39;ve never in my life had a bad interaction it experience with a black person, but damned if 28 years of media priming and programming isn&#39;t running through the back of my mind when I&#39;m talking to someone who&#39;s black, and it usually takes the form of me just being very aware of my whiteness and oh god don&#39;t say the wrong thing because you don&#39;t want them to think you&#39;re racist. It&#39;s like this crazy cycle that just feeds this instability and tension and it&#39;s not based on anything but media priming. </p>

<p>Anyway that was a ramble and a half and I kind of forgot what I was trying to say in the first place but I&#39;m not deleting this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born and raised in a smaller town out in the country in the south. While growing up and going to school there was only one black kid in school until High school. I did not grow up in a diverse city as you did but I too don&#39;t get the whole racism thing. I have also noticed that almost everything in society seems like it wants people to focus on differences rather than what we all have in common. I have no doubt that there is an agenda that is pushing hard to keep groups of people divided based on race, gender, where they were born, or what they believe. </p>

<p>If you can look past what the media is trying to get you to believe there is a pretty amazing thing to see. We are all born on this earth and alive. We didn&#39;t get to pick where we were born, who our parents were, or how we were raised. Everyone shares this because we are all human beings. All of the great things that human beings have done is something we all share. </p>

<p>All of the great things that people have done throughout time no matter what color their skin is or what part of the planet they were born in or are from. Those things are your inheritance because they were done by humans and you are human. </p>

<p>All of the terrible things people have done throughout time no matter what color their skin is or what part of the planet they were born in or are from. Those things too are your inheritance because they were done by humans and you are human. </p>

<p>It is good to keep both of those things in mind while you live your own life and make your own choices. You are part of a great and terrible legacy just like every other human on this planet. Together there is no limit to what we can accomplish. But divided and squabbling over petty differences or over things that a person has no choice of get us nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to forget sometimes amidst all of this madness that there is good out there, people that do care for one another and live by what we know in our hearts is right. Mahatma Ghandi once said that humanity is an ocean, if a few drops of the ocean become dirty the ocean does not become dirty. What you&#39;ve experienced in your life is necessary for you to learn and grow. We are all connected to each other, different expressions of the same one consciousness and it will take a while for most to realise this and that all of these societal divisions are manufactured. If we love the world and love each other then our lives are fundamentally changed and the world is fundamentally changed. If we can turn the tide within ourselves to freedom from fear, then we turn that tide outwardly in the planet. Stay strong and never forget this, that there is good out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I red your post right after a reply I did on facebook on a &quot;Spotted&quot; page to try and help someone that was having a real hard time after a break up of many years.</p>

<p>Might seem banal, but I resonate with your post and I feel like I need to do more of this. Like you said, the lack of empathy for others is very saddening... I want to blame the society we live in for it, and I think it&#39;s a big part of it, but it all comes down to us to change this and start being aware of others.</p>

<p>We need to listen more.</p>

<p>You are a good person and I love you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I blame the lack of empathy on the wide and easy availability to the 24 hour news cycle.  People are ghoulishly curious about deaths, abductions, terrorism, etc.  So they watch this stuff on the news, which dishes it up because a) it&#39;s out there to report on and b) it gets the ratings they so feverishly desire.</p>

<p>The issue is that people are losing empathy for others because they&#39;re afraid if they stop to help, they&#39;ll get attacked.  Or, if they talk to someone they don&#39;t know, they&#39;ll get kidnapped.  Although these things happen in this world they are very, very rare, and by and large we are much safer than people think.</p>

<p>I only hope somehow this cycle is broken and people open up again and stop feeding the fear monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed a large difference between us and european citizens where the us media fetishises violence and gore and simultaneously puts a taboo on nudity under the guise of religious purity. I believe that the us war machine inculcates the lack of empathy to ensure a large cadre of support for their war effort. It is a terrible thing when men and women are not comfortable of their own bodies, when they view each other as chattels to be bought and sold. It causes so much suffering.</p>

My father taught at a high school on a reservation for a few years, and he has similar stories.  As an empathetic person I have had to work to build up the mental strength necessary to even pay attention to world events these days without being consumed by rage and frustration.  Every little bit of empathy we show helps us resist the rising tides of ignorant hatred.  Keep it up!  Stand tall!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in Keyna for two years. The first 6 months were some of the most depressing months of my life. I come from a well to do neighborhood. Going from being well off in the U.S. to the relative poverty in Kenya was depressing. Not because of me. Because of what I saw around me. Every day was a struggle for some people. They literally woke up in the morning not knowing if they were going to be able to eat. They would stand on a street corner waiting to be selected for menial work that would give them enough money to buy basic food. If they were selected, their family would eat. If not, they would starve for a day. It was difficult for me to live there knowing there was nothing I could do to help. (editing to add more)</p>

<p>About three months after I arrived there was a contested election that resulted in a civil war breaking out. By war, I mean that people literally took to the streets and started killing each other. The primitive weapons made the situation much more barbaric. The most advanced weapon used was a machete. During most of the time I simply sat inside and waited for the violence to end. When I did venture out, the carnage was heartwrenching. Abandoned bodies strewn across the landscape. Mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters were searching among the dead for their family members. There were a few times were people would find the body they were looking for and attempt to bring it back home. On the way they would be ambushed and killed. There were a few people I came across that were still alive, and I did my best to treat them. One of the most depressing feelings in the world is giving someone CPR for a few hours, and then realizing that there&#39;s no medical infrastructure to help. I can&#39;t call 911. Once I was too exhausted to continue with CPR, this person would either start breathing on their own or they would die. This person died. It&#39;s an eerie feeling to roll over after giving someone CPR to the point of exhaustion and then just lay there next to a dead body. It gives you some time to think. </p>

<p>The saddest part about this situation was the root cause of the violence. A contested election. Presidental elections impact the daily life of citizens so little that these people experienced no change in their lives, and yet they were motivated to start killing one another. </p>

<p>After a few months, things calmed down. I was still sad to have witnessed so much hate and suffering, but things got better from there. I was reminded of the quote, &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country.&quot; I replaced the word &quot;country&quot; with the word &quot;neighbor&quot; and realized that there is a culture of assistance in Kenya. If someone didn&#39;t get work that day, their neighbor would invite them over for dinner. If someone was kicked out of their home, they had relatives they could rely on for shelter. I&#39;ve never seen people so willing to assist one another. Even though they were poor, even though they didn&#39;t have very much, they were willing to share what little they had to alleviate the suffering of others. That lesson has stuck with me. I have a feeling that this attitude largely doesn&#39;t exist in the U.S. because we have the mentality that it&#39;s someone else&#39;s problem. If someone is out of work and homeless, it&#39;s because they&#39;ve done something wrong. Also, we have plenty of charitable organizations, right? One of those organization will take care of this person. Or they can get money from the government, right? /s</p>

<p>Since arriving back in the U.S. I&#39;ve been wary of divisive tactics. Any attitude of &quot;we&#39;re being treated unfairly, and these other people should pay&quot; tends to throw up a red flag in my mind. Even if there is truth to what is being said, that divisive attitude is extremely dangerous. I see that attitude everywhere now that I&#39;m looking for it. It&#39;s sad to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the gripe people would have is that it is more personal than most posts. Usually conspiracy theories are along the lines of &quot;I saw this in the news and read this in a book and calculated this equation out and I think I am on to something&quot;. But despite the fact that this is base mostly on personal observation your hypothesis falls fully in line with various other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;ve read crazier conspiracy theories with less base evidence which have garnered interest from people. The big thing now is to hope other people make similar observations elsewhere. Then try to draw correlations and figure out how its happening and who is most and least at risk.</p>

<p>I think the conspiracy is that they have divided and a lot of people don&#39;t think they have fallen for it but they have. Like the race wars are great examples.</p>
