       A dream about reincarnation that I am only beginning to realize years later (self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix)
submitted 1 month ago by emayne55
Two years ago I had two extremely vivid dreams in the span of about two days.
The first one was a dream where I had died. I was in a blue waiting room of sorts. Apparently I had died in some way and this "waiting room" was a place where I could wait for my friends to die and show up/talk to them, before erasing all my memories and reincarnating back to Earth. It gets weirder though. Eventually my friends do show up and we all talk and cry/etc and they start poofing off 1 by 1 to reincarnate until me and my best friend are the only ones left. My best tells me it's time to go and to come with him.
I ask him why I have to reincarnate. Why can't we just stay here forever and remember everything? He keeps pushing it more and I get angry with him and tell him that's bullshit. This is where the dream gets really weird. I get pissed off and literally jump or kind of noclip out of the waiting room and then tear down all of the walls in the waiting room and start running away. There's some weird controller behind the waiting room who I called "god" and I told him I would never fall for his lies or deceit ever again and that I would never reincarnate.
The second dream a couple days later is I sort of saw how new souls get put into a new human body. I saw myself zooming through a white tunnel and seeing life through the eyes of a baby for a split second. I woke up drenched in sweat and felt like shit after this dream, it was still the most vivid dream I ever had.
Overall does this tie into the idea that reincarnation is a "scam" and that when you die beings will try to coerce you back to Earth? I was browsing this subreddit and came across comments from
       <a href="/u/astralrocker2001">
        /u/astralrocker2001
       </a>
       and he always talks about how reincarnation is a trick and that the only true free way to escape this hell is to not be deceived by whatever beings meet us at death. Normally I would brush off comments like that but since that dream I had sticks out to me so vividildy two years later I feel like I needed to make this thread.
I would like to share this video right here.

       i thought it was contained in the original repost. i did not notice my intro statement had gone over the original authors intro.. emayne55 mentions me in the article, obviously i would not also claim to be the original author.. regardless; it is an fantastic experience the person went through..

       Both. If you understand it, it becomes your thinking mind too. It's understanding, the more you understand the less you have to think. Everything in the world is made perfectly. It's hard to see unless you really research but everything in life is already perfect. Starving makes you grow brain cells so you can find yourself food. That's just an example of how our world is perfect. All plants and herbs will give you all the remedies you need. If you can find the key you know where to look to find anything you want to know.

       ty so much for this we all get so caught up in the rat race routine and nowadays we run harder and harder just to stand in place but every so often you just gotta remember we all have such a higher purpose to ourselves first and foremost .... what is your suggestion to understanding the perfection which enlightened you [ty for sharing]

       Eat good and realize the trickery of the world. Chase perfection in every sense of the word. If you follow it enough you'll realize there is a pattern taking place. Truth is not seen in the public and will be realized in bursts over time. Every government agency exists to cover up something about the very thing they are "studying"

       This... Well what youve said. The "third eye" that Is the Eye. Meaning that is Truth. Everything else is blind, rather, distracted. If people really saw what was in the "third eye" there is no Taboo, shit that seems weird to any stretch of imagination is normal. Everything is byproduct of something we do, everything is a side effect of, as you said it, imperfection. If we were perfect, in similarity with what youre saying, we would be more living like the original native americans for example, but even purer.

       Interesting and very symbolic. My opinion is the golden sword is your higher conscious awareness, and the snake is the lower mind as you said.. How did you conquer the "lower mind"..

       Gotta chase divinity in every aspect of your life. After awhile you manage to realize the massive fuckery happening currently and are no longer a victim to your lower mind. Your higher mind smashes your lower mind thinking so the snake dies. Sad realizations though because you see how the lower mind runs the world.

       Hi. The lower mind is what the Global Elite and their Satanic Masters are all about. Through mass media they initiate the population continually. This is a planet in which people slaughter each other, and the horrible energy of suffering is absorbed by the Illuminati and the Archons..

       And to answer your question the theory is to not go back into the white light. The white light is how you reincarnate. Don't do it. I won't do it when I die unless there is nothing else.

       Hey dude. Something you might want to check out, but I think the soul traps/reincarnation loops have just been shut down.  Apparently them Draco dudes were running that tech and they split last summer and took it all with them.  Other ET dudes are apparently here to help remove and clean up some of the mess up there so we can get a clean shot to do shit right for ourselves for once without some freaking overlords messing with us.  Check some of the latest post over at

        Listen to this, OP.
       </a>
       It's Simon Parkes, and he says something
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       similar to what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the idea of
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       going into the white light and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being sucked in by what happens immediately after death is something which the Indian Vedic philosophy talks about quite a bit.
