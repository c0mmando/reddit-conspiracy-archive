    <div class="md"><p>Something I wrote a while ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Modern skepticism is being hijacked by pro-corporate interests. I&#39;ve seen this happen in <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a>. I&#39;ve watched a biotech shill there get people to comment on real FDA approval processes, based solely on the information this shill buttered them up with. They didn&#39;t just encourage them to comment, they encouraged them to comment in favor of something. I know the user is a shill because I did my research and found that user goes by various screen names, one of which is their real name. It was only a matter of time before I found their numerous pro-biotech articles and comments across various blogs, and the biotech company they own which aims to profit heavily should that FDA approval process pass. By the way, I&#39;m talking about CRISPR gene editing technology. This is not skepticism, it&#39;s straight up astroturfing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This person particularly said &quot;the skeptic movement&quot; once when scheming things, which is what nudged my Toucan Sam in the right direction. Was this person planning to prey on skepticism? I found this person was regularly affiliating with <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a> moderators and other infamous pro-GMO / pro-Biotech bloggers / scientists. Take a look at that sub&#39;s &quot;myths network&quot; for a laugh - nothing says <em>we are industry apologist PR buffoons</em> more than that right there. I will give out a consolation prize though - since I&#39;ve been calling them out they&#39;ve toned it down big time. Kudos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you actually have to call them out for them to change.  that&#39;s how the op works.  they have to maintain the perception that they&#39;re balanced.  it&#39;s the same for all of the psyops.  they&#39;ll respond to &quot;design threats&quot;.  that&#39;s how you know they&#39;re psyops.  when you have grassroots organizations they develop organically, decoratively, and they&#39;re less likely to need to feel the need to respond to anything. </p>

<p>at any rate, i&#39;d caution you to not call them out, or to call them out in ways that are optimal.  because really, the best evidence We have of coopted narratives is their actual work.  and it&#39;s a shame to make that evidence go away because you&#39;ve told your opponent how to fix or hide their mistake.  </p>

No longer do they think that &quot;skeptic&quot; applies to a person who does not accept an idea or concept. Instead, &quot;skeptic&quot; refers to people who have been convinced by evidence, making all others &quot;deniers&quot;. That&#39;s the same level of stupidity that has made words such as &quot;derth&quot; and &quot;literally&quot; mean their own opposites.

<p>They start out trying to discharge from some philosophy and then become militant about their new philosophy in a way that ironically undercuts the tenets of what they were originally about, which was something usually centered around being &quot;nicer,&quot; &quot;friendlier,&quot; and &quot;not-at-all-like-those-other-people.&quot; Feminism is a good example because women are supposed to be &quot;inherently nice,&quot; but the movement now has people associating women with &quot;holy terror.&quot;</p>

<p>Correct, their only <em>real</em> weapon is the narrative, which is why it is protected at all costs.  Once people overcome their differences with a particular group the controllers will simply switch to a new demographic that is to be the focus of rage and bigotry. If the strategy of division starts to lose it&#39;s effectiveness a fresh distraction will be cooked up in the form of war, scandal, mystery, or anything that will keep attention focused where they desire it to be. </p>

<p>They will continue doing so until there are no more sacrificial lambs and all distractions are disregarded in short order, and that is when things will get really interesting..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re rapidly approaching the point where it will be.  People have so little faith in both the media and the government that pretty much any information that comes through either of those mediums is instantly questioned now.  The last bastion that the establishment has to keep the illusion going you alluded to in your first sentence when you mentioned &quot;shilled to the gills&quot;.  Artificial consensus via manipulation of social media by fake accounts is still somewhat effective simply because most people still believe that the majority of the comments they read are made by random individuals with no particular affiliation to corporate or government entities.  It&#39;s only after this last veil has been pierced that things will become unpredictable, even for the controllers.  Then and only then will the horse be out of the barn..</p>

<p>The truly frightening thought that follows is the question of what types of drastic measures will be used to re-focus everyones attention once we&#39;ve all gone AWOL from the narrative.  It will have to be big and flashy, in a bad way.</p>
