       Have you noticed that the modern world has been seeking to separate everything from its roots? They have been trying to get rid of the traditional forms of worship in the catholic church. They have been genetically modifying foods so it is not the same as what it once was.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want people to travel around the country constantly from job to job. People go on vacations constantly and never become rooted in the land where they are. The style of music changes every ten years. They don't interview any of the old movie stars who were a part of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't interview the descendants of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. They don't interview the descendants of any of the founding fathers. We have no connection to the past. They just want us to move from one thing to the next and they want us to have shiny technology in compensation for having lost our connection to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       They promoted chaos in the middle east making millions into homeless wanderers and created many homeless wanderers in Eastern Europe. The schools tell the children what to think and it changes constantly and it keeps changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change change change everything keeps changing. It seems designed to throw people into psychological turmoil. Kids raised in this state of psychological turmoil are then called spoiled by adults even though they have a harder time than the adults had growing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything has been thrown into chaos and the generations have been turned against each other. Everyone is arguing and working so hard and constantly moving. But life is supposed to be simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cicero said "if you have a garden and a library then you have everything you need".
      </p>
      <p>
       Albert Camus said "What is a rebel? A man who says no".
      </p>
      <p>
       Say no to the modernity.  It is not going anywhere even though it is constantly moving.

       They are busy preventing roots at all, yes, instability is a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This nation once built houses an auto mechanic and retail workers could buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the middle class is being priced out of housing
      </p>
      <p>
       No affordable housing is being built for the working and now middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       current wages also put a new auto out of reach for about 45% of the people now working full time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes rootlessness but at the same time our ability to move on our own with our own money is being eliminated,  we have no public transportation outside of cities now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while they are busy creating  and moving around huge groups of economic and war refugees, and now the numbers are disruptive to cultural ties that bind people together.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are preventing the moved from putting down permanent roots and blending in with the existing populations.

       it's come to the point where grass-roots movements of people helping people and redefining their social contract with each other will happen, imo.

       There is that saying that goes "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me". The American people at this stage in the game have to accept responsibility for what they think because they have had almost a hundred years to adapt to the new information culture that has swept the world, the development of radio and television, and we are now at a stage where we have the internet and a huge amount of information and points of view. There is no longer an excuse if the American people choose to support and buy into policies that make the future worse. But yes perhaps at one point there was an excuse because society was experiencing a new type of propaganda that started maybe 50 or 70 years ago.

       Don't forget how they are breaking apart families by convincing children to go away to far off schools out of their home states only to become agenda-fed dummies who want to live in "big" cities where they only care about "jobs".
      </p>
      <p>
       Motherhood is a one time thing now, with many "empty-nesters" barely living to enjoy grandchildren. Compare this to women in 3rd world countries who probably get to play the role of mother their whole lives. Whether it's their own children or village-pests, moms want to stay moms. Not being able to is a big bummer.

       And dad's man. Dad's got it rough nowadays. I ain't even gonna get into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I hadn't believed the bullshit. I would have liked to have a kid already. But lets face it, with no land, no money, no friends, no car, the common consensus would say I don't deserve a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the world becoming increasingly toxic to conscious-lifeforms I usually think it's probably best I didn't.

       Planned Parenthood is NOT Parenthood.
They're part of a conspiracy to destroy Parenthood; the most basic unit of society.

       Thats a good point about the far off schools. So many pieces to the puzzle that many people have not looked at.

       Wealth and power.  The common man is an obstacle to that.  The smarter and more networked these men are, the harder they are to control and contain.  That is why across the spectrum from food to education to mainstream culture, it is all a mass effort to poison us.  We far outnumber and overpower them, and that is the biggest secret they wish to keep from us.  It's about telling the people who matter the most that they don't matter, the world hates them, and they should feel bad for existing.  Keeping us asleep is the best thing they can do to stop an angry mob dragging them out of their homes and lighting them on fire.  Whenever the day comes that people wake up to the truth, it will be a very ugly day for them.

       I guess we're just an infestation on their world. Partially true I guess. 5 billion thralls and probably a billion warriors/enforcers, and a couple thousand ruling elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The caste system of India is a real thing, and not a bad one. The idea is just that the elite sometimes aren't who they're supposed to be, they're just that way because of the complacency of the warrior class.

       They are trying very hard to separate us from knowledge and committing truly important aspects of our lives to memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's common knowledge that modern society has been removed from ancient knowledge. The Occult, which is ancient knowledge, has been demonized for centuries by the church. Only the elites are privy to its power now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The separation of knowledge continues and we are required to think less and less as time goes on. Spell check, calculators, cell phones, GPS and the financial grid are all leaving us brain dead and fucked should these systems fail us one day. We have become pathetic in our ability to provide and take care of ourselves...like lambs to the slaughter.

       And their future consists of poisoned food and water, Legal drugs that do nothing but make profits, Police state, Global currency with the poor and rich divide as inequal as possible.

       Yes.  You're on to something.  The singletonian agenda.  It's by design, and it's point is to isolate, disempower, and control you.  To turn you into a machineperson, a human resource in the game of grand human instrumentality working towards the world as federated empire of 'hives' called the city

At one time, mortgages could control you and tether you to a job, now it's rent because they don't give millenials loans very easily anymore.  I am beginnign to think the housing bubble was to convert everyone to renters so they could more easily move businesses around by moving employees around more easily

       Your solution is not to play their game.  Build a tiny house, buy land, make your own stuff.  Barter more.  Build your own solar powered internet.  Support open hardware (and open source generally).  Learn skills.  Have sex and don't feel bad about it, like your'e supposed to feel ashamed at being alive....realize everything they've taught you is probably wrong and that they lie to you all the time, every day and have for all your life...and they do this to benefit themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, plan for some big event (by amazon + cia + illuminati) that causes the power grid to go down, and all the kindles will power down and you'll lose your library. Just know that will happen. It's called the kindle fire so it's predicting the burning of books.  They have to dismantle libraries and mulch all the physical books first

       Definitely, as a foreigner with a chill job (Assistant language teacher).  But I can't speak for other foreign teachers since my situation is a little different from theirs.  And I definitely couldn't speak for Japanese teachers who work even more than Americans.

       If we take context out of any political discussion, then all we have is what works on the voting public: emotional, reactionary hysteria. Great place to have voters. God forbid you actually describe the

       That is a great find! A gem of a quote. The agenda is Marxist to the core. Maybe not Marxist in the way Karl Marx envisioned but the hostility to tradition and the envy is part of this modernistic agenda.

       Uhh, I don't think you understood the quote. The quote was critiquing capitalism's tendency to assimilate and destroy tradition and culture. Which is exactly what's happening today.

       I never said the quote was intentionally describing the Marxist agenda. I said the quote is the Marxist agenda and by marxist I mean the politics of envy which is the root of the modernist tendencies that even marx himself was critiqing in his book but which his book in fact was a progression of.

       I ache for those I cannot be near but I plow ahead. My garden will be there tomorrow and the next day but if I neglect to care just a day or so...my family has feet, cars, jobs, lives, pressures, LIFE!

       Everything is being shaped to discourage white Christians from having children. The family is under attack by feminists and "progressives". Marriage has been made into a mockery by homosexuals, with the progs enthusiastic support through the media. Women are encouraged not to become mothers, but to work all their lives at pointless, useless jobs. House wives are mocked ruthlessly. Birth control and abortion are both heavily promoted. Promiscuous sex outside of marriage is promoted, particularly with partners of another race, or with partners of the same gender. Pornography is everywhere. Did you ever wonder why there is so much pornography? It's because it decreases normal sexual impulses. Porn addicts are less likely to want to marry and have children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget rootless wanderers -- they are trying to commit genocide against us, and they are succeeding. And who are they? Ask yourself who control the media? Ask yourself who you are not permitted to criticize without being attacked?

       The antichristian elite is not the only ones to blame. The public itself that just mindlessly goes along with the next horrible agenda is to blame as much as anyone else. If there was no traitorous elite in this country you would still have disgusting things happening. You would still have the government doing really stupid things and people would still be oppressed by the system. The reason the elite in America are so treacherous is becaue of the character of the nation itself. A treacherous elite isn't able to embed itself in just any country just as a plant can't grow in just any soil.
