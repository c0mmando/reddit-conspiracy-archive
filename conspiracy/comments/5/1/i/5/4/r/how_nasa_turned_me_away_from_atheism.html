        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe I claimed myself an atheist for most my life because of science brought forth by USA and NASA. </p>

<p>Now that NASA has proven to be a giant hoax and the US government is proven to be a giant deception ( along with most other countries in the UN ) I&#39;m once again entertaining certain ideas that I absolutely have denied in the name of science. 3 months ago I wouldn&#39;t even entertain watching this video that shifted my reality, I&#39;m glad I did.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IYYj_h_i5wo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IYYj_h_i5wo</a></p>

<p>The fact that those in the government worship Baal and Moloch ( As per Wikileaks email leaks ), I have found myself once again searching for answers. </p>

<p>Im starting to think Satan runs this world or at least the people in power strongly believe he does.</p>

<p>When people say &quot;lucifers greatest trick was making you think he didnt exist&quot;. They weren&#39;t joking.</p>

<p>Since I woke up, I&#39;m in this somewhat limbo state. Could these people have sacred knowledge which makes them believe the way they do. Or could they just be another pawn, like the fake Jews. Could the Masons be pulling all the strings or could the satanists.</p>

<p>I think that is the beauty of their giant deception.</p>

<p>Nobody but true insiders know who is really pulling the strings. For all we know the Masons have all these satanists and Baal worshippers fooled doing their bidding.</p>

<p>The fact is, everything we have ever been taught about history, from Darwin ( a mason ) to Ancient Egypt, has been told in half truths and lies. We have been deceived on a grand scale.</p>

<p>As a militant atheist who truly believed in the science out forth to us, this was a hard pill to swallow.</p>

<p>Hell, there are hyroglyphs of light bulbs found in Giza! Most people don&#39;t even know Ancient Egypt harnessed free energy and were 10x more advanced with cleaner tech than we have now.</p>

<p><a href="http://m.harunyahya.com/en/Technological-Advances-of-Ancient-Ages/13770/light-bulbs-were-used-for">http://m.harunyahya.com/en/Technological-Advances-of-Ancient-Ages/13770/light-bulbs-were-used-for</a></p>

<p>Whatever it is, it&#39;s interesting as hell.</p>

<p>What freaks me out is the fact that people pulling the strings are hell-bent on bringing forth an artificial apocolyps as written in the biblical Revelations. </p>

<p>The question is why?</p>

<p>Is it a blue print by the real people pulling the strings to reset society?</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that we are in an advanced biological terrarium. </p>

<p>Why do they hide space? When I say hide space, ideally I mean embellish the reality of space and images of space through computer graphics.</p>

<p>Since all the pictures are CG and composits, we really have no clue what space actually looks like except through a ground telescope or pictures they out out which most have been proven to be computer graphics.</p>

<p>One of the more recent sick/amusing jokes they put out were the early shots of Pluto:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEDbjNaz4g">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEDbjNaz4g</a></p>

<p>There can be two reasons why they hide space. </p>

<p>One. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bustling busy place flourishing with life and we aren&#39;t part of it being on this prison planet.. maybe we are just grown in open captivity for spare blood for more advanced humans/animals on another planet. For all we know the pharmaceuticals are tested on the humans of earth before they are used on a race that has us enslaved in this open world bubble.</p>

<p>Two. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t actually get to space through conventional space ship means. Perhaps there is an impenetrable dome over us. Perhaps we truly are at the forefront of the universe and everything revolves around us. Perhaps the bible is true and Lucifer does run this shit.</p>

<p>No one really knows if there is life on Mars, at least us peons. We can&#39;t trust their word because they were caught hoaxing everything. </p>

<p>Seeing as the people pulling the strings are inserting foreigners ( refugees ) into countries for eugenics purposes, I&#39;m betting the safest place to be to avoid the murder by your own government ( 9/11 ) is the places they import these people to. What would he the point of them importing them only to kill them in a false flag.</p>

<p>I do know one thing, as a human in this world, with the right biological tool, we have access to higher dimensions. Through plant technology we can go where we sometimes need to go. The fact that the powers that be have banned this plant technology should tell you something.</p>

<p>Anyways. Much love to you all.</p>

<p>Hope I got my point across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is a representation of Fear.</p>

<p>The elites want you to be afraid.</p>

<p>If you are afraid ,you would project onto reality a satanic being running everything. 
It follows with our belief systems. Why are you afraid? Because you believe in evil beings.</p>

<p>The dichotomy messes with your head.. It limits the mind to black and white. Either or. Either God or Satan. Try to dissolve that religious duality. 
If there is no God, or Satan, then what&#39;s really going on?</p>

<p>And don&#39;t project y o ur fear on an alien race as controlling you.</p>

<p>When you ask yourself what&#39;s going on, don&#39;t be afraid. Dissolve the dichotomy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can test and measure reality as you perceive it within a degree of certainty. Gravitational force can be measured, you can fire a rocket upwards and observe that it can escape the atmosphere. The idea that the Earth is shielded by a dome over flat land is thus demonstrably false. Airplanes, time zones, etc must just be the clever work of a biblical devil (specific to one religion in a sea of thousands). This theory just doesn&#39;t hold up with anything that aligns with a person&#39;s subjective  perception.</p>

Why do they think we can do this when we can&#39;t even manage our own planet well? This is off topic but it&#39;s a pet peeve of mine.</p>

<p>As far as your post, I&#39;m kind of struggling with the same thing? Just how real is Satan? If consciousness is limitless, then there is the possibility for anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. I&#39;ll take it even deeper, how do we even know for sure that Mars isn&#39;t actually habitable.</p>

<p>How do we know for sure that animals aren&#39;t living on it right now.</p>

<p>I think Satan is real enough for them to pull the greatest mass deception ever I guess to be a clever way of steering people away from God.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a lot deeper than Satan.</p>

<p>Perhaps he is just being used as a tool by those behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Which in effect doesn&#39;t make him any less real. The Satan paradox.</p>

<p>One thing I always wondered was &quot;all this bad thing happening in the world, what human would be evil enough to orchestrate such..only to think, what if it&#39;s not human&quot;</p>

<p>Highly recommend Imran Hosein On YouTube, although he is Muslim he studied Christian/Jewish/Islamic escheotology (misspelled) and is very knowledgable on current world events and history connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think God damns people to hell, God just creates a choice. </p>

<p>To live in harmony with creation;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>to reject it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that wacking it or having sex before marriage rejects anything. This is the Christian God, as we are told that this one is omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent who created us in their image. Since to be omnipotent requires being all energy, and omnipresent being all matter, we have to accept that the image is not a physical one. All matter and all energy came to gather to provide us with a platform for life with conscientiousness: the image of God. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t want you to understand your value. Some will use your sexuality against you, and every other thing they can but if you wasted this existence on such things, that&#39;s hardly worthy of the image of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the fulfillment of the Abrahamic religions (according to Christians), I&#39;ve described God as Christians must accept God to be. To be omnipresent and omnipotent. God must be everything. Since God is everything, God is also omniscient. </p>

<p>Jesus was the highest prophet and as he said, we are all his brothers and sisters, equally children of God. For Jesus, we have the living and the dead. You are either living, being a sibling amongst the children of God, or the dead, those who wish to be more equal than the rest. </p>

<p>I thought it was so crazy that it couldn&#39;t be reality.</p>

<p>Kinda shifts the whole reality. After I learned about the nasa hoax and all their data I ever learned about space went out the window I started questions why they fake space.</p>

<p>This opened me up to the idea of flat earth. Ya see I automatically resisted the idea of a flat/concave earth based on my reality that NASA wouldn&#39;t push false malicious info. Once I could see that deception I revisited the flat/concave earth theory and WOW.. </p>

<p>The amazing part is.. the elite have inserted this knowledge in plain sight for years in media and movies.</p>

<p>The flat earth maps and references are EVERYWHERE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1960s, a plot concocted by the Jew/Freemason alliance captured the church, held a church council, and changed all the traditional beliefs and practices. This had been planned for many years (research Alta Vedita). Now why was this important to do? Does the Catholic Church represent some kind of threat? You bet it does. The traditional Church teaching was standing in the way of the Jewish/Mason agenda. These people have not done the same to the Southern Baptist Convention, or the Tibetan Buddhists, or any one of any number of religions or Churches. Only in the Catholic Church was it important to infiltrate and destroy. The Traditional Catholic Church was upholding the true teachings of Jesus since when He established it for this purpose. The Traditional Catholic Church is the sworn and natural enemy of Masonry/Judaism, so it therefore must be the friend of humanity — even if it&#39;s on the principle of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>

<p>But note well, I&#39;m talking about the Traditional Church. So find a traditional latin mass in your area, and learn everything you can about it. Don&#39;t ever go the new mass, and especially pay no attention to the fraudalent counterfeit church now ruling in the Vatican. That goes for all Popes and teachings since 1958. I can&#39;t tell you what the truth is, you must find it for yourself, but that&#39;s where you start. </p>

<p>Now you might hear things coming out of the Vatican talking about religious tolerance and ecumenism and things of that nature. It can be very beguiling because all want peace and we don&#39;t want hate and intolerance. But realise that the Vatican teachings are full of liberalist, modernist Marxist, jewish, masonic principles. It&#39;s these principles that are being pushed as the secular agenda, and it all serves to undermine humanity, society, relationships etc etc and thus enable and feed the beast — the beast that is behind most of the conspiracies you read about in this sub. The conspiracies to keep the people fat, sick, stupid and poor, to the benefit of the elite and TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same bro. Same.</p>

<p>I thought it was so crazy that it couldn&#39;t be reality.</p>

<p>Kinda shifts the whole reality. After I learned about the nasa hoax and all their data I ever learned about space went out the window I started questions why they fake space.</p>

<p>This opened me up to the idea of flat earth. Ya see I automatically resisted the idea of a flat/concave earth based on my reality that NASA wouldn&#39;t push false malicious info. Once I could see that deception I revisited the flat/concave earth theory and WOW.. </p>

<p>The amazing part is.. the elite have inserted this knowledge in plain sight for years in media and movies.</p>

<p>The flat earth maps and references are EVERYWHERE.</p>
