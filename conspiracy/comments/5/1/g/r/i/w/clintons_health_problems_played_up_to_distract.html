       I'm not so sure about that, though it would be hilarious if she pulled a Willy Wonka and tumbled into a somersault as she came up to the podium for her next speech.

       Many outlets including this sub and other sites roughly follow drudge. If it's front and center, first second and third tier articles get posted and up voted the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       People's memory is fairly short. It's amazing to watch. To think this detracts from the multiple years of email scandal or benghazi, murders, etc is just silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, this just adds credibility to the fact Hillary is capable and willing to hide things, lie, and leverage institutional connections and power as a means to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her camp will attempt to solidify Drudge/Infowars/Brietbart/Trump as scales of the same serpent - throw it all out based on lack of "credibility". The "alt-right" remarks are the beginning of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       After they coalesce around these talking points, what determines the outcome could be any leak that destroys the narrative given to defend the onslaught of allegations. But the clock is ticking...
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, this is not a distraction. Far from it.

       ah, then the credit goes to you.   I was suspicious about the 'Dr. Drew' scenario - where they pretend to try and quash medical rumors counting on the Streisand effect to blow it up out of proportion to the criminality allegations.

       I'd rather she not "get away with it".  But I will settle for her backing out "for medical reasons".  It's better for than America to let a criminal go free, than have one as President.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could happen, as her criminal acts are getting so much attention
       <em>
        despite the media's best efforts
       </em>
       that to NOT indict Hillary would irreparably harm Americans belief in the religion of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be her way to get out of the public eye, "out of sight, out of mind", and be her only way to remain unconvicted.  Rather see in her prison, but I'll take this.

       Her criminality AND her health are distractions... Every president in Amerikkkan history has been a criminal...you have to be a criminal to be the puppet for our criminal government... Voting or caring about the election proves you are still plugged in to the distraction game... Can we get this page back to conspiracy rather than politics 101...
