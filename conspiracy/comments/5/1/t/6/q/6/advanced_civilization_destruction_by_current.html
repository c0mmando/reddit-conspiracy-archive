       So I've been digging into our past and have been finding out a bunch of interesting things. The more I dig the more noticeable it is that the people in power have actively tried to hide the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stumbled across this hyroglyph.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The hyroglyphs writing translates to "the enemies of Egypt".
      </p>
      <p>
       We are let to believe that the ancient Egyptians were a slave society that only existed in current egypt and never expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we were taught in school was without a doubt deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Egyptians is now clearly discovered in North America as well as Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Groups have actively tried to cover these discovers up because it hides the narrative of Egyptians not being travelers or advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact when looking at this hyroglyph:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       One clearly notices, a tank, a helicopter and a jet doing a bombing raid.
      </p>
      <p>
       One also notices a bug. I'm theorizing it's a Mosquito. Now why would a Mosquito be an enemy of Egypt? Please see the GM Mosquitos of today that can spread virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet that the same lineage of people that brought forth the genocide of ancient Egyptians, literally wiping them off the map, are the same ones carrying out this biblical Revelations destruction of our society today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The technology was always around, just nobody who wasn't elite knew about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right, a select chosen bloodline of people either had helicopters and jet technology for the past hundreds of years and pick and chose when to release it on the world.
      </p>

       That's basically the gist of the Survivors of the Great Deluge theory. Various people survived, some good and some (evil) of the ones that caused it (CERN). If you haven't seen it yet, check out:

       Yes. I believe they are trying to recreate what they did before, without the whole fuck up that was the Great Deluge. They're insane though and will be the death of us all... Bastards...

       I think the really sad part is all of the people who are into the bible and thinking they will be saved by God when in reality, they have been deceived by the same group that is actively trying to reset society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im certain they most definately created this Adam/eve religious thing as a form of control..
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably created the first bible and spread the first bit of misinformation from town to town until the myth grew roots.

       the bible is a version of the pagan Saturn stuff.  it's not myth so much as it's misinterpreted (it's a design document, partly, imo).  Saturn's (or alternately Enlil's) influence as the God of the Bible is prob the case.  There are just too many consistent historical records that align to this.  But who knows..

       That's not true. There is evidence everywhere, you just need to know what/where to look. MS archaeology/historians have done a great job at obfuscating this. Göbekli Tepe is one example of this.

       Copypasta of my response on the similar CST thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen that image before but I didn't know about the text that came along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some thoughts on it. The craft are relatively lowtech compared to the lightcraft/foofighters. I personally believe we have time travel tech. This carving could show that ancient egypt was invaded by a time-travelling force whose weaponry is somewhat contemporary to today. The images are indicative of the ways in which the attack happened. I imagine there's a seed of something the powers want to destroy or change, historically, but have failed to do it. As you say, the ruling families might be the target of this, and they're trying to pull off a mandela effect kinda change further on down the timeline.  Or the ruling families might be the cause of this, with another agenda, but similar mandela effect kinda goals.

       I sure as hell don't see a helicopter or tanks, but that is highly subjective, people see what they want to see. One thing is for sure, the priesthood of egypt moved and changed it's colours. It's widely known that the pharonic bloodline heritage is

       It's clearly a glyph of a helicopter, a tank and a plane.

       No doubt our history is covered up and distorted, that was the hole point of christianity, to dumb down and make people stupid to their ancestry, to make them forget their forefathers religion, the romans started this historic forgery. Who built the most ancient megalithic sites? I do not know, they sure as hell had more advanced tools than copper chisels. That's a fact I know for sure. So what happened to the ancient highly developed civilizations, did it destroy itself or did they keep the knowledge to themselves, kept it in their elitist families?

       the bible is a version of the pagan Saturn stuff.  it's not myth so much as it's misinterpreted (it's a design document, partly, imo).  Saturn's (or alternately Enlil's) influence as the God of the Bible is prob the case.  There are just too many consistent historical records that align to this.  But who knows..
