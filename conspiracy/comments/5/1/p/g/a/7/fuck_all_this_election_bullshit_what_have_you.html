<p>who has this to say &quot;the many benefits the Muslim world derived from Mongol rule after the initial conquests..and whilst Soviet editors added footnotes deploring his &#39;bourgeois&#39; attitudes, his prestige was such that the text was left uncensored despite not conforming to a Marxist interpretation of history&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing conclusive yet. The closest I&#39;ve gotten is an obscure 4chan thread that was deleted by the op, who claimed to be a CERN scientist, working on the team responsible for the edits. Luckily, someone took screen shots, and uploaded here:
np.reddit.com<a href="/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4yyz23/4chan_thread_scientist_at_cern_admits_it/">/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4yyz23/4chan_thread_scientist_at_cern_admits_it/</a></p>

<p>Anyone could&#39;ve easily hoaxed that, and the thread is hard to follow, but there&#39;s a very strange feeling I have about it... worth checking out. I&#39;m convinced that something profound is happening, and our reality as we know it is being edited. I once thought that it was a combination of CERN, quantum computing, and our exponential increase of personal processing power, as a civilization, but these changes aren&#39;t random, they&#39;re targeted at very specific things. So now I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s absolutely deliberate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is sarcasm or not - since Stephen Greer is so maligned by so many - but he is a figure that, regardless of what one may try to say about him one way or the other, has done more for the disclosure movement than pretty much anyone.  As such, he is, again, a seminal figure where disclosure is concerned.  I personally greatly appreciate his efforts, and am glad he did what he did with his The Disclosure Project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, there isn&#39;t &quot;one group only&quot; in charge of EVERYTHING on the planet.  There are various cabals - something like 7 families or so (?) - each of which have great power, and all of which have their own, personal agenda...and some of those agendas are pretty directly conflicting with one another.</p>

<p>Some of those groups are pretty &quot;service to self&quot;, and some of those groups are pretty &quot;service to others&quot;.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that he is protected to <em>some</em> extent - whether he knows it directly or not - by at least one of those groups.  Otherwise he would likely have been long dead by now (as a long time business partner and collaborator of his was).</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that there is at least some extent of narcissistic undermining in him as well.  I don&#39;t have the personal agenda against him that so many others seem to be fixated on.  I feel I&#39;m quite a bit more balanced toward Greer than many I&#39;ve heard on here, and I think he&#39;s a very important figure and has done a lot for spreading disclosure to the masses.  However, he does, of course, come across as pretty full of himself sometimes, and I acknowledge that there&#39;s a possibility that he has been undermined to perhaps some extent regardless.  How and to <em>what</em> extent? I&#39;ve no idea.</p>

<p>Regardless, he&#39;s disseminated a lot of valuable information w/regard to disclosure, so I appreciate greatly that he did that at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Who would protect him? The aliens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are elites on this planet that are very powerful in their own right - at least on a global/Earth level/basis.  I imagine that if some of these powerful elites don&#39;t want him dead, they can help keep it from happening.  There are also certain ET groups that I imagine wouldn&#39;t have a problem w/disclosure and who wouldn&#39;t have a problem helping someone interested in moving it along.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He mentioned that aliens have an interest in our survival. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some do.  Some don&#39;t.  Most I&#39;d imagine don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Some who do I would guess have an interest because they <em>made</em> us - or at least were partially responsible for our existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That sounds creepy to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?  What&#39;s so creepy in some beings having an interest in our survival?  Some have an interest because they see that the human species might have good potential to evolve nicely and can join a galactic family of sorts.  Others might have an interest because they&#39;re mining us as a resource and don&#39;t want to see their cash cow die off.  Some are interested because they helped <em>create</em> us and see us as family - or at least their &quot;property&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess something like that can sound creepy to some.  I just think it is what it is (whatever it might be).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I can understand how that would creep someone out.  However, if it&#39;s true, it&#39;s true.  We have to acknowledge it, deal with it, and move forward toward our betterment.  Getting creeped out by it is understandable.  <em>Remaining</em> creeped out, however, is something we would need to break out of if we are to move forward.</p>

<p>Additionally, considering what we do to other non-human animals here on this planet, it would make sense that we would get quite a bit of that same home cooking served right back to us.  Kind of serves us right, karmically speaking.  It&#39;s no different than what we do to all kinds of other species of animals here on Earth ultimately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon his arrival in the U. S., British intelligence reportedly told the U.S. government that they suspected he was working for German intelligence. Documents indicate he was under FBI surveillance for much of the 1940s. Mohrenschildt was hired by the Shumaker company in New York City, which also employed a man named Pierre Fraiss who had connections with French intelligence. According to Mohrenschildt, he and Fraiss, among their other duties, gathered information about people involved in &quot;pro-German&quot; activities, such as those bidding for U.S. oil leases on behalf of Germany before the U.S. became involved in World War II.</p>

<p>Mohrenschildt spent the summer of 1938 with his older brother Dimitri von Mohrenschildt on Long Island, New York. Dimitri was a staunch anti-Communist[15] and member of the OSS and one of the founders of the CIA&#39;s Radio Free Europe and Amcomlib (a.k.a., Radio Liberty) stations.</p>

<p>While in New York, Mohrenschildt became acquainted with the Bouvier family, including the young Jacqueline Bouvier, the future wife of John F. Kennedy. Jacqueline grew up calling Mohrenschildt &quot;Uncle George&quot; and would sit on his knee.</p>

<p>when the United States entered World War II, his application to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was rejected. According to a memo by former CIA director Richard Helms, Mohrenschildt &quot;was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.&quot;</p>

<p>After the end of World War II, Mohrenschildt moved to Venezuela, where he worked for Pantepec Oil, a company owned by the family of William F. Buckley.</p>

<p>Mohrenschildt testified to the Warren Commission in 1964 that he had met the Oswalds through George Bouhe. When he asked “Do you think it is safe for us to help Oswald”, Bouhe said he had checked with the FBI. Mohrenschildt also stated that he believed he had discussed Oswald with Max Clark, whom he believed was connected with the FBI, and with J. Walton Moore, whom Mohrenschildt described as &quot;a Government man — either FBI or Central Intelligence&quot;, and who had debriefed Mohrenschildt several times following his travels abroad, starting in 1957. (According to a CIA classified document, obtained by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, J. Walton Moore was an agent of the CIA&#39;s Domestic Contacts Division in Dallas.)</p>

<p>George de Mohrenschildt&#39;s wife and daughter would later say that it had been Mohrenschildt who secured the job at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall for Oswald.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1963, George de Mohrenschildt and his wife, Jeanne, visited the Oswalds&#39; apartment. As Oswald&#39;s wife, Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald&#39;s rifle leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, &quot;Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?&quot; (General Edwin Walker was a conservative activist whom George de Mohrenschildt said he &quot;knew that Oswald disliked.&quot;) When later asked by the Warren Commission about Oswald&#39;s reaction to his question, George de Mohrenschildt said that Oswald &quot;smiled at that.&quot; In an interview with Edward Jay Epstein, Mohrenschildt claimed to have been in touch with the CIA about Oswald’s attempted assassination of General Walker. &quot;I spoke to the CIA both before and afterwards. It was what ruined me.&quot;</p>

<p>During 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison interviewed Jeanne and George de Mohrenschildt as part of Garrison&#39;s prosecution of Clay Shaw. Garrison said that both of the Mohrenschildts insisted that Oswald had been the scapegoat in the assassination of President Kennedy. Garrison concluded from his conversation with them that George de Mohrenschildt had been one of Oswald&#39;s unwitting &quot;baby-sitters... assigned to protect or otherwise see to the general welfare of [Oswald].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to disentangle the spy vs spy of jesuits versus sabbateans versus freemasons of Jesuit&#39;s original protocols of elders of zion...allegedly called &quot;The Secrets of the Elders of Bourg-Fontaine&quot;.  Of course, all I can find is blogs repeating each other and no primary source document of the text of this, leading me to believe this is yet-more-misdirection--a nice &#39;story&#39;, similar to some misdirections of dan brown or umberto eco or anyone fakewhistleblowing the occult.</p>

<p>Henry Ford was a freemason who published many copies of Protocols, and did so with anonymous authorship, which means he published propaganda on behalf of Freemasonry.  Sorry, but we have to pin that on freemason.</p>

<p>The Jesuit &#39;original&#39; source is a nice &#39;story&#39; until we can get some confirmation that this document actually ever existed, such as 1) the textual contents, 2) a picture of the document or location of the document in a museum (ie: vatican library or buried off the books in a vault somewhere), 3) a statement from the vatican, from a monarch, or from a vatican or monarch or jesuit endorsed &#39;authority&#39; that can confirm it as extant</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon his arrival in the U. S., British intelligence reportedly told the U.S. government that they suspected he was working for German intelligence. Documents indicate he was under FBI surveillance for much of the 1940s. Mohrenschildt was hired by the Shumaker company in New York City, which also employed a man named Pierre Fraiss who had connections with French intelligence. According to Mohrenschildt, he and Fraiss, among their other duties, gathered information about people involved in &quot;pro-German&quot; activities, such as those bidding for U.S. oil leases on behalf of Germany before the U.S. became involved in World War II.</p>

<p>Mohrenschildt spent the summer of 1938 with his older brother Dimitri von Mohrenschildt on Long Island, New York. Dimitri was a staunch anti-Communist[15] and member of the OSS and one of the founders of the CIA&#39;s Radio Free Europe and Amcomlib (a.k.a., Radio Liberty) stations.</p>

<p>While in New York, Mohrenschildt became acquainted with the Bouvier family, including the young Jacqueline Bouvier, the future wife of John F. Kennedy. Jacqueline grew up calling Mohrenschildt &quot;Uncle George&quot; and would sit on his knee.</p>

<p>when the United States entered World War II, his application to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was rejected. According to a memo by former CIA director Richard Helms, Mohrenschildt &quot;was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.&quot;</p>

<p>After the end of World War II, Mohrenschildt moved to Venezuela, where he worked for Pantepec Oil, a company owned by the family of William F. Buckley.</p>

<p>Mohrenschildt testified to the Warren Commission in 1964 that he had met the Oswalds through George Bouhe. When he asked “Do you think it is safe for us to help Oswald”, Bouhe said he had checked with the FBI. Mohrenschildt also stated that he believed he had discussed Oswald with Max Clark, whom he believed was connected with the FBI, and with J. Walton Moore, whom Mohrenschildt described as &quot;a Government man — either FBI or Central Intelligence&quot;, and who had debriefed Mohrenschildt several times following his travels abroad, starting in 1957. (According to a CIA classified document, obtained by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, J. Walton Moore was an agent of the CIA&#39;s Domestic Contacts Division in Dallas.)</p>

<p>George de Mohrenschildt&#39;s wife and daughter would later say that it had been Mohrenschildt who secured the job at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall for Oswald.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1963, George de Mohrenschildt and his wife, Jeanne, visited the Oswalds&#39; apartment. As Oswald&#39;s wife, Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald&#39;s rifle leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, &quot;Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?&quot; (General Edwin Walker was a conservative activist whom George de Mohrenschildt said he &quot;knew that Oswald disliked.&quot;) When later asked by the Warren Commission about Oswald&#39;s reaction to his question, George de Mohrenschildt said that Oswald &quot;smiled at that.&quot; In an interview with Edward Jay Epstein, Mohrenschildt claimed to have been in touch with the CIA about Oswald’s attempted assassination of General Walker. &quot;I spoke to the CIA both before and afterwards. It was what ruined me.&quot;</p>

<p>During 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison interviewed Jeanne and George de Mohrenschildt as part of Garrison&#39;s prosecution of Clay Shaw. Garrison said that both of the Mohrenschildts insisted that Oswald had been the scapegoat in the assassination of President Kennedy. Garrison concluded from his conversation with them that George de Mohrenschildt had been one of Oswald&#39;s unwitting &quot;baby-sitters... assigned to protect or otherwise see to the general welfare of [Oswald].</p>
