       Ever since the start of this most recent European terror wave, I've been convinced that there was some element of the European far right that's been responsible for most of these attacks that have been attributed to ISIS and refugees. These are Cold War-style Gladio stay-behind operations, only this time NATO's boogyeman is Islam instead of communism. Its main purpose is to suppress dissent, violate civil liberties, keep control over their tax cattle, and also to use the wave of ISIS-based terrorism as a weapon against Russia, China, and Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another purpose served by NATO's Islamic State regional proxies is that Russian troops are much less likely to push into western Ukraine or into an EU member state if they know that they will have ISIS to deal with should they ever attempt an assault on wider Europe. This is likely the politicians' main political justification for the creation of ISIS in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some notes on Gladio:

       As someone who has been following this peculiar phenomenon very closely for a very long time, one of my worst concerns that I have ahead of the fifteen year 9/11 anniversary is that world elites, their far right mercenaries, and a cabal of neo-fascistic political opportunists in the West, Russia, and the Middle East will use another right wing terror attack to further scapegoat Arabs and Muslims.

       I'd say it's very possible. But all in all I am not fearful. I serve the one true God of the Bible. The living word of God that predicted the NWO in the book of revelations. Use this modern knowledge and compare it to the biblical prophecy! These are the end times.

       I think It's very likely that something big will happen before the election. People have figured out that the game is rigged, so they need something big to take attention away from it all.

       Since 9/11 is a Sunday, I've been guessing (not predicting, just taking a wild horrible stab in the dark), a mass organized attack on churches by "evildoers" with semi-automatics, wiping out a ton of Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would set off a shit-storm of dominoes, from gun control to surveillance state to removing forces of goodness, etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT....I also think that there's a lot of super secret forces pushing back against the evil plotting. I'm pretty convinced there was more to that SpaceX rocket blowing up than we've been told, and that it's payload wasn't what we were told, either.

       Israel firsters who came up with the project for a new american century are now aligning themselves with hillary clinton. So basically nothing is going to change, there will be only escalation of

       I can't believe that our far-right brethren in Europe would stage false-flags, unless they would benefit from a massive right-wing coup. That would be the only motivator for true nationalists.

       The Nazis scapegoated the communists when they burned down the Reichstag building.

       Yes. And i think it would use Pokemon Go to bait crowds and blow them all up with a car or chemical bomb, killing hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility is one of those democracy-bringing Invasions that they are experimenting on Libya or Ukraine in the last few years, this time on Hong Kong. I already made at least one post concerning this and it can happen very easily with Soros agents and political unions running legislations.

       This next attack could be nuclear. Dick Cheney himself has "warned" about it.

       Gotta love that predictive programming. An ex-military buddy of mine told me the same thing 2 years ago about nukes being used for the "next 9-11." I don't know exactly what to think about that but one thing is certain, the next event will make 9-11 pale in comparison. Whenever that may be.

       They want control, not destruction. A nuclear attack can easily represent the end of the illuminati structure. They will be launched on barren places like detroit or chicago, but they will not be used to attack establishment places such as washington or new york.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use them to attack anywhere results are still the same, but they will not and never be stupid enough to attack their own command centers.

       I'm gonna blow some minds right here I think. You know if you fold the old US notes you can see the towers getting hit and falling. Well... If you fold the newest notes the same way it makes a picture of new york seemingly getting bombed and flooded.

       Could be. I don't think the currency lies. Martial law is going to happen. I don't want to scare anybody with what I think will happen. They're going to take away everyone's guns. It's going to start in the US and will go everywhere in the entire world. They are going to cull the population.
