        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Human culture is passed down from generation to generation throughout history, morphing and evolving as it goes. The culture reflects the environment of the time, the technology available to it and the habits and feelings of the people who make it up. In the past, most human culture was passed down through oral tradition, the telling of stories that lived in our culture longer than any one human body ever lives. </p>

<p>In modern history we have developed methods of communicating information across many people very quickly. First was the printing press and books, which evolved in to modern print media, newspapers, magazines and eventually once the technology developed, moving pictures, film, TV, and the internet came to be the methods of gathering new information. </p>

<p>The power of controlling the narrative is not new. This knowledge has been around since before the age of Kings and Queens. If something happens in the world, and you&#39;re the only one who saw it, then you can tell the story any way you like as long as it matches up with what people already know to be true. If you&#39;re the government, and only your people saw it, then you can do the same thing. I can&#39;t imagine how many murders have been covered up throughout history by control of the narrative. Entire wars, even. The reasons for starting wars can be fabricated by those who would profit from war. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">(Link to list of 53 government-admitted false flags)</a> If the public can&#39;t tell the difference, then they will be fooled in to supporting the authority structure that governs them because believing narratives and going with the group is our default stance as human beings. If people are content and suffer no pain from this belief, they will continue to hold it, because why not? It helps them fit in and it&#39;s no fun to hate what everyone else likes, it just alienates you, and no one <em>wants</em> to feel alienated.  </p>

<p>So through the consolidation of the narrative through the consolidation and widening reach of the media, we are offered information that benefits the state, because generally the only conglomerate of media that is allowed to form <em>in</em> the state, is one that <em>supports</em> the state, or else they will be eventually disbanded by the government for opposing it too strongly. So you wind up with a pro-authority structure in both the government and media, each supporting each other. Anything else doesn&#39;t last as long because they&#39;re unstable and aren&#39;t benefiting from propping each other up, the media with narrative control and money, and the government with lawmaking power and money.</p>

<p>So our culture is influenced a lot by the media, that is obvious. We have the cultural momentum from the past, but the acceleration of the media in the present, to make a physics analogy. We also apply acceleration to our human world culture if we choose to take it in to our own hands - in a good or bad direction - through our own contributions to our overlapping micro-cultures, like this subreddit or your group of friends or co-workers. </p>

<p>Now in history we find ourselves like many populations have in times past: trapped under an abusive authoritarian system. The government has problems, the corporate monopolies have run amok (essentially taking over the government), and the middle class is dying out. We are returning to the haves and the have-nots, because the essentials to life are becoming so expensive to access. No one owns their house anymore, everyone is making mortgage or rent payments that keep them on the treadmill, because it&#39;s too expensive to buy a house. Same for cars. Wages are simply too low, jobs too few, and goods are too expensive. Just 40 years ago, it was generally the opposite. </p>

<p>So to tie all this together, we find ourselves in a situation of being abused by the authority structure already in place, who uses the media to powerfully manipulate culture. But our human nature of going with the group and wishing to be socially accepted keeps us trapped going along with the game they&#39;ve outlined for us. It&#39;s built with our innate desires in mind. The table is tilted, the ball rolls downhill. It&#39;s predictable. </p>

<p>If we are to believe the narratives we are told in 2016, this often means to hate ourselves. &quot;You are not attractive enough, buy this thing. You are stupid, so act stupid. You don&#39;t understand, you shouldn&#39;t have your own opinion yet. Focus on sex and materialism as your pursuits.&quot; This is the point we have gotten to. The authority structure has little regard for human life. I think this is partially because, at least in America, people did not protest and continue pushing for rights in the 1970s-1990s because they were all living high on the hog due to a good labor market and stopped caring. So there was scope creep, and the government spread to more and more things. Power structures want to grow, it&#39;s how they got powerful in the first place. They are always passing bills, but rarely cancelling or repealing them, ever notice that? There are always more and more laws. The corporations were then very successful in pressuring congress because the reduced pressure from labor, and then our government eventually became corporatist. Carter through Bush and Obama all participated in this. This allowed for things like globalization, where jobs are outsourced globally or insourced via H1-B programs and the like, for the cheapest wages. Good for the profit of international companies, bad for the middle class of already-wealthy countries, like the US in the 80s. </p>

<p>So the economy is getting worse and worse, and it is starting to wear on people. The claws are starting to come out as people get more desperate to meet their payments required to live. This, in turn, causes the media to become more disconnected from the reality we all experience every day, because it must maintain the illusion of things being generally good in the country, because the authority structure needs our consent in order to lead all of us. There is no way a few thousand people can control 330,000,000 people unless those people consent to it on some level. This is why there are good things in the government, like roads and the postal service, and fire services. They have to keep these, because they know if they pull the money for those things, people will uniformly no longer tolerate the government because it&#39;s obviously anti-human. Those are lessons we&#39;ve learned in our culture from things that have happened in the past and our culture refuses to budge on those issues. These beliefs are golden, they protect us because they spur us to action if we are crossed in the wrong way as a group. These things are considered to be requirements of the &quot;Social Contract&quot; that the allows the government to maintain its position of control and power. </p>

<p>Those in power know that you cannot deprive a population of certain things, or else any appearance of legitimacy will disappear. Food availability is a key one, just look at the giant protests in venezuela right now. Bread and circus, is the saying. Our circus is TV and internet. So the electric lines must remain operating. 1/5 households in the US have someone on foodstamps (SNAP program) now. Food stamps are a riot-prevention device, and they know it.  Everything else can slowly decay as they suck out funding and put it in their own pockets, or towards nefarious wars to gain more control over the earth. We have seen this happen over the last 30 years. If we had different qualifications for what is &quot;protest-worthy&quot; then we might not have lost so many rights, and we might look more like France or the Netherlands in terms of our labor rights. The only reason they have better rights is because they have a culture of caring more about those things, and that culture wasn&#39;t destroyed by the media. </p>

<p>In our daily lives we are told everything is one way by the media and culture at large, and then we see it&#39;s another way in real life, and the two don&#39;t match up. What happens in your mind when two ideas logically conflict but you think both are true, it is called cognitive dissonance. Two ideas don&#39;t match, and they fight to determine which you will believe, which can be very emotional because people get emotionally invested in their ideologies. We internalize our culture, and when we see something in life that doesn&#39;t match up to what we think reality is like - as told by the culture we believe to be true - it creates this cognitive dissonance. It&#39;s an uncomfortable feeling, associated with a flurry of thinking. Ideally, this thinking would be used solve the disparity between the two ideas. But in reality many of these problems are so complicated and subtle, sometimes by design, and our time in that moment may be limited as we have to move on to the next mental task, so we end up coming up with false explanations, rationalizations or confabulations, that sooth our emotions without fully resolving the logical conflict. Just kinda quickie patch over it, then ignore it. The explanations have to be somewhat in line with the truth, or we and others won&#39;t believe them. The CIA&#39;s rule is to say 9 relevant truths for every 1 propaganda lie, then people will mostly believe the propaganda. This is powerful knowledge, and this is why in developed countries the elections are generally 51% wins, whereas in less developed countries with bad propaganda systems the leader wins with 99% of the vote. Making things believable makes propaganda much more effective, because people internalize it and don&#39;t even recognize it as propaganda. The best propaganda is never recognized as such. </p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is a tool used against us, do not overlook this. The media creates confusion within the populace by having authority-biased or ideologically-biased stories that subtly conflict with our understanding of reality. We are being gaslighted, told our reality is not <em>really</em> the way we see it, that our opinions aren&#39;t exactly valid or meaningful because we are not a media station or a billionaire or an &quot;expert&quot; or whatever qualification they deem necessary to have a valid opinion. If no one is allowed to question the structure, it&#39;s preserved longer because people don&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on as quickly. </p>

<p>We are quick to think things are accidents when they don&#39;t go right. Hanlon&#39;s Razor (named such because it&#39;s a special case of Occam&#39;s Razor) says &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity&quot;. However many in power try to have this rule applied to them, when they are actually doing something intentionally malicious and feigning ignorance. This is taking advantage of created moral blind spots and our ability to want to see the best in others. Instead, for the powerful, we should use what I&#39;ve seen called Sato&#39;s Razor, which is the opposite. Sato&#39;s Razor says &quot;it&#39;s probably actually wiser to presume malice over ignorance since the supposed threat of a malign conspiracy is inert if that presumption is wrong.&quot; For everyday people it&#39;s fine to assume ignorance, but why do we hold those in power to the same low standards? People in power should be held to <em>higher</em> standards, or else they don&#39;t deserve their position of power over other people. This is the entire idea behind giving people power, that they might drive us all forward in a good direction. Instead now it is being gamed for personal profit, as it has throughout much of history. However now we have the internet which allows mass communication, which could bring about a waking-up that makes the psychological games they play on us irrelevant and thus dissolves their power. </p>

<p>We see the soft lies in the media over and over, and because we have a long history of relying on the media for our information (having just come out of the age of TV) we are shocked and confused that things can actually be like this, that the news can be so wrong and bad. This shock and confusion lingers for years or decades, and this itself is a source of inactivity and inaction, which keeps people pacified. This confusion is a big tool to controlling people. If someone is confused about if they&#39;re free or not, and they&#39;re scared of the consequences of being wrong, they will give up their power if someone can convince them to. Our freeness isn&#39;t something we&#39;re given by an outside authority, it&#39;s something we assert on the world. We decide our authority in this world, we can give it away or we can keep it. How much of your authority do you give away to national mass culture by letting it tell you what is important and what isn&#39;t? We all give away some, it&#39;s just a matter of degree. </p>

<p>To move beyond the cognitive dissonance that is endemic in our culture, we have to be sure about the world. If you don&#39;t know, then keep searching. If an idea spurs you toward new ways of seeing the world, don&#39;t ignore it. This is the key, because cognitive dissonance cannot be resolved without the truth, and the truth cannot be found if you do not allow foreign ideas to enter your mind. Avoid thought-terminating cliches when new ideas come along. New insights in to the world are beautiful in the long run, even though they can cause pain and cognitive dissonance in the short run as your old beliefs are found to be invalid and you have to let them go and move on. However few things are more valuable than this personal evolution in ideologies and thinking. By seeing how the world <em>truly</em> is, or at least getting closer and closer, we can eradicate cognitive dissonance. When there is no mismatch between what we expect and what the world delivers, then there is never any cognitive dissonance. We have to be confident in what we know, and trust that it&#39;s true and that we can back that up. Stick to your story, your view of the world is just as valid as anyone else&#39;s. Doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re always right, but no one can be always right. As long as you allow yourself to grow with new discoveries and keep an open mind, you should feel confident in what you know to be true. If you allow the culture as driven by the media to steal your belief in the validity of your own opinions, then you have outsourced your thinking and given up what truly makes you, you. Don&#39;t be a robot, letting others have a go at the controller. Guard your mind and your beliefs, and refine and grow them, and perhaps one day we will hit critical mass and upgrade our global culture to a new level as we wake up to the games being played on us by the powerful. </p>

<p>It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. </p>

<p>So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi</p>
