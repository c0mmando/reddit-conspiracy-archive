       <strong>
        UPDATE
       </strong>
       I was able to get a pic loaded on imgur of my hand.  My ring finger was bitten on the tip- you can see how far more affected it is than other fingers:
       <a href="https://imgur.com/IZUiUoH">

      </p>
      <p>
       Was at the zoo a few weeks ago.  Leaning on a railing playing Pokemon Go.  A random bug flew right onto my non moving hand- latched on with two strong graspers and proceeded to lance me.  I tried to shake it off violently and it wouldn't let go.  It finally let go and went somewhere in the weeds- we couldn't find it to see what it was.  On my finger was a .25 cm slice; no stinger or anything like that and I was bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward 24 hours....my back and legs start aching to the point I couldn't stand up.  Next came horrible chills.  My fever reached 102 degrees.  I thought I was dying.  My husband took me to urgent care where the doctor tested for the flu- it wasn't the flu.  His final verdict was that I caught a nasty virus and had to ride it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That night passes with extreme pain and fever.  Bed sheets completely soaked.  By morning, small blisters started to appear on my hands around where the bug had bitten me and a horrible swollen throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Convinced I had a bacterial infection, I headed to my doctor who then identified it as Hand, Foot and Mouth disease.  Because of this, I had huge ulcers on my throat.  The majority of the ulcers were on the finger that was bitten by the bug but the doctor did not think the bug bite was connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a week of suffering, sores heal and throat becomes tolerable enough to eat food.  I'm now almost 100% but I can't help but think that strange bug had something to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it bit me, it felt almost mechanical and it came out of nowhere, like it targeted me.  I troll a lot of political and conspiracy posts on the inter webs and can't help but feel that maybe this wasn't a bug at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone know of any theories about bug viral attacks?  Was I a test subject?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr: I become horribly sick after a very strange bug bite and looking to see if there are any theories on this
       </strong>

       Bugs are assholes. There's plenty out there that can deliver painful bites and can give you an allergic reaction. Backswimmers, assassin bugs, wheel bugs.. they are all assholes.

       I almost lost a leg due to an allergic reaction to a tic bite.

       I don't think it was a government drone targeting people at the zoo playing pokemon go with biological viruses.

       Anytime you fight off a random death-virus it is weird...but it happens all the time to normal ass people. I would hate to jump to "the government is using hidden-in-plain-sight-bug-drones to attack random people at the zoo" because you will spend your days looking at every bug and wondering. There are real threats out there to your health and safety and they probably aren't bug-drones. I would say you are doing more harm to yourself with that Pokemon Go self-reporting-mass-surveillance-device than you could with a million bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       more importantly, glad you are feeling better.

       Hey just itching a curiosity scratch here.  And there are certain conversations I've had that I shouldn't have and sometimes it makes me wonder.  I don't think it had anything to do with the zoo.  Being at the zoo made me think that maybe an imported animal brought a weird bug with it or something.  But I do want to clarify that when it grabbed me it was like two metal prongs were grasping me.  Something was not right about it.  I love being outside and have been bitten many times.  That was a first of that kind for me.

       I sincerely doubt it. Its not like they pick up these animals and drop them off daily. Animals will spend decades in captivity. They are expensive and rare and hard to transport and easy to die. There are dozen of checkpoints between natural habitat and zoo where the animals are tested for disease and groomed. Once they are there they are used to breed new animals and those "new animals" is what you see at the zoo by and large. The idea that some jungle-bug would have hitched a ride all the way here to bite you is just plain impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, wherever you are in the world there are dozens of types of pincer bugs. It doesn't make it special or weird. You said you were leaning on a handrail...you probably were fucking with it without knowing it, and it defended itself.

       Well your first problem was playing Pokemon and not being a child... But seriously if you can give a bit more details as to either what part of the country you were in and or what this bug looked like im fairly certain I can help identify it. I spent six years as a park naturalist and dealt with a shit ton of weird ass aggressive bugs

       Honestly based on your description and the region you were in the only thing that makes sense is it was either a wheel bug (pic in the link from previous comment) or a black horsefly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of which would make you sick aside from infection due to scratching the open wound. The horsefly would be the most likely candidate because they attach themselves "cut" and drink blood. The wheel or "assassin" bug has an extremely painful sting like ten times more painful than a wasp or bee but they usually don't attack and only leave puncture wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although you could of had an allergic reaction the most likely scenario is that you caught something from your hands because I'm going to assume you put your hands on your face or near your mouth while at a public zoo... Lots of nasty shit on communal structures in a zoo. And you were bitten by some asshole horse fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tiny infecting drone is maybe plausible but very unlikely.

       Hand foot and mouth sucks, had it 3 yrs ago, got it from my kids. Same fever same pain, then the spots on my hands and feet hence the name. You got off easy. I developed the spots under every one of my finger and toenails. They all fell off because of this having no finger nails is not a fun experience
Edit bug sounds like an earwick
