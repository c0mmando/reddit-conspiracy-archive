       I just finished watching a great doc on JFK, the events that led up to his assassination and the political climate that arose afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Pizzagate is the one I have definitely sunk the most time into, although it's getting harder because the more eyes it gets, the more disinfo starts to spread and all the lines become incredibly blurred.

       All in all, it's not far-fetched to believe human trafficing is a wide-spread issue, even if it involves minors and sex slavery the age part doesn't matter so much but the fact it's happening at all is horrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       PizzaGate research has been going on for years and years, way before the word PizzaGate meant anything. It's just now that r/the_donald got a whiff of it they used it as a weapon to oust Clinton &amp; the DNC. Problem is, everybody ignorantly just associate it with Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and that damn pizza parlor but the reality is it's spread across the highest levels of government in countries across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a JFK truther you probably believe the Mafia aka the world bankers were the perpetrators of his assassination. And you probably believe they are also profiting from peddaling guns, drugs and people. So the whole thing starts to come clear that yes PizzaGate is in fact real, it's just the sleuths who are investigating are being thrown off.

       It started with project moonstruck and was very successful. ELF and VLF waves can trigger dental/brain implants by vibrating a piece of metal in your head, which connects you to computer commands as well as wreaks havoc on your physical and mental health. The father of the modern dental implant also coined the term "osseointegration" and definitely had ulterior motives as his research extended far beyond what is necessary for dentistry. There are dentists who are in on it putting implants in peoples head's against their will, and lying to patients who come in complaining about it to throw them off their trail. I started researching it because everyone thought one of my close friend's went completely nuts when he started telling us people were fucking with him and the dentist put an implant in his tooth. Mind you he had never heard of project moonstruck or the whole dental implants theory he just knew his life wasn't the same after his last dentist visit. Lo and behold, about 2 years later, we found a cool oral surgeon who took ex rays and removed 2 tiny metallic implants from a whole in his mouth where his previous dentist had pulled a tooth.

       Could you write what your conclusions were? I came to the conclusion that the attack was maybe orchestrated by a third party, but they only motivated the extremists to do it, and made it easier for them on that day. Everything else happened exactly like the official story says, that the buildings came down because of fire, and the other airplanes hit the Pentagon and the ground.

       I think the fire causing the buildings to fall, at free-fall speed is one of the least plausible things. There's eye witnesses that saw explosions, fire-fighter recordings where they hear &amp; report the explosions and some of the detonations are actually view-able on video coming from some of the lower floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ask yourself this, if 2 planes hit the towers that day, why did 3 buildings fall? All 3 of them at free-fall speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch this if you're interested, it might shine some light on it, it explains very well how a plane impact would not cause the kind of damage that happened on September the 11th:

       Why did they fall on to themselves? If they were so unstable why didn't pieces of the building began to fall, why didn't the buildings tip over in any way?  It's just not plausible 3 out of 3 fell on to themselves.

       My youngest daughter was 9 (my oldest 11 odddly enough) when this happened. She said on the day "Why didn't they hit lower down? Then the buildings would have fallen onto the city"

       Sure. I'd say the three skyscrapers were brought down by controlled demolition, including massive explosions in the basement timed to coincide with the airplane impacts, and later floor by floor detonations.  NORAD intentionally bumbled around and stood down.  The planes were not flown by any human, but rather by remote control.  The Pentagon was hit by something other than a Boeing airplane.   Those things I'm sure of based on much publicly available evidence.  I'd recommend this

       Things I'm not sure about include what type of planes actually hit the WTC towers, how those planes managed to slice through like a hot knife through butter than crumpling on impact.   Where the original flights and passengers ended up.  Who made the "cell phone" calls to family members.  What exactly was supposed to have happened in that burned field in Shanksville.  What role, if any, Osama bin Laden or any of the supposed hijackers played, or even if any of them were ever on any of the original flights.

       ELI5 attempt: The serpent of the bible was not a real serpent, but another entity similar to "god". Eve had a child with the "serpent" (ie. Cain) and with Adam (ie. Abel).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cain was artsy fartsy, Abel was oblivious and always honored his father and god (think nerd and jock). God favored Abel, because he was of his lineage, and damned Kain for his rebelliousness and the fact that he was not of the same blood lineage. Think Step parents. Kain resented this to the point where,  one day, Kain bludgeoned Abel. After that, both bloodlines continued on down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true Ruling Elites, imo, believe (and have evidence) they are descendants of Cain and in such hoard esoteric knowledge and despise the common man (Abel's bloodline), just like their great great great great great great great (you get the point) grandfather did.

       Glad, and you're welcome. My original post/comment is a primer for the topic.. Gives some text and videos of the topic. Cain is the "Widows son".. I did my best to lay it out in order, but there is far more to it, than just that. I'm working on another post, for supplement... I just have A.D.D and am really busy at the moment...

       Greer is a weird character, but he's done a lot of good for the UFO-community. The Disclosure Project is not about Greer, he just arrenged the press conference and brought all the people together. And all the high-ranking people coming forward are real people.

       I was 13 and lived in Dallas when JFK was shot so he got most of my conspiracy attention. I mostly ignored  9/11 til the engineers and architects came around. The intricate details of most conspiracy don't interest me just the big picture. There are some details that irrefutably focus disbelief but generally I don't get involved with the minutiae.
