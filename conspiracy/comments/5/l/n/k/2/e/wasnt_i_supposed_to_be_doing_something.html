      <p>
       Have you ever thought that you could be dreaming- and entirely awake at the exact same time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it a conspiracy if no one is in charge anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of everything you have ever experienced. Was it something you experienced, or was it something someone else experienced?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want you to remember something that you haven't experienced. It is hundreds of years ago. You cannot read. You are holding a book written in a strange code. Open it up, look through the pages. All you see is a series of strange symbols, printed on wood pulp, page after page. This book, to you, is useless. You can stare at the pages for hours and it will have no meaning to you. A person takes the book away from you and begins staring at these pages for hours on end, and begins experiencing a series of emotions: happiness, fear, nostalgia, sexual arousal. To you, the person seems psychotic, being influenced by something that isn't there. You decide that the object is enchanted, embued with a ghost, or an echo of a consciousness. The book seems very powerful to you, giving the person the ability to remember someone else's thoughts and dreams, across space and time. And then you realize that as wonderful as the book is, it can also be very dangerous, because it be used to warp a person's perception of reality. False or altered memories can be implanted in the pages, rewritten by the author to invoke their own authority, or manipulate a reader's behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want you to remember something more recent, the discovery of electromagnetic energy. Using a mirror and a lens, you discover that you can literally capture the light in the air and enchant an object with a memory, a moment in time. You take a picture of yourself, naked, just for fun. You look at the photo and the eyes almost seem to follow you. It is truly haunting how much it really looks like you. You give it to your lover and later discover them pleasuring themselves, remembering you simply by looking at this inanimate piece of paper. Much like the book, you realize the power someone could wield over another using this enchanted paper, even without intending to. You then realize that it is possible to manipulate these objects with a false memory to invoke fear in a person, or to influence them to behave in a way you desire.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is later. Radio waves are flying across the sky. They are just waves, like the symbols in the book you couldn't understand. You cannot even see them. You invent a device to transmit and decode these waves into something that makes sense: a radio. You ask a friend to test it, and suddenly, you hear a person's voice, someone beyond your range of hearing. The person's voice is there, right beside you, but the person isn't there. Once again you see this object as enchanted, as containing an memory of a person's voice. And you watch as those around you change their emotions based on what they hear the voice say. One day, someone decides to play a prank and read "War of the Worlds" over the radio, and some people trust the voice in the radio so much that they take their own lives, even though any danger they felt would disappear if they simply turned off the radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is today. You have in front of you, a device that flashes combinations of red, blue, and green lights, and emits sound waves, connected to everyone using electromagnetic energy. I want you to stop thinking about
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       this object is and start thinking about
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       it is. Everything that you see in this device is either a memory or a memory that has been altered. Paintings, drawings, icons, letters, these are symbolic, altered memories. It is nothing, and somehow everything. It is an electronic form of recorded consciousness, in its simplest form it is a house of mirrors, or an echo chamber. It can hold any memory, or altered memory, you toss into it, and it will echo around forever until someone opens their end of the system and unleashes it. Have you heard of Anwar al-Awlaki? He has been dead for over five years, yet he is still recruiting for al Qaeda. His voice and image were tossed into the house of mirrors, the echo chamber, and as more and more people open up their devices to his voice, their reality becomes warped by his voice and his image. It isn't him, only a memory. Yet it seems so lifelike that people trust it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want you to remember something you haven't experienced yet. A device that can literally project anything you want at your will. Anything you want to experience and you are "there". But there is a dark side. Anyone you want to fuck, you can fuck. Anyone you want to kill, you can kill in the simulation. Any person you want to be, any character, you can be. But it's all a series of altered memories, of projections that warp your reality and control your thinking. The time will come when you will decide that your imagination can create a better reality for yourself than the physical world can. And like every technology before, you will use, and be used. You will think you're playing games, but you will be contributing and processing data. You will think you're in danger, but you aren't. You will feel like you're in love, but you won't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a snake eating itself by the tail, you will fall victim to your own temptations and destroy yourself in the process. It will be so slow that you don't even realize what you're doing. You're already halfway there and you don't even know it.
      </p>

      <p>
       I want you to pull up this website and find yourself on this map. Zoom in to your address. I want you to think long and hard about where exactly you are. And then I want you to click 'satellite', and start zooming out. Do you recognize anything? I woke up when I realized that there were no street names on the map, just asphalt on the ground that people agree has a name. There are no city borders, country borders, state borders. They only exist in the devices we have created. I woke up when I realized that we are building a giant circuit board on the face of the earth without even realizing it. I woke up when I realized I was designing and living in a human-sized insect hive. I woke up when I realized that everything I thought was affecting me, wasn't. I woke up when I realized I was hurting myself- the parts of myself that are in you and every living thing on this planet- in order to be alone. But I wasn't alone. I was haunted by memories and my life was controlled by the false memories and emotions I chose to feed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cover your mirrors, your photographs, turn off your electronic devices... anything that you have created or bought to warp your own sense of time and place. Ask yourself three questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Where am I?"
"Why am I here?"
"Wasn't I supposed to be doing something?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it even a conspiracy if no one else really knows either?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up. Love. You are in everything, and everything is in you.

       "Where am i" is the best question you can ask yourself. It instantly brings you into the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the moment is where your power is. If you can train yourself to always be in the moment, then you achieve Presence. And presence is the merging of your essence and your mind. And that opens up abilities and information that can be accessed more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time though , is sort of a trick we play on ourselves thinking we are creating a future when the future is in the present. The past is also in the present. We are always in the Now. Where am I? Doesn't matter how you answer it. It pulls you back in, every time you become present you open the pineal, if that helps.

       Another slightly different one is to close your eyes for thirty seconds, thrust them open, and find five objects of the same color within the room.

       When you start to unravel time the closest word I think to describing it is simultaneous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our experience is always in the present, so must other times be in our present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time then is this vast framework where all consciousness experiences itself. So right now, millions upon millions upon millions upon trillions of things are happening. The perception of time is just us bouncing ourselves off the infinite and experiencing it's reflection and organizing the experience forward.

       Every moment in time is just a pattern. Everything that moves is light energy. Gluons use electromagnetic energy to harmonize quarks, which vibrate to form transitional waves. Everything you know is an infinite number of gluons pulling quarks to harmonize in song. So much has happened for you to exist. Keep changing the patterns; you are more powerful than you know.

       We are a portal of energy transformation.
Within us spins swirling an energy embedded with sacred genetics are encoded with the blueprint of reality. The very links of consciousness that compose our material reality can be in all places at once. Through consciousness all is possible, any organization that can be imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are personalities. Particular groupings of links of consciousness, highly organzed into a complex vibration and slowed to the rhythm of life.
