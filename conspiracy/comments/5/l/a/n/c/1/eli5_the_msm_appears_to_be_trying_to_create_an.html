    <div class="md"><p>This is it. </p>

<p>To flesh it out, dominance of Eurasia is a long term geopolitical goal of government planners.  </p>

<p>The Zionists are still pushing the <a href="https://cryptome.org/rad.htm">PNAC</a> plan through the neoconservative factions, which dominate foreign policy planning in Bush, Obama and looks like Trump administrations as well.    </p>

<p>Obama got shut down by Putin on trying to start a war in Syria by claiming Syrian government used chemical weapons. He published <a href="http://archive.is/DAqy0">this article</a> in the New York Times.  This is seen as a major insult to the empire planners. Next day the news was dominated by statements of indignation. </p>

<p>Obama got defeated in Syria. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that we hated the Russians for 50 years!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decision paralysis isn&#39;t all that common really.  Give people some credit.  I&#39;m just saying the specificity here is unlikely as the anti-RU propaganda predates the election by too long.  I did mess up my numbers though, I meant 1,3 and 4.</p>

<p>Starting a war with Russia for economic reasons is the most likely on the list.  #4 sounds more like a Russia propaganda talking point than an actual reason for the US to get involved, they never bothered covering up their support of terrorists in the past, and Syria isn&#39;t in any better shape now than it was before Russia started being active in the region.  It&#39;s just a proxy war for multiple governments to flex on each other while butchering civilians.  Sure though, that seems possible. 1 and 3 are impossible motivators without time travel.</p>

<p>The US decided it can put on a good show by attacking Russia and is building support for it.  I doubt there&#39;s much more to it than that, but it could be economic.</p>

<p>The economic motivator would be tackling Russia before they get their lithium mining and processing infrastructure up and running.  While they&#39;re still hobbling along tied to fossil fuels they&#39;re a sitting duck, ten years from now they could be a legitimate super power.  With the US/German/Japanese/Canadian fusion efforts starting to fruit, these four won&#39;t be willing to give Russia a slice of the infinite power cake simply because they live on top of massive untapped salt mines.</p>

<p>all a theory of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see. I drop 1 &amp; 3 because the build up of anti-russia stuff has been going on for longer than the election.  That being the case, the build up of anti-Russian stuff can&#39;t have been started because of the results of the election.  The exceptions to that require foreknowledge of the election results.  </p>

<p>It seems more likely that the push back against runaway globalist efforts are being lumped together under a fake banner in order to better sell the globalist message.  First they make Putin the head of some secret international plot to stop globalism.  Then whenever some other independent group pushes back against globalization, they add the new group to the Putin group even if it makes no sense.</p>

<p>This is why we have a ballooning conspiracy.  Putin was fine, they could link a few other non-EU countries to Putin, fight a pitched battle with a real government, crush the anti-globalist movement, and parcel out Russia to neighbor countries.  Then Brexit happened and they had to slice that topic so anyone who sided with Brexit looked like an ass.  Then Trump happened and they had to paint a good chunk of the US as bitter racists and Putin dupes.  Whatever the next thing is, you can bet it&#39;ll be more of the same.  If Germany goes anti-globalist you can bet the MSM will paint Hitler staches on new government heads and write articles like &quot;We thought Trump was bad, but X is literally the genetic duplicate of Hitler!  Those people should know better&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most mainstream media I&#39;ve seen have simply stated that these bombings hold little regard for civilian life, and Russia doesn&#39;t give a shit about how many children they kill with their air strikes.</p>

<p>And all I&#39;m saying is that when you kill more civilians, including <em>hundreds of children</em>, than you kill terrorists, then maybe the argument that you don&#39;t care enough about collateral damage holds a teeny tiny little bit of water.</p>

<p>You can blame terrorists for using civilians as shields, but that does not change the objective unambiguous fact that ultimately these hundreds of children were killed by Russian weapons. Arguing that they are blameless in this staggering loss of civilian life is a very hard sell to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Syrian. That &quot;independent journalist&quot; ( a title literally anyone can give themselves, how can you call that &quot;actual journalism&quot;?) is a liar, and she&#39;s pushing a whole lot of bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived in Syria, so hopefully you take what I say as the truth. People never loved Assad. He is a tyrant, from a family line of tyrants who have tortured and massacred the Syrian populace for decades (see: Hama Massacre).</p>

<p>People are terrified to speak ill of him anywhere because they believe he has their phones/apartments bugged. He has secret police that kidnap people with no trial and they&#39;re never seen again.</p>

<p>He is fucking scum. People protested for better government and he gunned them down. Sorry this doesn&#39;t go along with this subreddit&#39;s pro-Russia mentality, but Assad is a piece of shit and I hope he meets his end soon.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, your justification of the Russian-Assad hospital bombings sounds a lot like the same alibi used by the Israeli army when it destroys Palestinian homes and hospitals. Coincidence? You&#39;re falling prey to bullshit Russian propaganda, grow up. </p>

<p>I remember that when I was in Syria, there were posters of Bashar plastered all other the streets and the walls. Everyone was too scared to talk about him at all, and your internet was monitored heavily.</p>

The Syria topic in particular brings out the &quot;know it all&quot; who condescend and tell you that your educated views and instincts must be wrong, because they know the real truth. When it comes to this topic in particular I can guess the user names which will appear telling everyone else they are wrong, that Assad is a brutal dictator, and that we need to spread western democracy to Syria.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you just take the first youtube-link that supports your claim to send me?</p>

<p>Straight from the description, &quot;Footage of United Nations Press Conference sponsored by Syrian Mission to the UN.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Syrian Mission is literally owned by the Syrian government. The head of the Syrian Mission, Bashar Ja&#39;afari, is a member of Syria&#39;s Ba&#39;ath party. I wouldn&#39;t trust that video anymore than I trust Assad himself.</p>

<p>If people loved Assad so much, they wouldn&#39;t have rebelled. No leader gets 88% of a vote by gunning down peaceful-protesters in the street. </p>

<p>Do you understand how high 88% of a vote is? That is such an insanely high percentage. Take a look at Canada&#39;s vote percents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_2015">here</a> if it helps to show you what the %s will look like for a legitimate election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the delegates:  </p>

<p>Judy Bello, an antiwar activist.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Larudee, an academic from the bay area with anti-zionist politics.</p>

<p>Joseph Iosbaker, from Chicago. He is also an antiwar activist.</p>

<p>Jane Stealwater sp? a retired war correspondent who was in Iraq with the Marine Corp, and in Baghdad with the Army.</p>

<p>Scott Williams, another antiwar activist, and a occupy protestor. </p>

<p>So to recap: we have Eva Bartlett, doing multiple trips in Syria reporting that people support Assad using election participation and votes as a support of her positon. Also her observation as a journalist.  We have a five person North-American delegation supporting the election as being fair, moreover,supporting Eva Bartlett&#39;s impressions. </p>

<p>Than we have SwordofGondor who is a Canadian but visited Syria a couple of times, and whose arguments are an argument from incredulity, and the genetic fallacy.  I suggest everyone watch the video for themselves, and not just read the first YouTube comment. </p>

<p>This is not a US government delegation.</p>

<p>I trust what they say because I listened to them and utilized my faculty of judgment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like what they have to say... I don&#39;t like hearing that the US supports terrorist factions, I don&#39;t like hearing that civilians are dying, and I don&#39;t like that the whole region is being destabilized. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No I can&#39;t. That&#39;s why I said I don&#39;t support the vast majority of rebel factions. If you honestly think that Christmas celebration wasn&#39;t filled with actors and bribed citizens then you&#39;re a fool. You people are so blindly supportive of Assad and yet denounce everyone else as crisis actors. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did I say that? Stop putting words in my mouth.</p>

<p>RT is propaganda, put the /s sign wherever you want, that doesn&#39;t stop it from being directly funded by the Kremlin. They can spin the content whichever way they want and you folk will just eat it all up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need to. I already said I don&#39;t support Islamist rebel factions, I see no reason for me to defend them.</p>

<p>You realize Assad started the war right? You know his father was a tyrant who staged a military coup, and who massacred his own people? These are facts, not opinions. The Syrian populace had enough of a tyrannical regime, they shouldn&#39;t have to live under him any longer. Fuck Assad, I hope the bastard rots in hell , preferably after he gets dragged on top of a car and disemboweled like Gaddafi was. I&#39;ll never speak well of tyrants, and fuck anyone who supports him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not every single Syrian hates Assad. Alawites love him, and religious minorities probably support him as a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; candidate in comparison to Islamist rebels and ISIL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They say everyone there loves Assad and they&#39;re really grateful to the Russians for helping their country. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but this is just false. Most Syrians hold no love for the Assad family, and the average Syrian (likely a Sunni) views the Russian airstrikes as butchery. I mean just think logically, if everyone loved him then why on earth were the anti-government demonstrations before the war so prevalent? And why did he react so violently?</p>

<p>I suggest you read up on the history of modern-Syria. Assad is a dictator, and so was his father. The 1982 Hama Massacre is a great example of how the Assad family handles dissent. You sound smart enough to realize that his election is as fake as North Korea&#39;s so hopefully I won&#39;t have to convince you of that.</p>

<p>Your neighbors sound like hypocritical cowards. If they loved him so much and if the narrative is so bullshit, why did they flee? I have Syrian relatives that had to flee Syria and rest assured, they hold no love for Assad. I mean obviously, why would they? The bastard started this entire conflict to begin with.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t have to be. Assad is secular, I&#39;ll grant him that, but he&#39;s still a murderous tyrant. The FSA originally had goals for a secular society free from tyranny, but the FSA is fractured now and most of their power lies with Islamist groups.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What on earth makes you say that? I support secular societies, I just don&#39;t support these societies to be headed by a dictator with 0 regard for the lives and well-being of the citizens under his rule.</p>

Let&#39;s establish a nice set of credential standards then. Do bloggers count? Vloggers? According to <a href="https://nppa.org/page/press-credentials">these guys</a> it doesn&#39;t really matter with regards to what Eva covers.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that you do not need a press &quot;credential&quot; to take pictures or cover events in public places (streets, parks, sidewalks that are not closed off to public access). You do not need government approval to work as a journalist, although it may be beneficial to obtain a “Press ID” or an official government-issued press credential for other reasons. Press credentials related to news coverage are usually issued by law enforcement agencies. Requirements for the issuance of credentials are established by those agencies and vary by department. One agency may not recognize the privileges granted by the credentials from another department. Event specific press credentials are usually provided by the organizers of the event, i.e. major league sports, concerts, festivals, press conferences, corporate meetings.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t a false equivalency, it was an analogy. There&#39;s a difference, as hard as that might be for you to understand.</p>

<p>Eva is not objective in the slightest. I don&#39;t know enough about her to do some sort of major analysis, but all of her reports on the Syrian war are pro-government. It seems like all she does is denounce the rebels and the FSA, completely ignoring the war crimes of the SAA (hint: they exist, in massive numbers), and completely ignoring the tyranny of Assad.</p>

Now we are down to the last few countries on our list, but there is a reason they were the last, they (Syria and Iran) have close Russian ties.
So going after Syria and Iran requires going to war with Russia. One hundred percent war. So if they want to do it they have to have the American people on board and hating Russia. They may have gotten a part of the US on board, the die hard Liberals and Clinton supports who haven&#39;t realized Hillary turned them to war mongers. 
We want Assad to fall and Russia isn&#39;[ going to let that happen. Israel wants Iran to fall badly (and thus our leaders do too), but Russia has their scientists helping with Russia nuclear power stations (which Israel wants to hit) so that would draw Russia in also.</p>

<p>So basically they have to make America hate Russia because they know they have to war with Russia to complete their agenda of taking out Iran and Syria.</p>

<p>Series of current events are matching up with that Russian book. Brexit, Islamic terrorism , etc. According to the book, China is #1 threat to Russia, not US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM is repeating the stuff our government is announcing. They could dig deeper and expose way more anti-Russia and Putin stuff if they wanted to, there&#39;s plenty of shady shit out there. Much of this (the apartment bombings, for one) fall more under conspiracy theory than anything touted as true by our elected officials and various security agencies, so they don&#39;t get much mainstream play. </p>

<p>Is it curious that mass doubt in extant US gov and associated operations has neatly followed Trump&#39;s rhetoric, which itself neatly follows the notions of conservative talk radio, Alex Jones, sites like breitbart and zerohedge, proliferated fears of NWO/Muslim takeover, zionist control, scum-spewing places like thedailystormer, general conspiratorial thinking? You get the people to trust a major unknown like Trump by swaying hearts and minds to distrust everything that has come before. It&#39;s how you red-pill a populace into not only accepting but wanting fascism, seeing it as the only way out of a horrific, world war level series of internal and external threats. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived in Syria, so hopefully you take what I say as the truth. People never loved Assad. He is a tyrant, from a family line of tyrants who have tortured and massacred the Syrian populace for decades (see: Hama Massacre).</p>

<p>People are terrified to speak ill of him anywhere because they believe he has their phones/apartments bugged. He has secret police that kidnap people with no trial and they&#39;re never seen again.</p>

<p>He is fucking scum. People protested for better government and he gunned them down. Sorry this doesn&#39;t go along with this subreddit&#39;s pro-Russia mentality, but Assad is a piece of shit and I hope he meets his end soon.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, your justification of the Russian-Assad hospital bombings sounds a lot like the same alibi used by the Israeli army when it destroys Palestinian homes and hospitals. Coincidence? You&#39;re falling prey to bullshit Russian propaganda, grow up. </p>

I&#39;m sure a minority do, specifically the Alawites, but the average, non-brainwashed Syrian does not. </p>

<p>I never knew Russian-shilling was so prominent here. Russian airstrikes are slaughtering Syrian civilians by the hundreds, they&#39;re bombing hospitals ffs. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t support the majority of the rebels, so nice attempt at a strawman. I had hoped the FSA formed at the beginning of the war, which aimed at establishing a Syrian democracy, would prevail. It&#39;s unfortunate the way it played out.</p>

<p>But the mainstream media propaganda is trying to make people believe that civilians are being targeted by the Syrian army, which is not true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most mainstream media I&#39;ve seen have simply stated that these bombings hold little regard for civilian life, and Russia doesn&#39;t give a shit about how many children they kill with their air strikes.</p>

<p>And all I&#39;m saying is that when you kill more civilians, including <em>hundreds of children</em>, than you kill terrorists, then maybe the argument that you don&#39;t care enough about collateral damage holds a teeny tiny little bit of water.</p>

<p>You can blame terrorists for using civilians as shields, but that does not change the objective unambiguous fact that ultimately these hundreds of children were killed by Russian weapons. Arguing that they are blameless in this staggering loss of civilian life is a very hard sell to make.</p>
