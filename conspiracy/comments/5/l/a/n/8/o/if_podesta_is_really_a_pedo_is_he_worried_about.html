    <div class="md"><p>If pizzagate hits a fever pitch with normies, they pedo ring replaces the squeaky wheel.</p>

<p>Look at it now, they call the investigation full of unsubstantiated claims etc. Let&#39;s say pizzagate gets massive national traction among people. The Pedocracy doesn&#39;t exist on loyalty and blackmail alone.. They are good at.. maneuvering. </p>

<p>The inner circle will collude and find a way to pin the lower level people with all of the crimes and public judgement. It&#39;s simple - they wait, and see where the pizzagate leads are coming from. Which leads have the most attention? Which leads concretely implicate ? The people who get attention from the masses will pay, but that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>The same reason it&#39;s hard to get normies to consider pizzagate will be the same reason that they don&#39;t all face justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hunch that Podesta is an abuse victim himself. I mean look at the guy, he&#39;s a total weakling. How much influence could he actually have? Makes no sense to me. Not saying you have to be a tough guy to have power, buy he doesn&#39;t seem very confident in himself. Or am I just reading him wrong? Bill Clinton probably used to kick the shit out of him to do his bidding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched a lot of his interviews, and I&#39;m of the opinion that he&#39;s shrewd, good at playing people (ingratiating himself), and weasely above all. He is not very charismatic however and I think this is why he prefers to act through surrogates. He hasn&#39;t really gathered much hard power but rather soft power from a vast network of contacts/associates.</p>

<p>He strikes me as the type that in public (facing the mob of the citizenry), he&#39;s mild and easy to steamroll, but something about him makes me think that in private he is the opposite; that he craves being directly feared/respected. It&#39;s the sort of vibe you get after seeing various types of people in the BDSM community; people that are very nice and sugary in their day-to-day but sadistic fucks in private. They have created a compartmentalized outlet (a parallel life/personality) for deviant tendencies.</p>

<p>Anyways a lot of speculation, just my two cents.</p>

<p>&quot;But the staffers also fear his darker side. They fear ... Skippy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Skippy is the name--coined during Podesta&#39;s years as a top Clinton White House staffer--for Podesta&#39;s evil alter ego. Skippy is cutting, acerbic, impatient, and doesn&#39;t suffer fools gladly. Skippy will gladly tell you when you don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairly common among these &quot;enlightened&quot; perverts. I feel sorry for him, in a sense, but he also has chosen his path.</p>
