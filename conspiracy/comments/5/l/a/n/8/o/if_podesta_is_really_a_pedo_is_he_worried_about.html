       I think Podesta will be suicided mos def. then they'll turn around and tell us how evil we were for driving a good man into the ground and a whole new level of FAKE NEWS propaganda will be trotted out w laws making it illegal to even talk about pizzagate on forums.

       To think an inconvenient little move and name change would stop any of them from raping children is ludicrous. They probably will still have access to their funds.

       If he dies anytime soon, this or suicide will be the main story pushed. I see more of what I said above happening because it can help them further push the agenda of how harmful fake news can be, especially when they find no wrongdoing by Podesta after the "investigation"...

       If pizzagate hits a fever pitch with normies, they pedo ring replaces the squeaky wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it now, they call the investigation full of unsubstantiated claims etc. Let's say pizzagate gets massive national traction among people. The Pedocracy doesn't exist on loyalty and blackmail alone.. They are good at.. maneuvering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inner circle will collude and find a way to pin the lower level people with all of the crimes and public judgement. It's simple - they wait, and see where the pizzagate leads are coming from. Which leads have the most attention? Which leads concretely implicate ? The people who get attention from the masses will pay, but that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same reason it's hard to get normies to consider pizzagate will be the same reason that they don't all face justice.

       It will be EXTREMELY difficult to get rid of people like Podesta or Clinton. Trash their reputations when their actions are uncovered? Easy. Bringing to justice? Almost impossible. Between their ability to stay and fight (they've had AT LEAST nearly a decade to build connections and secure their position), and their ability to rapidly and stealthily flee if shit hits the fan (sneak out on a friend's private jet), I personally doubt they're going to get put in jail.

       But I can be satisfied with them losing their power here at the least.

       This is an interesting thought. Maybe I missed something, but it seems to me there is a lot more evidence against Bill &amp; Hillary (Epstein, Dyncorp etc.) above him and Alefantis, Brock and friends below him than there is against John Podesta himself. Most of the most questionable emails were ones he was cc'd on, not a direct participant in. All the nasty art and spirit cooking is his brother Tony. That's not to say the Clinton Crime Family won't take him out.

       I have a hunch that Podesta is an abuse victim himself. I mean look at the guy, he's a total weakling. How much influence could he actually have? Makes no sense to me. Not saying you have to be a tough guy to have power, buy he doesn't seem very confident in himself. Or am I just reading him wrong? Bill Clinton probably used to kick the shit out of him to do his bidding.

       I've watched a lot of his interviews, and I'm of the opinion that he's shrewd, good at playing people (ingratiating himself), and weasely above all. He is not very charismatic however and I think this is why he prefers to act through surrogates. He hasn't really gathered much hard power but rather soft power from a vast network of contacts/associates.
      </p>
      <p>
       He strikes me as the type that in public (facing the mob of the citizenry), he's mild and easy to steamroll, but something about him makes me think that in private he is the opposite; that he craves being directly feared/respected. It's the sort of vibe you get after seeing various types of people in the BDSM community; people that are very nice and sugary in their day-to-day but sadistic fucks in private. They have created a compartmentalized outlet (a parallel life/personality) for deviant tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways a lot of speculation, just my two cents.
