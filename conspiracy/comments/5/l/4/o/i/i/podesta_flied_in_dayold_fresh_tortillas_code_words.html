       Here's the money line:
      </p>
      <p>
       "fresh, handmade tortillas flown in from Mexico the previous day, "
      </p>
      <p>
       No one needs to fly handmade tortillas in at all, let alone a day ahead of time for any party. There are a million places in DC that make authentic handmade Mexican tortillas, which would actually be fresher if purchased the day of the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Googled "Washington, DC handmade mexican tortillas"
      </p>
      <p>
       872, 000 returns
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, with Obama's $65,000 in pizza and hotdogs being flown in from Chicago and all these handmade tortillas being flown in from Mexico there is certainly a lot of "flying around" of food, isn't there?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "you should bring all children that are available" comment is very strange as well. Not "kids are welcome".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been in Texas (from UK), and you can get fresh tortillas at nearly every restaurant and grocery stores (still hot, or made on the other side of the restaurant moments before). Tortillas are a mixture of flour and water or cornmeal and water with very little else besides lard. You don't freaking FLY tortillas anywhere so it is INCREDIBLY absurd. They could more easily hire a tortilla maker to come to their party and make them right there along with that entire roasted whole pig. Besides Podesta is a "foodie." He surely knows this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a cookout, with a suckling pig, in winter? Also because of the water issues in Mexico it would not be ideal to fly perishable food like that.

       even if these aren't code words, the amount of taxpayer money these people throw away is unreal. $65,000 to fly in real pizza and hot dogs should be grounds for impeachment alone, nevermind any of the possible nefarious shit they might actually be talking about.

       That was almost certainly false. That was an intra-office email at Stratfor, who was probably referring to something in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks before that Stratfor email, there was a minor event that some people tried to turn into a scandal:

       As it turns out, no taxpayer funds were used to fly food.

       pizza/cheese pizza definitely aren't some new code. Do any bit of  reading about the deep web and you'll see the references or their abbreviations come up a lot. Now all the other words the PG people have made claims about I have no clue. Don't wanna know honestly the shit grosses me out.

       So "cheese pizza" (not in any of the emails) can refer to child pornography, and that can be shortened to pizza in the same context. But that's not really a code, let alone a secret one is it? Seems to be used as a 4chan joke more often than not, or in situations where there's no reason to use code at all (found some supposed darknet screenshots showing it used when there wasn't a need).

       Yea, but there is no mound of evidence to support the notion that these people are drug users/traffickers. There
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       a mound of evidence to support the notion that the podesta's were speaking in codewords pertaining to pedophilia and human trafficking. When you dig on these people, they begin to fit the profile of someone who would be a potential pedophile or involved in human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say the code words mean nothing (which is what you are saying), tells me that you haven't researched the material thoroughly enough, and that you don't have a basic rudimentary understanding of the investigation. You don't have proper context, and you haven't researched any of the people who are implicated in detail.  If thats the case, why would your opinion hold any merit on the matter?

        Why is it believable that it's code for drugs but not code for kids?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So many reasons.  One of the most obvious tells is "play dominos on pasta, or on cheese?"  The use of the word "on" is a clue that it's about drugs.  The word "pillow" is universal in marijuana trafficking, it means a one gallon ziploc bag with one pound of weed in it.  It looks like Podesta made a custom code, but it's normal to include super-common code words, like "pillow" in an original code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wide variety of foods is more than needed for kids, but about right for drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody loves "pasta."  That means pasta is cocaine.  If the codewords were about kids, some people would prefer a type of kid other than pasta.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "dominos" might be an activity involving a kid.  Otherwise, those words are about drugs.  I would bet you hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say that Podesta isn't a pedophile, just that those codewords are pretty clearly about drugs.  If you have any experience in the drug trade, it's obvious.

       Nah not pretty clearly at all.  So the elite people in our government like podesta came up with code words for coke and weed.  And picked pizza??  Coke and weed really arent that hard to get.  You dont have 
to fly in coke or weed.  People dont do this for coke and weed.  Nope not buying because it doesnt make sense

       I support PG, but I always take everything with a grain a salt. I hate flat-out deniers, but I also hate over-reactive defenders that see the devil in every bit of "evidence" we find. I find the e-mails bizarre and indicative of something shady going on, but I can't (obviously) be 100% sure what the pizza-code is really about.

       What is your issue with that? That you can't see that writing "slice" instead of "pizza" was a simple mistake, or do you think it's suspicious that they're talking about pizza at all?

       If you wanted 100% pure coke, you wouldn't be able to get it.  Government elites are no doubt using the purest coke found anywhere in the world.  You'd have to make it in a lab, or fly it in.

       Yes, that's what I meant about making it in a lab.  But synthetic coke is more expensive than flying it in from Colombia.

       Even if you do an acid/base extraction on product in the states, you won't have pure output.

       The other alternative the elite could use is have their own coca crops in hydroponic deep underground bases.

       It takes way too many plants are needed to grow them in your basement. The best way to go is to realize coke is an egotistical useless drug and is expensive and painful when overused.

       Oh, dude, I don't disagree with the overall theory.  I disagree with the understanding of the Podesta code.  I wouldn't be surprised if they designed a code that would throw the pizza place under the bus.  Maybe they knew it was a deep rabbit hole and used it as a shield for their drug code.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize exhibit MM corroborates that Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's jet, and I agree with the assumptions you are making about their pastimes.  I disagree about the code, although perhaps "dominos" and surely the handkerchief are not about drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty convinced the handkerchief is about kids, and I note that dominos are also "black and white" usually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something you should ponder is why the popularity of the code nouns seems pretty similar to the popularity of drugs.  People don't really seem to have varied tastes, they just all really like pasta.

       I just don't know if it works to put everyone in the same group (us commoners in the same group with the elite). I think there are variables we may not be considering (e.g. clear evidence of past child-sex rings in the upper realms of society throughout history) that don't apply to both groups.

       I think sociopaths/psychopaths are more likely to abuse kids. I think sociopaths and psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. Wherever there's a hierarchical structure, there's likely a higher percentage of psychopaths near the top.

       I think that would have to depend upon the hierarchical structure in question. I would contend that for the vast majority you could not advance to the top if as described.

       Most positions of power involve management of and/or dealing with people, they're not gained solely through individual talent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly if you look into it then most pedophiles seem to be losers with low status. I actually looked up some studies just now which seem to support that, but it depends on the type of pedophile from the looks of things.

       I'm not talking about pedophiles, I'm talking about psychopaths who desire dominance. What's more dominant than power over the most helpless humans in the planet? I don't think all child molesters are pedophiles, especially those that are in high positions of power.

       The American Psychiatric Association estimates the rate of pedophilic tendencies in adult men at less than 5%.  The rate of those who actually act on those desires is even smaller.  That means that for every 1 pedophile assaulting kids or thinking about it, there are 19 normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the rate be so much higher among the elite?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's my biggest beef with pizzagate.  In order to believe it, you have to accept the everyone in these giant social circles is either fucking the kids, or completely OK with it.  Every employee who has ever worked at CPP over the past 10 years.  Every employee of Stratfor Austin office, men and women alike.

      <p>
       That goes against all logic.  Child sex abuse is a disgusting crime, it's not something that the majority of the population can just happily turn a blind eye to when its going on around them.  Especially when it's being advertised
       <em>
        in their goddamn work e-mails

       There are probably more people who molest, rape, and sexually assault children than there that smoke pot. So why do you think it's about drugs when children are just as easy or easier to procure?

       Your point is on rhetorically valid if there isn't an epidemic of sexual child abuse happening around every day that you choose to ignore and remain ignorant of. You want to pretend that it is not prevalent when it is very much so. It is very likely that the code words are about child rape as it is drugs. Probably more likely since drugs have a completely different lingo not related to food.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever dude, keep your head in the sand and avoid the reality that those in power and with power love raping children (Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, etc etc etc).

       Make a better argument. Your words mean things and imply things. I get you think you are just comparing numbers, but that comparison has meaning and implication. That's how language works. That's how rhetoric works. Make a better argument next time.

       That is a flawed argument when you are talking about a person who is so close connected with pedophiles and creeps.  It should be illegal to have statues representing Jeffrey Dahmer's victims, and the proceeds should go to the victims' families.

       What evidence is there that the Arch of Agony was modeled after a posed Dahmer victim? The two are only in vaguely similar poses, just more pizzagate creepypasta that gets regurgitated without being examined critically.

       Apparently, you don't understand that the Dahmer trial completed in Feb 1992.  The "Arch of Hysteria" was completed by Louise Burgerois about one year later.  The Dahmer photos were first published in a police forensics textbook in 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you telling me that this little old 81-year-old lady artist flew from NYC to Milwaukee over the course of that one-year window, in order to get a private showing of these evidence photos from somebody in law enforcement, and then used it as her inspiration for her art piece?

       What you mentioned is the real story. 
I believe 100% that pedophilia is rampant in the highest levels of government and society. This is somewhat of a weak point for TPTB. 
when something like pizzagate pops up, that has no accuser or witness, based mainly on emails and instagram pics, arnt you q lil skeptical? 
Just because people deny or support it doesnt make it true or false..

       I believe there are pedophilia and child traffiking rings, and without a doubt a % of leadership would be involved or covering up for (aka church hierarchies).

       I'm even more certain that pizzagate is complete bullshit rising from a political smear media that has no proof, evidence or logic behind it.

       Maybe because people in power do it more than you want to believe. They'd much rather fund the drug war and stop "drug abuse" instead of child abuse in all its forms, especially sexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the repeated Congressional page scandals, people like  Hastert, Weiner and Foley etc etc etc, maybe people in power like raping kids because it makes them feel more powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it doesn't support Pizzagate, but it makes it clear, that childhood sexual abuse is extremely prevalent and systemic in our society. And almost all the time, it goes unpunished.

       Some of you clearly need to go back and re-read the Podesta emails, and familiarize yourself with the basic rudimentary concepts of the investigation. No rational person could simply brush off the mound of circumstantial evidence we have ammassed.

      <p>
       But I also think when you go so hard on a single conspiracy, as I think most of us did on P.G8, after a bit of time spent deep in the rabbit hole, there is a tendency to snap back on certain issues, you know, after pondering things for a while, mulling the evidence and theories over, and after hearing so loudly from the
       <em>
        official
       </em>
       avenues what the "truth" is. Perhaps.

       There does seem to be an invisible influence sometimes, when the building steam and amassing momentum is kind of trumped by the media magik. It's way too powerful; it's too large of a platform to have little to no influence. I'm sick of them concocting the reality. And I'm sick of people I know personally holding too tightly to this concocted reality.

       Another possible explanation is that they could like barbecue. Who can say which is more likely: an invite to a pig roast, or a satanic attempt to drain blood to keep (((SOROS))) alive forever?

       I think it's just that they know someone coming in from Mexico and that's an easy convenient thing to bring to make it special.

       the real item of cusiousitu here is "SHOULD bring all children that are available".  ??? WTF does that mean?  Is that just an unfortunately awkward way to say bring kids if you like?

       what if its an event where they hired a professional photographer and want a sea of kids in the shot.  If i was hosting a large kid friendly event Id want there to be as many kids as possible.  Not because I'm a pedo but because Im running an event that kids enjoy and I want to make as many kids as happy as possible.

       Hmm like when clinton passed out and they had a kid rdy to run up to her for a photo op to show she was ok. They could have children in the wood works for photo ops. Or their rapping children in the basement of a pizzeria.

       Ya, honestly this just sounds like a party, with the reasonable coincidence of someone coming from mexico or tortillas being sent to a neighboring restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a LOT of food code, but either OP is stretching or intentionally trying to water down the more obvious food code with something appears (at least at first glance to me) totally normal as it's a PARTY INVITE and not a PM or anything similar.

       I think the real question is what does he mean by:
      </p>
      <p>
       "P.S. Parking is difficult in our neighborhood, Dupont Metro ten minutes by foot. 16th and U Streets bus stop five minutes."
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. = Pedophile Specific
       <br/>
       Parking = Park (Parks are frequented by sexual predators)
       <br/>
       Dupont =  DuPont (a highly influential family with many political connections, Pete Du Pont is a REPUBLICAN, this is definitely going across party lines!)
       <br/>
       Metro = Metrosexual = Sexual
       <br/>
       foot = a popular fetish item. Frequently deviants crush small animals like puppies with thier feet.

       The neighborhood they are hosting the party has horrible PARKing.  Have you ever been to that location in DC?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dupont Metro is a Train Station.  Party goers can park there take train to location.

       After PARKing and taking the train party goers can WALK on FOOT to the party.

       Mexico is a BIG country with a LOT of different local cuisines.
       <br/>
       Mexican food in America is mostly shaped by what is popular with Americans and the predominant "Mexican's" that immigrated to that area. Frequently what is called "Mexican food" isn't even made by Mexicans, but rather people from El Salvador or Guatamala.
       <br/>
       What passes for a tortilla in Oaxaca is not the same as in Sonora, or Mexico City, much less El Salvador or Guatamala. If you go to the border states, like Texas/New Mexico/Arizona, what you get is mostly the cuisine directly across the border. If you want Oaxacan dishes in Texas, you're mostly out of luck.
       <br/>
       We fly in tortillas because they simply don't make the type we get locally.
      </p>
      <p>
       "but, it's just flour and water and lard." you say?
       <br/>
       So is bread, but there's hundreds of different types of bread. The techniques/recipes/methods of cooking are what make it special.

       It's a pain in the ass. Only some shops will do it. Some of the best ones won't, so you need to have a local go to the shop. Usually, the easiest thing is to bring a suitcase when we go there, and drag a couple dozen back.

       "mate"? Well, that explains it. Let me put it in terms you may understand.
       <br/>
       When you're in your lorry talking the lift home from the pub, an you want a donner kebab, but you want a Turkish one in a pita, not a Lebanese one on lavash, but all the shops in your town are owned be Lebanese people, what do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you yelp "sobaquera" in DC, guess what? 0 results. "Sonoran Tortilla" 2 results one is a shitty chain restaurant, neither have sobaqueras. So, they don't even know what they are in DC.

       Well... as a resident of the Southwest, I can tell you that any store that doesn't also have a butcher counter is not going to have good tortillas.  That's why I'm a frequent customer at my local carneceria.  They are very polite and patient with us gringos, as long as you don't wear your Trump gear.

       for  Washington DC returns just eight hits, and about 3/4 of them look like utter shit.

      <p>
       So yes, I think it's plausible to say that it could be difficult to find a decent Mexican grocery in metro Washington DC.

       we are not looking for a Mexican grocery.  we are talking about finding a place in DC that sells fresh made, mexican style tortillas.  trust me, tortilla shops are all over DC.

       Again, I live in the heart of the Southwest, and you go to the grocery to purchase fresh tortillas.  There is no such thing as a "tortilla shop" here.

       I live in Latin America and can palm form tortillas after grinding dried corn with my own metate which has been passed down from generations.

       Flying in pizza dough (actual dough, not pedo code) from NYC is a big thing, so I can buy the story that they're flying in tortillas from Mexico. Maybe the Mexican tortillas there really do taste different enough to warrant importing them.
      </p>

       However, this line is incredible suspicious:

       The wording makes it sound like they all just keep children stored away and then drag them out when they want too. Considering other emails have alluded to 'baby sitting', whether or not the the children are
       <em>
        available
       </em>
       gives me the heebies.

       Here is a perfect example of confirmation bias to the inth degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I'm reading..... They are throwing a large party.  A mexican themed party.  In order to make it as authentic as possible they are flying in tortillas (likely from a favorite place). This event is family friendly so feel free to bring kids.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in California and near me I have 100s of places that serve cheese cake.  Yet I still order and get a cheese cake mailed to me from New York each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also happen to work for a company that throws a large Xmas Party each year.  The party is open to all employees.  In the email it says we can invite as many friends of our kids as we want because they are having Santa, Snow Hill, Snow man contest etc.

       Likely from a favorite place? Then why not mention the fucking favorite place? For example, we are flying in Lupita's famous tortillas directly from Jalisco, mexico! Or Tortilla's direct from Jesus in Juarez.

      <p>
       It's the same shit with pizza and pasta. Why would millionaire, "culinary experts" refer so plainly to food? Never a mention of fettuccini, spaghetti, deep dish or thin crust.  However, they do mention walnut sauce.

       I think he meant spent a crap load of money pointlessly flying in special day old "fresh" tortillias and not raping kids. Kinda like Trumps idea to live in NYC and fly to DC almost daily. Pointless, impractical but within his means.

       Really? You can buy 99% of any type of Mexican food because Mexicans are everywhere and they know how to cook. When you use your brain its easy to figure it out.

       was

        visiting her family in Mexico over Christmas?
       </strong>
       (Yes, that's the Helga who is in a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Bcj6mdA.png">
        couple with Michael
       </a>
       .) Or maybe somebody that she knows is flying to visit her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Naw, that never happens. Family never visit each other around Christmas and bring food from home. More likely is that they chartered a private jet to smuggle Mexican children in for a mass rape party. Fortunately, they live in an
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/1837_-_1841_California_Street%2C_N.W..JPG/800px-1837_-_1841_California_Street%2C_N.W..JPG">
        isolated neighborhood
       </a>
       and, anyway, nobody's home at 3 PM on the Sunday after Christmas, so none of the neighbors will notice. And they have a

       </a>
       that's perfect for burying the bodies, certainly not suitable for a barbecue! It's a good thing, since it's hard to keep the kidnapped rape victims quiet on the Metro ride home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, now that you've shown me the light, I can see that the mass child rape party is not only so much more likely than a barbecue, it's the

       You guys are getting desperate if now you're trying to fabricate "Tacogate."
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea if they were being tongue in cheek about the tortillas.  You are now trying to make anything and everything in those e-mails about pedophilia without regard to who it implicates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I read this is it was a party with a taco bar and people were encouraged to bring their families.  I don't think the company I work for is a pedophile front because in our recent bowling party announcement they said "make sure to bring your kids!" FFS

       Do you really think this woman is inviting people over to her house to rape Mexican children who were flown in fresh from Mexico the day before? Only to forget that she is speaking in code and later remind the guests to bring "children"?

       I could see some kind of illegal food, like bush meat being brought into the UK. It's not like you can go kill a free range Northamptoneshire Chimp or have a renowned African chef make a chimp dish. But Tortillias in 2016 and in the US, come the fuck on. It's code or possibly distraction fodder. Couldn't even call whatever a persons name. "Carlos from Mexico will be there!"

       I don't have to debunk. It's up to those promoting these claims to prove those images represent something other than what they are at face value.

       None of this constitutes proof. Real proof, the kind courts care about, requires absolute certainty of guilt. And there's nothing like that kind of certainty in any of the text or images presented. I've looked. Nor is there proof of hidden tunnels. And charging affiliations of various degrees of separation - guilt by association - isn't proof of anything either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go find that proof. Until then, expect legitimate skepticism.

       Trump's wall, I'm convinced, has something to do with the drug war. The drug war could also be part of the child-trafficking network. The smugglers use people as mules, after all. People, drugs, weapons --- it's all the same to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tortillas are a food item, like pizza and dogs, and I read somewhere that "pillows" referred to drugs, so I'm inclined to think this code is for Hispanic children and not drugs.

       correct me if I am wrong, 'cookout' implies making and cooking on the day, ie a BBQ with grill or stove.

       the whole point of outdoor cooking is the fun involved doing on the day, marinading obviously can be done before.

       I'd agree with your definition. Merriam's site says "cooked and served in the open". Now I'd take that as outdoors but some could say that cooked in an open kitchen with the guest by the grill could fit the definition. Could be away to label the party's theme.

       Ah that sucks. I thought you meant in the pizza gate discussion. I don't look at shit like that. Pizza gate is not about being obsessed with anything, it's about following leads, of which there are some legitimate threads. If you disagree, that's fine, but people have a right to legitimate inquiry and research without being lumped in with something unrelated.

       Depends on the number of guests. A suckling pig is commonly sold at around 20 pounds (can be smaller or larger). Including sides, that can easily serve 20+ people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I smoked a 14 pound brisket this summer, and had 15 people over. I'll be damned if everyone wouldn't agree it was a cookout.

       What if one of them had just come back from Mexico and brought back a pack of tortillas?  (Given what they do for livings) What if it was just a joke to describe cheap, store bought tortillas?

       It's billed as a "Taco and Tequila cookout", with drinking starting at 3pm.  "Family friendly".  If tequila's not your thing, there's a "decent selection" of other alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I've ever heard of such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  I see the red dagger next to the point count, so I'm not alone in thinking it's weird.  Personally when I go out for tequila with friends, it's usually some top-shelf Patron, and a place to sleep it off.  Seems odd I would get contentious down-votes (and even called a mormon!) simply because I've never heard of such a thing.

       Pedophiles are everywhere, not just in government.  Hastert got locked up for paying hush money to kids that he fucked while he was a perverted gym coach, long before he was ever a congressman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you donate to the Center of American Progress, none of your money was used to fly in tortillas (assuming that you actually
       <em>
        pay
       </em>
       taxes).  No taxpayer funds would ever be used for this kind of event.

       Ok, demanding all the children seems a strange way to put it,, these people don't mince words, and the impractical nature of flying tortillas in doesn't seem strange to you either?  My point on Hastert is that if the 3rd most powerful man in Washington is an admitted serial peodophile, that breaks the myth that it's uncommon. There must have been many people surrounding that man both, personally and politically that were aware of his acts and willingly enabled or assisted.  It's disgusting to think, but I feel this is more widespread amongst the Political/Hollywood/Corporate elite than we've been led to believe (Jeffrey epstein, Jerry Sandusky, James elafantis, Brian Peck etc) Politician wise, just look through the Weiner/Posta emails, it's in there. When you're thoroughly finished, look into Jimmy Saville and Ted Heath, the hole goes deeper and deeper. Pizza gate isn't the only effort to expose this issue in the last 30 years... Conspiracy of silence, Ted Gunderson,  are amongst a horde of examples that never got the attention and investigation they desreved.

       Pedophiles exist, if you search google news you can find daily reports on arrests in relation of child abuse and/or child pornography. It's usually pretty ordinary people. That is, or ought to be, far more alarming to you than people trying to draw ridiculous connections between the

       You're trying to gloss over the fact that pedophilia has been rampant in the US/UK governments for the last 40-50 years, the examples are numerous, podesta/weiner emails aren't going away. What are you trying to say by "usually ordinary people" .. our laws and criminal justice systems should take care of those sick fucks, as for SE asia, I've been all over and it's just as repulsive. Politicians are trusted and given certain privileges for their role in society, they should in no way be affiliated in this kind if sick behaviour, yet they are... on a bigger scale than you care or are willing to admit.

       Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Block said prosecutors would have charged Hastert with sex crimes, or referred him to their state counterparts, if not for the statutes of limitations. And he said they agreed to a plea deal in the case only because it spared a victim who did not want to be identified from having to take the witness stand at a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weiner sexted an underage girl ( an act of peodophilia) ever here of a show called to catch a predator? I swear your trying to ignore the facts. The emails that were found on his laptop are going to show more evidence, you only need to see what the FBI thinks

       Why won't you just support the point you're trying to make? You can only name three politicians, one of whom just sexted a teen and another who is being witch hunted based on nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conspiracy of Silence" covers a supposed satanic child sex ring that a fired employee made up. Ted Gunderson was not a politician and appears to be a nutter who also claims there's satanic ritual abuse of children and thousands of human sacrifices each year in NYC. All lacking that "e" word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just name all these politicians that have been part of rampant child abuse in the UK/US governments for 40-50 years.

       The hilarious thing is, how many kids to rape and murder do you people think $65k would buy? It's like the people pushing this joke have never seen more than $1000 in one spot and just don't even have the tiniest idea of what wealth and power actually look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza and hot dogs for $65k is how our government does things, standard waste and excess. Pulling off a kiddy murder orgy for than amount of money is wholly unbelievable, laughably so.

       What difference does it make if it's "prime real estate" or not. People have cookouts on the balcony of apartments, in driveways, in gardens, in parks. You use what space you've got.

       I think you are deliberately missing the point. People are pointing out how absurd the claim is and how it must be code words. Flying "fresh" tortilla's into the US from Mexico to eat a day later. Spending $65K on flying hotdogs and pizza in. You don't have to believe that is code words for anything specific, just realize that it doesn't make sense and has to be code words for something.

       He likes tortillas, a food that is native to Mexico, and wants fresh ones directly from the source? Maybe he has a favorite place in Mexico just like I have a favorite place in Chicago.

       You gotta try really hard to believe that. Personally, I would more likely think it was references to drugs, but criticizing the speculation is low hanging fruit.

       You should probably reevaluate where your life is at when it's harder to believe a guy would get tortillas shipped from Mexico than it is to believe that ACTUALLY means he's raping and killing kids.

       You should really evaluate your critical thinking process, if you think flying in tortillas from Mexico, that will be old and nasty, is a reasonable thing to do when dozens of authentic Mexican restaurants exist in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I never thought that meant raping or killing kids, just that it didn't make sense and was clearly code words. I speculated

        possibly drug code words.

       I'm even going to literally past in the Facebook invite text I included for a brisket I smoked this summer - Can you imagine if the last line appeared in one of these emails?

       "I'm smoking a big brisket. Come over and eat some of it. Bring drinks and if you're cool, a dish to share.

       Smoking a 14 pound piece of meat can take a long time but I'm aiming for 5:00-6:00 to serve.

       This is the point I was trying to make. As an outsider, who doesn't know me, a line of text like that looks bizarre to YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean it is bizarre, or implies anything wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the people I invite to my home, know me and my sense of humor. I'm in my late 30's - many of my friends have children - I do not. My friends know I have a dark sense of humor and they would know that I find it funny to refer to people who have chosen to have children as "breeders."
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, I actually got some replies that some of my guests thought the line was funny and they appreciated that I indicated this was a kid-friendly party.

       Again, none of us know these people. For all we know, he knew one or two guests indicated they would be bringing their kids and he wanted them to have other kids to hang out with while the adults were doing boring adult things.

       I don't see connections. I find it hard to believe a prominent rich white guy has 0 emails about regular parties or going out to eat, and they're rather all code for pedo activity with like 200 previously-unknown code words that everyone with a job in DC knows without any information leaking out.

       Haha you know full and we'll that is not what's going on here and actually that would be a terrible world. It's just your comment would lead people on this sub to believe you haven't done your research. There's too much evidence pointing towards a global pedophilia ring to dismiss it as easily as you and others like you have

       No. There's literally no evidence. I've been following this since the beginning. There's only "this is how this would fit in if a pedo ring was happening". This is evidence of a group of people planning to cook food for a party.
      </p>
      <p>
       People's idea of research here is turning any noun into whatever code word fits their narrative, and googling common names and assuming the first result that has some kind of government connection is the one they're looking for.

       No. That just shows you've read this post. At some point when you have this massive amount of "coincidences" you've got to realize there may be more than meets the eye. And it's not just comet ping pong or pizza places in general. This is a global event that has been covered up for a very very long time. Pedophilia rings around the world have been getting busted and there's evidence showing these rings are not disconnected. There's a lot of evidence, much more than just this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least think about it this way. Many accusations of pedophilia in the upper levels of the world governments have been popping up all over the place. If this is happening there are thousands of children taken from their families, suffering, abused, raped,  and sometimes murdered. Obviously a very serious accusation warrants a very serious investigation to at least make 100% positive that this is not happening. More than just dismissing it as "fake news" and saying no need for an investigation...
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be different if only a handful of people out there believed in pizzagate, but it's coming from so many people. Just something to think about.

       There are hundreds of millions of Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. They're not all right because of the amount that believes in something.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't coincidences going on. They're clear misinterpretations of statements and jokes, or made-up code words, made to fit a narrative of a pedo ring. There is no evidence of any actual activity. No witnesses, no complaints, no alleged victims, not even any evidence of child porn, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the pizzagate pushers need to realize is you can literally do this with anything. Come up with any narrative involving prominent figures/groups/etc, and it isn't hard to make loose connections, find "codes", and things that could be evidence if you interpret it a certain way. You can make mountains of "evidence" that way, but if every piece of that is so loose it doesn't matter how much there is. With nothing physical or actual, and every existing piece of evidence having very reasonable alternatives (yes I've looked at every email and instagram post relating to this), combined with the insane number of people supposedly involved without a hint leaking out, it's probably not true.

       But how can you believe that the government holds the type of power that they do, yet not think that it's well within their power to try to cover this whole thing up? It's worldwide and there have been a couple alleged victims to come forward, there's also more evidence in the podesta emails and not just codes and coincidences. Explain all the missing child cases where they are literally never found? Explain the orphanages that have been tied up in scandal that are closely related to many high ranking officials or alefantis' ties to silsby or the pedophilia busts all over the world that are either not being reported on in America or are just swept under the rug? Why would the MSM report on the huge bust in Norway and then delete everything they posted or reported about it a day later nowhere to be found? It's more than just coincidence man

       There are no alleged victims. The only possible one was based on misunderstanding of already-unreliable police sketches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone around here severely overestimates the government's ability to cover things up. People talk, even about minor things, even under threat of severe consequences, and especially when it would need to involve so many people (like this). The fact that this would involve such extremely morally wrong and illegal actions with the number of people supposedly connected to it, and not 1 person decides to say anything, makes it pretty unlikely regardless of everything else. Not to mention it's such an insanely unnecessary thing. It's not like an alien coverup to protect the public or give the government more power. This is alleging dozens, possibly hundreds of people, are like "yeah I'll help you rape a ton of children and defend that info to the death". Politicians can't bang a staffer without info leaking out half the time. The implications if it were real just seem so highly implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       About those missing child cases where they're never found, it's unfortunate but it doesn't implicate an organized governmental ring. Regular people do bad things too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis's connection to Silsby comes with being friends with someone whose son is on the board of directors of an orphanage Silsby is involved with. That's already a loose connection to start. There's also not that much reason to believe that case actually involved child trafficking, it seemed more like a misunderstanding. We don't have much confirmed evidence to make that link, and foreigners are often under a lot of suspicion in foreign countries for things they're not doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Norway case, I could still find links about it in from our media. The NYT response was that wire stories like this are removed after a couple weeks as practice. But I guess that was ignored, rather than confirmed or disconfirmed? News media in America barely cares about European terrorist attacks after a week. It doesn't look like much of a coverup when the majority of people who would've seen the story, saw the story, and can still find info on it if they want. I've seen plenty of big busts in America covered in our media, and no one's connected this one to anything relating to pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is coincidence. It's dozens of things that are built up to look like evidence, when each individual piece has more reasonable explanations. They're normal things twisted to look pedo-related, or nefarious things twisted to tie Alefantis/Podesta/Clinton/etc to them. Quantity doesn't make any of them true.

       But listen to yourself you want confirmed evidence, but from where? The government? They are the ones protecting themselves and everyone else involved. They are dismissing this case and connected cases because if the truth comes to light they know we would never allow them to get away with it. Hence why they want to cover up all of this. The recent history of "confirmed evidence" from our officials is shaky at best, just look at the anti-russia narrative.This is connected and if you're unwilling to accept all of this than that's fine I understand how it's an overwhelming amount of info and nobody wants to believe our beloved American government could ever be implicated in something so purely evil. And they aren't raping for no reason in their minds, it's satanic in nature. Many of these officials are part of secret societies that have known satanic signs and motives. Furthermore the definition of a conspiracy is a secret plan formed by two or more people to do something harmful or illegal. This is the sub you are on, we are making the connections and investigating the theories. It seems like your beliefs are more closely tied to what the MSM would have you believe anyways, so just keep believing in our wonderful system and the great Obama administration because it's certainly easier that way

       Lol satanic signs and motives. Most of our government is secular pretend-Christians. Most satanists don't even believe in a literal satan or those kinds of rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian hacking scandal is probably true. It's actually insane to me to think how people around here are trusting such a shady foreign government. Putin's the same dude who claimed to have no soldiers in Ukraine for MONTHS despite clear photographic evidence before he finally admitted it. Not to mention the absurdity of the idea that the CIA is full of liberals doing the DNC's bidding. I trust our government with these things more than Donald Trump's self-motivated intuition and Infowars.
      </p>
      <p>
       By confirmed evidence, I mean... anything? Are we supposed to base all our extreme accusations on assumptions and biased inference? None of this is an overwhelming amount of information, it's the same things over and over again, with people trying to turn anything they can into evidence that fits their conclusion. There isn't a single piece of it (and again, I've been following this from the beginning) that's actually made me think something's going on.

       <p>
        Why is it believable that it's code for drugs but not code for kids?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So many reasons.  One of the most obvious tells is "play dominos on pasta, or on cheese?"  The use of the word "on" is a clue that it's about drugs.  The word "pillow" is universal in marijuana trafficking, it means a one gallon ziploc bag with one pound of weed in it.  It looks like Podesta made a custom code, but it's normal to include super-common code words, like "pillow" in an original code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wide variety of foods is more than needed for kids, but about right for drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody loves "pasta."  That means pasta is cocaine.  If the codewords were about kids, some people would prefer a type of kid other than pasta.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "dominos" might be an activity involving a kid.  Otherwise, those words are about drugs.  I would bet you hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say that Podesta isn't a pedophile, just that those codewords are pretty clearly about drugs.  If you have any experience in the drug trade, it's obvious.

       what if its an event where they hired a professional photographer and want a sea of kids in the shot.  If i was hosting a large kid friendly event Id want there to be as many kids as possible.  Not because I'm a pedo but because Im running an event that kids enjoy and I want to make as many kids as happy as possible.

       There are no alleged victims. The only possible one was based on misunderstanding of already-unreliable police sketches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone around here severely overestimates the government's ability to cover things up. People talk, even about minor things, even under threat of severe consequences, and especially when it would need to involve so many people (like this). The fact that this would involve such extremely morally wrong and illegal actions with the number of people supposedly connected to it, and not 1 person decides to say anything, makes it pretty unlikely regardless of everything else. Not to mention it's such an insanely unnecessary thing. It's not like an alien coverup to protect the public or give the government more power. This is alleging dozens, possibly hundreds of people, are like "yeah I'll help you rape a ton of children and defend that info to the death". Politicians can't bang a staffer without info leaking out half the time. The implications if it were real just seem so highly implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       About those missing child cases where they're never found, it's unfortunate but it doesn't implicate an organized governmental ring. Regular people do bad things too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis's connection to Silsby comes with being friends with someone whose son is on the board of directors of an orphanage Silsby is involved with. That's already a loose connection to start. There's also not that much reason to believe that case actually involved child trafficking, it seemed more like a misunderstanding. We don't have much confirmed evidence to make that link, and foreigners are often under a lot of suspicion in foreign countries for things they're not doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Norway case, I could still find links about it in from our media. The NYT response was that wire stories like this are removed after a couple weeks as practice. But I guess that was ignored, rather than confirmed or disconfirmed? News media in America barely cares about European terrorist attacks after a week. It doesn't look like much of a coverup when the majority of people who would've seen the story, saw the story, and can still find info on it if they want. I've seen plenty of big busts in America covered in our media, and no one's connected this one to anything relating to pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is coincidence. It's dozens of things that are built up to look like evidence, when each individual piece has more reasonable explanations. They're normal things twisted to look pedo-related, or nefarious things twisted to tie Alefantis/Podesta/Clinton/etc to them. Quantity doesn't make any of them true.

       But listen to yourself you want confirmed evidence, but from where? The government? They are the ones protecting themselves and everyone else involved. They are dismissing this case and connected cases because if the truth comes to light they know we would never allow them to get away with it. Hence why they want to cover up all of this. The recent history of "confirmed evidence" from our officials is shaky at best, just look at the anti-russia narrative.This is connected and if you're unwilling to accept all of this than that's fine I understand how it's an overwhelming amount of info and nobody wants to believe our beloved American government could ever be implicated in something so purely evil. And they aren't raping for no reason in their minds, it's satanic in nature. Many of these officials are part of secret societies that have known satanic signs and motives. Furthermore the definition of a conspiracy is a secret plan formed by two or more people to do something harmful or illegal. This is the sub you are on, we are making the connections and investigating the theories. It seems like your beliefs are more closely tied to what the MSM would have you believe anyways, so just keep believing in our wonderful system and the great Obama administration because it's certainly easier that way
