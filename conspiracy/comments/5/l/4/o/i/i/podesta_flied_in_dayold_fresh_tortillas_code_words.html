<p>Here&#39;s the money line:</p>

<p>&quot;fresh, handmade tortillas flown in from Mexico the previous day, &quot;</p>

<p>No one needs to fly handmade tortillas in at all, let alone a day ahead of time for any party. There are a million places in DC that make authentic handmade Mexican tortillas, which would actually be fresher if purchased the day of the party.</p>

<p>Googled &quot;Washington, DC handmade mexican tortillas&quot;</p>

<p>872, 000 returns</p>

<p>Gee, with Obama&#39;s $65,000 in pizza and hotdogs being flown in from Chicago and all these handmade tortillas being flown in from Mexico there is certainly a lot of &quot;flying around&quot; of food, isn&#39;t there?</p>

<p>The &quot;you should bring all children that are available&quot; comment is very strange as well. Not &quot;kids are welcome&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in Texas (from UK), and you can get fresh tortillas at nearly every restaurant and grocery stores (still hot, or made on the other side of the restaurant moments before). Tortillas are a mixture of flour and water or cornmeal and water with very little else besides lard. You don&#39;t freaking FLY tortillas anywhere so it is INCREDIBLY absurd. They could more easily hire a tortilla maker to come to their party and make them right there along with that entire roasted whole pig. Besides Podesta is a &quot;foodie.&quot; He surely knows this...</p>

<p>Also a cookout, with a suckling pig, in winter? Also because of the water issues in Mexico it would not be ideal to fly perishable food like that.</p>

<p>That was almost certainly false. That was an intra-office email at Stratfor, who was probably referring to something in the news.</p>

<p>A few weeks before that Stratfor email, there was a minor event that some people tried to turn into a scandal: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gutu2/wikileaks_reveal_obama_flew_in_65000_worth_of/davr3by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gutu2/wikileaks_reveal_obama_flew_in_65000_worth_of/davr3by/</a></p>

<p>As it turns out, no taxpayer funds were used to fly food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So &quot;cheese pizza&quot; (not in any of the emails) can refer to child pornography, and that can be shortened to pizza in the same context. But that&#39;s not really a code, let alone a secret one is it?

<p>Yea, but there is no mound of evidence to support the notion that these people are drug users/traffickers. There <strong>IS</strong> a mound of evidence to support the notion that the podesta&#39;s were speaking in codewords pertaining to pedophilia and human trafficking. When you dig on these people, they begin to fit the profile of someone who would be a potential pedophile or involved in human trafficking.</p>

<p>To say the code words mean nothing (which is what you are saying), tells me that you haven&#39;t researched the material thoroughly enough, and that you don&#39;t have a basic rudimentary understanding of the investigation. You don&#39;t have proper context, and you haven&#39;t researched any of the people who are implicated in detail.  If thats the case, why would your opinion hold any merit on the matter?</p>

<p>Why is it believable that it&#39;s code for drugs but not code for kids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many reasons.  One of the most obvious tells is &quot;play dominos on pasta, or on cheese?&quot;  The use of the word &quot;on&quot; is a clue that it&#39;s about drugs.  The word &quot;pillow&quot; is universal in marijuana trafficking, it means a one gallon ziploc bag with one pound of weed in it.  It looks like Podesta made a custom code, but it&#39;s normal to include super-common code words, like &quot;pillow&quot; in an original code.</p>

<p>The wide variety of foods is more than needed for kids, but about right for drugs.</p>

<p>Everybody loves &quot;pasta.&quot;  That means pasta is cocaine.  If the codewords were about kids, some people would prefer a type of kid other than pasta.</p>

<p>The word &quot;dominos&quot; might be an activity involving a kid.  Otherwise, those words are about drugs.  I would bet you hundreds.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Podesta isn&#39;t a pedophile, just that those codewords are pretty clearly about drugs.  If you have any experience in the drug trade, it&#39;s obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, dude, I don&#39;t disagree with the overall theory.  I disagree with the understanding of the Podesta code.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they designed a code that would throw the pizza place under the bus.  Maybe they knew it was a deep rabbit hole and used it as a shield for their drug code.</p>

<p>I realize exhibit MM corroborates that Bill Clinton flew on Epstein&#39;s jet, and I agree with the assumptions you are making about their pastimes.  I disagree about the code, although perhaps &quot;dominos&quot; and surely the handkerchief are not about drugs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty convinced the handkerchief is about kids, and I note that dominos are also &quot;black and white&quot; usually.  </p>

<p>Something you should ponder is why the popularity of the code nouns seems pretty similar to the popularity of drugs.  People don&#39;t really seem to have varied tastes, they just all really like pasta.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American Psychiatric Association estimates the rate of pedophilic tendencies in adult men at less than 5%.  The rate of those who actually act on those desires is even smaller.  That means that for every 1 pedophile assaulting kids or thinking about it, there are 19 normal people.</p>

<p>Why would the rate be so much higher among the elite?</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s my biggest beef with pizzagate.  In order to believe it, you have to accept the everyone in these giant social circles is either fucking the kids, or completely OK with it.  Every employee who has ever worked at CPP over the past 10 years.  Every employee of Stratfor Austin office, men and women alike.</p>

<p>That goes against all logic.  Child sex abuse is a disgusting crime, it&#39;s not something that the majority of the population can just happily turn a blind eye to when its going on around them.  Especially when it&#39;s being advertised <em>in their goddamn work e-mails</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is on rhetorically valid if there isn&#39;t an epidemic of sexual child abuse happening around every day that you choose to ignore and remain ignorant of. You want to pretend that it is not prevalent when it is very much so. It is very likely that the code words are about child rape as it is drugs. Probably more likely since drugs have a completely different lingo not related to food.</p>

<p>But whatever dude, keep your head in the sand and avoid the reality that those in power and with power love raping children (Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, etc etc etc).</p>

I believe 100% that pedophilia is rampant in the highest levels of government and society. This is somewhat of a weak point for TPTB. 
when something like pizzagate pops up, that has no accuser or witness, based mainly on emails and instagram pics, arnt you q lil skeptical? 
Just because people deny or support it doesnt make it true or false..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because people in power do it more than you want to believe. They&#39;d much rather fund the drug war and stop &quot;drug abuse&quot; instead of child abuse in all its forms, especially sexual. </p>

<p>Given the repeated Congressional page scandals, people like  Hastert, Weiner and Foley etc etc etc, maybe people in power like raping kids because it makes them feel more powerful. </p>

<p>I know it doesn&#39;t support Pizzagate, but it makes it clear, that childhood sexual abuse is extremely prevalent and systemic in our society. And almost all the time, it goes unpunished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>But I also think when you go so hard on a single conspiracy, as I think most of us did on P.G8, after a bit of time spent deep in the rabbit hole, there is a tendency to snap back on certain issues, you know, after pondering things for a while, mulling the evidence and theories over, and after hearing so loudly from the <em>official</em> avenues what the &quot;truth&quot; is. Perhaps. </p>

<p>There does seem to be an invisible influence sometimes, when the building steam and amassing momentum is kind of trumped by the media magik. It&#39;s way too powerful; it&#39;s too large of a platform to have little to no influence. I&#39;m sick of them concocting the reality. And I&#39;m sick of people I know personally holding too tightly to this concocted reality.</p>

<p>&#39;It was debunked. I saw it on the news. Surely they wouldn&#39;t lie to me. I&#39;ll let them do the big thinking for me. I am super naive to the real darkness of the world as well as the immense power of the twisted manipulators.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why do you &quot;fly in&quot; tortillas ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mexico is a BIG country with a LOT of different local cuisines.<br/>
Mexican food in America is mostly shaped by what is popular with Americans and the predominant &quot;Mexican&#39;s&quot; that immigrated to that area. Frequently what is called &quot;Mexican food&quot; isn&#39;t even made by Mexicans, but rather people from El Salvador or Guatamala.<br/>
What passes for a tortilla in Oaxaca is not the same as in Sonora, or Mexico City, much less El Salvador or Guatamala. If you go to the border states, like Texas/New Mexico/Arizona, what you get is mostly the cuisine directly across the border. If you want Oaxacan dishes in Texas, you&#39;re mostly out of luck.<br/>
We fly in tortillas because they simply don&#39;t make the type we get locally.    </p>

<p>&quot;but, it&#39;s just flour and water and lard.&quot; you say?<br/>
So is bread, but there&#39;s hundreds of different types of bread. The techniques/recipes/methods of cooking are what make it special.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why only once per year ?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a pain in the ass. Only some shops will do it. Some of the best ones won&#39;t, so you need to have a local go to the shop. Usually, the easiest thing is to bring a suitcase when we go there, and drag a couple dozen back.</p>

<p>ah!</p>

<p>so for what you are saying to make sense (in the context of this post)... there would need to be few or no Mexican-owned tortilla shops in Washington DC.</p>

<p>that&#39;s a tough sell, mate ;)</p>

<p>sure, if you are living in fucking nebraska... ?</p>

<p>but... it&#39;s washington dc.  come on... get real.</p>

<p>&quot;mate&quot;? Well, that explains it. Let me put it in terms you may understand.<br/>
When you&#39;re in your lorry talking the lift home from the pub, an you want a donner kebab, but you want a Turkish one in a pita, not a Lebanese one on lavash, but all the shops in your town are owned be Lebanese people, what do you do?    </p>

<p>Also, if you yelp &quot;sobaquera&quot; in DC, guess what? 0 results. &quot;Sonoran Tortilla&quot; 2 results one is a shitty chain restaurant, neither have sobaqueras. So, they don&#39;t even know what they are in DC.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... as a resident of the Southwest, I can tell you that any store that doesn&#39;t also have a butcher counter is not going to have good tortillas.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m a frequent customer at my local carneceria.  They are very polite and patient with us gringos, as long as you don&#39;t wear your Trump gear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Carnicer%C3%ADas&amp;amp;find_loc=Washington%2C+DC">Searching &quot;carneceria&quot; on Yelp</a> for  Washington DC returns just eight hits, and about 3/4 of them look like utter shit.</p>

<p>So yes, I think it&#39;s plausible to say that it could be difficult to find a decent Mexican grocery in metro Washington DC.</p>

<p>we are not looking for a Mexican grocery.  we are talking about finding a place in DC that sells fresh made, mexican style tortillas.  trust me, tortilla shops are all over DC.</p>

<p>Really? You can buy 99% of any type of Mexican food because Mexicans are everywhere and they know how to cook. When you use your brain its easy to figure it out. </p>

<p>Podesta flied in day-old &quot;fresh&quot; tortillas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word is &quot;flew&quot;, and Podesta didn&#39;t have anything to do with it. He was <em>invited</em> to the cookout, but said he was going to be in California.</p>

<p>Hmmm... let me see. Why might somebody be flying from Mexico on December 27? Might it be that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helga+flores+trejo+mexico">Helga</a> was <strong>visiting her family in Mexico over Christmas?</strong> (Yes, that&#39;s the Helga who is in a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Bcj6mdA.png">couple with Michael</a>.) Or maybe somebody that she knows is flying to visit her?</p>

<p>Naw, that never happens. Family never visit each other around Christmas and bring food from home. More likely is that they chartered a private jet to smuggle Mexican children in for a mass rape party. Fortunately, they live in an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/1837_-_1841_California_Street%2C_N.W..JPG/800px-1837_-_1841_California_Street%2C_N.W..JPG">isolated neighborhood</a> and, anyway, nobody&#39;s home at 3 PM on the Sunday after Christmas, so none of the neighbors will notice. And they have a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uGWRAmR.png">backyard</a> that&#39;s perfect for burying the bodies, certainly not suitable for a barbecue! It&#39;s a good thing, since it&#39;s hard to keep the kidnapped rape victims quiet on the Metro ride home.</p>

<p>Why, now that you&#39;ve shown me the light, I can see that the mass child rape party is not only so much more likely than a barbecue, it&#39;s the <em>only</em> possibility. I can read through all the code </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear <del>friends</del> PEDOPHILES and <del>colleagues</del> CHILD-SACRIFICING SATANISTS,</p>

<p>We will have the third annual <del>cookout</del> MASS CHILD RAPE at 1837 California Street NW on Sunday, December 28th and we would like you and your <del>partner</del> BONDAGE BUDDY to be part of it.

<p>So are all the images and research people are doing to prove its all connected. You cant debunk that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have to debunk. It&#39;s up to those promoting these claims to prove those images represent something other than what they are at face value. </p>

<p>None of this constitutes proof. Real proof, the kind courts care about, requires absolute certainty of guilt. And there&#39;s nothing like that kind of certainty in any of the text or images presented. I&#39;ve looked. Nor is there proof of hidden tunnels. And charging affiliations of various degrees of separation - guilt by association - isn&#39;t proof of anything either.</p>

<p>Go find that proof. Until then, expect legitimate skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused, why can&#39;t you have a cookout indoors?  Where in the e-mail did it say they were going to be outside, exposed to the winter weather?</p>

<p>waste of FLYING IN tortillas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know, I think they would agree with you.  This is why I think you&#39;re reading too far into it.</p>

<p>What if one of them had just come back from Mexico and brought back a pack of tortillas?  (Given what they do for livings) What if it was just a joke to describe cheap, store bought tortillas?  </p>

<p>Here are their profiles:</p>

<p>These are the people you think are having some kind of pedophile party because they made a joke about tortillas.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even brought up the most ridiculous aspect of this which is reportable...</p>

<p><strong>The title is a lie.</strong>  &quot;Podesta&quot; didn&#39;t fly in shit.  In OP&#39;s own link, Podesta declines the invitation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s billed as a &quot;Taco and Tequila cookout&quot;, with drinking starting at 3pm.  &quot;Family friendly&quot;.  If tequila&#39;s not your thing, there&#39;s a &quot;decent selection&quot; of other alcohol. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard of such a thing.</p>

<p>edit:  I see the red dagger next to the point count, so I&#39;m not alone in thinking it&#39;s weird.  Personally when I go out for tequila with friends, it&#39;s usually some top-shelf Patron, and a place to sleep it off.  Seems odd I would get contentious down-votes (and even called a mormon!) simply because I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing.</p>

<p>Unless you donate to the Center of American Progress, none of your money was used to fly in tortillas (assuming that you actually <em>pay</em> taxes).  No taxpayer funds would ever be used for this kind of event.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, just look at how our new president-elect is committed to &quot;draining the swamp&quot; of corrupt political influence... individuals have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-inaugural-donors.html">no limit on how much they can contribute to his inauguration party fund</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, demanding all the children seems a strange way to put it,, these people don&#39;t mince words, and the impractical nature of flying tortillas in doesn&#39;t seem strange to you either?  My point on Hastert is that if the 3rd most powerful man in Washington is an admitted serial peodophile, that breaks the myth that it&#39;s uncommon. There must have been many people surrounding that man both, personally and politically that were aware of his acts and willingly enabled or assisted.  It&#39;s disgusting to think, but I feel this is more widespread amongst the Political/Hollywood/Corporate elite than we&#39;ve been led to believe (Jeffrey epstein, Jerry Sandusky, James elafantis, Brian Peck etc) Politician wise, just look through the Weiner/Posta emails, it&#39;s in there. When you&#39;re thoroughly finished, look into Jimmy Saville and Ted Heath, the hole goes deeper and deeper. Pizza gate isn&#39;t the only effort to expose this issue in the last 30 years... Conspiracy of silence, Ted Gunderson,  are amongst a horde of examples that never got the attention and investigation they desreved. </p>

<p>Pizza and hot dogs for $65k is how our government does things, standard waste and excess. Pulling off a kiddy murder orgy for than amount of money is wholly unbelievable, laughably so. </p>

<p>This is the point I was trying to make. As an outsider, who doesn&#39;t know me, a line of text like that looks bizarre to YOU.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it is bizarre, or implies anything wrong.</p>

<p>But, the people I invite to my home, know me and my sense of humor. I&#39;m in my late 30&#39;s - many of my friends have children - I do not. My friends know I have a dark sense of humor and they would know that I find it funny to refer to people who have chosen to have children as &quot;breeders.&quot;</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I actually got some replies that some of my guests thought the line was funny and they appreciated that I indicated this was a kid-friendly party. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Should bring all available children&quot; is still more fucked up tho.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, none of us know these people. For all we know, he knew one or two guests indicated they would be bringing their kids and he wanted them to have other kids to hang out with while the adults were doing boring adult things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That just shows you&#39;ve read this post. At some point when you have this massive amount of &quot;coincidences&quot; you&#39;ve got to realize there may be more than meets the eye. And it&#39;s not just comet ping pong or pizza places in general. This is a global event that has been covered up for a very very long time. Pedophilia rings around the world have been getting busted and there&#39;s evidence showing these rings are not disconnected. There&#39;s a lot of evidence, much more than just this post. </p>

<p>At the very least think about it this way. Many accusations of pedophilia in the upper levels of the world governments have been popping up all over the place. If this is happening there are thousands of children taken from their families, suffering, abused, raped,  and sometimes murdered. Obviously a very serious accusation warrants a very serious investigation to at least make 100% positive that this is not happening. More than just dismissing it as &quot;fake news&quot; and saying no need for an investigation...</p>

<p>It would be different if only a handful of people out there believed in pizzagate, but it&#39;s coming from so many people. Just something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds of millions of Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. They&#39;re not all right because of the amount that believes in something. </p>

<p>These aren&#39;t coincidences going on. They&#39;re clear misinterpretations of statements and jokes, or made-up code words, made to fit a narrative of a pedo ring. There is no evidence of any actual activity. No witnesses, no complaints, no alleged victims, not even any evidence of child porn, nothing. </p>

<p>What the pizzagate pushers need to realize is you can literally do this with anything. Come up with any narrative involving prominent figures/groups/etc, and it isn&#39;t hard to make loose connections, find &quot;codes&quot;, and things that could be evidence if you interpret it a certain way. You can make mountains of &quot;evidence&quot; that way, but if every piece of that is so loose it doesn&#39;t matter how much there is. With nothing physical or actual, and every existing piece of evidence having very reasonable alternatives (yes I&#39;ve looked at every email and instagram post relating to this), combined with the insane number of people supposedly involved without a hint leaking out, it&#39;s probably not true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no alleged victims. The only possible one was based on misunderstanding of already-unreliable police sketches. </p>

<p>Everyone around here severely overestimates the government&#39;s ability to cover things up. People talk, even about minor things, even under threat of severe consequences, and especially when it would need to involve so many people (like this). The fact that this would involve such extremely morally wrong and illegal actions with the number of people supposedly connected to it, and not 1 person decides to say anything, makes it pretty unlikely regardless of everything else. Not to mention it&#39;s such an insanely unnecessary thing. It&#39;s not like an alien coverup to protect the public or give the government more power. This is alleging dozens, possibly hundreds of people, are like &quot;yeah I&#39;ll help you rape a ton of children and defend that info to the death&quot;. Politicians can&#39;t bang a staffer without info leaking out half the time. The implications if it were real just seem so highly implausible. </p>

<p>About those missing child cases where they&#39;re never found, it&#39;s unfortunate but it doesn&#39;t implicate an organized governmental ring. Regular people do bad things too. </p>

<p>Alefantis&#39;s connection to Silsby comes with being friends with someone whose son is on the board of directors of an orphanage Silsby is involved with. That&#39;s already a loose connection to start. There&#39;s also not that much reason to believe that case actually involved child trafficking, it seemed more like a misunderstanding. We don&#39;t have much confirmed evidence to make that link, and foreigners are often under a lot of suspicion in foreign countries for things they&#39;re not doing. </p>

<p>With the Norway case, I could still find links about it in from our media. The NYT response was that wire stories like this are removed after a couple weeks as practice. But I guess that was ignored, rather than confirmed or disconfirmed? News media in America barely cares about European terrorist attacks after a week. It doesn&#39;t look like much of a coverup when the majority of people who would&#39;ve seen the story, saw the story, and can still find info on it if they want. I&#39;ve seen plenty of big busts in America covered in our media, and no one&#39;s connected this one to anything relating to pizzagate. </p>

<p>It is coincidence. It&#39;s dozens of things that are built up to look like evidence, when each individual piece has more reasonable explanations. They&#39;re normal things twisted to look pedo-related, or nefarious things twisted to tie Alefantis/Podesta/Clinton/etc to them. Quantity doesn&#39;t make any of them true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But listen to yourself you want confirmed evidence, but from where? The government? They are the ones protecting themselves and everyone else involved. They are dismissing this case and connected cases because if the truth comes to light they know we would never allow them to get away with it. Hence why they want to cover up all of this. The recent history of &quot;confirmed evidence&quot; from our officials is shaky at best, just look at the anti-russia narrative.This is connected and if you&#39;re unwilling to accept all of this than that&#39;s fine I understand how it&#39;s an overwhelming amount of info and nobody wants to believe our beloved American government could ever be implicated in something so purely evil. And they aren&#39;t raping for no reason in their minds, it&#39;s satanic in nature. Many of these officials are part of secret societies that have known satanic signs and motives. Furthermore the definition of a conspiracy is a secret plan formed by two or more people to do something harmful or illegal. This is the sub you are on, we are making the connections and investigating the theories. It seems like your beliefs are more closely tied to what the MSM would have you believe anyways, so just keep believing in our wonderful system and the great Obama administration because it&#39;s certainly easier that way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol satanic signs and motives. Most of our government is secular pretend-Christians. Most satanists don&#39;t even believe in a literal satan or those kinds of rituals. </p>

<p>The Russian hacking scandal is probably true. It&#39;s actually insane to me to think how people around here are trusting such a shady foreign government. Putin&#39;s the same dude who claimed to have no soldiers in Ukraine for MONTHS despite clear photographic evidence before he finally admitted it. Not to mention the absurdity of the idea that the CIA is full of liberals doing the DNC&#39;s bidding. I trust our government with these things more than Donald Trump&#39;s self-motivated intuition and Infowars. </p>

<p>By confirmed evidence, I mean... anything? Are we supposed to base all our extreme accusations on assumptions and biased inference? None of this is an overwhelming amount of information, it&#39;s the same things over and over again, with people trying to turn anything they can into evidence that fits their conclusion. There isn&#39;t a single piece of it (and again, I&#39;ve been following this from the beginning) that&#39;s actually made me think something&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Why is it believable that it&#39;s code for drugs but not code for kids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many reasons.  One of the most obvious tells is &quot;play dominos on pasta, or on cheese?&quot;  The use of the word &quot;on&quot; is a clue that it&#39;s about drugs.  The word &quot;pillow&quot; is universal in marijuana trafficking, it means a one gallon ziploc bag with one pound of weed in it.  It looks like Podesta made a custom code, but it&#39;s normal to include super-common code words, like &quot;pillow&quot; in an original code.</p>

<p>The wide variety of foods is more than needed for kids, but about right for drugs.</p>

<p>Everybody loves &quot;pasta.&quot;  That means pasta is cocaine.  If the codewords were about kids, some people would prefer a type of kid other than pasta.</p>

<p>The word &quot;dominos&quot; might be an activity involving a kid.  Otherwise, those words are about drugs.  I would bet you hundreds.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Podesta isn&#39;t a pedophile, just that those codewords are pretty clearly about drugs.  If you have any experience in the drug trade, it&#39;s obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no alleged victims. The only possible one was based on misunderstanding of already-unreliable police sketches. </p>

<p>Everyone around here severely overestimates the government&#39;s ability to cover things up. People talk, even about minor things, even under threat of severe consequences, and especially when it would need to involve so many people (like this). The fact that this would involve such extremely morally wrong and illegal actions with the number of people supposedly connected to it, and not 1 person decides to say anything, makes it pretty unlikely regardless of everything else. Not to mention it&#39;s such an insanely unnecessary thing. It&#39;s not like an alien coverup to protect the public or give the government more power. This is alleging dozens, possibly hundreds of people, are like &quot;yeah I&#39;ll help you rape a ton of children and defend that info to the death&quot;. Politicians can&#39;t bang a staffer without info leaking out half the time. The implications if it were real just seem so highly implausible. </p>

<p>About those missing child cases where they&#39;re never found, it&#39;s unfortunate but it doesn&#39;t implicate an organized governmental ring. Regular people do bad things too. </p>

<p>Alefantis&#39;s connection to Silsby comes with being friends with someone whose son is on the board of directors of an orphanage Silsby is involved with. That&#39;s already a loose connection to start. There&#39;s also not that much reason to believe that case actually involved child trafficking, it seemed more like a misunderstanding. We don&#39;t have much confirmed evidence to make that link, and foreigners are often under a lot of suspicion in foreign countries for things they&#39;re not doing. </p>

<p>With the Norway case, I could still find links about it in from our media. The NYT response was that wire stories like this are removed after a couple weeks as practice. But I guess that was ignored, rather than confirmed or disconfirmed? News media in America barely cares about European terrorist attacks after a week. It doesn&#39;t look like much of a coverup when the majority of people who would&#39;ve seen the story, saw the story, and can still find info on it if they want. I&#39;ve seen plenty of big busts in America covered in our media, and no one&#39;s connected this one to anything relating to pizzagate. </p>

<p>It is coincidence. It&#39;s dozens of things that are built up to look like evidence, when each individual piece has more reasonable explanations. They&#39;re normal things twisted to look pedo-related, or nefarious things twisted to tie Alefantis/Podesta/Clinton/etc to them. Quantity doesn&#39;t make any of them true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But listen to yourself you want confirmed evidence, but from where? The government? They are the ones protecting themselves and everyone else involved. They are dismissing this case and connected cases because if the truth comes to light they know we would never allow them to get away with it. Hence why they want to cover up all of this. The recent history of &quot;confirmed evidence&quot; from our officials is shaky at best, just look at the anti-russia narrative.This is connected and if you&#39;re unwilling to accept all of this than that&#39;s fine I understand how it&#39;s an overwhelming amount of info and nobody wants to believe our beloved American government could ever be implicated in something so purely evil. And they aren&#39;t raping for no reason in their minds, it&#39;s satanic in nature. Many of these officials are part of secret societies that have known satanic signs and motives. Furthermore the definition of a conspiracy is a secret plan formed by two or more people to do something harmful or illegal. This is the sub you are on, we are making the connections and investigating the theories. It seems like your beliefs are more closely tied to what the MSM would have you believe anyways, so just keep believing in our wonderful system and the great Obama administration because it&#39;s certainly easier that way</p>
