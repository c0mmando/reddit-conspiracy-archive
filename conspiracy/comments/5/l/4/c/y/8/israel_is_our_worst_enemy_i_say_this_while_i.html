       As long as media is their handmaiden the tide will be difficult to turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been astonishing to watch media carry Israel's water re: the UN vote. Israel supporters on tv trashing the US while not one talking head says, "Well, ya know…they are in violation…and US taxpayers support them to the tune of 11million dollars a day. Who are they to bite the hand that feeds them?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And more astonishing…no one stops to ask…"Why the fuck should we care what Israel thinks or does? There are 100s of countries on this planet, all filled with decent, productive human beings who also deserve our support. Why do we continually focus on a tiny shithole populated with self important whiners?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of decent Jews…but the Talmudic variety that see non Jews as cattle to be led to slaughter can all, every last one…go fuck themselves.

       It's not about the big bad Israel. People living there are normal people. It is about a small group of Jewish families that actually are the ones to hate. Rotschild, Rockefeller, Warburg, Maxwell, those.

       That is still a generalization. I am sure there are people in Israel who are not followers of Judaism and who just want to have a normal life in the country that they happened to be born in.

       You're right about Israel doing 9/11. A little tip that might help you in the future is to make you're opponent do the work from the get go. The burden of proof belongs to gov that has spent trillions and murdered a million+ as a result of their "investigation." The burden is squarely on them to prove it. Ask them to first provide proof of the official conspiracy, that 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters did it. Beyond repeating it ad nausium, how has the gov proved it? When they call you Truther you call them truster. No one wants to be seen an unconditional truster of politicians.

       Believe what you wish with regards 9/11. Never in the history of mankind has a building like Building 7 burn to the ground - in any way shape or form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parrot your "sources" - or use your head. Building 7
       <em>

       is proof that shit did not happen how you believe.

       The sole fact that you support that story shows you're full of beans. Since you're so very wrong on this - you must be wrong with regards of the land "dispute" in Palestine too.

      <p>
       I really do hate those that perpetrated 9/11.  I'll be glad to admit that.  Israel has a lot to answer for, and one day it will.

       You have a few things screwed up in your mind.  The Samson option is something Israel threatens the rest of the world.  My statement was that if zioinist Jews decide to go forward with that option, I would be fine with their mutual destruction.  I welcome it, as long as we all die.  No more chosen people.  Oops, darn.

       9/11 was an inside job, perpetrated by the Bush administration and Israel in order to further Israeli interests.  But you know that.

      <p>
       It's funny how your response to me explaining how WTC 7 collapsed is to simply say that it's more than enough evidence (which is utterly false, as it's clearly not even evidence, much less an abundance of it)
      </p>

       which leads me to the conclusion that 9/11 "truthers" are anti - evidence, as I stated before, and you are yet to prove otherwise.

       Christ man, if you hadn't been such as asshole in your very first interaction with me, we would be having a lovely conversation.

       I'm no fan of Israel's actions against innocent people, or their meddling in our state affairs, but Israel is a complex democracy populated by a number of ethnic groups. There are divisions even among jews themselves. Get over this jewish boogeyman thing... soros and the like are gangsters, just like the mafia, the jesuits, etc. Israel is a player in the game, not the top of the pyramid.

       Israel is responsible for the destruction of several Arab states and deaths of millions. Criminality couldn't be more clear. Yes, the criminality is committed by wealthy Jews, who have rooked Jewish lower class  into blindly supporting their schemes through religion.

       Arab infighting is also responsible. Arab elite are just as bad, also traffick in human slavery, also control huge percentage of world's wealth. Let's not lump all arabs into one party, either. The situation is a lot more complex then "ZIONISM JEW BOOOOO!!!"

       Believe what you wish with regards 9/11. Never in the history of mankind has a building like Building 7 burn to the ground - in any way shape or form.
