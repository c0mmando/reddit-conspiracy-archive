       I posted this in another sub yesterday but got very little response and from no one who actually believes in a Kennedy conspiracy.  So I'm trying to understand why this has been probably the most persistent conspiracy theory of the last 53 years.  I'm not trying to judge or criticize, I really just want to understand better why people believe the official story should not be trusted, particularly why Lee Harvey Oswald could not have been the shooter.  Any help you could offer would be great!

       Oswald was a terrible shot, with an even worse rifle shooting at a moving target from a decent distance.

       Have you ever fired a rifle? the 2 shots that hit the president (of 3 taken in 6 seconds) are nearly impossible to replicate with the best gear in the world. and with the mail order dog shit rifle he had, its even harder. There has to have been multiple shooters. Oswald could have been 1, but if you know anything about shooting, those are impossible with a single below marksman shooter

       There is too many inconsistencies with Oswald taking the shot on his own, which other posters in the thread have covered pretty good. I like the theory that at least one shot was by accident from the secret service in the car behind. If that was the case it pretty much explains all of the other fuckery that followed.

       I saw that documentary. My biggest hangup is I have a hard time believing the shot was accidental, especially since they called off the agents who would have been riding on the car right before it happened.

       I think- if you watch the video with a clear mind instead of thinking about all the bullshit you've been told and looking for what you've been told to look for-  it's pretty obvious that Jackie shoots him through the head, stuffs the gun behind the seat, and either a bullet shell or some piece of evidence that she felt she needed to grab flew back onto the trunk of the car so she goes back to retrieve it. All of this while in an MKUltra-induced state of action.

       Some others have already explained the difficulty of making the shot that is said to have killed him, and the fact that Oswald's military record reflected that he was not a skilled marksman. In addition, it would have been challenging, for any one person, to pop off that many
       <em>
        accurate
       </em>
       shots in the short time span that they occurred (with the weapon he is said to have used.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story also involves what is referred to as "The Magic Bullet Theory" - which basically defies physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have several strange occurrences and procedures around how his body and autopsy were treated once he was taken to the hospital. The original autopsy was said to have been burned because there was blood that got on it, and then the doctor "sketched a new one from memory" - that's the official autopsy that was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a custody battle over the body and disputes about where it should be transported to and how it should be handled.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were also witnesses who were on the grassy knoll at the time of the shooting who claim shots were fired "over [their] heads" - aka, not where "Oswald" was shooting from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also people who claim they saw Oswald at the time of the shooting, in the lunch room on a different floor than he was said to have been shooting from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret Service did not follow typical procedure that day and Dallas Police were ordered to stand down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take all of that into consideration and then examine the official story, which contains
       <em>
        several
       </em>
       inconsistencies in itself. I actually visited the 6th floor museum, which is where Oswald is said to have shot from. There were several "facts" in the museum that even conflicted with each other.

       Have you looked into it at all? Like,

       Start with evidence of 11 bullets hitting the car, the road, the overpass, the grass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continue with Oswald's identity being used across Texas to buy trucks and guns, while Oswald was in Russia. Try to figure out how the Dallas PD was circulating Oswald's description, when no one ever claimed to have seen the shooter. Ask yourself if, "I am not resisting arrest. I am a patsy," is relevant testimony by Oswald in the heat of the moment.

       Look into umbrella man. Look into Jack Ruby and Richard Nixon.  Look into Operation Zapata &amp; the Bay of Pigs. E Howard Hunt &amp; Frank Sturgis &amp; David Ferrie and Guy Bannister and Allen Dulles and Prescott Bush.
