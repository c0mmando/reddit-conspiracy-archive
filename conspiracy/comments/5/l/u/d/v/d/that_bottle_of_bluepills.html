        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, since November I&#39;ve been more or less waking up. In the aftermath of the election, I went from leftist liberal to nonpartisan and skeptical of everything. </p>

<p>I hate Trump for the racism and misogyny, but I respect what professional attitude he has. I lament voting for HRC, and I want to see the Dems burn for their recent behavior.</p>

<p>When I redpilled, it was primarily to do with pizzagate. I gave pizzagate up today -- not because I don&#39;t believe it, but because I&#39;m tired of being shit on by fellow investigators for trying to do my part. I&#39;ve decided to let them handle it.</p>

<p>However, since last week I&#39;ve been looking into Hollow Earth for entertainment and somewhat consumed by Cold War II/World War III foreshadowing. I finally breached the surface and fell into another long-ass hole.</p>

<p>Aside from the emotional toll of being conscious, I&#39;m finding I don&#39;t enjoy as much in life as I did.</p>

<p>Veteran conspiracy and truth seekers, how do you handle the desire to go back to ignorance? To handle the new weight that went unnoticed for so long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am new but not as new as you.  I am thinking there are layers of understanding as well as layers of emotions dealing with it.  Lately I am a bit morose about the scope and depth of it, but have opted to just enjoy the good moments as they come up.  So whether you believe Antarctica holds danger. Or the cabal.  Or sun flares.  Or Niburu / PlanetX.  Or WWIII.  Or etc.</p>

<p>Enjoy the day.  Enjoy the moments.  Enjoy each other.  Especially don&#39;t fall into TPTB&#39;s trap to fear everything and to hate everyone.</p>

<p>I am sad by the thought it could all end soon not only for me but everyone.  But those I love don&#39;t know I have it weighing on my mind.  They just feel my love.</p>

<p>Come back up out of the hole, go back in for mild doses.  Laugh at what you can about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With you on Pizzagate (Voat). You can still garden or go canoeing.  Realize some of the best fear-porn available is often considerable speculation.  TPTB and various governments and agencies you are now more conscious of have been doing this for years/centuries, your life still has most of the things you used to enjoy.  I&#39;ve got to say the worst thing I can think of as late has to be the change of the Red vs Blue paradigm as of late, its always existed but try explaining even the most coherent, cited and well thought out issues to strangers, friends or family (Liberal and Conservative it doesn&#39;t matter).  The response is either the complete inability to even entertain a thought contrary to their beliefs or complete disinterest.  For simple requests for proof, information, simple discourse, etc. I am a shill, Trumptard, Libtard, Russian Agent, too concerned with things beyond my control to discuss any of these things further and that&#39;s a real downer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite everything you should strive to be happy. If you let all of the negative things in life get you down you&#39;re going to be a very unhappy person. </p>

<p>IMO the whole point of living is to be happy. If digging down rabbit holes makes you miserable then stop doing it. You aren&#39;t helping anyone by making yourself full of hate and loathing.</p>

<p>Accept the things you cannot change. Change the things you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there are some topics I avoid just because they&#39;re so shitty and depressing. I find the best thing to do is acknowledge them, maybe research some basic info, then move on. </p>

<p>Yes these topics are extremely important, but it isn&#39;t worth being miserable over.</p>

<p>I was friends with this guy in high school and now he is extremely engrossed in pzzgt and other things like it. All he does every day is watch YouTube, make reaction videos, and make long rambling facebook posts. It is pretty sad how obvious it is in his videos and posts that he is miserable. No reason to do that to yourself.</p>

If there&#39;s one thing that I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that each new piece of information I&#39;m exposed to reinforces how little I will ever know about the world and the universe.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Aside from the emotional toll of being conscious, I&#39;m finding I don&#39;t enjoy as much in life as I did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, at first when you learn of this world, you can&#39;t be happy immediately but after time you learn to live with it and do your part where you can. I for example was woken up after 911 happened and my discomfort and hate against the world was just seen as a &quot;teenage transformation&quot; thing as I was 14/15 when the tragedy happened.</p>

<p>I went to college, got involved with the socialist/communist on campus, discussed alternate economic and societal structures, and just shared moments of realization with each other and continued our discussion and pursuit for a Utopian society. This is what brought happiness back to me. I realized I wasn&#39;t alone and there were people like me out there that want an alternate to the world we live in now.</p>

<p>After college, I got a job and pretty much just go on my day being part of society but every chance I get, i try and educate people and try and red-pill the fuck out of them. I believe once enuf of us are red-pilled (i&#39;m talking masses), that&#39;s when we will see change as the movement will happen not with 1 or 2 or thousand people but when a million people all wake up and come together. </p>

<p>But again, going back to your statement of happiness, you can find it in what you like to do most, no matter how fucked the situation. For me, travelling and seeing the world and it&#39;s people is what makes me happy. I work to earn money, I save that money, and with my savings, i pay my bills and then my disposable income is all spent on travelling and seeing other cultures and learning history of our civilization.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have zero desire to return to ignorance. To be perfectly honest, I don&#39;t think I ever had it. I started getting into trouble at a very early age for questioning various narratives. </p>

<p>One thing I have always done, is not take any of it too seriously. I&#39;ve meditated a lot, practiced yoga, practiced various occult teachings, practiced Law of Atraction. All of these things have aided me in sovereignty. Once you realize you rule yourself, everything else is just noise to which you can choose to listen - or not. </p>

<p>Look - it&#39;s ok to turn away from pizzagate. That shit is hella fucked up. <strong>You have no obligation to concern yourself with it.</strong> Does that sound selfish? Perhaps so, but unless you are prepared to make actionable decisions regarding it, aren&#39;t you just punishing yourself with the knowledge? </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s up to you to decide how many brain-splinters you can work on at once.</strong> </p>

<p>Take a break. Take a walk. Breathe. Stretch. Turn your thoughts to what is in front of you. Pet your dog. Find one thing to be grateful for &amp; appreciate it. None of this stuff is going anywhere &amp; should you choose to pick it back up, it (and surely more) will be waiting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t lament being awake at all.  Ignorance is for children.  I think the idea of being a self-reliant adult in every capacity.  I think its incredibly empowering to know the truth, actually.  As I&#39;m so often saying here, the Grand Scheme is just so <em>lame</em>.  Ugh, it&#39;s so pitifully lame.  This whole Bankster Globalist shitshow right now is just sad.  There&#39;s no respectable Blofeld operating right now, just <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PaTXUJVfRRc/VYrzol4nCqI/AAAAAAAAX8o/ogXlLuQyCXc/s1600/rockefeller%2Brothschildjpg.png">these goddamn geezer losers.</a>They&#39;re so unimpressive.

    <div class="md"><p>Had a similar discussion with a good friend a few days ago. Basic question was: if somebody would offer you the blue pill - you live a normal life with house, job, family etc and believe everything the government and legacy media is telling you - would you take it?</p>

<p>I personally somehow turned into a nihilist and seeing the huge amount of people with Stockholm syndrome doesn&#39;t make it better. It&#39;s a curse and a blessing.</p>

<p>Oh and my friend decided in favor of the blue pill. He&#39;s fighting for years about animal abuse (which is basically like the Holocaust but with a different species, watch <a href="http://www.earthlings.com">www.earthlings.com</a> if you want to understand) that he&#39;s too exhausted for life now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an old saying...</p>

<p>There&#39;s two mistakes one can make when considering their &quot;Path&quot;.</p>

<p>The first mistake is not beginning.</p>

<p>The second mistake is not going all the way...</p>

<p>Just keep going, and growing.  You&#39;re in the ever-changing process now...</p>

<p>One practical suggestion, though?  </p>

<p>Get busy.</p>

<p>Go get smarter about something that might make you happy and make you money, at the same time.  It&#39;s one of the keys to this existence.</p>

<p>Good Luck, and don&#39;t believe anything anyone tells you (including me:)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say you hated trump for the racism and misogyny - when I ask other people what did trump do or say that was racist they pointed out his illegal alien comments - that illegal Mexicans were largely criminal. Mexico isn&#39;t a race - what he said may not be fact but it&#39;s not exactly racist. Saying the grab her pussy thing may be misogynistic but saying something to someone in passing doesn&#39;t mean he is misogynistic. </p>

<p>The reason I even bring up trump isn&#39;t to defend him but to point out that the media manufactured most of this bullshit to guarantee a win for the unelectable clinton. The media painted this picture of trump as a monster so that when he won people lost their shit. </p>

<p>What the media did was criminal and they should be torn down and re-built based on these actions alone. The media is the true enemy and should be treated as such. </p>

<p>If nothing else remember the media is not on your side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s lots of great responses here.  These sorts of topics pop up periodically as new people have their worldviews blow up on them and show up here wondering how we can even wake up in the morning and get dressed knowing how much evil shit is going on around the world.  I empathize and sympathize every time, and these topics almost always surprise me with how good the responses are and make me proud of this community all over again.  Maybe shills just don&#39;t give a crap about these posts. Heh, fuck those guys.</p>

<p>Anyway, my only advice has kind of already been given, but:  Master your own mind and emotions first and you will no longer be so depressed and upset by the &quot;red pills.&quot;  I cannot recommend mindfulness meditation enough.  If you don&#39;t have your own physical and mental health up to a certain minimum, you are doing yourself no favors by indulging your newfound (and generally quite healthy, albeit perilous) thirst for truth.  You are right to take a break / step back, I still need to do that periodically for my own mental health. Keep your skepticism intact at all times.  ALL TIMES.  A lot of &quot;rabbit holes&quot; are false in whole or in part.  Nobody knows everything.  Lots of things that are taken for granted by the conspiracy-minded set are probably just as ridiculous as the &quot;scofftic&quot;-minded set think they are, and that&#39;s by design.  Disinfo is all over the place.  I think the world is simultaneously both <em>way more fantastic</em> than most people want to believe it is (you got here via pizzagate so you can understand what I mean by that all too easily) and also <em>somewhat less fantastic</em> than the most addle-brained and credulous &quot;light worker&quot; or what have you thinks it is.  So don&#39;t give anything too much credit unless it &quot;fits&quot; the overall puzzle when looked at from multiple angles.</p>

<p>Anyway, good luck, be well, question literally everything, remember you&#39;re not alone, and try to learn to laugh at the cosmic absurdity of it all, not matter how depressing a given topic seems at first. :)</p>
