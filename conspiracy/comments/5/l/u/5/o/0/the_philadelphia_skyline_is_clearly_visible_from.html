       The Philadelphia skyline is clearly visible from Apple Pie Hill in the New Jersey Pine Barrens 40 miles away. If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, factoring in the 205 foot elevation of Apple Pie Hill, the Philly skyline should remain well-hidden beyond 335 feet of curvature.

       Also the Earth is not a ball. It is a bit more oblong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also local topography is not the same as planetary shape. That is like saying climate change isn't really because your local weather is cold.

       Oy.. every time I see this curvature argument I think ..doesn't light travel so fast(7x around the world in a second right?) and/or curve with gravity/the earths curvature making it perfectly feasible to see great distances over the curve with the likes of a telescope. I'm no great physicist but from what I do remember that seems perfectly logical to me. I am not sure how correct this would be but I think by that measure as an example if you fired a beam of light straight ahead at 90 degree angle by the time it got all the way back to you once it would only of sloped about 12 degrees down.

       Not to mention the flat earth theory violates every single fundamental law of physics. Including torsion physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire flat earth theory is built on bad science and almost a zealot sort of philosophy, like creationists saying the Earth is 6000 years old. Then every facet of reality is spun to support the theory.  Religion has done this since time began.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matt is math. There's another made up theory that defies the laws of physics that millions of people believe in, and still believe in.  It's called the NIST report. The NIST report sold to us by the US government claiming buildings can collapse at freefall speed when hit by an airplane. Totally impossible.

       Relativity is basically an attempt to make the mathematics of the Heliocentric model work. That's basically why relativity sounds so bizzare and difficult to understand. It occupies a stange position of explaining things we know are true but also including things that haven't been proven. This would be 'agenda driven science' of which evolution is a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the flat earth we are countering a scientific agenda so as kind of supporting proof we have to be on the look out for evidence of a cover-up. It's a sort of half joke to call it Jewish propaganda but I have encountered some interesting ideas linking physics especially atomic physics with Jewish mysticism etc. I'm really just playing around with an idea.

       You know what? Arguing with a flat earther is the biggest waste of time, and your snarky ass attitude just reeks of shit. So when you want to grow up and look at science with the big kids, let us know. Keep believing your earth is flat, and I'll tell you what, I'll even sell you a couple of unicorns.

       "You cannot debunk a fisheye lens give a circle like optical illusion. This is based optics as far as I know." I can't find a single, sensible independent clause in there to respond to...  all lenses have barrel distortion. fisheyes are just extremely pronounced therefore people who know little about lenses will call the barrel distortion "fisheye distortion" and will google "how to turn off fisheye on my go pro." Go pro does not use a fisheye lens. Google "fish eye lens" and see how different they look than a go pro. And lastly, you are op, and we're debunked by him pointing out that the height of the buildings is the missing piece in your incomplete "math"

In Advanced Settings check the "Remove Fisheye" option. Click OK.
Add the clip to the Conversion List and then Convert the Clip. The fisheye effect will be removed.

       This is actually a backend "correction" of the barrel distortion inherent in the lens. Again it's not a "fisheye" lens, just user friendly nomanclature. Read the post and comments in the link below by actual photographers:

       First off, please don't accuse of me of being programmed because I think something that has generally been accepted. A "round earth" is pretty much so fundamental, so basic an idea that we pretty much calculated Earth's circumference at about
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">
        250 bc

       . If you want to get a little deeper, just look at the workings of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">
        Antikythera mechanism.
       </a>
       A "round" earth has been so obvious, so "true" for so long, has worked in so many models throughout history, the burden of proof is hardly on "round" earth. Your willingness to not only believe, but propagate theories based on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5lv0ix/the_earth_has_a_radius_of_approximately_3965/?">
        questionable math, factual inaccuracy

       tempts me to dismiss you as a "crazy self brainwashed flat earther" just as you dismiss me as programmed... but I won't.

      <p>
       Secondly, the image above is a trap.

        Not only does the height of where this picture is taken matter, the point at which the "correction" is made matters to

       Yes, the Greek guy did the experiment and got sort of close to what they claim the globe to be size wise. How can you be ago confident every person say in the middle ages was aware of his theories? They did not have the printing press or Wikipedia in some stages in history.

       Much of the globe theory was not mainstream until around the time of expiring for the new world and the formation of the Jesuits.

       Everyone debunking here is smarter than me. My biggest questions to flat earthers are 
1. we can see spherical planets with telescopes as well as their moons. (not to mention artificial orbital bodies like the ISS). Why is earth so special? (other than GOOOOOD). 
2. what's up with Eratosthenes then? was he also part of the jesuit conspiracy roughly 3 centuries before christ?

       i don't believe earth = flat. But the flat earth movement I think is gaining popularity because the few arguments it uses noone gives a simple easy to understand answer to it.

       That site debunks both of those claims itself, so I'll just quote it:

        The consistent results within each of the different shafts led McNair to theorize that circulating air was the culprit with shaft 5’s updraft along the western line causing the divergence.

       NOTE: The divergence was only seen in

       shaft. Another shaft showed convergence. Either way, the experimenters came to the conclusion that wind currents were messing with their results.

       Here the author admits not having performed the experiment himself or having ever seen actual evidence that it was carried out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The page was posted in 2013, but to date (despite investigating the possibility) the author does not seem to have carried out the experiment - or has decided not to publish the results of the experiment (for obvious reasons).

       Had a flat earther tell me science , math and laws of physics  ,especially math are not real, period. So I literally kicked his fucking ass , he's not a flat earther anymore , he got a job ,moved out from his moms basement found a special lady, he's doing fucking great now , he thanks me every time he sees me and his lady brings me baked goods .

       I'm just gonna post this here too. Sorry for reposting but you never replied it when I posted it on your other thing.

      <p>
       You've posted like 20 flat Earth one liners on here. You've got a 9 day old account. Understand, you may be a legitimate delight of a person. However, shitposting theories that can be disproven with middle school math and a 5 minute google search certainly seems like shill behavior.

       Wtf? You cannot debunk a fish eye lens give a circle like optical illusion. This is based optics as far as I know.

       First off, please don't accuse of me of being programmed because I think something that has generally been accepted. A "round earth" is pretty much so fundamental, so basic an idea that we pretty much calculated Earth's circumference at about
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">
        Antikythera mechanism.
       </a>
       A "round" earth has been so obvious, so "true" for so long, has worked in so many models throughout history, the burden of proof is hardly on "round" earth. Your willingness to not only believe, but propagate theories based on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5lv0ix/the_earth_has_a_radius_of_approximately_3965/?">
        questionable math, factual inaccuracy

       tempts me to dismiss you as a "crazy self brainwashed flat earther" just as you dismiss me as programmed... but I won't.

       Secondly, the image above is a trap.

       That'd be awesome. I'm pretty sure that Steven Christ dude did it but botched it on purpose.  Which doesn't surprise me since he's most likely in place to turn people off from the theory..
