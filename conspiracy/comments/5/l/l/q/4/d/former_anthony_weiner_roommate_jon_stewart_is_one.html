       You're really reaching here, sometimes pizza is just pizza, you're going to have to do better than a TV sketch and being roommates with someone who texted with 15-year-old girls right before he outed the whole organization.  15 really isn't that young and AFAIK, he didn't touch them.

       They had to beep her out twice when she said he "fucks pizza". At the end she alludes to him never having seen an adult vagina because he "only fucks pizza" Maybe she's just trying to be funny... :/

       So it's dock's razor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like a dock, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's most likely a fucking dock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still a bit confused by this, and your entire premise were you to mean actually mean "duck" for every instance. Because it wouldn't apply in this situation. It's only you with your 'advanced knowledge' that thinks pizza = a child to be raped/murdered/eaten. To everyone else it looks like a joke, sounds like a joke, and is most likely a joke.

       I was a 15-year-old girl once and I admit to having sex with several guys over the age of 18, even in their 30s.  I'd lie about my age, I had daddy issues and it was exciting.  It's one thing to talk about it, quite another to act on it.  Show me where he bought kiddie porn and I'll help you lynch the guy.

       I see the problem now, I didn't see it then.  All I am stating is this mob mentality is scary and we should ask for more evidence before we start making accusations.  I am referring to Jon Stewart, who, as far as I can tell, left the Daily Show because he wouldn't play nice with the elite.

       The topic is about Jon Stewart and whether he molests kids.  Wiener made really bad decisions and he's paying for his crimes, but I am not going to call Jon a pedo based on this stupid video and the fact he was roommates with someone whose wife was fucking Hillary, not him.  Weiner was weak, he's in jail.

       Guy in mass media making jokes about politics. Who in their right mind would have guessed that he works for the mass media. Mind blown . /s

       Fuck Jon Stewart and his surface dancing bullshit. The guy had zero balls on his show. Fuck TV overall. If someone is on TV, with their own show, about politics, then obviously they work for big mass media. This is simple fucking logic.

       That is proposterous. He's a TV dipshit.  He was/is a surface dancing fool, who never once talked about real things. He talked about the TV political surface front. He avoided all real talk, to those who are educated. I feel sorry for anyone who thought they were getting anything of value from that show. People who have been fooled rarely admit it. Oh well.

       You people have so far out there to reach for anything that you have the solar system. Come on, for you to make this accusation based on this video is total BS. You accuse someone of something that is so vile and potentially so damaging to a person with nothing more that what you are interpting in comedy skit assuming that some words that have been repeated over and over for months that are code words for pedophiles and think that now and forever any one who uses these words is them using them for pedophile code.  By your logic PizzaHut is now a verified kidde porn company . My anger on this isn't because I'm John Stewart fanboy, its from your complete carelessness in actually willing to accuse not just him but is apparent you would accuse anyone off nothing more than common words that just recently has been promoted as something  that is somehow justfiable to possibly ruin an innocents person life just by the accusation and I just can't understand how your anyone like would be willing to take that risk against someone you do not know and have no even the slightest circumstantial evidence for  and is making you no different than people in Salem who accused women of being witches and had them be killed for that baseless accusation. Think about that for awhile and maybe start being more careful about how you are willing treat others and think about how you would be devastated if someone did this to you because said the word pizza.  According that is all the evidence is needed to determine with certainty that rape kids.  Yeah, that's totally insane now isn't it.  So maybe don't do this to others if you are thinking how unfair and unjust it would be if you were the one being accused publicly on Reddit just like you have here.

       Shills are ALWAYS asking for more evidence. It's their go to phrase. They think there's a conveyor belt loaded with evidence out in the open where people can just stand there and let it come to them.

       I'm shilling in favor of pizzagate and against msm narrative? For you to even think that.....never mind. Looks like I have to pull out the heavy artillery. Fine.

       In what world do you go from pizza to talking about fucking pizza. Such a strange leap to make. Of course it doesn't make him a pedo. But it's such a bizarre reference you can't ignore it.

       At this point in pgate I'm basically assigning a 1-5 for circumstantial evidence.  This is a solid 3.5.  It's not quite Miley Cyrus pizza pajamas (a 4, clearly), but it's dang close.

       Jesus Christ, people. Recognise forum sliding and a strawman argument when you see it and don't give it the light of day.
      </p>

       There is plenty to discuss on the allegations of human trafficking as it relates to the CF and their ilk (like Laura Silsby, Epstein, and a bunch more), the Podesta brothers, Bill and Hill themselves as well as Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis without dragging everyone through the mud who has ever expressed a love for pizza, be it sincere or ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza (and I mean the doughy dish, thank you very much) is an immensely satisfying fast food for all its ingredients and is one of the most unequivocally loved foods out there. People will joke about how they fucking love pizza without secretly implicating themselves as fucking pedophiles on national TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       The code words in Podesta's emails are certainly out of place enough to warrant non-literal interpretations that can lead either to it relating to drug talk or sex lingo, but they don't suddenly turn every literal use of these food terms into code for these illicit things. You get that, right?
