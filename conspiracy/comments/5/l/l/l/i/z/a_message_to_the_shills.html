       Why are you doing this? In what way does spreading misinformation benefit you at all. This is your world too, and it's fucked up right now and nobody in the government is doing anything but sitting back and watching their game. Idk how they get you guys to do this, but please see through them and stop trying to act like everything is OK. Our country has set about many false flags to push their agenda. 911 was staged, this alone is enough evidence to make me not trust a thing that comes from them. Knowing about 911 how farfetched is it that all the rest of it is true too? Anyways, I ask you to at least think about your fellow people. The ones who don't have billions and fuck children.

       I've thought about this abit and I guess that 'these people' fall into a few categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do not share our moral perspective. They might not give a flying shit considering $$$ involved, perks, power and all the usual BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be that they believe that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the ones taking the moral high road; what they do is important and you are just a dumb pawn to think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are a pawn in the system bent with corruption? We know that blackmail using paedophilia is rampant. The system clearly knows how to exploit people for their benefit.

       A lot of my own closest friends, unfortunately fall into this description. I think some people just have completely different perspectives and places of mind. Some people hold truth and justice over all, others hold money and materials over all, everyone has different priorities.

       Yep, I watched the documentary on Swartz yesterday. The man would have been our Gandhi of the Internet. The MLK of the internet. He would have done many more great things had he not been antagonized by the CIA. But that's why it's up to the people to follow his legacy and fight the good fight. We can't let people like Swartz (and likely Assange) die for nothing.

       It makes sense, but I would expect the CIA to be involved more than DOD. I assume this is why we saw the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 get repealed recently.

       unless you are going to tell me these other shills popped up after august 2016, then I will say are not as impacting as CTR. CTR overtook r/politics in a single day.

       Sure, there may be shills around, but we are not experiencing a shill invasion at the level CTR took over r/politics after the conventions.

       Yes, but they did so very obviously. A great shilling organization will not make it obvious they are present. If I ran such an organization, I would base the operations on black propaganda and forum sliding, discrediting anything that I didn't like. That would be invisible to people who are looking for shills.

       ANd who's to say they aren't one in the same? I think people are missing that there is actually an Industry for this and it's contracted out. And at the top it is always .gov controlled. CTR was a "mission". A mission here, a mission there. Or there wouldn't exist an industry.

       The CTR guys are mostly politics. They're pretty fucking stupid. They were mostly on The Donald

       The DOD guys are the middle of the road. They're the bread and butter that we see in here.

       The CIA and secret society guys are the really dangerous ones. I've run into a handful of them here (they're all over 4 chan), and they're fucking sharp. Hard to fight, because they have info we don't have, so they can do partial hangouts we aren't prepared for, and bridge back to the regime's paradigm.

       CTR funding expired 12/31. Many people do not like Trump. Over 50% of the people that voted in the election would rather have a corrupt 70 year old hag that has been dry humping corporations for decades, and sold out this country for a price without a whim. A woman that cant tell the truth about her favorite baseball team, let alo e matter os significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It follows that Reddit being a liberal, sheeple, cess pool in majority has a majority in /r politkcs that strongly dislike Trump. The SJWs are strong on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the obvious bias of the mods in r/politics. Posting anything positive about Trump, or critical of anything leftist is incredibly arduous. Its dam near impossible in fact.

       I wouldn't say that we can definitively say "over 50%". Hillary's entire lead could be contained to California, where illegitimate voting is really easy. Along with NY and Detroit, I don't think the popular vote can be used as a piece of data, honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what you're saying, is that that rather than paid shills, we now just have a bunch of closed minded SJWs controlling the front page of Reddit, and it's not CTR anymore? That, I can buy. It's still pretty obviously manipulated and biased, but I honestly don't care whether the people behind it are getting paid publicly, they're probably incentivised in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods in r/politics were taken over during the election, and I really doubt anything will change over there.

       Yes, 50% is a fact, regardless of geographical boundaries. The fact is over 50% of the people that voted, voted against Trump in favor of Hillary.  Geographical boundaries is irrelevant.

       Yeah r/politics can nearly give you cancer. And r/The_Donald looks like it's been turning into right-side r/politics. It used to promote free thought and critical thinking to a point, but now it's just as bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's disappointing to see SJWs and the like censoring dissenting opinions and controlling the discussion. I just like freedom of speech and information, and when folks decide to censor, that is not good, whether they are paid or not. But it's pretty clear that the admins of Reddit control the conversation too, and someone must be paying them to put that much work into censoring r/the_donald and r/pizzagate.

       I believe they censor r/The_Donald because they simply don't like the sub. I am a sub there, and it is a very childish sub, for lack of a better term. I could see how a die hard Hillary fan, particularly u/spez, could have strong dislike for The_Donald and direct censorship of the sub. And censorship is essentially what we see with the changes in algorithms aimed at pigeon holing The_Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts on pizzagate is the classic problem of sheeple. The average person cannot bring themselves to imagine, let alone believe, the possibility that people, particularly those in power, could engage in such atrocities. Much like any discussion of 9/11, most people don't want to entertain any possible scenario other than the government's official account. And it is because most people are sheeple.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the internet opens up more minds by providing access to plethora of information, the sheeple are beginning to wake. Even this sub is more active than it was 3 years ago. As more people wake, the elite controllers get nervous. They know they need to contain this and stop it from snow balling. More people are awake now than ever to the fact the government is corrupt and flat out lies to the general public   whose best interest they do not have in plan. This is why we are seeing this move by government to censor alternative news sources. It's a problem. The eiltes are pushing back and trying to stop the inevitable revolt. And revolt is what we see with Trump's election. This user certainly voted for Trum to keep a status quo criminal politician from taking power once again.

       I agree. The_Donald brought 4chan to Reddit and a lot of folks don't like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, folks are too stuck in their delusions to see they're being lied to. Pizzagate and 9/11 are good examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, yeah I agree a lot of progress has been made just in the last 3 years. I can remember 5 years ago watching "Doomsday Preppers" and thinking those guys were smart to prepare, but I didn't see the threat. My family members considered them wack-jobs for putting that much effort in that stuff. Now, my family is legitimately aware that there is a lot that is going to change in the next few years, and simply hope that nothing catastrophic happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's recognizable for anyone not directly in the delusion, that we are being lied to and there is a large cover up in place. The Internet continues to wake folks up, and honestly I hope legal marijuana will have a similar effect. Weed chills people out, but it can have a perspective changing effect especially on folks with internal struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there is such an aggressive push by the MSM against these things should be a sign to all that there is a larger game at play. And before folks start to recognize the bigger picture, they'll be stuck in their greedy materialism.

       I believe millions of illegitimate votes were cast throughout the states. Many of them were in California I presume. Many were in New York too, I'm sure. Detroit also had that problem. I'm confident saying that if Hillarys team couldn't get the electoral votes, they'd make sure they got the popular vote.

Before the election I really had fallen into this mindset of " well he didn't seem to do much and what he did do I didn't like most of it but he still seems like a good guy" but I think that's part of the reason why they picked him for president, because he's charming and people want to like him

       You can say I'm in that camp, and I don't discredit something if there's actual logical evidence. I find it harder to believe that the CIA is full of liberals doing the DNC's bidding against an incoming administration who could easily figure out the veracity of their information, than a shady foreign power tried to work against a candidate they don't like, possibly to help prop up a candidate they can manipulate.

       I think they did. But I don't think they conspired against him to the extent that some think. I think it was moreso "this is our person (and friend/long-time colleague in many cases) and this is who we're gonna push for" rather than actively preventing Bernie from taking the nomination. In our circles he seemed like the people's choice, but Hillary's been on people's minds for president for a long time, and there's only so much you can do through social media etc to switch people off that within the time he needed.
      </p>

       I think it was also the Dukakis kind of scare, that such a progressive candidate can't win in the general election. Despite that being exactly the populist counter to Trump the democrats needed.

       See to me it's pretty clear that Bernie should've had the nomination. If Trump won anybody can. Bernie I believe was scammed out of a nomination and future presidency. It's unfortunate that the people pulling the strings would have even that much sway over things.

       That doesn't surprise me either, somebody else in this post talked about getting off the internet to try to convince people face to face about the corruption and scandals which I think is going to be our last course of action against the misinformation

       Ah, yes, the hobo technique. Stand on a corner with a sign and hope people are willing read it. It's much easier to spread information on social media. The only problem is the shills, but if you have the facts to back up your post, the people will read the information. People are also more comfortable absorbing stuff online. They can be in their underwear and they can easily verify whatever it is with the sources you give them.

       That's true it's hard to show a ton of evidence in person but maybe the goal could be more about getting people to do their own research?

       Perhaps, but I know that most of the stuff I post about would sound tin foil crazy if I didn't provide sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every decent sized government hires social media shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       50 percent of the scientific literature is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the country has poisoned drinking water and government officials fake the testing results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies all over the country dump chemicals directly into rivers and the EPA allows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That stuff sounds crazy, but it's all factual. It's also really difficult to find the sources. If you were to google any of it, you'd probably have a really hard time proving anything.

       Careful with who ya be calling out... Maybe I'm just a bit paranoid... But both my internal hard drives happened to suffer catastrophic failures simultaneously on the only night I fell asleep before disconnecting from the Wi-Fi.... Usually I would shift my IP address every hour. Maybe just a coincidence... But very suspicious... Feels like they were nuked just like in all those xkeyscore 4chan larps.

       Your comments make no sense... No one can follow what you're saying... Maybe it's just because you're paranoid... I didn't know you even fell asleep because you comment for nearly 24 hours straight nearly every day of the week... Especially when there seems to be important breakthroughs... Maybe just a coincidence... But very suspicious... OP wasn't even calling anyone out... Careful with what ya be accusing folks of...

       Maybe I should have added /s. I have a history of arguing with Ninja, and I've had the opinion that he's a bot for a couple weeks based on his comment history. I was just making a joke about how fucking weird he types. Like "LOL Trust Me..."

       Wouldn't you like to get paid money to shit post and argue lies on the Internet? Afterall it doesn't affect you personally. These are just words on a screen, ideas, memories. It's like the saying about how music when it hits you feel no pain. Same here, don't be fooled by fake status up votes or likes, don't buy into the hype, most of all have some discretion. There are shills out there, but how many are shills and how many are merely people with different opinions than your own? How many are simply regurgitating what to them seems like a reasonable point of view.

       Who has a monopoly on reality in this day and age? And who is really the tyrant? The one that respects your right to call someone a shill, or fag, or racist? Or the one that demands all others call said entity a shill, or racist, or whatever term is fashionable?

       Yeah that's a good point to make man, like the insight. I'm not necessarily calling anyone with a differing viewpoint than my own a shill but I see what you're saying. My goal was just to try to reach out to anyone who may be actively trying to lead others away from certain information. Because those people need to be aware of the direness of this situation

       No I ask many questions on this subreddit, as should we all. I think that anybody that vehemently tries to dismiss the theories as false or stupid and relentlessly attack the poster. I'm not saying you did or do this and quite honestly idc. If there are shills on this sub maybe they read my post and maybe it would make them rethink what they're doing.

       I suspect they also don't get the full picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are likely setup on a system that just has them respond to comments that are auto picked-up.  They may not know what site it's on.  They may not get to see the article.  They may or may not see multiple comments at once.  They often seem like they are responding with little content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military people are mostly all really good people.  They may or may not likely what they are doing.  They could think they are targeting an country overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the time to respond to some of them, and they see what's actually happening, they will react and be shocked or upset.  I've seen it happen a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give an example.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eg0vl/zip_zap_and_za_pia_arcade_the_kidnapping_was_at/dac6fur/">
        This comment seems like it's not addressing the site or context, but responding to his marching orders
       </a>
       .  It seems to me like he's being told to speak on it or discredit it, and he says it, and he's responding to his boss by saying "I'll be goddamned."  It's like where he drew the line on his advocacy.  Which that's a good sign I guess.  Not a good way to spend tax money, but if they are military people behind the controls then I don't feel as bad about it.

       Interesting, the 24th isn't in Florida, so who is that?

       I mean, they could easily disguise their location online but disguising it as another air force base would be pretty silly.

       Whoever it was, it might just be that servers are in that location. But I don't find it at all surprising that the military would monitor sites like reddit.

       Well I know for a fact people involved with freemasonry come here and call bullshit on very obviously true things. Masons are required to tell lies and even perjure themselves to protect other Masons. They are also required to obey even orders which they know to be immoral:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You must conceal all the crimes of your brother Masons, except murder and treason, and these only at your own option, and should you be summoned as a witness against a brother Mason be always sure to shield him. Prevaricate [falsify], don't tell the whole truth in his case, keep his secrets, forget the most important points. It may be perjury to do this, it is true, but you're keeping your obligations, and remember if you live up to your obligation strictly, you'll be free from sin." (Edmond Ronayne, "Masonic Handbook," page 183)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Right or wrong his very existence as a Mason hangs upon obedience to the powers immediately set above him. The one unpardonable crime in a Mason is contumacy [insubordination] or disobedience."

       Yes but stupidity can't be adequately explained and it's sort of a vague catch-all. Any point that omits facts can be called stupidity. All a shill has to do is insert some weakness in their argument and suddenly any hint of ulterior motive becomes invisible to you. They're just stupid.

       That's true. I guess it just seems so foreign to anybody with a moral code how anyone could do shit like this.

       There are 2750 Architects &amp; Engineers on record stating all three towers were controlled demolition, here are some of their statements
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I'm a chemical engineer with bachelors and masters degrees in engineering from the University of Michigan. I'm an authority on the flammability of materials and I have testified in court on this subject. WTC 7 was demolished with explosives attached to the structural frame. Hardly anything in the building was flammable; it was mostly steel, glass, and masonry.” —** Bruce Caswell**
       </p>
       <p>
        “My experience has included being president of three different architectural firms in Michigan and New England. My outrage and shock at being asked to believe the net of lies surrounding this event matches the feelings of the founding members of AE911Truth. As I watched the towers fall on television, I knew the rapid destruction on display made no scientific sense. Though the tentacles of this subject run in every direction, this betrayal of our national confidence and honor as citizens must not be allowed to stand.” —

        “I'm a licensed architect familiar with structural steel design. When considering the yield point of A36 steel and the redundancy factors included in all 21st century buildings, these buildings could not have been collapsed by an airplane of any kind. This was obvious to me at the time I saw the collapse on television. When the first building came down I told my wife that ‘airplanes cannot make that happen.’" —

        “I have 30 years of diverse design and on-site experience in the engineering field. My most relevant credentials are my extensive experience in computer simulation of structures and mechanical components. I recently reviewed much of the documentation that AE911Truth has supplied and also other sources. My conclusion, based on my engineering experience and intuition, is that structures that are struck in a random nature do not respond with the type of symmetry we see in the WTC towers collapse. In fact, if one were hypothetically tasked to collapse these towers as symmetrically as they fell, it would be nearly impossible, at least for someone without expertise in demolition or other advanced techniques.” —

        “I have twenty-seven years experience as an engineer, the past eighteen of which have been as an independent consultant. During my career, I have developed a specialty in analyzing and addressing residential and commercial buildings with structural problems. It’s taken a long time for me to come to terms with the real possibility that the true causes of the WTC collapses on 9/11 were obscured from the general public and perhaps much worse. We must know the truth, because what’s left of our democracy depends on it.” —

        “I have worked in almost every city in NY. I have been licensed 24 years doing a variety of work from residential to industrial. I was on the phone with another architect on 9/11. We both noted the flashes on the floors below the collapsing floor when the towers came down. Two years laterI was involved in demolishing six buildings in Kodak Park. I realized it was like watching 9/11 all over again. I have no doubt that WTC was controlled demolition. If the mast was not controlled it would have been a sideways fall killing 10,000 more.” —

        “I've been involved in construction all my professional life. I've seen controlled demolitions, and from the day of 9/11/01 watching the towers come down, I knew it had to be a controlled demolition. For the government to not even investigate this possibility in a serious way is beyond unbelievable.” —

        “I have fifteen years experience in defense and private industry engineering and project management. Recognizing that the Twin Towers and WTC 7 were instances of controlled demolition is not the hard part. The hard part is overcoming the emotional hurdle that our government betrayed us. I went into shock and had to grieve when I accepted this. As a country we need to face this anger and grief if we are to come to terms with ourselves and leave a legacy we can reconcile with.” —** Ben Werner**

       <p>
        “I have a Bachelor of Architecture and a Master of Architectural (Structural) Engineering. I remember being very surprised by the collapse of the Twin Towers after the planes struck. Despite the damage and fires, it did not seem possible. I also remember reports of Building 7 being evacuated because it was expected to come down from sustained damage. I accepted the explanations given by the media. It wasn’t until years later that I started examining the research of experts on this and other websites and rethinking my discomfort with the official account. From an understanding of steel failure, I would expect any collapse to be gradual and asymmetric. If the official story were true, it would be a major embarrassment to the US design and construction industry that these towers failed so catastrophically, especially Building 7. I want to stand on the right side of history. We all deserve a real investigation with subpoena power, that explores every possibility.” —** Forrest Mertz**

       No you can not, that is not an equivalence because you absolutely can not show any steel framed buildings, completely collapsing to the ground, for ANY reason, other than controlled demolition.

       Yes there was (Palisades station), Popular Mechanics just claim the strongest spikes recorded the rubble hitting the ground, which is correct, they incorrectly then claim that this proves no demolition, a baseless claim, it proves nothing about the presence or absence of explosives, whose seismic signature would be minimal.

       The shotgun blasts paragraph is a good example.  Maybe NIST's own tests disproved their own theory, but the first passage intending to prove that
       <em>
        didn't prove what it was claiming
       </em>
       .  It was irrelevant information.

       Including irrelevant information along with relevant information, and presenting them both as relevant, is a disinfo tactic.  Do you have any sources that

       What strength would have been remaining in the steel at the temperatures the fires in wtc1&amp;2 reached, the answer is nearly all of it, NIST has no evidence for steel temperatures above 250 degrees C except for three pieces that experienced 600 degrees C where half the strength is lost, but the building had a safety factor of 5.

       Really?  You know, the videos of the towers collapsing are available: it's very obvious that the point of failure is the point where the airplanes hit it, rather than the base like you'd see in a controlled demolition.  In fact, the upper portion of the building angles at one point, because it has too much structural integrity to collapse straight down.

        <p>
         The deceleration of the top's rotation is even more discrediting to the idea of a gravity-driven collapse, which cannot explain the documented changes in angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum is the tendency of a rotating solid object to continue rotating at the same rate in the absence of torque. Initially the block consisting of the top 30 stories of the tower acted as a solid object, and rotated about a fulcrum near the impact zone. Although the fulcrum was the axis of rotation, the block had two types of momentum: the angular momentum of the block around its center of gravity, and the linear momentum of its center of gravity tilting away from the tower's vertical axis. When the portion of the building below the collapse zone disintegrated, the block would preserve its angular momentum by continuing to rotate at the same rate (but the acceleration of the rotation would cease due to the removal of the torque that was being applied by intact columns at the fulcrum). But in reality, the rotation of the block rapidly decelerated as the downward plunge began. Once the fall started, any resistance it encountered from parts of the building would have imparted torque on the block in the same direction as the original fulcrum, and would have accelerated its rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the apparent absence of any torque to counter the rotation of the block, the slowing of its rotation can only be explained by the breakup of most of the block, which would have destroyed its moment of inertia.

       My argument wouldn't be invalid even if neither one hit WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you had video proof that WTC7 was manually demolished by construction workers, the argument is
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       valid for WTC 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it stands, it's valid for all three towers, which saw unprecedented damaged caused to them before their collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind, I'm not particularly attached to that knowledge, but I'd need some pretty good facts to change my opinion.  But your evidence isn't holding up any better than the stuff I had researched in the past.

       I wasn't wrong.  The report only says that WTC1 was responsible for the structural damage; both towers cause a huge cloud of debris when they fell and bits were found on every building for several blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that minutia isn't necessary to my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of my statement is that, regardless of the specifics, WTC7 had seen unprecedented damage in the form of a massive fire and a large chunk of building supports being damaged.

       You were wrong actually. You said both towers hit WTC7. "The report" very specifically says that only WTC1 hit WTC7. "The report" very specifically says that WTC2 was too far away to hit WTC7. You were very specifically wrong. You're only making yourself look bad (worse) by not admitting it.

       Regardless of the facts you mean? Figures. Regardless of your unqualified opinion, NIST (the official government story) states that the damage didn't initiate the collapse. Only fire. And that the fires themselves were not unprecedented.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza, both
commercial office buildings, had fires that fully
involved entire floors. In both buildings, vertical spread 
of fire was by external flame exposure, breaking
glass windows from the outside and igniting office furnishings
in the floor above. By contrast, the fires in WTC 7 spread across several floors, but did not involve an entire floor at any given time. Additionally, in WTC 7 there was no evidence of floor-to-floor fire spread in the photographic and videographic records. Finally, the combustible load was likely similar in First Interstate Bank, One Meridian Plaza, and WTC 7, with the combustible load in One Meridian Plaza perhaps even greater as it was described subjectively as “heavy.” NIST therefore concluded that the fires in First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza were at least as severe, and probably more severe, than the fires in WTC 7." NIST NCSTAR 1-9 pg. 341

       You're arguing that NIST's report said that only WTC1 hit WTC7, but the report talks about what caused the structural damage.  Both towers showered the area with debris, so the statement is still literally true.

       Wow you're still trying to lie? The official report does not state that WTC2 took out any chunks of WTC7. It clearly states that it was too far away. And it states that the damage did not initiate the collapse anyway. Only fire. I'm sorry you think me pointing out your lies is a waste of time. It isn't for me. I'm going to continue to do it.

       Yes NIST claims that fire is the cause. No, NIST states that fire alone caused thermal expansion of column 79 and that caused the collapse. They don't even claim that the debris knocked off fireproofing in this area. In fact, they say it did not. Fire alone is the cause. Not the debris. They also say that they conducted a separate analysis that shows that fire would have collapsed the building in the same manner even if there was 0 debris. Fire is the cause. Not debris.

       NIST's official report says that the fires would have caused the collapse anyway, but you said it didn't collapse on its own?  Why are you quoting NISTs official statements if you don't believe them?

       To clarify, what I intended to communicate with my statement was that debris from the main collapse, in which the two towers fell down, caused structural damage to WTC7.  No building had suffered that kind of damage followed by that kind of fire before.

       I refuted your direct quotes. You tried pretending both towers ("they") took a chunk out of WTC7. You got caught either lying or making an ignorant, uneducated argument. Either way, now you're trying to back pedal away. And the debris from WTC1​ didn't cause the collapse anyway. Making your argument incredibly pointless.

       I debunked your exact quotes and watch you backpedal away from them. You try to bring up irrelevant factors to explain the collapse because even you aren't confident in NIST and their theory.

       What source have you provided? Popular mechanics. And the IQ test that you're to scared to take shows that they (just like you) promote theories that even NIST denounced. My source for debunking you this entire time has been the very same official story you're failing at defending. I don't care what a proven liar thinks about my credibility. In fact, with your track record, I'm glad you don't find me credible. Look at your popular mechanics source. You take that IQ test yet?

       All I've learned is that, if you were convinced of your opinion rationally by facts, you are not capable of relaying that information.  Maybe it's because my IQ is too low to figure out your genius, or maybe you lack the capacity to relay information sensibly.    Or maybe you're wrong, which is what I figured to begin with, but I was willing to listen anyway just in case.

       No. I took your direct quotes and refuted them. You aren't adult enough to admit you were wrong and now you're backpedaling away from them. But it doesn't matter anyway because only fire collapsed the building. Not the debris.

        I pointed out that, even if the fire didn't cause the collapse, the building had suffered other damage.  This means that the "no other building has collapsed this way therefore this hasn't" isn't a reasonable assumption to make.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. NIST says that even without the damage, the building would have collapsed from the fire. Making the damage irrelevant. And there are multiple examples of buildings burning with no global collapse. So those buildings with no debris damage are exactly comparable to WTC7 where the damage did nothing to initiate the collapse.

       Your desperation to get the last word isn't as entertaining as it was an hour ago, so I'm just going to let you have it.  Then you can pretend you won an argument unchallenged.  I'm going to seek out somebody smarter than you, and see if

       That was a proven false claim

      <p>
       The damage in the linked graphic shows minor damage to WTC7's parapet wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't even matter, the alleged damage was asymmetric, confined to the tower's south side, and any weakening of the steelwork from fire exposure would also be asymmetric. Thus, even if the damage were sufficient to cause the whole building to collapse, it would have fallen over asymmetrically, toward the south. But WTC 7 fell straight down into a neat rubble pile.

      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST say fire collapsed this building, not structural damage, for which they have zero evidence for either claim

       Sure.  And now I'm sick to death of it.   I commented because I wasn't happy with the quality of evidence I'd seen, and I'm interested in something that puts forth a credible argument without any red herrings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the towers were demolished on purpose is an outlandish theory.  You either know something the public isn't paying attention to or you're a crazy obsessive, or both. In either case I'm not going to change your mind so there's no point in arguing with you any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean you don't have good evidence hidden away somewhere?  What have you got?

       Yet that is what ALL the evidence points to, but you believe and tried to argue, unsuccessfully i have to add, that for the first and only time in history, three steel framed skyscrapers completely collapsed to the ground because of fires, when the only time in history any building has completely collapsed is due to controlled demolition.

       There aren't any other times where a building of that size suffered that kind of damage.  NIST's report cites the fire as the primary cause of the collapse of WTC7, and cites other fires where main supports weren't damaged in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good evidence might, for example, prove that the main structural components weren't damaged by fire, or were damaged by fire in such a way that could not have been caused by a combination of the fire and impacts.

       Next to being irrelevant, it's also quite incorrect. It's also a vague statement which allows you to backpedal in perpetuity, because after all, no two things are alike, especially damage to a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before one can disprove what you state, we need to first establish what it is that you say. When you say "that kind of damage", it means the superficial damage to 7 perimeter columns.
       <em>
        Not
       </em>
       "an entire corner of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are you really going to make the claim that no building ever sustained that kind of superficial damage that had no impact of the structural integrity of the building?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the WTC bombing in the 90's? What about WTC5? What about the Oklahoma federal building bombing? I'm sure I can find a good deal more if you want, do I need to add that none of these collapsed without being deliberately destroyed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of steel high-rises sustained damage and infernos,
       <strong>
        ONLY
       </strong>
       on 9/11 did this every lead to a collapse. To claim that these are unique circumstances without looking at the actual details of the damage and the fire and instead speak in hyperbole, is quite dishonest and fallacious.

       Have you ever read the metallurgy report describing a chemical attack on the steel? It goes on to conclude that this attack could've been responsible for the building's collapse. This report was done as part of the official investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be honest with you though, I will indeed not change my mind, because the official theory not only violates the laws of physics, but there is evidence which does not fit the official theory. And if I recall my elementary school physics lessons, if the evidence doesn't fit the theory, you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you become familiar with the official reports, it's quite obvious that NIST did the opposite and rejected evidence. Evidence
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       themselves provided, but then ignored, disappeared, or twisted until it fit their theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you don't have to take my word for it, they admit to this very fact in their own report.

       <a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">
        Here's a metallurgy report by FEMA
       </a>
       , which depicts the molten steel. The author of the paper said in a NY Times article that the steel "evaporated". It was labelled the biggest mystery surrounding the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's more about molten steel:
       <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/point-tt-6/">
        http://www.consensus911.org/point-tt-6/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is info about the molten iron microspheres, which was documented by the USGS:
       <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/home/348-previously-molten-iron-spheres-were-in-wtc-dust-reveal-use-of-thermitic-materials.html">
        http://www1.ae911truth.org/home/348-previously-molten-iron-spheres-were-in-wtc-dust-reveal-use-of-thermitic-materials.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting tidbit is that John Gross from NIST said that he was unaware of any molten steel. Yet
       <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Figure-C2.jpg">
        he is pictured with a piece of steel
       </a>
       that shows the same deterioration as the steel in the FEMA document.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also pointed out to him that hotspots in the debris remained for months, and that NASA had the evidence to prove this by means of thermal imaging. This was brought to his attention in a room full of people while he was talking about 9/11. At that point, he asked whether the guy bringing this up could provide this evidence.
When that guy later approached John Gross to exchange information so he could deliver this evidence, he was no longer interested. You can see some of this exchange on youtube
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcqf5tL887o">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcqf5tL887o
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also advise you to watch the following clip, where NIST admits to freefall and tries to explain it.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkp-4sm5Ypc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkp-4sm5Ypc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how you feel about those clips, but I see people doing their best to weasel out of something.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the collapse, debris falling to the side can be seen on video to move faster than the main portion of the building.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For a long time that's all I saw too. If you keep looking, it's obviously not the case. A wave of destruction, which can only be described as the tower exploding apart, races down the face of the buildings. These violent explosions, seemingly every third floor, move at virtually the same rate that the debris on the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following video explains what I'm talking about, though it is not the best quality:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUDoGuLpirc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUDoGuLpirc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The freefall speeds have been admitted, for all three buildings, by the official report. Complete freefall for WTC7, in case of the two towers, NIST used the term "virtually freefall".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nobody on the plane at the time of the crash survived.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course not.
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm">
        But how come 7 of the hijackers turned up alive?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI's response to this was "we are aware of this but, we are sticking to the story". The offical claim is now one of mistaken identity, but this is nothing more than a label they've put up on what is otherwise a fact incompatible with the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you need to ask yourself is why is there no evidence that these hijackers were on the plane? And why is there evidence that they are still alive after the planes hit the buildings?

       No, it doesn't. They explain that the "damage" was caused by a chemical attack, forming a eutectic which lowered the melting point of steel. I quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          The thinning of the steel occurred by a high temperature corrosion due to a combination of oxidation and sulfidation
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Heating of the steel into a hot corrosive environment approaching 1000ºC results in the formation of a eutectic mixture or iron, oxygen, and sulfur
          <strong>
           that liquefied the steel
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The sulfidation attack of the steel grain boundaries accelerated the corrosion and erosion of the steel.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can see the pictures can't you? Don't find it a bit dishonest to describe what you see there as softened steel? It's completely gone, in the words of the author, EVAPORATED. There is no explanation for something like this in an office fire.

       And what does that redaction actually say? Absolutely nothing. I swear, reactions like yours are so infuriating, someone says "we have an excuse!", and you parrot it like there is any merit to it. There is ZERO substance in that redaction, which is not even a redaction, it's an addendum. That says exactly what I've said, that the FBI knew about these "mistaken identities", but that they were sticking to the story. That "redaction" is a middle finger to any one asking critical questions, it's the equivalent of going "we know, but what are you going to do about it?". And this is enough for you to come here and repeat it as if it has any merit at all? Where is the substance? What is the actual explanation they give for these mistaken identities? I haven't seen it, have you? Simply making the claim that there is an explanation is not an explanation my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you ask yourself why the BBC updated their story to say "a man CALLED .." when the whole issue is that these people were named AND pictured.  It isn't simply about a guy with a similar names, these people saw their pictures on TV and then went to the police telling them obvious. The BBC knows this, so why are they misrepresenting the situation?

      <p>
       One? Seven guys turn up alive, out of 19. Seven guys survive a plane crashing into a building, and that doesn't raise any concerns with you? Don't you think it's odd that we were told that there was evidence that these people were on the plane, ID's, religious books, plans, even DNA, yet when they show up at a police station to say they are still alive, the best the FBI can do to explain this situation is a sincere "oh, oops, no idea how that happened". Maybe you are happy with that explanation, I certainly am not.
The only thing you can conclude from this situation is that the claim that these people were on the plane is a lie and the so called evidence for them attending the event either fabricated or completely made up.

       Does that really need explaining how that supports the notion of a conspiracy?

       "Dishonest" is for debate tactics.  Yes, my point is not terribly precise, but my intent was to communicate that your sources do not seem to match your interpretation of the evidence.  This continues to be true despite your elaboration, which does not address my core concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as though you've interpreted "attack" to mean a deliberate chemical attack when it's unlikely that this was the intent within the publication.  Rather, they were referring to the chemical reaction, in the way that oxygen attacks iron.

      <p>
       My argument was that there was molten steel and iron, among other things. The report quite clearly states that. I provided evidence by means of the report
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       supporting evidence, and I corrected your false claims once before about what it actually said. And now you're back with a few weak attempts at semantic confusion, with a nice "as far as I can tell" disclaimer that absolves you of any wrongdoing down the line. I'm not going to play that game however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admit that you were wrong or that you don't know, but don't try and twist your own inabilities and project them onto me when I've provided the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to dignify your claims about how I presented the word "attack" with a response, I insinuated nothing, I simply quoted the report, which uses the word 8 times.

       What is it with people defending the official story and reading comprehension? The fact is that "they were seen", these people saw their

        own

       name and picture listed, along with their occupation, their location and their date of birth, and then went to the authorities for an explanation. Trying to brush this aside as some figment of someone's imagination is again, quite dishonest.

       There's a critical difference between something dissolving chemically and something melting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one produces byproducts like iron oxide, and the second one would just produce steel but in a different shape.

       It's important not to conflate the two because

       I feel as though the term "shill" is too kind. These are traitors, directly acting against the best interest of Americans and humans, in general. Either they are mind control slaves or the most morally destitute murder aids imaginable. There must be a better name?

       Abandon ship. Let the shills and shill bots talk to each other. Let them own the social media platforms.

       Go back to the real world and organize your friends and neighbors. Look them in the eye and change their minds.

       The revolution will not be online. Use the tools, encrypted email, VPNs, etc to communicate with your comrades about the things you are going to do in the real world, instead of bitching about this fake, empty, vapid cyberworld which is quickly becoming another "Free Speech Zone."

       I became a "truther" because someone on the street handed me a DVD which a laughed about in the moment. Then I watched the DVD, out of curiosity, and I realized that what I had thought was real, wasn't, because I hadn't been using my critical thinking up and until that point.

       I think this is a key point. The future is in small community collaboration. When the powers at be control the narrative in all forms of media, you'll eventually have to stumble outside, blink in the sunlight, then realize you don't even know what your neighbors looks like and set about convincing them instead of anonymous strangers.

       Yup.  It's gotten too big and too top heavy.  When that happens you lose responsiveness and agility.  Almost a breakaway civilization in an unintentional way.  And I don't think it's just institutions or egos that have gotten too big, I think "expectations" at the top have become incredibly distorted.  Expectations are based on thinking done in the
       <em>
        past
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these people are literally detached from the
       <em>
        present
       </em>
       reality because they're living in the past.  "I was important/rich/whatever yesterday, I expect to be important/rich/whatever tomorrow."  Regardless of what actually transpired that day.

       This is an excellent point to keep in mind. The people who have woken up to the information need to try to spread it face to face with those they know so that it doesn't get hidden down voted or deleted.

       How am I hurting my cause? My cause is truth. I desperately want to figure out what the truth is and what I've come to find is that there are many people trying to deter myself and others from figuring out just what is actually going on in this world. So I'm posting to the roadblocks and detours on the road to the truth.

       Calling people shills is getting us no where with finding the truths of the world. It turns people away and further distances us from the general population. I type essentially the same comment everytime I see one of these posts because I also want the truth, but dividing people with shill talk is counterproductive.

       I believe most of the shit the governments of the world to tell us to be a lie. But to be perfectly honest, I would be willing to be a shill. I hate them but if we're talking about getting paid to do it.. I probably would.

       I'll acknowledge that Clinton was involved in stupid shit, yes. 
But I don't think it would be like this. we' ll never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never believed the swamp would be truly drained, but I'd hoped, and tried to latch onto the positive points trump does make. He just keeps saying and doing crazy shit that defies logic and morality both, and many still bitch about some has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather a crook that TRIES to do some good, even if it's to distract than the admitted one with lawyers at the ready for every decision skirting anything possible and paying off everyone when they fuck up and get caught. He's super excited for the rules to not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel about trump like I felt about the Iraq war, and it's always striking to me when I see the MSM being BLamed for the entire thing. (the same fake news and lying agencies that tell us Clinton is a crook, btw) 
It's a huge mistake, a big league one, IMO.

       The real tragedy is the fact that more people hated either major canadite enough that a strong 3rd party could've taken the popular vote, but even In Those ranks things were wonky.

       Trump is a conman. He conned people with lies. Everything out of his mouth is a lie. But if you look at what he's done, who he's appointed, what the republicans are planning, you know we're in for some really bad shit. Get a AK or AR15 and learn to use it cause we've really got some bad days coming.

       Exactly the thing here to me is that it's not Republican vs Democrat as much as it is establishment vs everybody else. They push candidates on both parties to ensure they win no matter what. Trump, we know by how obviously they were trying to keep him out of the oval office, doesn't seem to be one of their picks. I don't trust him and I don't like him, but Hillary Clinton IMO has done worse shit than him. At least so far, but we will have to wait and see what happens.

       Well, the republicans (and Russians) bought and organized a lot of shills and sockpuppets so not troubled if Hillary got some to try to counteract the shills against her. Turn about is fair play. But clearly she didn't understand social media and how many shills she needed to counteract the Trump shills so was unable to counter them.

       Imo, the most effective way to combat opposition in situations as such is to literally ignore them. If their intent is to tire/stress you out to the point where you either give up the search for truth or start questioning your own sanity, they aren't going to be the kind of consciousness that is open to honest suggestions. Those of us who are awake should ignore these foes. Just as life does when it no longer receives sustenance, shills will die when they're no longer recognized.

       You're wrong. These people are paid, paid to post, or comment and the upvotes are often paid for too. They won't stop until the paying stops. But you think this is bad, wait till after the 20th when the government shills take their orders from Trump and the republicans.

       What? I didn't reference anything re. being paid or the incentive that drives their actions. No matter what their incentive be, if you ignore the actual action, or their literal existence, they will die away. Maybe they keep coming back literally, but if they're never acknowledged, no person whose unaware of what a shill is will take them nearly as seriously. If you show them attention and argue with them, you're giving them your energy. So others who observe might assume that's necessary, and they too might give their energy to the negativity/shills. Ignore what you know isn't true and others will follow the lead, allowing the truth to shine through and draw all the focus.

       Spreading misinformation is litterally what this subreddit is. Some of it has been proven true, yes, but theories like pizzagate have little to no evidence for it and incited violence and hurt Comet Pizza. Stop with this projection and look at yourselves once in a while. Also, why do you keep calling us shills? Do you know what that even means?

       I have, don't really see the purpose of telling me to look at it. Why not answer my other questions and thoughts as well? Even you have to admit that not all of the conspiracies are correct, try looking at things at a false until proven correct mindset.

       There is a huge difference between being a shill and questioning a conspiracy claim. If I I want sources or additional information, it's because I want to research a claim myself. Not all of us have to believe in every conspiracy theory out there to participate in the thread.

       The damage in the linked graphic shows minor damage to WTC7's parapet wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't even matter, the alleged damage was asymmetric, confined to the tower's south side, and any weakening of the steelwork from fire exposure would also be asymmetric. Thus, even if the damage were sufficient to cause the whole building to collapse, it would have fallen over asymmetrically, toward the south. But WTC 7 fell straight down into a neat rubble pile.

       I did ask whether you had read the metallurgy report which described a chemical attack on the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ignored it.

       Indeed, being dishonest is a debate tactic for when facts are not on your side.

       <p>
        What I was telling you was that the report doesn't support your argument.

      <p>
       My argument was that there was molten steel and iron, among other things. The report quite clearly states that. I provided evidence by means of the report
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       supporting evidence, and I corrected your false claims once before about what it actually said. And now you're back with a few weak attempts at semantic confusion, with a nice "as far as I can tell" disclaimer that absolves you of any wrongdoing down the line. I'm not going to play that game however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admit that you were wrong or that you don't know, but don't try and twist your own inabilities and project them onto me when I've provided the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to dignify your claims about how I presented the word "attack" with a response, I insinuated nothing, I simply quoted the report, which uses the word 8 times.

       Where does it say that?

        Like you said, they got DNA and ID's and religious books, how did the people themselves escape?

      <p>
       Are you asking me how these people escaped a hijacked plane?

       <p>
        I would expect people had seen them since, even if they were dead.

      <p>
       What is it with people defending the official story and reading comprehension? The fact is that "they were seen", these people saw their
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       name and picture listed, along with their occupation, their location and their date of birth, and then went to the authorities for an explanation. Trying to brush this aside as some figment of someone's imagination is again, quite dishonest.
