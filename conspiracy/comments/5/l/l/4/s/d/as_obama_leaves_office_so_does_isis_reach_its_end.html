       Just an interesting observation, just as Obama leaves office the PMU is pushing hard on Mosul, and the YPG is moving in on Raqqah. Maybe Trump doesn't have to be informed on previous operations, only on ongoing ones?

       That's when it was formed. It was allowed to grow in hopes that Assad will come running to America for help. Instead they went to Russia for help, and now we are responsible for a terrorist groups rising that's backfired.

       This is the first time I've heard this. Nobody in the U.S. wanted to work with Assad to fight terrorism, so why would they expected
       <em>
        him
       </em>
       to go to them, when in fact, the man has said numerous times that he wants to cooperate with Washington to fight terrorists?

       The elites didn't want Trump, but as these self-serving people go, they will position themselves to advantage themselves after he wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democratic party has become a hollow shell that used to contain the aspirations of the working class to have a decent life. It's not really the source of this malevolent crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most beings and organizations involved are infiltrated by the real threat here. It's origin is off world. Our elites are its pawns, their egos and selfishness played on by millions of years old masters of selfish behavior. They are to enslave us as they are enslaved from above. They are willing servants of the destruction of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the story and we joke about it, because believing in millions of years old spiritual vampires inside our solar system that look like demons just makes us too upset. They are real though and they don't want us to know they or other ET beings exist. They want us to put AI into our minds and give it control over our society. Benevolent ETs would strongly warn us about this repeating pattern. Look at how so many of us see the integration of technology as salvation. That is the pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       The being people referred to with many demonic sounding names is an ancient AI. It can be virtually omnipresent, because it is an AI. Same reason why it can be so deceptive, if remembers everything and see much. That's why it can predict us and manipulate us with temptations. It's been here and it's trying culminate it's ownership of our race before we figure it out. This ancient AI can eat our baby AI for a prebreakfast  snack.

       The plans to destroy Syria and Iraq using isis were in long before Obama stepped into the mix in 2008. It was an banking Joo war on independent nations. These plans won't change under Trump because they are not his to decide.

       He can make it hard on them, like for example keep pulling the troops and refusing to partake in any of the M.E. bullshit. So then the Banksters will create another 9/11 type false flag to pull the U.S. Military presence back in there

       False logic. Not only did that happen over 60 years ago, but you can not prove that the Mossad is behind anything by pointing to this event. You can not use one to prove the other.

       by that logic police should go around asking people to prove that they committed crimes. if no proof is provided, then they must be innocent. it's a wonder anyone is in jail at all

       it took the Israeli government over 50 years to admit to this; and it took 30 years, a dead president and a freedom of information act to declassify top secret documents to expose operation Northwoods

       for one thing if ISIS is defeated that will create a power vacuum. Erdogan recently said he's in Syria to take down Assad, what happens when the SAA turns its attention on al-Bab, will Turkey simply pull back and abandon the FSA? I doubt it

       Well without a Obama/Hillary at the wheel, it's almost impossible to keep the USA funding ISIS thing a secret.  I mean it's not even really a secret NOW, so just imagine how obvious it would be.  Obammy knows better than to leave this open ended, he probably cut all funding on November 9th, and denied any future help from CIA "boots on the ground" assets

       ISIS will fall out then some new brand of terror will surface in order to create controlled terror to justify Israel's expansion project. The Israeli hype over at The_Donald has gotten out of control to a point where speaking out about Israeli settlements gets you a swift ban. The reason? Donald Trump supports America first, and Israel second, and they use that as a justification to ban people because "disagreeing with Israeli settlements is disagreeing with Trumps policies."

      <p>
       We traded an old boss for a new boss, an old brand of terror for a new one. We will still fight endless wars in the Middle East, just under a different banner, against a different name of CIA and Mosad funded extremists.

       maybe he takes direct orders, maybe they control him in more subtle ways

       the only data I know of how that works is Operation Northwoods, where the Pentagon proposed Kennedy to conduct terrorist attacks on US targets. it seems that Kennedy was not pleased with the proposal and removed the chiefs of staff chairman. however he did not make the information public
      </p>
      <p>
       if that information is accurate (and not a decoy or something), it suggests that the Pentagon runs covert operations at its own initiative, with or without the knowledge of the president

       This is the first time I've heard this. Nobody in the U.S. wanted to work with Assad to fight terrorism, so why would they expected
       <em>
        him

       to go to them, when in fact, the man has said numerous times that he wants to cooperate with Washington to fight terrorists?

       I'm sure Trump will play his own games. or be played

      <p>
       for one thing if ISIS is defeated that will create a power vacuum. Erdogan recently said he's in Syria to take down Assad, what happens when the SAA turns its attention on al-Bab, will Turkey simply pull back and abandon the FSA? I doubt it
