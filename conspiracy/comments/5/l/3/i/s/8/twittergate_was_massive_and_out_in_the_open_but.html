    <div class="md"><p>Even when it was going down there was only one news article I could find on the whole shit show. @Eclipse_OW (Molly) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5e4w3h/im_eclipse_ow_the_person_behind_the_massive/">tried to get an AMA</a> rolling with less than stellar results. If you go to that link you can find her reddit account name and probably PM her to make sure she isn&#39;t a secret faker. Failing that google specifically @Eclipse_OW and the first result is a link to the entire database she collected. There is also an archive.is of the file.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely 100% covered up by MSM.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching it unfold on Twitter. I saw it only because I was hitting refresh on the Pizzagate hashtag. I saw the guy&#39;s account, @0hour, with my own eyes, Tweeting out account after account with CP. I would not take screen shots of that stuff because in some of them you could literally see the thumbnails of CP. I clicked off of his account to go write a Tweet and by the time I finished, his account had been blocked. Here is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5e2wev/huge_cache_of_pedophile_accounts_discovered_on/">the post</a> I made at T_D when it was happening so you know I&#39;m not making up my story. I don&#39;t have screen shots of the @0hour account, sorry, but I have no reason to make this up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question and I&#39;ve wondered about the same thing.  Also, WTF has happened to @Eclipse_OW(Molly)?  I was here as this was unfolding and it&#39;s shocking how it&#39;s been glossed over like nothing happened.  I think the next reveal will be how Youtube has the same thing going on.  The thing is, the softcore stuff is public and I&#39;d imagine you have to become friends within the right circles to see the Private more hardcore videos.  I keep waiting for an anon on one of the chans to do some investigating but so far nothing.  I for one can&#39;t risk myself doing this type of investigation currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alledgedly some user found CP on Twitter then used a bot to find out which accounts where related. It was a big thing on Reddit becuase many Reddit users went to check the accounts and appearantly there was hardcore CP on Twitter and linked. I was not online at the time but supposedly many Redditors where in distress about what they saw.</p>

<p>Now again, I dont want to see CP, not even slighlty censored. But if many people did see it, then there must be screengrabs that are heavily censored?</p>
