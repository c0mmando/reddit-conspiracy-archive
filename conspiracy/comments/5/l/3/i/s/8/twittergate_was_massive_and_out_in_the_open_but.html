       Ive asked and searched for
       <strong>
        heavily censored
       </strong>
       evidence of Twittergate. With this many accounts and people watching it live there must be screenshots and such?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not being dismissive, just asking for the most plain form of evidence as all I have seen is comments from people saying that it happened.

       Even when it was going down there was only one news article I could find on the whole shit show. @Eclipse_OW (Molly)
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5e4w3h/im_eclipse_ow_the_person_behind_the_massive/">
        tried to get an AMA
       </a>
       rolling with less than stellar results. If you go to that link you can find her reddit account name and probably PM her to make sure she isn't a secret faker. Failing that google specifically @Eclipse_OW and the first result is a link to the entire database she collected. There is also an archive.is of the file.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely 100% covered up by MSM.

       I was watching it unfold on Twitter. I saw it only because I was hitting refresh on the Pizzagate hashtag. I saw the guy's account, @0hour, with my own eyes, Tweeting out account after account with CP. I would not take screen shots of that stuff because in some of them you could literally see the thumbnails of CP. I clicked off of his account to go write a Tweet and by the time I finished, his account had been blocked. Here is
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5e2wev/huge_cache_of_pedophile_accounts_discovered_on/">
        the post
       </a>
       I made at T_D when it was happening so you know I'm not making up my story. I don't have screen shots of the @0hour account, sorry, but I have no reason to make this up.

       This is a great question and I've wondered about the same thing.  Also, WTF has happened to @Eclipse_OW(Molly)?  I was here as this was unfolding and it's shocking how it's been glossed over like nothing happened.  I think the next reveal will be how Youtube has the same thing going on.  The thing is, the softcore stuff is public and I'd imagine you have to become friends within the right circles to see the Private more hardcore videos.  I keep waiting for an anon on one of the chans to do some investigating but so far nothing.  I for one can't risk myself doing this type of investigation currently.

       Alledgedly some user found CP on Twitter then used a bot to find out which accounts where related. It was a big thing on Reddit becuase many Reddit users went to check the accounts and appearantly there was hardcore CP on Twitter and linked. I was not online at the time but supposedly many Redditors where in distress about what they saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now again, I dont want to see CP, not even slighlty censored. But if many people did see it, then there must be screengrabs that are heavily censored?
