        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Hoping this post will gain traction but undoubtedly it will come under fire.. I will do my best to be as factual as possible but also will bring in some scripture. I am personally not religious, but I find it asinine to disregard old texts as complete nonsense or rubbish.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Let me pre-face with the reason I think everything is getting &quot;wacky,&quot; - </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. Climate scientists will tell you that our water levels are causing this to happen.. but this is actually a debated topic and not proven.. essentially a &quot;theory.&quot; This is just a theory of mine, so bash it all you will but take in some of the rest of this information seriously and take note because this isn&#39;t a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just start with December seen as we are still in it.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I am going to do November and December.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally. Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening. </p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is. </p>

<p>STILL WITH ME? That was just November! Apologies for the formatting but this is a pigs ear to write.</p>

<p>Let me just drop in a few scripture statements that are interesting..</p>

<p>“Disasters will soon spread from nation to nation. They will come like a powerful storm to all the faraway places on earth… The DESTROYER will come against every town, not one town will escape… The Lord said this will happen.”
Jeremiah 25:32 &amp; 48:8.</p>

<p>Below is from Kolbrin bible;</p>

<p>Manuscripts 3:3
When ages pass, certain laws operate upon the stars in the Heavens. Their ways change; there is movement and restlessness, they are no longer constant and a great light appears redly in the skies.</p>

<p>(I keep pointing how intense and red sunsets are at the moment in places that normally do not experience those types of sunsets)</p>

<p>Manuscripts 3:6
The people will scatter in madness. They will hear the trumpet and battle-cry of the DESTROYER and will seek refuge within dens in the Earth. Terror will eat away their hearts, and their courage will flow from them like water from a broken pitcher. They will be eaten up in the flames of wrath and consumed by the breath of the DESTROYER.</p>

<p>Manuscripts 3:1
Men forget the days of the Destroyer. Only the wise know where it went and that it will return in its appointed hour</p>

<p>Gleanings 4:1
... EARTH WAS DESTROYED TWICE, ONCE ALTOGETHER BY FIRE AND ONCE PARTIALLY BY WATER. THE DESTRUCTION BY WATER WAS THE LESSER DESTRUCTION AND CAME ABOUT IN THIS MANNER.
Gleanings 4:13
... Their God sent down a curse upon the men of the cities, AND THERE CAME A STRANGE LIGHT AND A SMOKY MIST which caught at the throats of men ...
Gleanings 4:16
... THE SHADOW OF DOOM APPROACHES ... THE HOUR OF DOOM IS AT HAND ...
Gleanings 4:17
… Therefore a great ship was laid down under the leadership of Hanok, son of Hogaretur, for Sisuda, king of Sarapesh, from whose treasury came payment for the building of the vessel.
Gleanings 4:18
... The length of the great ship was three hundred cubits and its breadth was fifty cubits, and it was finished off above by one cubit. It had three storeys, which were built without a break.
Gleanings 4:19
... Each storey was divided in twain, so that there were six floors below and one above, and they were divided across with seven partitions ... GREAT STONES WERE HUNG FROM ROPES ...
Gleanings 4:20
... they carried the seed of all living things; grain was laid up in baskets and many cattle and sheep were slain for meat ... and ... Also gold and silver, metals and stones ...
Gleanings 4:21
… people of the plains ... mocked the builders of the great ship; ...
Gleanings 4:22
... they who were to go with the great ship departed ... the people entered the great ship and closed the hatch, making it secure …
Gleanings 4:23
The king had entered and with him those of his blood, in all fourteen ...
Gleanings 4:24
… riding on a great black rolling cloud came the DESTROYER ... THE BEAST WITH HER OPENED ITS MOUTH AND BELCHED FORTH FIRE AND HOT STONES AND A VILE SMOKE ... [Again, this implies that two celestial objects are viewed from the surface of the Earth during the fly-by.] ...</p>

<p>Take all that as you will.. but I do find it interesting nonetheless.. especially the whole blood-red moon end times theory and we&#39;ve had at least 4 this year? More than usual and its been pretty abnormal.</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do.. but;</p>

<p>There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes  of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a  6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days.</p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere. does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of?????</p>

<p>as a caveat to the brown dwarf statement.. we are constantly moving through space so its possible we&#39;ve just entered a fuck off massive helium cloud (our entire solar system) through no means of anything nibiru, end times, or whatever related.</p>

<p>READY?</p>

<p>Bonus video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0</a></p>

<p>Watch with a 2016 view on &quot;climate change,&quot; and it will completely open your eyes. </p>

<p>Sorry about the formatting etc, it was a long post.</p>

<p>Antarctica? So.. what is going on!</p>

<p>Quick history;</p>

<p>Nazis set up bases in Antarctica (Newscheubenland) as early as 1939 (supposedly)</p>

<p>U.S. + Allies launch an expedition in 1947 &quot;Operation Highjump,&quot; reportedly for a period of 6 months for &quot;research pursposes.&quot;</p>

<p>This expedition comes to a close less than 50% of the way through. its natural course? why? According to Richard E Byrd himself;</p>

<p>&quot;It is necessary for the USA to take defensive action against ENEMY AIR FIGHTERS which come from the polar region,&quot; and in case of a new war the USA would be &quot;attacked by fighters that are able to fly from one pole to another WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED.&quot;</p>

<p>Now.. I work in Aviation and I am aware that nothing could achieve what Mr.Byrd is discussing there in 1947 unless it was of a higher technology than was possible at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2016...........</p>

<p>Who is the head of Antarctica &quot;logistics.&quot; ? ? </p>

<p>Lockheed Martin - Watch this ; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA3HV_gfq80">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA3HV_gfq80</a></p>

<p>Ex Lockheed Martin Engineer discussing Anti-Gravity etc.. (plus extra terrestrials!)</p>

<p>Take from that what you will but I never disregard information from someone who has worked inside an industry that we only so much as get a smidgeon of information from.</p>

<p>2016;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2002.htm">http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2002.htm</a>;</p>

<p>Head of Russian Orthodox Church meets with Head of Catholic Church for first time in &quot;1000 years.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly after this meeting, Kirill (Head of Orthodox Church) goes to Antarctica and acts quite.. strangely. Performing a ritual and saying that Antarctica is the perfect &quot;example of ideal humankind.&quot; He could just mean the fact that there is no &quot;military,&quot; there or guns etc. but..... we are r/conspiracy so we don&#39;t believe that kinda shit do we?</p>

<p>what else happened in 2016.. OH.. John Kerry! Mr Kerry visited Antarctica during the NIGHT of the results for the 2016 Presidential Debate. Why would the Secretary of STATE visit a country with... no STATE? During such a crucial time?</p>

<p>It was balked off as &quot;climate change,&quot; but it is common knowledge that Antarctica is the most remote location on Earth.. which provides great Cosmic viewing as well as the probably the most secret place on Earth.</p>

<p>Buzz Aldrin also recently visited Antarctica and his OFFICIAL (confirmed) tweet stated that he was &quot;going to the Launchpad.&quot;</p>

<p>What??? What Launchpad? Why caps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People bash YouTube.. and I totally understand why when you look at 99.5% of the thumbnails which are like &quot;THE EARTH IS GOING TO EXPLODE.. JUNE 2017!!!&quot; it just.. kind of invalidates anything I ever try to convey. But.. there are a few hidden gems on YouTube which pump out regular quality content who reference things that you can&#39;t really argue with. To play devils advocate (and help my own sanity) the moon IS very close to the earth at the moment which could help explain that. But.. I have noticed the sun seems almost WHITE hot at the moment rather than the yellow that I can remember? I also struggle to look at it and remember as a kid I could see the &quot;disc&quot; shape of the sun if I looked long enough (surprised i&#39;m not blind).</p>

<p>Interesting thing about the moon..;</p>

<p>Vasin-Shcherbakov Theory, is a theory that claims the Earth‘s moon may actually be an alien spacecraft. The theory was put forth by two members of the then Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, in a July 1970 article entitled “Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence?”.   Vasin and Shcherbakov’s thesis was that the Moon is a hollowed-out planetoid created by unknown beings with technology far superior to any on Earth. &quot;</p>

<p>how did they come to this conclusion? Well.. our moon is the 5th largest moon in our solar system, roughly the same size of Pluto. Based on our understanding of the other planets in our solar system.. the size of our moon in conjunction with our earth makes it almost impossible that it is a natural satellite due to the sheer size of it and the incapability of the Earth to hold it naturally in orbit.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also it orbits at the circle that contains the same volume as the square if you square the circle of earth.  Pretty coincidental...and then you have </p>

<p>Moon radius = 1080 miles = 216x5 = 360x3=6x6x6x5
Sun radius = 432,000 miles = 216x2000 = 360x1200=6x6x6x2x10x10x10
Earth radius = 3963 miles = (approximately) 360x11 = 6x6x5x2x11
Orbital velocity of Moon = 2286 miles/hour

<p>I didn&#39;t know alot of that, it&#39;s a shame it can&#39;t be translated too well over Reddit. I recommend checking out ULO&#39;s &quot;Unidentified Lunar Objects,&quot; for a bit more stuff to read on the moon. Many strange geometric shapes etc on the moon that don&#39;t make sense being there from a natural cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently i&#39;m over 4,000 characters..so SECOND UPDATE.</p>

<p>I urge you to read the first Executive Order (For Extreme Space Weather) which I have referenced. It is not particularly long, but the wording suggests it is some really serious shit. The Obama Administration released this Order rapidly, and without warning.</p>

<p>Which leads me to ANOTHER Order which was issued recently...</p>

<p>&quot;SAFEGUARDING THE NATION FROM THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES.&quot;</p>

<p>Now.. I understand Flora/Animals etc can pose a threat to a nation in terms of habitat destruction, and affecting other species.. but..</p>

<p>&quot;Federal agencies shall consider the impacts of climate change when working on issues relevant to the prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species, including in research and monitoring efforts, and integrate invasive species into Federal climate change coordinating frameworks and initiatives..&quot;</p>

<p>The. &quot;National Invasive Species Council,&quot; consists of;</p>

<p>(i) Secretary of State;</p>

<p>(ii) Secretary of the Treasury;</p>

<p>(iii) Secretary of Defense;</p>

<p>(iv) Secretary of the Interior;</p>

<p>(v) Secretary of Agriculture;</p>

<p>(vi) Secretary of Commerce;</p>

<p>(vii) Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>

<p>(viii) Secretary of Transportation;</p>

<p>(ix) Secretary of Homeland Security;</p>

<p>(x) Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</p>

<p>(xi) Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;</p>

<p>(xii) Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development;</p>

<p>(xiii) United States Trade Representative;</p>

<p>(xiv) Director or Chair of the following components of the Executive Office of the President: the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Office of Management and Budget; and</p>

<p>(xv) Officials from such other departments, agencies, offices, or entities as the agencies set forth above, by consensus, deem appropriate..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the policy of the United States to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species, as well as to eradicate and control populations of invasive species that are established. Invasive species pose threats to prosperity, security, and quality of life. They have negative impacts on the environment and natural resources, agriculture and food production systems, water resources, human, animal, and plant health, infrastructure, the economy, energy, cultural resources, and military readiness.&quot;</p>

<p>Key word here.. ECONOMY? and MILITARY READINESS?</p>

<p>Now i&#39;m not suggesting this is suggestive of an alien invasion.. but the wording is most certainly interesting as I don&#39;t know many flora/animals/species that would have any impact on the U.S. Military and its &quot;readiness.&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. MORE Flash-Floods today in the Congo. 10,000 now homeless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statistics on earthquakes may be faulty. If you are comparing the &#39;average amount of earthquakes of magnitude X a day&#39; to &#39;the average amount of earthquakes of magnitude X a day of the previous 9 days&#39; then we need to know over what time span is the first average taken. For example, if the first average is over a 1 year or 5 year period then you could have 9 really active days followed by 9 relatively inactive days which if you then took the average over those 18 days you might get an answer closer to the first average. In other words, you must be careful when comparing &#39;averages&#39; of different time spans.</p>
