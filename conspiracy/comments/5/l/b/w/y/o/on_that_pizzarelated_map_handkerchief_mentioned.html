       Here's the thing. JP left the house the Friday before Labor Day and this email from the realtor Tate happens on Tuesday! How is his handkerchief still there on the kitchen counter not found by the hosts, the Sandlers, but found by the realtor, Tate, instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I got an email from someone that was risky or sent without thinking about how dangerous it would be if compliance got a hold of it, I'd answer like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh no worries, just forget about it." in the email.... but then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd CALL the person on their CELL and give them the real story bc we didn't want a paper trail and most likely the call wouldn't be recorded and we could say hey, wtf are you doing putting that in an email you dumb ass?!?!?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably what happened here. If it's that important to have a "pizza related map on a handkerchief" in the first place and then for people who had just toured various properties the day before and talked about then it must be something important and wanted back by Podesta.... He's just being coy in his email since his assistants read them and he doesn't want to raise a red flag by being overly concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why the hell would Susan Sandler, who's parents are billionaires who made their fortune in the mortgage meltdown and her parents were what Time magazine calls people who are "25 People to Blame for the Financial Meltdown", not have the realtor just email JP directly? People like the Sandlers just delegate that kind of unimportant message to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT no. Susan makes it a point to spell out exactly what the handkerchief is. And what is it and why did Podesta leave it? And why didn't he want it back along with his "pillows" (which is slang for pills and/or weed)?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not insignificant. It is really important to Podesta bc he does respond and he does so in a really short and controlled way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget how important the Sandlers are to the fundraising and support of the clinton Campaign. Susan's parents foundation donated over $4,000,000 to Clinton! Her mother, Marion, died in 2012. And Susan is a big part of making the decisions of the Sandler Foundation so she's a really important person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta says:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mine, but not worth worrying about.
No "Thank you so much Susan." or "That's very thoughtful of you and of course I had a wonderful time. yada yada yada."
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, none of that rich people small talk. And he definitely wouldn't be so curt to Susan Sandler unless he was really nervous about that "pizza related map" bc Susan is a huge funder of HRC and she took the time to email JP about something so dumb and unimportant to us knukcle-dragging, deplorables as handkerchiefs and pillows.. btw who the fuck buys their own pillows at a rental house and then leaves them behind????
      </p>
      <p>
       I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.
      </p>
      <p>
       said the Realtor in her original email to Susan. WTF? Pillows purchased for rental houses that they just looked at the day before and she can't find them? They're on the fucking BED!!! That's where normal fucking people keep their pillows. But no they're not actually "pillows" they are DRUGS!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that no one has asked about it bc Podesta called Sandler right after he sent that email and told her to fedex it and the "pillows" to him asap.

       his response is extremely damning to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's mine, but not worth worrying about."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm putting myself in that situation and thinking if I left a pair of socks at a friend's house.. they call and say "hey you left your socks here." My response would be something like "haha just toss em," or "ok I'll get em next time I see you." Socks/handkerchiefs are hardly expensive things, most people have tons. If someone bothers to let you know that they have something that belongs to you, no matter how trivial, you give them direction on what to do with it. You don't just say "it's mine."
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to the fact he says "not worth worrying about".. uhh who worries about things like a lost sock or handkerchief? Only a person who realizes the significance of what they found and its definitely not just a plain old handkerchief.

       I made a comment in one of the threads here in this sub but I think no one saw it as it may have gotten lost among other comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I want to excuse the age of this account due to the fact that I want to protect my regular account. I don't want my regular account to be known for its associations to other subs so I created this account for conspiracy stuff only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, my theory behind why the "pizza mapped handkerchief" is so "important" is because it could be related to the DNA on the handkerchief. JP may have used it to clean up the "love stains", which created a "map of the DNA", linking it to "pizza". Maybe the person who emailed JP, felt it was important he knows there was a handkerchief and wanted to know what to do with it; mail it to him or dispose it properly. Maybe JP knew what was on it and didn't think there would be sufficient evidence to hold up in court or he probably subtly told the person to dispose it properly so it won't be traceable back to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.
