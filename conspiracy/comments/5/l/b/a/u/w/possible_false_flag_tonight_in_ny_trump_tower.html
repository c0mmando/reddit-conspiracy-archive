       Just hit me like a ton of bricks....
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Military-Helicopters-Plane-Midtown-Manhattan-Training-Drill-Evacuate-President-Elect-Donald-Trump-407846885.html?amp=y">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So weve already had a drill for evacuating Trump from Manhattan...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-evacuating-trump-tower-over-suspicious-package/2016/12/27/af832888-cc80-11e6-85cd-e66532e35a44_story.html">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-evacuating-trump-tower-over-suspicious-package/2016/12/27/af832888-cc80-11e6-85cd-e66532e35a44_story.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then just this the other day...
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who wasnt aware, current UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon will be dropping the ball to kick off the New Year. Coincidentally, his term as Sec General ends exactly at midnight. This may be nothing, but if there was an oppurtunity for a massive false flag event before Trump official takes office (other than his inaugeration), this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drills evacuating Trump and the towers so close to one another? Head of the UN dropping the ball? Could an assination attempt be in play here? Or another Boston marathon type incident but on a larger scale? Any excuse to institute marshall law, which IMO means civil war. The American people have been programmed now to the point where they absolutely will not accept anymore abuse of power by Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure about anyone else, but I dont necessarily see TPTB as one giant team who all get along. I think there are many sides...some with malicious intent, others genuine. For all we know, theyre all secretly controlled by an even higher power and themselves dont even know whats going on (think Kaiser Soze/Usual suspects...Soros, Rothschilds etc may be absolute nobodies in the grand scheme of all this).

       Sure, it's possible some actually secret higher power is controlling all sides or playing them against each other, but most conspiracies and conspiracy theories that don't have sci-fi elements can be explained by "normal" dirty politics.

       Would you. Could you. In the dark? (Remember that creepy as fuck emergency broadcast?)
      </p>
      <p>
       That along with a report that "Russian" malware was found on a grid employees computer and now they are trying to say "Russia" is trying to hack the power grid, is not sitting very well with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly hope nothing happens, but imagine the chaos if the power goes out at midnight. If I was an evil elite, that would be one hell of a false flag to kick off martial law and war with Russia... Everyone is watching in anticipation then when the clock strikes 12.... darkness across the country....

       I also hope nothing happens, but when I first heard about that creepy emergency broadcast, my first thought was new years eve. When its dark and everyone's focus is on the countdown and the fireworks, would anyone immediately realise  sometthing was happening amonst all the noise of the fireworks and the celebrations?

       I'm surprised nobody has lobbied for it to be taken down, then again, it's mostly tourists in Times Square.  Native NYC residents won't be there for the ball drop, for the most part.

       Its unlikely.  Trump has already swung on pretty much everything he said before making him the perfect candidate for them.  Now if this whole thing was aimed at something like gun control then that is much more likely of a scenario.

       The Khazarian Mafia. They clearly selected Trump to win because the Masons (Hillary, Obama and co.) were getting too greedy. Obama abstaining from the UN vote was a message back to the Khazars that the Masons aren't going to take it. We might witness a war of two Demon cults. It might be good for the common-man though, their alliance was going to make implementing the NWO way easier.

       Freemasonry is Judaic in origin. Im with you, trust me. But saying "Masons" may be a bit to simple. Thats what I was getting at. IMO, we're being manipulated by many different factions of possibly multiple secret societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kind of side question Im proposing is whether these groups are all being manipulated the same way we are, or are they simply playing a part to kind of program and push society in a certain direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: you mention Obama as an opponent of Israel with the evidence that US abstained on the Palestine conflict. Conversely, I could call him a friend after giving Israel $38 billion over the next 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, whos truly on whos side? Is there even a way for "normal" people like us to even tell?

       I think there are about ~4-7 secret societies which work together to retain control, but each want to be on top of the inevitable NWO. They can't go too hard on each other because whenever one of these societies entirely fails, the others tend to struggle. Quite a few people are also playing multiple sides because they're all out for themselves. Being in the 0.000001% isn't enough for these people, they want to control everything and everyone.

       I'm surprised nobody has lobbied for it to be taken down, then again, it's mostly tourists in Times Square.  Native NYC residents won't be there for the ball drop, for the most part.
