    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s really crazy is people gladly pay to submit their DNA, think about it , when you go to county jail they take a DNA sample from you and put the data into CODIS and that is really the only way right now for the government to get your DNA &quot;legally&quot; on a mass level ,limiting there data base to people that go to jail, what about the rest of the people that do not have a record or are not in the CODIS data base or didn&#39;t give a DNA sample if they were arrested prior to CODIS , Ancestry and companies like it are the next best thing ,( call it voluntary submission and no one gives a damn )makes the DNA data base larger without the general publics knowledge </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the things r/conspiracy talks about quite a bit is the &quot;bloodlines of the elite.&quot; I don&#39;t really have a firm opinion on that, but I&#39;ve read a lot and some of the arguments have been pretty compelling. This has been on my mind since I first started seeing adverts for these services - that they could possibly be a registry of both DNA &amp; one&#39;s family history and connections. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also noteworthy that many alphabet agents seemingly come from Utah &amp; Mormon backgrounds. </p>

<p>To me, these companies have always posed a potential threat, but they seem wildly popular. </p>

<p>I suppose it could be much ado about nothing, but it has always set my spidey-senses on edge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this have something to do with the RH-Negative Registry because your ancestors may be from Northern Spain or Southern France where you can find some of the highest concentration of RH negative factor in the Basque people ,or your a descendant of a nephilim , or the ultra rare %1 of the Native Americans that are RH negative, which would also be a hell of a reason to register and log RH negative blood type ,other than to alert medics in an extreme situation </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of theories about rh negative blood lately. Notably, a natural resistance or immunity to diseases, like Ebola. More conspiratorial theories are common as well - like rh negative individuals belonging to specific bloodlines. I was being somewhat silly by bringing it up, but there are some interesting stories. ;)</p>
