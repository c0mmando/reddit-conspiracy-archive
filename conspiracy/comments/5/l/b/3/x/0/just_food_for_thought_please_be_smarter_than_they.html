        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just something I&#39;ve been thinking about as important. We need to think about the division in our country. People always have and will continue to have opposing viewpoints it part of what makes us humans great. We&#39;re individuals. But think about the fact that in the MSM it always turns into right vs left, dem vs rep, white vs black, hate Muslims, hate white men, hate BLM, hate Russia, etc.
The important thing is why are they trying so hard to keep us 99% divided?
I believe it&#39;s because they are scared of us, if we are working as one United front, it makes the establishment agenda much harder for them to push. It has to start with informing, if enough people are exposed to the truth we can fight back against them. Let&#39;s remember to love each other while we are trying to educate others. We can&#39;t be like the detestable people we stand against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve always thought even from a young age that it seems stupid that humans haven&#39;t accomplished more by now and I fully believe if we could come together and at the very least accept that different people have different viewpoints we would be in such a different place as a species right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a long journey and one that doesn&#39;t mean you have to quit your job and burn all your money... Just meditate, it&#39;ll surprise you in many ways I promise, and yes, you might feel a little silly at first!</p>

<p>I think of my life in two ways 1. The golden rule. 2. Let all my decisions be governed by love and not fear, and it&#39;s a work in progress.</p>

<p>Some examples of False Evidence Appearing Real..</p>

<p>Material gain at the expense of others
Selfishness
Afraid of what others think
Afraid to think outside the consensus</p>

<p>And remember, many many people have tried to tell us, or at least alluded to the fact that it&#39;s just a choice, each person has to get to that point on their own, but when we do as a collective...shit gonna get real interesting for humanity.</p>

<p>Peace :)</p>

<p>nice! keep up the good work</p>

<p>the &quot;collective consciousness&quot; is Very real! We need to <em>join our minds</em> together in <em>rejection</em> of All the Bullshit we&#39;re being told. </p>

<p>It&#39;s slowly beginning,, people like us OP are the &#39;front lines&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful comment and also inspirational and hopeful. That&#39;s another thing I feel this sub and community of independent thinkers need to do a better job of. There is still hope for us good people put there. If we give up simply due to the amount of power &quot;they&quot; currently possess, than were effectively killing our own fight. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking of the NWO as being like the empire in star wars and we are the group in rogue one looking for a hole to bring down that God damned death star. We can still beat those evil bastards </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks, think of it this way, the PTB have huge militaries and <strong><em>organisations</em></strong> to figure out what to do and how to implement it</p>

<p>what do &quot;we the people&quot; use? A family group of 5?</p>

<p>No wonder multinational companies with &quot;paid troops&quot; work so well ... and &quot;we&quot; are those troops!</p>

<p>Maybe IF the &#39;average person&#39; were to realize the 99% are <strong><em>all in it together</em></strong> things would begin to improve</p>

<p>but we sure don&#39;t act that way in this &quot;all about Meee!&quot; world ... a very clever construct of TPTB to pacify the people .... it&#39;s beginning to unravel </p>

<p>At the end of the day, <strong><em>it&#39;s up to ALL of us</em></strong> to do what we can to rethink our lives and stop being so fucking selfish! To think how many more of &quot;us&quot; there are ... IF people weren&#39;t prepared to let their kids join an army, we wouldn&#39;t have armies!</p>

<p>But the  mentality that supports this mindset is entrenched, dad was in the services <em>so</em> little johnny can join them too ... it&#39;s a job isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>&quot;we the people&quot; are the <em>only ones</em> who can break these cycles of madness by refusing to participate <em>on any level</em>, from physical to mental and spiritual</p>

<p>Just.Don&#39;t.Do.It.</p>

<p>and I&#39;m not talking about drugs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yeah man, hit the nail on the head. I&#39;ve been on this sub for a while now, especially recently and I feel like it&#39;s definitely unravelling and that&#39;s the first step, if we can get the people to just realize what&#39;s going on in the world literally right under their own noses. The shit that the world governments do to their own citizens. Its deplorable and I hope we can get some mo re people over to the &quot;light&quot; side if you will, thanks again man, keep up the good work and spread that info</p>
