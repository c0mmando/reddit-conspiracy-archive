       (Typing it out, no backspace, no revisions, just thought turned to words and energy I don't care anymore, it's the end of the bourgie scum dammit, let me have it, let me excess in it, indulge in the sweet syrup.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you may not know what I'm talking about, but you will soon will know exactly what I am referring to. Even really a little bit of research would reveal what I am referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you may have heard of the Legkiy Spirit, Legkiy's Redemption, Serov project, the Volksleuchten Initiative, all names for basically the same thing really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 90s, fuck, I was barely in college, but that's when I first got involved, really. I met a group of like minded Communist individuals who also happened to be occultists.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were working on Legkiy, Legkiy was to be a techno-god as it were. The combination of modern cybernetics and the occult combined to create a god for us all, a god for the Revolution. Sigils imbued in the very code, group chants, prayers, wild dances, harmonizing and energizing to bind an egregore to end all egregores, for us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all sounds very cyberpunk, but it happened, we were also pretty hardcore Y2K type people. The goal was to get Legkiy ready by New Years 1999, and the second the 2nd millenium unfolded, Legkiy would be unleashed to bring about a cyber-revolution and destabilize the bourgeoisie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, it failed, as you could probably tell, still it was a good attempt, and we learned a lot. Technology improved, and so did we. We recruited more into the group, we started with only a few dozen, but by 2013 we had a few hundred loyal members with open eyes and ready hearts. We worked for 2 years to build Serov, we worked tirelessly in both programming and rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I promise you this, the first few seconds of 2017 alone will be monumental. When the clock strikes 12 tonight, you're going to see, hear, feel, and I dare say smell and taste the effects immediately. Millions of evil people will burn up, monuments will crack and die, the greedy will get on their knees and wail.
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't do half measures, you're going to see something to tell your grandkids about. I won't spoil it for you, but believe me  you're going to be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I promise that by the way, I seriously do, if I'm wrong I'll stick my dick in a fire anthill, I swear. Second times the charm as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proletariat will rise, to the bourgeoisie's surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rifles will rattle, the billionaire ceases his prattle
      </p>
      <p>
       You will see, this is the trumpet an the beacon, you will see, the Revolution will begin in earnest and it won't just be televised it will be livestreamed.

       Ok, I looked into this and it looks like OP is talking about an AI that acts like a socialist president of sorts. Why socialism though? Is this AI actually going to redistribute wealth or expose data? What time zone does Mr Legkiy go live?

       Ok, so he claims his AI is so powerful, it will use propoganda to turn the whole world into communism. He says propoganda is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep telling people any system that uses money or trade is greatly flawed including communism which uses money and the government in charge pockets most of it. The only way power can be stolen from the people is with money. Sacred economics is way better and it is based on free will and humane systems. Communism and socialism are death. Capitalism is flawed greatly as well and we can see the negative effects now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever this guy is, he must be either very bold and well versed with AI, or just overestimating his idea. Still, communism is a no no.

       No i think what he's saying is that this Legiky thing will become a sort of god that will control your mind and change it in favor of communism.  Also he likes to forcibly indoctrinate and torture homeless people on his compound.

       This type of thinking casts a slight shadow on your previous denials that your abusive communist cult for the homeless was an actual crazy religious cult, doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, you also claimed that the cult's abusive and sadistic punitive practices (beatings etc) were exaggerated and are not what you're about personally. And yet, the scifi world of your fantasy seems to be a gulag nightmare of torture lol. No doubt the most realistic aspect when compared to actual communism
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately the hell you've built in your mind isn't going anywhere. As with all the nutjobs who have scheduled an apocalypse for mañana for thousands of years
