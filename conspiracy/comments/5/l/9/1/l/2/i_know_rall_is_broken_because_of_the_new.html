    <div class="md"><p>You are right in your stance towards MSM, especially Television.  The very format of the medium, squeezing something between commercial breaks prohibits nuanced and in depth understanding of the issue. That there are good people in these organizations is true but irrelevant. They would not get to where they are without internalizing filters and ideological commitments.  My advice, read far and read wide if you can, read everything you can. Read the NYT, read the Washington Post, Read the Financial Times, Read the Wall Street Journal, Read the International Socialist Review, read the National Review...read all sides and start trusting your judgment about what is being pushed, why and whether its true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m posting on r/conspiracy. I just get tired sometimes of the echo chamber on r/politics. </p>

<p>But I used to be a journalist, and I still have a lot of friends in the media. It&#39;s definitely not perfect. There&#39;s a lot of pressure to crank out content that gets clicks or ratings or to get a scoop 6 seconds before a competing outlet. So there definitely are business pressures in the industry. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the same as saying major corporations are using the media to secretly push propaganda to further their own interests. There&#39;s actually a decent amount of diversity in ownership of the national media outlets. NYT, Washington Post, WSJ, Politico, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, AP, Reuters, Bloomberg are all owned be competing companies. </p>

<p>Glad to hear from someone once in the media industry. Your description of their need to pump out content continually just for clicks is one other big reason I stopped reading most mainstream media sources.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve loved alternative news sites so much more because they aren&#39;t afraid to touch on sensitive subjects like most news outlets are.</p>

<p>Not to mention a lot of media outlets have pushed racial divide, racial tensions, and other bullshit to further divide the population.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disrespecting you or your former profession but man, professional journalism is not as professional these days. I hate to say it but it&#39;s true. It&#39;s all about clicks, lies, agendas, and divide and conquer.</p>

<p>This entire comment is so cringeworthy, I can&#39;t help but feel you&#39;re very young. </p>

<p>There are real hard working professionals in those mainstream media outlets. Yes the companies themselves and the higher ups in those companies can be corrupt, but most of the people are just doing their jobs without any hidden agenda. The way you reduce those people by saying it&#39;s laughable to call it professional journalism really pisses me off.</p>

<p>Also the way you try to &quot;educate&quot; him while being pretty wrong yourself is hilarious. Nice buzzword jab there at the end with the &quot;fake news&quot; bit too. You know where the real fake news is? The bullshit blogs and so-called alternative news websites that I see at the top of this subreddit ALL THE TIME. Where they link to each others copy and pasted stories as sources in a never-ending loop so you just give up looking for an actual source. </p>

<p>I lazily typed it I&#39;m not really trying to solidify anyone&#39;s beliefs or push anything on anyone I&#39;m merely expressing my opinion.</p>

<p>I have no respect for corporations and the way they are used by certain greedy individuals to push a narrative or agenda. That&#39;s what I was getting at but in lazy with my sentences sometimes.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is about 90% of mainstream media I&#39;ve watched and used to watch just regurgitate the same shit just like you claim alternative news does.</p>

<p>I like to read alternative news sources and form my own agenda instead of feeding into what the media wants us to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a great point, and I can echo that myself that most people I have talked to or met in my life really do not care much about the strife in the middle east or things of that nature unless the main news outlets are talking about it.</p>

<p>Unless someone puts it in there face about the horrible things happening then they start to consider it. Personally I think that kind of indifference is exactly what the elite wanted from their brainwashing to accomplish.</p>

<p>To divide us and then also have us not care about anything that doesn&#39;t affect us directly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m tired of seeing Reddit being described as &quot;democratic&quot; or &quot;the users decide what content gets pushed up.&quot; It&#39;s just not true at all, r/all and many subreddits are straight up manipulated, so the posts are presented in a certain way. So I&#39;m tired of people having this ideal that Reddit is some great democratic thing, it&#39;s not and I&#39;m tired of mods and admins saying that as well. Fucking nothing is decided by the &quot;community&quot;.</p>

<p>I wish they WOULD just let the users decide what content gets seen the most. Why don&#39;t they? Probably because they are afraid as to what would get upvoted and made visible. </p>

<p>OP or anyone else, would you be kind enough to list a few of the world events that have happened over the past days or week? Nothing too crazy, I&#39;m not asking for links or huge descriptions, please just take a quick minute or two out of your day to help me and others out. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true.</p>

<p>Everything that makes it to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> ends up being posted in here as a false flag / fake / distraction from something else / etc. etc.</p>

<p>The threads that get created here after any major event are totally predictable.</p>

<p>And now that someone hasn&#39;t seen some event or other on the front page - that&#39;s a conspiracy too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But now we have fools like you who come in here making these claims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not the one who claims it&#39;s a conspiracy when things are on the front page - and then claims it&#39;s a conspiracy when they aren&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who don&#39;t finalize their opinions without critical thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the logic you are defending:</p>

<p>A = conspiracy</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>NOT A = conspiracy</p>

<p>And you claim it&#39;s me who lacks critical thinking?</p>
