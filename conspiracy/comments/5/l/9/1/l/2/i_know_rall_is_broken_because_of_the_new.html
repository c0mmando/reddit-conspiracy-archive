       That's because you are sorting by "hot" instead of "top."

       No big conspiracy there, buddy. If you sort by Top, it is literally just a descending list by points.

       You're not a fan of any news outlets that have the resources to invest in real research, reporting, and editing?

      <p>
       There are some smart people writing things on the internet. But that's never going to be a substitute for a professional journalist who develops sources and breaks news. There's fair criticism of a lot of mainstream outlets, but I'm not sure what the alternative is.

       You are right in your stance towards MSM, especially Television.  The very format of the medium, squeezing something between commercial breaks prohibits nuanced and in depth understanding of the issue. That there are good people in these organizations is true but irrelevant. They would not get to where they are without internalizing filters and ideological commitments.  My advice, read far and read wide if you can, read everything you can. Read the NYT, read the Washington Post, Read the Financial Times, Read the Wall Street Journal, Read the International Socialist Review, read the National Review...read all sides and start trusting your judgment about what is being pushed, why and whether its true.

       I know I'm posting on r/conspiracy. I just get tired sometimes of the echo chamber on r/politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I used to be a journalist, and I still have a lot of friends in the media. It's definitely not perfect. There's a lot of pressure to crank out content that gets clicks or ratings or to get a scoop 6 seconds before a competing outlet. So there definitely are business pressures in the industry. But I don't think that's the same as saying major corporations are using the media to secretly push propaganda to further their own interests. There's actually a decent amount of diversity in ownership of the national media outlets. NYT, Washington Post, WSJ, Politico, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, AP, Reuters, Bloomberg are all owned be competing companies.

      <p>
       Glad to hear from someone once in the media industry. Your description of their need to pump out content continually just for clicks is one other big reason I stopped reading most mainstream media sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've loved alternative news sites so much more because they aren't afraid to touch on sensitive subjects like most news outlets are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention a lot of media outlets have pushed racial divide, racial tensions, and other bullshit to further divide the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disrespecting you or your former profession but man, professional journalism is not as professional these days. I hate to say it but it's true. It's all about clicks, lies, agendas, and divide and conquer.

       This entire comment is so cringeworthy, I can't help but feel you're very young.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real hard working professionals in those mainstream media outlets. Yes the companies themselves and the higher ups in those companies can be corrupt, but most of the people are just doing their jobs without any hidden agenda. The way you reduce those people by saying it's laughable to call it professional journalism really pisses me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the way you try to "educate" him while being pretty wrong yourself is hilarious. Nice buzzword jab there at the end with the "fake news" bit too. You know where the real fake news is? The bullshit blogs and so-called alternative news websites that I see at the top of this subreddit ALL THE TIME. Where they link to each others copy and pasted stories as sources in a never-ending loop so you just give up looking for an actual source.

       I understand what you're getting at. I'm not trying to dismiss the good people in journalism that work hard for their career.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lazily typed it I'm not really trying to solidify anyone's beliefs or push anything on anyone I'm merely expressing my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no respect for corporations and the way they are used by certain greedy individuals to push a narrative or agenda. That's what I was getting at but in lazy with my sentences sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is about 90% of mainstream media I've watched and used to watch just regurgitate the same shit just like you claim alternative news does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to read alternative news sources and form my own agenda instead of feeding into what the media wants us to believe.

       Can't be manipulated if I don't watch their shitty narrative and attempt at controlling an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why I'm getting backlash against my choice to refrain from mainstream medias fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in conspiracy right?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious most mainstream outlets follow an agenda or a narrative and to think otherwise is naive after what the main stream media machine shits out day after day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So continue to watch main stream media and having your world view FED TO YOU

       Did you know there is a bunch of grey area between "All MSM is fake" and "All MSM is completely 100% factual and without bias."

       Maybe try to think of the world as NOT being completely black and white. It's actually mostly just grey.

       This is why you can't ever have a legitimate community of skeptics. Because there are always nutjobs out there that are going to take over those communities and spout nonsense like all mainstream news is fake news. There is a lot of fake news out there, and it's voted to the top of this subreddit all the time. But once again the nutjobs have turned a real issue into crazy nonsense that nobody will pay attention to. So when those of us that are serious want to talk about the giant misinformation machine in this country, we will never be taken seriously.

       Reddit is a mostly American website, so just think to yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Does the average American care more about Carrie Fisher dying, than a war, or some earthquake somewhere else in the world?
       </em>
       - Chances are the answer is yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't mean there's a conspiracy, just means people care about different things to you. You might think it's absurd a celebrity death trumps multiple civilian deaths, but that's just human nature. We care more about those we have some kind of connection with over those we don't.

       The thing is, we have absolutely no connection to those celebrities at all. Oh, you watched a movie a few times and liked their character? That's not a connection. I drive by the same stop sign every day and have seen it since my childhood, but I have no attachment to it just because I've seen it frequently. Our obsession with celebrities is sad.

       You have a great point, and I can echo that myself that most people I have talked to or met in my life really do not care much about the strife in the middle east or things of that nature unless the main news outlets are talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless someone puts it in there face about the horrible things happening then they start to consider it. Personally I think that kind of indifference is exactly what the elite wanted from their brainwashing to accomplish.

       I'm tired of seeing Reddit being described as "democratic" or "the users decide what content gets pushed up." It's just not true at all, r/all and many subreddits are straight up manipulated, so the posts are presented in a certain way. So I'm tired of people having this ideal that Reddit is some great democratic thing, it's not and I'm tired of mods and admins saying that as well. Fucking nothing is decided by the "community".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish they WOULD just let the users decide what content gets seen the most. Why don't they? Probably because they are afraid as to what would get upvoted and made visible.

       Most of this mourning for celebrities is pretense.  If any of these mourners (who've never even met Fisher) actually lost their mom, or their dog, any grieving they're doing for Carrie Fisher would be forgotten in an instant.

       Noticed this as well, if you hate it so much why don't you just stay on r/all since you apparently don't believe anything were saying anyways?

       This is simply not true. You would know this if you had frequent this sub before in the past. A false flag attack is domestic terrorism not natural disasters.

       It is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that makes it to the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ends up being posted in here as a false flag / fake / distraction from something else / etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The threads that get created here after any major event are totally predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that someone hasn't seen some event or other on the front page - that's a conspiracy too?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But now we have fools like you who come in here making these claims
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not the one who claims it's a conspiracy when things are on the front page - and then claims it's a conspiracy when they aren't.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        who don't finalize their opinions without critical thinking.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's the logic you are defending:
      </p>
      <p>
       A = conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       AND
      </p>
      <p>
       NOT A = conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       And you claim it's me who lacks critical thinking?
