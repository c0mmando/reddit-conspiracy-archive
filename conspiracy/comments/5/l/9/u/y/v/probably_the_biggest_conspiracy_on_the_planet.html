    <div class="md"><p>I may not agree with you on everything but damn I always love a classic <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> effort post. Just the right amount of truth, speculation and conjecture to keep you interested. I do agree that Muslim subversion of US government is extensive. See Major Stephen Coughlins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKzkuQyexZc&amp;amp;list=PLRGjclMs6x2Kgctqns2WNEEbxHE5jU2ZZ">Red Pill Brief</a>, it will shock you. The Muslim Brotherhood should not be underestimated. Hopefully DJT will ban them and list them as a Terrorist organization. </p>

<p>What can ya do! </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the votes discourage you. They&#39;re just fake points. Those of us that actually care and want to learn, we read and digest! The messages do get to those of us that care.... we&#39;re seeing a pattern of hostile voting taking place, so those of us that want to learn, know where to find the good stuff (New r/conspiracy is just so much awesomeness.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the most overlooked aspects of Saudi Arabia is the fact that it is firm allies with Israel. There are other members of this alliance as well, Qatar, Bahrain, etc. Saudi Arabia is right now bombing and instigating mass starvation in Yemen.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/06/05/israel-gcc-alliance-shall-named/">https://theintercept.com/2015/06/05/israel-gcc-alliance-shall-named/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/04/22/saudi-arabias-disastrous-war-in-yemen/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/04/22/saudi-arabias-disastrous-war-in-yemen/</a></p>

<p>Investors in Saudi Arabia did fund the 9/11 attacks and obviously allies are free to despise one another, there are few nations that hate Americans more than Israel. These nations are a part of a scheme to dominate the middle east and steal land and resources, destroy competitors to the gulf oil state (Syria, Russia) and Israeli welfare pipeline (Palestine, American National Sovereignty).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a vital part of the plan to convince western citizens that the war on terror is real, that&#39;s why every major &quot;threat&quot; which is supposedly due to the nature of islam actually comes from destablizing the middle east while funding terrorism. ISIS comes directly from this funding and Libya&#39;s destruction, as well as other states like Iraq. Before ISIS it seems like the US &#39;took out Al Qaeda&#39;s number 1/2&quot; every 6 months.</p>

<p>This is a multi-trillion dollar industry, with a fake war that&#39;s killed somewhere between 1.5 to 4 million people. Trump allowed Eric Prince (Founder of Blackwater, who wants his own private air force) to buy his sister Betsy Davos (Who wants children to work in mines instead of going to school) the sec of education seat so we know it&#39;s not going to end. Trump is also an anti-american, who believes Israel deserves the lifeblood of the american taxpayer.</p>

<p>These people don&#39;t care about human life, or the people under them. It&#39;s all about justifying owning all of the capital, destroying anyone who disagrees, and creating enough fake enemies to make it seem real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a firm &quot;Obama wants to help and better America&quot;...up until Benghazi I had no doubt in our government and it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; way of doing things. The past 4 years have deterred that and it&#39;s evident there has been plotting against the American people for a while now. It&#39;s just gotten to the point of the &quot;Star hitteR&quot; getting up to knock one out of the park...and well..That &quot;star hitter&quot; just got sidelined by the American people. </p>

<p>The establishment is still beating the drums of war against a foreign nation like Russia when in fucking JUNE we had 50 people gunned down in the Pulse Massacre. Just last week they found 9 &quot;Refugees&quot; storing ammos whom had grown and resided in the continental states their whole life. I&#39;m not &quot;scared&quot; of what ISIS will do. ISIS will attack probably tonight and a few other times in the coming weeks on U.S. soil. I only fear for the liberals who will run to hug the man who came to kill them. </p>

<p>The truth is, that&#39;s why I consider that the russian / usa devide is prevelant; It&#39;s not so much that people are complicit; It&#39;s that they are paid to look away, having never connected these dots in the first place.

<p>If you pay attention to what hes saying, that his plan (hes talking to the &quot;establishment&quot; not the people)... what has he said recently, we need to take down ISIS, therefor when we take down ISIS we take all their oil and keep it... once more who is training ISIS in the middle east, Saudi Arabia ... you can expect there to be a soft coup and a regime change where we insert our own people to run their govt and take over the oil there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thought process.  The only thing for certain is that something is fishy with all the Russian talk.  It misses the mark in the sense that it&#39;s being met with skepticism and yet our government is not backing down.  It does not feel organic.  Why is it the more we ask for answers, the louder the media talks about Russia.  It just doesn&#39;t jive with our day to day, with who we are.  It is exposing that someone or something else is in control of us and they will ignore us.  I do think something is in motion and the over all sentiment from those in control is &quot;fuck it, what can they do to stop us?&quot;</p>

<p>If they are actually doing this obviously the establishment would be very worried about the reality of their corruption being exposed. If they are not doing this or it&#39;s being exaggerated it is regardless a convenient excuse to crack down on all the &quot;Russian propaganda,&quot; freedom of speech, and the political parties Russia &quot;controls.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a very insightful theory, as normal responses/actions. USA oil reserves are pretty good. The economic issue came from a long time ago and the euphoria/panic stages are inherent to the capitalist market, as seen in the past. USA always sells weapons to the best &quot;target&quot; (or local/regional interests). Obama is Osama is the dumbest shit I ever read. If you check facts and statistics about Obama he was an &gt; average president, friendlier face for the world, still dealing with a disruptive government and other shit. </p>

<p>(Didn&#39;t Reagan sell weapons to Iran to give money to rebel armies in South America back in the times? Or other presidents financed dictatorships around the world? or experimenting on people? Are you sure you remember/know USA history to say Obama is the worst enemy for its people?)</p>

<p>In the other hand:</p>

<p>Those secret armies and development/experimentation of exotic weapons by the private sector are an issue, either with the DoD acceptance or not.</p>

<p>Trump might consolidate USA enemies accordingly to international opinion on the country. Attacks or not (doubt that NY shit), those guys don&#39;t like regulations much. Federation? there&#39;s just too much speculation because of Trump uncertainty.</p>

<p>I think we just wait and see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One point to add onto regarding the fire bombings: these type of fire bombings are similar to the ones being used against israel as well.</p>

<p>Inb4 israel is the ultimate all powerful enemy overhype narrative...</p>

<p>Israel has the potential to be a very valuable ally to the US as long as we dont let them walk all over us, like trump said, while being fair to our allies we need to place america first. Remember the stuxnet incident where the &quot;all knowing israel&quot; came all over themselves at just being given some table scraps by the US.</p>

<p>The info about the isis cells is the most important points in OP&#39;s post and im glad someone finally brought it up. They&#39;ve been pushing up through south america and into mexico for awhile now, thats why the wall is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you are trying to say Sharia law, which is an interpretation of religious texts that does not mean the same thing for all Muslims. Saudi Arabia indeed is exporting terrorism across the middle east, the USA is helping. They are allies. They both make billions from this practice.</p>

<p>It is all about money, the idea of an invasion on the USA is ludacris and hilariously dumb. It&#39;s the age old trick of creating a boogie man and offering a solution. The Islamic threat is severely overstated and I think you took their bait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That or...</p>

<p>Maybe you think the threat is &quot;contained&quot;, and I think the situation is &quot;a run away train&quot; Hence we were being played this whole time. </p>

<p>What you aren&#39;t considering is that Trump is the new cool kid in school. (taking their Tear 2.0 Huma) out of operation. </p>

<p>So desperate times, calls for desperate measures...</p>

<p>Otherwise ISIS is finished, and the entirety of their &quot;war plans&quot; was a &quot;financial loss&quot;; Because trump won&#39;t play the long game; </p>

<p>Nations don&#39;t like spending billions of dollars for ulterior gains they won&#39;t be receiving in the end now do they... </p>

<p>This is all based on everything your saying; Your just not thinking about the fate of their little army, once someone takes over; </p>

<p>They have to make a move or their game board is tossed, and everything was for nothing. Because they like to work in the shadows and coerce nations to make moves, Its likely Huma was their Plan A. 
It&#39;s because her position is out that a Desperate Plan B. Went into effect; 
Again, Why do you think there is so much RU hate right now?
Don&#39;t you think that is a sign they are trying to stop both us from working together to rain bombs on them like a tag team match, of two giants against a midget...</p>

<p>Think of how much ISIS soldiers sacrificed... Did you think they did that to fail in the end?</p>

<p>I think they will make a hail mary tonight. That line of thinking is exactly what made me make the post. It isn&#39;t a long post. Its a we have 24 hours to see if this checks out. (And it needed to be said) prior to an incident; Just in case it truly does check out; Because if it falls like this, We the people can not sit back any longer. 
There is simply too much at stake, and this is a very real threat to the entirety of our nation...</p>

<p>If ISIS falls, they will be replaced. Where do you think most of them came from? So long as there is war in the middle east there will be radical groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ty. New York is a sitting duck; I have terrible feelings about all of this; I have had them since near christmas... I&#39;ve tried making small hints, and tips; I simply couldn&#39;t sit back any longer; I think the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_xCI-peq0&amp;amp;t=49s">I pet goat ii video</a>, is what finally pushed me to post; Something about the videos content, was very powerful, touching me on my own concepts in a level that I no longer felt alone in my conspiracy. </p>

<p>I think this is the collective conscious speaking out, against what we all feel could happen; Again call me a nutter; But I didn&#39;t not watch this unfold over the years, It&#39;s hard to assume the worst; 
Equally hard to reveal what could be the worst acts of man; </p>

<p>To go against the official &quot;Narratives&quot; or so they say...</p>

<p>But I love this country, and judging by the upvotes, I think I am not the only one that feels that way. &quot;In fact&quot;. I think the whole world feels this way, and they all are afraid to say it. So I thought i&#39;d put it out there. In hopes that I am both wrong, and encase I am right. </p>

<p>Happy new years either way :)</p>

<p>This is obvious if you watch news outside of the US. ISIS is a name generated by the US gov&#39;t to keep up the notion that al qaeda is dead, and the US are the world protectors that killed them. Watch news from middle eastern countries about Syria and they all talk about <em>al qaeda</em> and ISIL being the terrorist groups in Syria. They never say ISIS. Regardless, the US is definitely supplying them with weapons and money. We are already fighting a proxy war against Russia, god save our souls of it becomes a real one. </p>

<p>Hillary was supposed to win the election; There is suggestions that she even was attempting to sway the electoral vote; </p>

<p>I believe the coup de tat, is FBI, and NSA VS. DOJ. </p>

<p>hence why that Investigation, just happens to be ongoing until post January 20th I am sure; Guccifer already admitted to hitting the HRC server; That is what lead to its discovery; So why would he lie about hitting it; Sure he didn&#39;t provide evidence; But what man would self incriminate himself in that position, (having already been caught). And if there was an actual attack on american&#39;s planned; The parties in possession of those emails, would have every reason to keep them under state secret...</p>

<p>Being that Assange, is missing; It&#39;s likely safe to say, that he could confirm this; (And those were the insurance files that would lead to her indictment that he claimed he possessed).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not to say this is all factual; Just to say this is what I see, hidden between the lines; All theories are openly welcomed; Even if you disagree; </p>

<p>I simply put this out there, because It is what I believe is the full extent of the crisis as it stands. Regardless of the ambiguity.  </p>

<p>Another interesting post - Could have been an incident earlier; </p>

<p>Looking forward to reading what went on behind the scenes as the media catches up... Note that the public broadcast vs the private ones are absolutely important to take into consideration; I am probably headed to bed here soon. Night, and happy newyears...</p>

<p>There was also witnesses to a nuke cloud? *mushroom. </p>

<p>I am wondering if maybe an explosion was kept off the news, or a situation happened as its very close to the town in question...</p>

<p>Waiting to hear more really.

    <div class="md"><p>Quote:
CAUSE NOT FOUND -Fire cleared. We have no further information on the reported &quot;explosion&quot; that has been felt all over the region. Reports are coming in from several counties away in New York and Pennsylvania of it shaking house and heard. News agencies in other states also reporting it (Ohio and Georgia) A mushroom cloud has been spotted over Niger Hollow in Halsey Valley but exact location unknown. Again fire units cleared nothing found on Niger Hollow Rd. This shook houses, and was heard and felt over 100 miles into PA according to emergency responders in those areas. Check local news for updates.
Quote:
All we know at this point is that a large explosion has been heard over a large area. Reports have been given of a mushroom cloud as well. On the Fire side, nothing has been reported and nothing has been seen after the fact (fire, people hurt, etc...) in order for Fire operations to continue. We do not report on Sheriff or State Police matters. Police may still be investigating, but without evidence as to an exact location, it&#39;s hard to get a warrant to search people&#39;s property for more info. We may learn more tomorrow once it&#39;s brighter out and more can be seen. IF we learn more before then, we will start a new thread to update.</p>
