       Trump breaks that mold of "left" and "right". You saw it during the primaries, where the neocons were attacking him for not being a "true conservative" and (later, in the general election) where the Democrats were [ironically] charging him with being a "rightwing fascist".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: Trump's policy positions form the standard-issue Democratic Party platform from 1960 [before the DNC was hijacked by Marxists and radicals].
      </p>
      <p>
       He is not far right, nor far left. He's cartoonishly centrist (if you look at the larger historical arc).
      </p>
      <p>
       One commentator said, "We're watching something phenomenal. Trump isn't running as a 'conservative' or a 'liberal'. He's running as an
       <em>
        American
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no: As much as I'm inclined to be suspicious (and I
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       suspicious for a long time about Trump), I no longer think he's a NWO agent. I do, however, believe that he was brought in by the Deep State to help salvage the country due to the upcoming economic collapse. Trump is the bankruptcy king in the corporate world. Who better to bring in for a bankrupt America?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe he was recruited by the Deep State [the bureaucratic lifers within the government, the intelligence community and the military].
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are NOT New World Order puppets. The NWO basically controls the politicians, but not the career bureaucrats within the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Ryan = NWO
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton = NWO
      </p>
      <p>
       Neocons = NWO
      </p>
      <p>
       Radical Left Agitators Funded by Soros = NWO
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is basically the Deep State recruiting a person to come in and aid America after the NWO crowd fucked things up so bad economically that the nation was on the verge of collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then that's the NWO design: To keep America weak . . . and poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus she's more pliant.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Paul Ryan got scared when Trump talked about lowering the corporate tax rate and getting millions of companies to flood into the US. Ryan knows that that will revitalize the US economy, and his masters don't want that. So Paul Ryan (who worked hand-in-glove with Obama to double US debt) is suddenly pretending he's a budget-hawk . . . but only when it comes to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We . . . uh . . . um . . . can't lower taxes, because it wouldn't be responsible for the government to fund itself."
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly he's pretending like he gives a shit about deficits (like he never did with Obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Trump would instantly create jobs and raise the pay of Americans [that has been artificially depressed for decades by the NWO].
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're desperate to keep America weak and in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Ryan is the NWO poison. Trump is the antidote.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're watching unfold is a struggle between the globalists and the patriots within the Deep State. And, to everyone's shock, the Deep State won the initial battle. It wasn't "Russians" leaking things to Wikileaks. It was the intelligence community within the United States who did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catherine Austin Fitts said, "Their power grid was falling apart internationally. We saw it with Brexit. A decision had to be made to sacrifice America to the larger global empire, or sacrifice the larger global empire to try and save America. It looks like, with Trump, there may be an effort to try and save America."

       Trump is the result of the leakers, rogue agents, and double agents in the deep state. The people who have had enough of seeing the evil at hand. We can't confuse the motives of these people with those of the NWO. Do we really think that EVERYONE on the inside is an evil lizard that wants to take over the world? No! There are still good people out there, and these people are starting to come to light. These are the people that wanted trump to run. We can't confuse that

       Well put.. good job. However I have a question, if there were Patriots in the deep state who have good intentions for the country and not the NWO agenda, wouldn't they be more keen to destroy the fractional reserve banking systems, Rather than continue to prop up the inevitable bubble?

       This is just what they want. To destroy the FED, u must have to make the economy independent from it. U cant destroy the FED when the economy is so intertwine with it that when the FED falls, the economy fall as well. Simple logic.

       It's very possible that Trump is, in reality, guided by hidden hands. For example, I've been wondering whether Trump's Wall is a solution for a problem that doesn't exist yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global warming is happening whether anyone believes in it or not. As the oceans rise because of the melting ice coastal cities are going to be destroyed. All those people are going to loose their homes. There will be millions of refugees. It's very likely that those people are going to blame America for what happened. A sturdy wall would be a big help in keeping those people from crossing the border.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico is a pretty dangerous place as it is. Canada, on the other hand, is pretty peaceful. It's pretty obvious where the wall needs to be built. Plus, they have a perfect excuse for building it since there already is an immigration problem.

       So all of the documentaries that have been showing the effects are all part of the "conspiracy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the scientists?
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been warning that this could happen since I was young. I'm 50, so that's about 35 years in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more people who have to be an Insider of any conspiracy the less likely it is to succeed. Someone is bound to decide to eventually tell everyone what's really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about your own observations? Haven't you noticed that the weather is changing?

       I'm an OTR truck driver. My usual run is Los Angeles to New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year I barely had to drive in snow the whole winter. Yes, I was very lucky in my timing of trips since there were some bad storms but on average I saw way less snow last year then previous years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my 5th year driving. The first two years I saw lots of snow. Places like Flagstaff, AZ were snowpacked on the Interstate for most of the winter. That's just not the case for anymore. Sure, they've had storms but each time the snow melts off of the Interstate between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far this year is turning out pretty much as last year. It's already almost January and I've only had to drive in snow a couple of times. Each time it was light snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I'm somewhat torn about this. On one hand I know that it's ultimately a bad thing but for myself it's a good thing. I hate driving in the snow...

       How about multiple examples retreating glaciers over a time frame of many decades? Is that a slightly better example of the effects of Global Warming?
