        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For years, ever since I started conspiracy research, the first name that popped up was David Icke and his &quot;crazy theories&quot;</p>

<p>I immediately dismissed the man without ever even looking into what he&#39;s said or done.</p>

<p>Today for the FIRST TIME I actually sat and watched 20 minutes of one of his presentations and am blown away.</p>

<p>I wish this was the first thing I studied...</p>

<p>It connects all the dots. All the depravity, negativity, etc. </p>

<p>Archons, old ancient gnostic texts. These are all things I should have been studying in the first place.</p>

<p>So now that I&#39;m finally realizing the truth in his messages, what are the best videos of his you guys have for me to watch and delve into?</p>

<p>I&#39;m bummed the one I was watching earlier I lost because my phone shut off and now I can&#39;t find the video which is a shame because I really got sucked into it. </p>

<p>Anyway, please share the best David Icke material you have, I&#39;m not sure where to start.</p>

<p>EDIT: Found the video!!</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IgP88z6h-Zk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IgP88z6h-Zk</a></p>

<p>I greatly encourage you to listen to at least half an hour of this. Please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall a friend of mine telling me about Icke a decade ago. I thought he was a complete nut. Nowadays, he doesn&#39;t seem so crazy. Although I do believe Icke mixes in a bit of disinformation to keep himself alive. Basically make himself seem like a quack. </p>

<p>A good video from icke on consciousness and reality :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how it was for me too. I thought he was just &quot;crazy&quot; I fed into the labels, something I hate doing but did anyway with Icke.</p>

<p>I think he is a genuine person. Some people claim he&#39;s dos information but he seems genuine and he seems to be coming from his heart.</p>

<p>Also he lives in a apartment and drives an older dodge stratus or some shit so I really feel he&#39;s doing this for what he believes is true.</p>

<p>He has a massive amount of research on these subjects and I can&#39;t help but respect that amount of research. Thanks for the link man I&#39;ve only seen 1 Icke video so far so any shared Icke videos I can watch I will. Thanks again man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya he&#39;s got alot of great vids on his youtube channel. I would love to meet him and just pick his brain. He does have a tendency to ramble on at times, so you really have to be in the right mood to watch his stuff. I usually listen while I&#39;m doing something else, like playing guitar or cleaning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if we are all Jesus? What if we are connected to a source. Let&#39;s say that source is God, or the creator. Let&#39;s say that we are all connected to this one source</p>

<p>This would make us all God. We are God experiencing himself. We are billions of versions of God. Because if we are all one, if we are all connected to God, then we are a PART OF GOD.</p>

<p>Here is what I found on the 90&#39;s thing</p>

<p>Quote:
If you call the Infinite consciousness &#39;God&#39;, I was trying to say, we are all the symbolic &#39;sons&#39; and &#39;daughters&#39; of &#39;God&#39;. Obviously my awareness of these matters has increased dramatically since then, but that was the basis of my comments about being a &#39;Son of God&#39;. However, I was both misrepresented in the media and, with my mind downloading so much information following the mound in Peru, I wasn&#39;t grounded or &#39;here&#39; enough to articulate clearly what I was trying to say and this led to even greater misrepresentation and misunderstanding among those who ridiculed and laughed. All I can say to &#39;Jesus&#39; is that if you are there, mate, don&#39;t for goodness sake come back because they&#39;ll bloody crucify you - Christians as mlft11 as anyone. If you do return I would definitely do the cloud trick to give yourself any chance at all. Some comedians were funny rather than vindictive, though, and I recall the brilliant British comic, Jasper Carrot, saying that I couldn&#39;t be the Son of God because you&#39;d never find three wise men and virgin in Leicester.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just been to his WW WAKEUP tour. He starts with the structure of society: education, banks, jobs. And how it&#39;s mostly rigged to keep us subservient. </p>

<p>He then talks about how world events are planned by a deep state shadow government long before they are executed after filtering through secret society&#39;s etc.</p>

<p>He then spends a great deal of time on very basic quantum physics and particle physics and using them in an allegorical sense towards spirituality. Where he repeats &quot;It&#39;s an illuuuuuuusion&quot; many times.</p>

<p>There is a peppering of pseudoscience in the last bit I assume only to enrapture the audience more as they are proven falsities and he would or at least should know this.</p>

<p>He always then throws in the damn lizard shit in the end which spoils and is a complete discredit to everything he did earlier.</p>

<p>All in all I like Icke, I just wish he would be more honest. The world and existence IS crazy. He does not need to make up additional craziness by subtracting heavily from his integrity as a researcher.</p>
