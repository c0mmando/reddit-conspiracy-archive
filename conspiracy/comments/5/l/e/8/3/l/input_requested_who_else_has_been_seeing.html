        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d like to know who - if anyone - else is experiencing:</p>

<p>1) Body changes, or bizarre feelings lately, out of the known
2) Compulsions to seek truth or research information more than usual
3) Compulsions to make major life changes in the face of major doubts and worries
4) A strange sense of being more &quot;aware&quot; or alert
5) Feelings of warm or cold sensations
6) Unexplained electromagnetic anomalies, such as lights flickering, seeing shadows out of your peripherals, etc.
7) Any other signs that could be on this list: <a href="https://earthenergyreader.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/the-most-comprehensive-list-of-ascension-symptoms/">https://earthenergyreader.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/the-most-comprehensive-list-of-ascension-symptoms/</a></p>

<p>No judgment, please.  You can question sources of info we get details from after doing research, but everyone knows their own bodies, and can tell when something is &quot;off&quot; that isn&#39;t life threatening, but just... strange.</p>

<p>We all experience the paranormal at times, it seems, but I&#39;m talking - an inundation of weird.  On all fronts.</p>

<p>Who else has experienced this in the past 2-3 months, or specifically, in the past week?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is apparently a sign of ascension: <a href="https://earthenergyreader.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/the-most-comprehensive-list-of-ascension-symptoms/">https://earthenergyreader.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/the-most-comprehensive-list-of-ascension-symptoms/</a>  </p>

<p>&quot;Blurry vision, shimmering objects, seeing glittery particles, auras around people, plants, animals, and objects. Some report seeing formerly opaque objects as transparent. When you close your eyes, you no longer see darkness, but redness. You may also see geometric shapes or brilliant colors and pictures when eyes are closed. Colors appear more vivid — the sky might look teal or the grass an amazing green.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you begin to have multidimensional sight, you may see objects that other people do not see, such as sparkles of light, SHADOWS, orbs or balls of energy, grids of light, or movement from the CORNER OF YOUR EYES.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I just want to say that the whole seeing more out of the corner of my eye-thing is freaking me out when I drive lol.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been happening for awhile now; it&#39;s driving my fiancé crazy, I&#39;m always turning turning my head quickly because I swear I fucking saw something moving but it&#39;s never really anything. </p>

<p>This is the first I&#39;ve heard about any of this, I&#39;ve felt so bizarre lately and I&#39;m just really glad I&#39;m not the only one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the out-of-body moments that I just cannot understand, they happen all of the time now. I was walking out of the gas station the other day and I swear I just suddenly had an aerial view of me walking out and to my car but then suddenly I was normal again. It freaked me out but it keeps happening so I&#39;m getting used to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes, yes. It has definitely been happening for me for a while but going into overdrive the past 3 months or so and increasing over time. The past week now that you mention it has been especially notable.</p>

<p>I&#39;m suddenly getting insight from my own consciousness into how my mind actually works, causing me to question all of my preconceived notions and underlying beliefs systems and in many cases revising them with new awareness. It feels as if I am downloading massive quantities of information especially this past week. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also experiencing an increased awareness of my own body&#39;s energy field, the chakras, etc, as well as deep meditative states. The synchronicities and number coincidences are also piling up. </p>

<p>In conclusion, you are not alone. Also, I discovered this movement in a synchronization event this week, you might want to check it out: <a href="http://prepareforchange.net">http://prepareforchange.net</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Lots of patterns in numbers too. Particularly time. Lots of 11:11, 23:32, 23:33... 33s and 23s all over the place generally. Saw 2 ufos in December.

<p>Scared of those wanting to stop it from happening, maybe :D</p>

I was pacing around my house looking out windows to the sky saying &quot;I can feel it, it&#39;s happening!&quot;  I kept asking my bf &quot;can you feel it?&quot;  I knew it was something big. I knew it!i just didn&#39;t know what it was.  Just getting on the page I feel everyone&#39;s vibrations. It&#39;s amazing!  I don&#39;t even really know what all this means. But it feels great!

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. 3 months+ things have begun to change noticeably. The things I used to enjoy as a child, like learning more and experiencing nature and things around me, have become relevant again. I&#39;ve bought more books in the past month than I have in the past 10+ years combined. I can&#39;t get enough knowledge now, where as before I was content to just be hum drum and sleep all day or play games. Maturity factors in to things, sure, but this just <em>feels</em> different to me. I have always slept 4 hours daily and functioned, but I&#39;m in that triad period of restlessness where I need more sleep after my dreams have been wearing me out.</p>

<p>I was able to quit taking a medication for painful neuropathy (after paralysis a few years ago) with no side effects and adverse withdrawals. I feel better than I have in years. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve become more consciously aware of my surroundings. I&#39;ve been given this feeling that I&#39;m not to alarm those who are not &quot;awake&quot;, do not scare others that have remained in their dormant state. It&#39;s brought attraction in numerous people towards me - those that want to be near me as a little bit of a beacon of light, and repelled equally just as many (who I guess find me abrasive in the wakened state? Which is why I&#39;ve only talked about personal &quot;ascension&quot; details to those that notice it in themselves)</p>

<p>The religious teachings of all races and creeds have become entirely relevant and interesting to me. I&#39;m actively looking for ways to further humanity as a whole and thinking of ways to change the world for the better gives me peace. I&#39;m going to do my part when I can, where I can. </p>

<p>That being said, I still get &quot;jilted&quot; a little and thrown off balance by ... some &quot;people&quot;. It&#39;s just strange! </p>

Distancing myself from my entire family, who express nothing but negativity - and not in a normal &quot;my mother in law sucks&quot; kind of way.  But in a, &quot;they are imperiling my soul&quot; sort of way.  I have also been feeling extremely tired lately, as if no matter how much sleep I get I am unable to get enough.  And I feel.... solid.  No innuendo there; it&#39;s hard to explain.  Like my core is not made of what it used to be.  And the weirdest thing: these bizarre vibrations when I&#39;m laying chest-down while I sleep (which is how I&#39;ve always slept).  I thought it was a furnace kicking on, or a plane going overhead making my foundation rumble.  But it was coming from ME... but not from my heart.  Weird.</p>

<p>Eating less and drinking more water! Trying to figure out the difference between am I hungry or am I just thirsty has been a challenge.</p>

<p>A low carb diet has changed me in very nice ways. I&#39;ve lost a lot of weight and clothes fit better. I feel better about my image. Losing weight was easy this way.</p>

<p>If those things are causing you problems, listen to your body! I&#39;m not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination but when you feel something is going on, it might just be. Soda has SO much sugar and nothingness in it anyway and it&#39;ll rot your teeth! </p>

Lately, over the past few months, I&#39;ve been hearing an unreal amount of random ringings in my ear. Pitches changing. As if my mind is venturing through different frequencies as I walk down the street. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I&#39;ve sensed something/someone trying to contact me for weeks now. But, having a schizophrenic aunt, have accepted that maybe I was losing my mind. That said, something deep within is telling me that it&#39;s all okay and that I will be fine. I&#39;ve spent the past year intentionally unemployed so as to open and develop my awareness. I think now is the time for everyone embrace looking within. Hopefully I will soon better understand these pitch-frequency changes. Thanks a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually incredibly awesome when you begin to listen and interact with it.  </p>

<p>I used to have this awful script in my head, thinking the worst things about myself and others.  Constantly bringing up terrible memories as proof of what a wretch I truly am and anyone who thought differently simply did not know me.  Once this started that script changed. It became positive, nourishing, encouraging, accepting and loving, pointing out all the good things I do and gently urging me with directness and without judgement to make better choices especially when I ask for it, affirming the path and purpose I&#39;m supposed to take.  It guided me to end my relationship and had been telling me for months I just had to let it go in order for me to continue to evolve. Who knows what you will experience!  Alcohol seems disconnect me from this as does excess sugar and wheat.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also not a &quot;voice&quot; although I understand why someone might reach for that word.  It&#39;s more accurately thoughts, knowledge and information that clearly COME to you.  </p>

<p>I know how this sounds of course.  I too have &quot;crazy&quot; family members and it occurred to me that I was just going insane but I feel better than ever, not in an elated manic way but a stable, centered, motivated way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This! I&#39;ve had this happen to me the past couple nights as I&#39;m falling asleep in complete silence. I just got back to school yesterday, and last night I let my roommates fan run throughout the night. As I was trying to fall asleep, its clicking sounded like a metronome. I&#39;m a drummer, so I naturally started counting 8th note subdivisions, and once I felt like I got the tempo right, I felt like I &quot;locked in&quot; with the the clicking. I started counting in my head to hopefully ease myself into sleep as I had a headache. The more I counted, the more the clicking had a ranging pitch to it. I could even hear a melody play out or more like a walking bassline that I felt in somewhat control of. I kept counting, and the more I counted the more aware of the ringing I became and the more I focused on that than my counting, but I kept my counting somehow still going on in my head. It got higher and higher till I felt like it couldn&#39;t go higher. It felt like a massive energy surge went straight through my forehead and when it happened my headache was gone and it felt so warm and healthy. When I stopped, my headache returned, but I felt refreshed. As crazy as it might sound, I feel like my &quot;third eye&quot; has opened up the past few days. Every time I look at the world around me and focus my awareness open, I feel that warmth open up in the center of my forehead, but back slightly. Its a tingling sensation associated with some light pressure, and at sometimes I feel like I can visualize it. I&#39;ve never had this happen to me before until I had very noteworthy lucid dreams about a week and a half ago and noticed my first ME&#39;s the next day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is weird, but I was going to respond to your reply without having finished reading your whole response. Why? Because, after reading that your headache ended and you felt energy through your forehead, it aligned perfectly with my thoughts on my experiences feeling these frequencies within my head lately. Never was I a spiritual person prior to these past 10 months, but something has happened where I&#39;ve been drawn to it. I&#39;ve been drawn to the idea of the third eye and have even begun having strange, intuitive realizations. Like, for example, one day I was walking to work and it dawned on my that an atom, which makes up human form and is a center/nucleus with crazy fast electrons flying around it to make a sort of ring around the nucleus, I noticed how the atom looks incredibly similar to Saturn. What does that imply? That the make up of our being is similar in form to that of planets? Does that imply that I might be something grander than I&#39;ve been led to believe in this life time? Am I, in fact, the universe? Is the essence of consciousness the universe using me as a tool to see and, eventually, become aware of itself? What am I? What is it that is hearing these frequencies? It&#39;s the most beautiful and exciting thing to ponder! I&#39;m a pianist. Nice to hear from a fellow musician who shares interest in the supernatural :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I was a straight up Atheist no more than 6 months ago up until I started noticing sychronicities in my life. Then I didn&#39;t know what I believed in. Now I feel this sense of spiritually I have never felt before all of a sudden as things in my everyday life and my body itself feel... &quot;different&quot;. It&#39;s really interesting to me and it doesn&#39;t seem to scare me very much. It&#39;s almost comforting. Maybe being a musician helps with us being able to tune in to this kind of thing ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

It started with tackling some personal psychological issues, I experienced this Mandela effect, came across Corrado Malanga stuff, on to nag hammadi...  It&#39;s been a blur.  Quit smoking after pack a day for 20 years.  Now vegetarian.  Just a lot of changes.  Next step on my list is fasting, then finding some good hallucinogens :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I corrected <em>so much</em> of my wrong eating habits. I lost a significant amount of weight and find health foods to be my go to.
A low carb diet has helped me extensively. I&#39;m excited to keep losing weight and get down to what feels <em>natural</em> for me - No longer paying attention to the numbers behind the weight.</p>

<p>Fasting is fun. The idea that helped me immensely was that if I&#39;m not exerting that much energy, I shouldn&#39;t be eating this much! So cut backs became easy. Filled the void with lots of water and eating much better, paying attention to lower carb as well.</p>

<p>As far as hallucinogens, let&#39;s hope marijuana becomes legal.... like yesterday. If you know what I mean. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had any such opportunity in a while, <em>but</em> I can say that it frees you in such a way. Find a calm time after work, don&#39;t eat before hand, settle yourself in at home and let the Earth just hug you in such a way you&#39;ve never felt before. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve become more consciously aware of my surroundings. I&#39;ve been given this feeling that I&#39;m not to alarm those who are not &quot;awake&quot;, do not scare others that have remained in their dormant state. It&#39;s brought attraction in numerous people towards me - those that want to be near me as a little bit of a beacon of light, and repelled equally just as many (who I guess find me abrasive in the wakened state? Which is why I&#39;ve only talked about personal &quot;ascension&quot; details to those that notice it in themselves)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced this for sure. It&#39;s really brought up a lot of questions regarding ethics for me. I&#39;ve been having these internal experiences, I&#39;ve started to simply &quot;know&quot; things. But it also came with the knowledge that I need to be very careful about who I share this info with, not for <em>my</em> safety, but for <em>theirs.</em> Too much interference from &quot;awake&quot; people can have a negative effect on other&#39;s ascension. I guess we gotta live and let live, and trust that everyone will come around to this when they have done the internal work necessary to be ready for it. All we can do is be there to great them with open arms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for not sharing with others and in limited bits, yes, absolutely. </p>

<p>I stumbled across a few sayings that have really helped guide me, in the past few months. 
Maybe it&#39;s good food for thought for anyone else that sees this too, if you&#39;ve crossed this path, here&#39;s your sign.</p>

<p>Religious teachings from different parts of humanity, if you&#39;re experiencing anything like this are a great way to center yourself: (Whether you&#39;re religious or not, there is something to be learned and shared here)</p>

<ul>
<li>Peter asked Jesus, &quot;What about him, Lord?&quot;
Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!”  “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”</li>
</ul>

<p>That quote has helped me come to terms with <em>I shouldn&#39;t wake people up from the matrix that don&#39;t want to be waken up. It&#39;s not their time.</em> They will see good changes happening around them on their own in different ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/b09Tb">Dalai Lama quote</a></p>

<p>That has helped me listen more, pay attention to the small details and build better bonds with people.
Listening can be tough!</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/gcKwy">And this one from a Yogi</a></p>

<p>When you can <em>just tell</em> someone is upset and you&#39;ve not done anything, well, it&#39;s not your fault. Reminding yourself this is a good mastery. However pointing this out to people won&#39;t make them want to be friendly! (Learned that one a few times... all I want to do is help, I pay attention, good intentions I promise!)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found myself in a new balancing act, and it&#39;s exciting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So interesting. I, too, have been experiencing random &#39;knowings&#39;. For example, walking down the street, it randomly dawns on me how similar the physical make up of an atom (nucleus + electrons flying around it like a ring) is to that of saturn and its rings. So, the make up of planets is similar to the make up of humans. Hmm. That suggests that I might be something larger or more vast than I had originally assumed/been taught. Hmm. Well, then what am I? What is this &#39;I&#39;? Whose is it? Where was it before I was born? Where does it go when &#39;I&#39; die? etc. etc. etc. </p>

<p>Also, I tried lsd a few weeks ago with two buddies. Both are intellectuals. One of them begged for me to talk existentialism. The other demanded that I not. After bringing up, &quot;We do not exist the way we &#39;think&#39; we do,&quot; one of the two friends went into an incredibly deep and profound panic. My other friend and I thought he was going to literally lose his mind. It was if he had been consumed by negativity itself. I agree. Some people are prone to triggers when considering existence. If one is ready to view the truth, which often means forgetting the entire idea of your self because it is illusory, one opens one&#39;s heart to a new degree of love, because I feel you have to in order to know what the truth really is. Those who are not prepared to know the truth can easily become incredibly fearful of what they are told. The ego is fragile, in many cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed a change since this July. My heart lept when you mentioned that we might be part of something larger than we&#39;ve been taught. Here&#39;s, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5hc8ct/just_as_individual_cells_are_born_live_and_die/">post</a> I made with a similar idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individual cells are born, live, and die. Combined, they are essential to together make a completely different expression of life, which is ourselves. Individually, however, they have no concept of us as a human. They have no idea that together they make up something more.</p>

<p>If this is true, and if you believe that humans are not special or central to the universe, I posit that it is likely or nearly must be true that we, also, are individual living beings which make up a larger organism or structure which we cannot see or comprehend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, friend. I will add, however, that I&#39;m not sure my dark night has ceased. Lately, I&#39;ve been having such strange emotional callings, almost like magnetic drives, that it makes me start to question whether or not I&#39;m embracing some sort of schizophrenic experience. But, behind all the concern, is something that feels bigger than me, something that is telling me to go with it and to let it happen. I&#39;m aware that I must sound nuts lol. Cheers.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen your girlfriend in a few days, or you missed something you normally catch, your routine thrown off... these all influences unspent emotion. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let it get to you. We all feel it, and sometimes it sucks! That weighed down dread feeling is not fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! It&#39;s like a strange and fun roller coaster where we&#39;re all connecting. I had battled depression too which lead to my reality check.</p>

<p>To look deeper down the rabbit hole and experience something that is akin to ... <a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/">well can angels and sentient beings</a> get online?  This person has such a vast knowledge, it&#39;s like speaking to a computer that can give you emotion and feeling behind the facts and answers. That personal touch that a regular computer does not have.</p>

<p>But that link comes with the warning: as always there is lots of disinformation and misinformation, if this person is of any significance as it seems, just remind yourself that there are those that <em>will actively oppose</em> this person and have no problem voicing that opinion. </p>

<p>This person backs up what they say, and I&#39;m cool with learning whatever I can all the time. That&#39;s what matters to me, they&#39;re spreading good information that&#39;s backed up by fact, actively wanting to share good morals and ideas. Isn&#39;t that what we all want?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look at Alan Watts youtube videos, sounds fun! Thank you for that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most damning thing that&#39;s ever happened to me was when I was looking to sell my home and upgrade.  We were looking at $150,000 homes, and not anything higher; had filters on.  But somehow a $165,000 home, perfect for us, showed up in the listing.</p>

<p>I knew my wife wouldn&#39;t go for something &quot;out of our budget,&quot; so to speak, so I took her on a &quot;Sunday drive&quot; through the neighborhood where this house was, as I felt compelled to see this house. </p>

<p>We get there, and I go, &quot;Oh, look, a for-sale sign!&quot;  Wink, wink.   I tell her I&#39;m going up to talk to the owner directly, with no realtors (because I am feeling magnetically drawn to this home for some reason).</p>

<p>The rest is history.  Owner gave us a private tour, we cut the realtors out.  And when I walked into their kitchen, every device in there - the fridge, the stove, the microwave - and my phone, were all in sync at 11:11.  And I got goosebumps.</p>

<p>I now own this house.  Several weeks later we found out we were pregnant with our 3rd child, and that the extra bedroom was necessary, or we wouldn&#39;t have had enough room for everyone.</p>

<p>We later discovered this home was just 5 minutes away from our closest living relative, who turned out to rely heavily on us for babysitting, and vice versa, and is walking distance away.  </p>

<p>This. doesn&#39;t. just. happen.</p>

<p>There are no coincidences. </p>

<p>In the Nag Hammadi/gnostic stuff, there are clearly evil characters.  Archons, mostly.  They aren&#39;t just actors, pretending to be bad, as hidden hand says.</p>

<p>The Ra stuff...  I read some portions of it.  Always got the &quot;I&#39;m being lied to&quot; vibe, more than I did from hidden hand, even.  Plus, I&#39;ll never trust anybody named Horus, or Ra.  He seemed pretty parasitic to his channel, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hidden Hand describes things as if they are not even part of the surface-dwelling earth population, and that they are either underground or off-planet.  And that they are here to &quot;help&quot; us - not sure if I can take them at their word there, about the whole &quot;95% Negative Harvest&quot; thing.  It may be the only falsehood in that testimony: their painting of themselves are &quot;saviors&quot; of sorts, here to help us &quot;make the decision.&quot;  Right.  Because raping and murdering babies as part of a pedo ring <em>HAD</em> to happen to get us to wake up, there&#39;s no other way.  Uh-huh.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horus is also known as the &quot;all seeing eye&quot; on the Illuminati pyramid, and is worshipped by occultists in those circles, so yeah, I am suspect of anything identifying as an Egyptian god.  They want you to believe they came peacefully and &quot;gave&quot; despotic kinds of Egypt technology, and wanted them to use it for &quot;good.&quot;  Right.  Because man never abuses their power.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear these entities share tech with the elite so they can use it to enslave us; otherwise, they could distribute it to the &quot;everyman&quot; and take the system down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came across the Ra material about a month ago, and read all of it (four books + one book of personal material outtakes). </p>

<p>I support you in reading it. It has helped me a lot, and there are many points of resonance that I found to be anchor points. It came to me at just the right time, and I find it surprising to see it mentioned on here at all. I find that when it comes up in conversation with people that are unfamiliar with it, I often expect outright rejection of it. But, I am surprised time and time again that, despite its origin being seemingly difficult to swallow for some, the content has a deep resonance with people that have been undergoing their own awakening in their own way. </p>

<p>For the most part, I think that when you come across the Ra material, it most likely ready to read it if you are interested in service to others. I suspect that it will not resonate with people that aren&#39;t interested in service to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question.  Depends.  In many ways I think I might be pretty service to self - as I am sacrificing a great deal to get what I want in this life.</p>

<p>I try to be as conscientious and aware as I can of helping others, however.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m really not super sure if I truly am &quot;service to self&quot; or &quot;service to others&quot;.</p>

<p>I mean...we ALL are at least <em>somewhat</em> &quot;service to self&quot;.  It seems we <em>have</em> to be.  Otherwise we die if we don&#39;t make sure be service to self enough to <em>feed</em> and clothe and care for ourselves - even if it happens to be at the expense (temporary or otherwise) of others.  So we&#39;re <em>all</em> &quot;service to self&quot; to some extent.</p>

<p>Now...as far as the extent to which we are (or <em>I</em> am) service to others?  Again...I&#39;d say I try to be.  I try to be as aware and conscious of helping others as I can.</p>

<p>I do NOT take shit from people though and am not afraid to rage on someone pretty quickly if I feel they&#39;re being unfair or negative toward me or others.</p>

<p>So...I&#39;m not sure, honestly.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could take a look through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ghjgt/iama_person_who_gave_a_complete_stranger_cpr_this/">this IAMA I did a few years ago</a> and you could assess whether I&#39;m a service to self or a service to others type of person.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>That is all very different from keeping ourselves alive.  I got into an argument with someone else over some authors, motivational speakers, etc. who use the LAW OF ATTRACTION to their advantage for profit, and who have nice homes, etc. to show for it.</p>

<p>I totally disagree that there is anything wrong with having abundance.  To the contrary, I believe Infinite Intelligence intends for us to understand that we can all have anything we want, that it is within our grasp if we just ask for it.</p>

<p>I’ve been working consciously on at least some level or another for I’d say 20+ years at thinking about, facing, and not having great (if any) fear of death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think most of us know, however, when we are unethically exploiting people for blatant personal gain, or inflicting pain on someone intentionally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think on a certain level, what you say is valid.  However, if I really wanted to, I really <em>could</em> fly to, say, Africa and go help people in greater need than I.  I really <em>could</em> go tend to the homeless and help out at soup kitchens, etc. - which I’ve done before…but I could do it <em>more</em>.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> do those things…but I’m not.  I don’t.</p>

<p>And yet I <em>know</em> others are not only hurting and starving, but would be hurting and starving <em>less</em> if I helped them…and yet I’m not doing that…</p>

<p>So I’m not sure if I can really classify myself as any real type of “service to others” person.</p>

<p>…Maybe there’s grey area because I <del>also don’t think that I’m</del> <em>know</em> I’m not a COMPLETELY “service to self” type.  No way.  I’m actually even more certain of that than I am of a lot of things in this life.</p>

<p>most of our survival instincts - where we act desperate, fearful, and hurt others in the process - would be eliminated if we simply understood there is truly nothing to fear.</p>

<p>We understand that we have nothing to fear when we understand that All Is One and that what we fear is another version of The One Self which we ourselves are just as much a part of and one with as whatever it is we may run in fear from.</p>

<p>We are all at different stages of this understanding.  Some of us don’t have even the slightest conscious awareness of this.  Others of us have almost entirely imbued this into our beings.  Most of us are somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Oh I’ve thought about that <em>ooooofffften</em>.  I think to myself “WTF did Africans do in a past life to deserve what’s happening to them collectively now?  Wow.”</p>

<p>And you know what I often think?  I regularly think that Africans might <em>actually</em> have been the super advanced, Egyptian/Lemurian peoples of ancient times.  They had great power and great knowledge.  However, I think there might have been a possibility that they got a bit too uppity/overconfident, etc with their power and maybe did some really bad things with it - destroyed themselves or just had <em>way</em> too many slaves and did too many debauchery-filled things, etc.  I don’t know.</p>

<p>So now?  In this day and age/civilization?  The people of that super advanced society of ancient times are coming back today as beaten down slaves.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t know.  Just spit balling.</p>

<p>Perhaps in another civilization or two from, karma will make Europeans come back as the slaves of the future.</p>

<p>Europeans <em>are</em> slaves.  They have been slaves.  You are a slave to your white American culture and government that you believe defines you and dictates who and what you are, what you should do with your life and value.  But that&#39;s false.  Look around you.  White people/Europeans have been slaves for so long you cannot even imagine the possibility you are <em>literally</em> a slave.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m Native American and I can see the trauma your ancestors, distant and near, suffered by being told they should enslave and brutalize other humans for the sake of their slavemasters.  You have been TRICKED.  That is the reality.  </p>

<p>Uh…yeah.  That’s a bit different kind of “slave” than I’m talking about.  This is a “metaphorical slave” that you’re referring to here.  I’m not talking about that.  I’m talking about a LITERAL SLAVE.</p>

<p>Yeah.  They might be a slave to their status - but it’s much better to be a slave to having to “keep up appearances” than being an <em>actual</em> slave who’s appearance is about a thousand times worse than the European “slave” mindset you just described above here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Missing the point a bit here.  Nobody’s saying that “No white person has it tough!”  That’s not what’s being said, and that’s not the point.</p>

<p>The point is that regardless of how bad Europeans have <em>ever</em> had it in, say, the past few centuries, that’s still nothing compared to how bad Africans have had it - and they’ve had it that bad for the most part <em>at the hands</em> of Europeans.</p>

<p>There’s just no way to argue against this fact.</p>

<p>Dude…smh.  You have <em>no</em> idea what you’re talking about.  Stop assuming you know anything about my genetics.</p>

<p>I’m mixed.  I have pretty much everyone in me - European, African, Native (not Native American - Native islander), Asian, etc.</p>

<p>You’re dealing in exceptions to the rule and being ignorant (purposefully or accidentally) of the fact that AS A WHOLE white people have enslaved non-white people throughout centuries.  Period.</p>

<p>As a Native American, you of all people should REALLY know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a metaphor. It is factual.  Yes Europeans did those things but they did them as literal slaves themselves and suffered trauma for it.</p>

<p>Lol &quot;if&quot;...  because IF I am then I must share your limited perspective.   I am Native American, Lipan Apache and Shawnee.  I hold this view and understanding through a broader perspective.   I see the pain and confusion white people are in and the trick that has been played on them is that they think white people are privileged and I understand that humanity needs them to wake up to this truth. </p>

<p>White people  might be their house slaves but they are still their slaves.  They must come to this understanding of their true position in global society and that the atrocities their ancestors perpetuated was done out of an evil manipulation they are still grappling with.  It is not an EXCUSE but it is the way forward.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  There were (even still are) European slaves.  Doesn’t matter.  Not diminishing that, but the fact is that there have been a LOT more African and <em>non</em> European slaves than there have been European slaves.</p>

<p>The fact is the the financial elites and kings of past on the planet in recent history have been European more than most other races, and it is they who have been responsible for the most enslavement on the planet.  And yes, some Europeans have been victims of these elites, but it’s been, again, <em>non</em> Europeans that have suffered most greatly.</p>

<p>You’re simply confused into thinking that I’m somehow trying to be negative toward Europeans when in reality I’m simply pointing out facts that <em>you</em> are misinterpreting.</p>

<p>EVERYONE needs to wake up.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the entire human species needs to wake up - but that includes being aware of who’s enslaving who.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found that list intriguing. Some of the things there I&#39;ve noticed since childhood, but I stopped counting after I&#39;d checked off 21 items on it. The one about the tingling head is what really got me; it&#39;s hard to explain, but for the past year I&#39;ve had this pain on the crown of my head... It&#39;s not the scalp that hurts, it&#39;s the actual hair when it moves. Doctor didn&#39;t seem concerned when I brought it up. </p>

<p>I have MS - I usually just assume any neurological weirdness is because of it, but I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s hard because anything that happens to me (mental or physical) can be blamed on it, so no one takes me seriously.</p>

<p>I almost constantly hear a high pitched hum. The closest thing to it I can remember is the high frequency hum of an older tube style TV. I remember noticing that as a kid, if a TV was muted I could tell it was on. I hear it most of the time I&#39;m awake and it makes me wonder if it&#39;s me hearing electricity somehow. I make this assumption only because we have this pair of headphones that sit on a charging base. It can&#39;t be plugged in when I&#39;m around due to the noise the plug itself emits. I&#39;m the only one hearing the plug, too. </p>

<p>As for recent changes, I&#39;ve been in anxiety overdrive since about mid-July. Since then I&#39;ve taken up cooking my meals and snacks, and have finally come to the realization that it&#39;s all just &quot;stuff&quot; and I don&#39;t want anymore of it.  I saw the soul sucking big corp I was working for for what it was, and jumped ship a few weeks before the anxiety started. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so disheartening hearing the daily stories. I worked for a Canadian company that was bought out by a larger Canadian company a couple years ago. Over the past two years I&#39;ve watched them suck all life and culture out of the  other office, packaging the big names out, killing the spirit of the minions. 2017 is the year they start purging entire departments. Somehow people still don&#39;t see it coming... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  Because having depression makes people feel unexplained vibrations in their solar plexus, absent any recent stress or specific events to trigger it.  Let me get on some pills to fix that right away.  I have a good life.  I have 3 beautiful children and a successful business, and a full time day job.  I have a beautiful wife and a large, loving extended family.  And I live near nature, and can go for walks as I please, which is my favorite thing to do.  I am far from what you would consider the type of person to experience mental illness.</p>

<p>But go on and diagnosis complete strangers based on a simple inquiry.  Go right ahead, if that makes you feel fantastic.  </p>

And I can see through all the little small talk and dramas people act out in society. It&#39;s become incredibly noticeable and disgusting, like realizing everyone is a marionette dancing along in one big show, oblivious. Will they all wake up soon? What will they say to me if they do, so that I know? Or will people simply stop the consumerism and the insanity and restructure their lives so that one day I notice a lack of people around? Thoughts on where the negativity I&#39;m feeling is coming from? That&#39;s what I can&#39;t puzzle out.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know its like I watch these documentaries on how these fucking ELITE&#39;s like Rothschild and other bankers are messing with the countries and looking back at the past I think they made my country literally a third world,my place would have been more wonderful and healthy and less populated if those British cucks woudn&#39;t have invaded us.</p>

<p>I think what will happen when everyone will knew that the money we get is nothing but a piece of paper,the wars are just for profit of minority and not natural,soon people will hang the curropt motherfuckers and then we will start a technological revolution.</p>

<p>These days I usually think of forming a new settlement some place else,where unison harmony like sitting in a middle of night with booze and weed in a bon fire with some robots doing the farming alongside connected to a solar powered cell.</p>

<p>Children in my locality will have round conference debate table where they select the topic look at it with different view point and debate on it.</p>

<p>The same with values and way of life,they discuss on what&#39;s logical and more practical and work on it,rather to listen to some old nut monk and take his words as a totalitarian.</p>

<p>I have got tons of things in my mind to fuck this system and live someplace else and enjoy the fucking part of life,this democracy shit never works,its always that majority of fool elect a major fool who then fucks up with the development process of life.</p>

<p>We have to do things as a species,there are many more other problems to look at rather to fight among ourselves,they are robbing our intellectual by making us think that the currencies are ultimate device of value,but with civil disobiedience we can make their system fail.</p>

<p>Majority of Democracy on this earth are Banana Republic and those who works fine are the small populated state with good percentage of literacy.</p>

<p>I find myself playing a steam game for all of 30 minutes online and I&#39;m about played out, fast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been feeling that some demonic shit is going on. I feel like all these deaths are ritual sacrifices by the elite to conjure up some energy or something because they&#39;re desperate. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been thinking about God for the past week.  I came to the conclusion that he created us from a part of his soul and split us up and gave us different identities or &quot;egos&quot;. So when these people that do psychedlic drugs talk about &quot;ego death&quot; they&#39;re talking about feeling this limited part of God&#39;s soul that is in all of us. I feel like we&#39;re the only creation that has this honor. He gave us these attributes so that he we can get to know him and be thankful to him. </p>

Sometimes my battery percentage will go along with it. Sometimes it will be repeated numbers. Like i looked at the clock at 2:22 on the 22nd of December and my phones battery had 22%. Lots of little random coincidences like that. </p>

<p>Im just assuming they&#39;re like the numbers from lost and i wont ever figure out what they mean and we&#39;re also in purgatory. :)</p>

I&#39;ve never been as hungry for knowledge and achievements (certifications etc) as I have been over the past couple of years. 
I also see 13:37 way more often than is normal. 
Also, when pouring a drink out, from whatever size bottle, the fluid is absolutely in line with the label way more often than is normal when I put the bottle down. 
I&#39;ve not been able to find any reasoning for this bit there are patterns. Noticeable and odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am crying atm, I have been trying to find others who have been experiencing these sensations, this is really happening...</p>

<p>I feel so powerful, nothing can stop me, I have the power of us all flowing through me, the experiences I&#39;ve come face to face to in my life moulded my mind to think a certain way. To think of those around me and not myself, for those around me and myself are one in the same, and now that the time has come, and the source energy is flowing freely through us all again, I know my purpose is to help others come to realisation, and to fight this evil on the front lines.</p>

<p>I would love to hear more from anyone, maybe we can all link up our flow and try to focus on sending out positive energy to the world at the same time. I feel like those who have experienced these physical and psychological changes are able to send powerful messages to others.</p>

<p>This is all new to me, but it feels like I&#39;ve known about this since before I was born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve been constantly noticing 9:11, 11:11, :33 for the last few months when I look at the time.</p>

<p>My compulsion to seek truth really picked up early 2016 because I was worried about TPP and the US election. I live in Canada but I was petrified of the prospect of Hillary winning the election(I was born in yugoslavia in the 90&#39;s). That was also around the time I actually started looking into the objectives of the n w o and noticed similarities between those objectives and the kind of people Hillary surrounded herself with. I had heard of the n w o in the past but regrettably didn&#39;t look into it deeply enough back then.</p>

<p>That being said, I thought this compulsion would subside after the election and it did for about a week but then it picked up again. I should point out that I&#39;m a gamer and have probably played 25% as much in 2016 as I did the year prior. It&#39;s not that I have a lack of games to play either.
Another major change is that I&#39;ve been trying to follow a vegan diet the last few months and have been semi successful. I&#39;ve slipped up a few times with dairy but I haven&#39;t eaten meat since September. I really don&#39;t think I&#39;ll eat animals again in my life. Just doesn&#39;t feel right. If only y&#39;all knew exactly how much meat I was consuming prior to that.</p>

<p>What am I to make of all this? I&#39;m starting to believe all the shitty experiences I&#39;ve had in my life happened for a reason. For example: I was a white refugee going to a Catholic elementary school where I was mentally, physically, and emotionally bullied on a frequent basis the entire time I was there. I had suicidal thoughts before I was 10 and began questioning my entire existence. After fleeing a civil war and being abused by supposed children of God, not only was my faith in Society shattered, but my perspective on life was much different than your average western child. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be so concerned about the Truth if I lived a happier life.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m the type of person that can make a difference though so I&#39;m doubtful that I&#39;ve been selected for some greater purpose.</p>

I wasn&#39;t sure if it was because of side effects of my medication, or the fact that I&#39;m newly separated, but mentally and spiritually, i don&#39;t even suffer from anxiety anymore. </p>

<p>I prefer to connect with people now, and help others with the wisdom I&#39;ve gained in my meditation. I see things I didn&#39;t used to and feel at peace about the world. I feel brave now wheras i used to cower into my bubble. I truly feel that our world is being phased into something new. Very gradually. We are being tested and helped and watched. Religions of the world are like training wheels of spirituality for humans. </p>

<p>Everything will be ok. Big changes are happening. </p>

This is a whole can-o-worms in itself that is a deeper issue entirely, <em>but</em> the instant gratification and desire for insta-satisfaction has really corroded it&#39;s way in to people. Enjoy the game, don&#39;t just play it because you&#39;re bored. </p>

<p>Find a rabbit hole to go down on youtube! Something that interests you and goes with you beliefs. Do you find conspiracy stuff as fun, pick your favorite one and go watch something about it. The suggestion bar on the side, follow your soul and click through - maybe the universe is showing you a sign &quot;Hey, check this out, over here!&quot;... and obviously you don&#39;t have to watch a full 2 minute video if you clicked and instantly realize it&#39;s bogus, go to the next one. This has been my favorite thing to do recently, quenching that insatiable thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not alone, and you&#39;re not left out! You&#39;re exactly where you need to be, because you&#39;re there right then and now. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone has different sensitivities and is on a different schedule/time table.  But it also has to do with you and this is where free will comes in.  It is your choice of when/if you are going to be open to this.  There seems to be three ways you can jumpstart this though:  Turning off your tv/unplug from media, meditate, change your diet.  </p>

<p>For me changing to a vegan diet, which truthfully was motivated primarily by pure vanity, made something click inside me.  It lifted a fog of some sort and I began to reconnect to my sense of empathy for all things including myself, rocks, plants - I swear I saw the plants try to communicate with me, they move. They vibrate their leaves in such a way where it is so clearly not a breeze or wind.  I spent a lot of time staring at that until I had to give in that I was truly seeing what I was seeing and it made me cry!  I was an atheist but I can&#39;t deny what I&#39;m experiencing. </p>

<p>I reached to a point that I hope everyone else has gotten to. I still don&#39;t believe yet, but I feel like I&#39;m on the edge.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve starting seeing patterns. I&#39;ve felt strongly nostalgic. Watching old cartoons I grew up with. Looking for toys I had when i was child on ebay and such. Like I&#39;m looking further and further backwards looking for something.</p>

<p>Like a earlier post here, as a child I was able to tell when a tube tv was on or off. I was able to feel it&#39;s fhq. And that noise started to pop up freely and it&#39;s getting stronger and stronger this past year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking trough my old drawings and I&#39;m finding questionable patterns. My thoughts and feelings this year has open my eyes...very quickly. I&#39;m scared yet I feel hopeful. Like..I know it&#39;ll be ok.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over the past few months, I, for the first time in my life, paid attention to politics (I&#39;m 26). I have literally felt that something was deeply wrong with the world and that my people weren&#39;t aware. As pizzagate unfolded, I started questioning everything I&#39;d ever known to be true outside of my own self. In learning that nothing I ever thought to be true really seemed to actually be true, my conscious then led me to question what the hell &#39;I&#39; really am. That process led me to understanding that &#39;I&#39; do not exist -- that &#39;I&#39; am a collection of thought-memories and experiences -- and that what &#39;I&#39; really am is the One Energy, the One Creator. In summary, recognizing that my world did not exist the way I thought it did, I began to suffer immensely, which led to existential questions, which led me to discovering that none of us exist the way we &#39;think&#39; we do. The past few months have changed my life forever. I have a more intimate, open, and loving consciousness. And my ego is dying day by day.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t gone on to find definitions that apply to what I&#39;ve come to know as truth. I certainly believe mind, body, and soul exist. But there is no one there for whom they exist. There is no ownership. The sensation of &#39;mine&#39; is illusory and often results in massive suffering, as it did my own case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yeah, I love this thread. I grew up as skeptic as they could be. From a very young age I took a very hard-line &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; approach to the nature of reality. About 6 years ago I took mushrooms for the first time, and it definitely softened my stance on all things &quot;woo woo.&quot; So I&#39;ve been a bit more open minded over the past few years, but 2016 was a doozy for me. In the past year I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experienced every single symptom OP mentions in this post and then some.</li>
<li>Made major life changes regarding work and diet. I didn&#39;t even consciously mean to, it just kinda happened (and all for the better!)</li>
<li>Tuned into my chakra system and began opening and clearing them, and moving energy through them. This happened before I even &quot;believed&quot; in chakras. </li>
<li>Experienced automatic writing, which lead to connecting to my spiritual guides (whom I now know by name).</li>
<li>Connected with a ghost.</li>
<li>Connected with a few spirits while hiking in the woods.</li>
<li>Connected with a past-life experience.</li>
<li>Seen and felt vibrations from plants and crystals. There was one day where I could even hear the vibration coming from a flower patch. It was so beautiful I was moved to tears.</li>
<li>Experienced &quot;clear knowing&quot; about...well, just stuff. I just know things about my life and other people. Always little things, though. Like a friend will start telling me a story about their day and I&#39;ll already know the whole thing. Or my SO will tell me about a dream he had and a fully detailed explanation of it&#39;s symbols will pop into my head out of nowhere. This one is a bit difficult to explain. But information seems to just come to me and its somehow different from normal thinking.</li>
<li>For almost an entire month, seeing number synchronicities was nearly constant. Upwards of 15 times a day. I&#39;m still seeing them daily, but not as much.</li>
<li>Felt the compulsion to investigate more conspiracy theories (hey guyyyys!!!!), and have become a believer in many of them.</li>
<li>As soon as these things happened to me, I started noticing them happening to other people around me. I&#39;ve had friends reach out to me, unprompted, to discuss some of this stuff.</li>
<li>Just the tip of the iceberg, there has been so much more than what I&#39;ve written here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely NONE of this happened prior to 2016. It was one hell of a year. I fully came to know that I am on a spiritual path, and it&#39;s awesome. And I mean the very literal definition of awesome. I am in awe every time I have these experiences.</p>

<p>I really love all of you for sharing your stories. I&#39;ve been very afraid of judgment and it has slowed me down in &quot;coming out&quot; as a spiritual person. But I don&#39;t want to live in fear of judgment and skepticism anymore. So thank you guys, for sharing your stories. I love you all. </p>

<p>And to the skeptics who may think I&#39;m crazy- I understand how you feel and I respect that, and I have no interest in convincing you that what I say is the truth. Your skepticism is a good thing and I would never tell you you&#39;re wrong. Critical thinking is a valuable skill. But I also won&#39;t let your skepticism keep me quiet anymore. No more fear of being perceived as &quot;crazy.&quot; In 2017 and beyond I will live as my authentic self.</p>

<p>Our collective consciousness IS CHANGING. Its changing in me, and I&#39;m seeing the changes everywhere I look. It&#39;s real, people. What is happening is <em>really</em> happening. If you&#39;re ready to believe in it, then believe in it and don&#39;t hold back. There is a very rich, lush world to be uncovered within. It is so beautiful and I am so happy for all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s on thing I&#39;ve learned in my time on the planet, its that your intuition (&quot;gut feeling&quot;) is a powerful force.  Don&#39;t be afraid to &quot;hear&quot; / &quot;feel&quot; what it&#39;s telling you and follow it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been steered wrong, and have had many net gains out of potential large loss scenarios by listening to, and feeling, what mine is putting out for me.  Thinking strongly about it, there&#39;s never been a time in which I&#39;ve followed it (&quot;my gut&quot;), and had it lead me to something negative.  Always a neutral out of what easily could&#39;ve been deep negative, or a positive out of a neutral situation.</p>

<p>Never in my life did I think that I&#39;d find other like-minded people. I thought I was alone, and I think that&#39;s the most beautiful part of all this: we all did some solitary in life. We&#39;ve done our research, and felt the loneliness that broods from living in a world so strange as this one. But now we can all come together and heal each other a little bit, bit by bit, because we need to be strong to fight the war on truth. </p>

Like even if we had paused the movie to take a call or make a cup of tea etc, which doesn&#39;t happen every night, but 00:35 is always consistent.

<p>The only changes I&#39;ve noticed lately is I&#39;m really getting a lot of place and time feelings. All of a sudden it feels like I&#39;m back in high school, or a kid playing in the forest again, or some places I&#39;ve traveled.

    <div class="md"><p>This spiritual awakening happened for me starting in 2012. I&#39;ve always been a die-hard Catholic, but something was pushing me to learn more about different religions and spiritualities. I began eating differently (cleaner), went pretty much holistic, cut negative people out - even long-time friends - started studying about the energies and healing properties of rocks and minerals, got into meditation and essential oils, etc. etc.  I also could no longer stand loud noises.</p>

<p>A couple months later is when the repeating numbers started showing up.  11s and 22s.  CONSTANT.  It freaked me out so badly at first that I was actually keeping a journal of sorts as to how often I would see them.  And the synchronicities were mind-blowing.  Like, I&#39;d pull a picture book out while absentmindedly watching tv, open to a random page and start reading, then whatever I was reading was then mentioned on tv.  One night my family and I watched a movie.  Over the next two days I saw the name of the movie in three completely different places - a book in the library (not about the movie), on a personalized license plate, and mentioned on a history show (it was the name of a ship in the 1600s).  Another time I was taking a day trip.  I&#39;d set the trip monitor and looked down to see how much further I had to go.  It was 63 miles and I&#39;d driven 57.  Just then, a car pulled out of a business ahead of me, and when I caught up to him at the light, I couldn&#39;t believe it - his license plate was only four numbers - 6357.</p>

<p>This went on for a while - the numbers and synchronicity - but stopped for a bit as life got busier.  I got too busy for pretty much everything, meditation included.  But the &quot;push&quot; started again a few months ago.  I also noticed that my intuition has recently increased dramatically.  I&#39;ll have a random thought and a few minutes later someone in my family says it.  On Christmas I kept getting a vision of something that my husband had gotten me.  It was something I&#39;d desired, but had not mentioned, and would not have asked for because of the cost.  But damn if he didn&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>According to some of the spiritualists that I follow, this is a supreme time of collective consciousness and soul evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So years ago I used to dabble in &quot;lightworker&quot; stuff but life happened and a lot of negative experiences happened to me to harden my heart. Starting in November I&#39;ve felt drawn back to spirituality. I even bought my first pack of tarot cards 2 weeks ago and was shocked to draw the same card several times after shuffling each time. My gut was telling me &quot;hey this is statistically improbable, there&#39;s something going on.&quot; It also seems like because of my negative experiences I have an easier time discerning real spiritual info from ego-driven fluff (because my ego is stronger now and I know how it acts), and holding my mental space above the crowds telling me what to think and believe (a useful skill in these times).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, maybe, but how does someone explain the life stability that came after experiencing these symptoms? Obviously I&#39;m not speaking for everyone, but having these experiences directly corresponded to me living a more stable, fulfilling life. My job situation improved, my bank account improved, my relationships with others improved. I achieved many of the goals I set out to achieve in the last year. My depression and anxiety went away. My therapist and my doctor both commended me in the huge progress I made in my mental and physical health. If it were schizophrenia, why would I be in such a better position in my life?</p>

<p>To those of you who are experiencing these symptoms and are worried about your mental health: I say, explore all avenues of inquiry. Speak to a mental health professional and your doctor. Talk to people you trust, and talk to people you don&#39;t know. Talk to the skeptics and the believers. Get all the information you can and figure it out <em>for yourself.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked at the site, but I do coding for a living and am well aware of the underlying technology/techniques to make that. It largely relies on parsing/scraping (no issues here) which is then fed into a mix of NLP (Natural Language Processing, a branch of machine learning) algorithms such as sentiment analysis. The reason I bring this up isn&#39;t because it works or doesn&#39;t works. It&#39;s got an established track record. However, almost every machine learning algorithm depend on training. That is, your results completely change depending on what data you train on. Training is the phase where you let the neural net learn based on examples. For the most part, neural networks do not change after training and for a good reason; you wouldn&#39;t be able to manage the noise easily, which would probably result in progressively less reliable outputs. And it is this somewhat inflexible nature that is very double sided edge. Over time, not being able to retrain might mean you start diverging and make bad conclusions. You always have the option to retrain and reprocess the data but this is a lot of work in itself, in addition to take a while to run. You have to understand that it is mostly a set of black boxes that at training time we knew how good they were performing, but for which we extrapolated that that same margin of error will remain throughout on new previously unseen data. </p>

<p>Ultimately, nobody will be able to explain to you how it came to any conclusion (except maybe with LIME...). It&#39;s like a semi-reliable narrator if you will. It&#39;s as best as we know to get good results, but it&#39;s also very tough to keep the models good across time. And this applies to every machine learning project. Any sufficiently tortured data will tell you anything you wish to know. It&#39;s easy to disregard the data we don&#39;t want to see and keep trying until a model gives what we expect to see, which is pretty much like saying you can entirely control the narrative and force some conclusions from them. You need really talented and aware people to make those models and how to train them properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My awakening started when I started watching Ancient Aliens a few years ago.  It made me question what we are told.</p>

<p>As a kid I was always interested in space.</p>

<p>This led to my interest in learning about ancient civilizations and religion.</p>

<p>My research led me to a book likely of Theosophy that some of you have heard of called the Kybalion.  I found it to have interesting philosophies that I have used to try to classify things as positive or negative.  I also use its ideas to use what is basically self mind control.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I came to the idea that I would rather not exist than exist in this world.  Shortly after, I remembered that suicide is considered an evil act in most religions.  I would consider it to be a destructive act in the negative spectrum as opposed to a creative act in the positive spectrum.  I have a great family around me so it would have caused a great amount of suffering.</p>

<p>So I figured, what the heck, might as well subscribe to a religion that offers some positive outcome for continuing to live in this world.  I tend to agree with what many religions are saying from an ethical perspective,  I have a lot of respect for all positively oriented religions.  That was when I have started to feel something deep inside.  Maybe it is what people call increasing your vibration or being filled by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>My prayers for a higher power to show me the truth have led me here and I learn more and more about how deep the corruption of our world runs.  My belief is that there will come a positive force to counteract the negative force.</p>

<p>Seeing the connection to Satanism has only strengthened my faith.  It makes sense to me that evil people would have the most power in this world being able to take advantage of good people.  I feel that either they will be stricken with their bad karma or the second coming will set things straight.</p>

<p>Writing things from a stream of consciousness that last pages and pages with beautiful language that I wouldn&#39;t be able to do in my regular life. Making connections between ancient religions that I had never thought before, questioning status quo and even the character archetypes within religions, like, Lucifer being the hero, and the good side losing resulting in the state of reality now.</p>

<p>I even empathized with the idea of globalism, like perhaps it is a necessary pain to take care of our wild and unaware populace like we would a stray dog.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s mania, schizophrenia, a coming of age for a generation, or a real scientific phenomena, but it makes me feel like there&#39;s hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but this is fucking retarded.</p>

<p>Yeah just give people a list of 50 symptoms and let them &#39;read into it&#39;. This is the same reason doctors don&#39;t tell you to look up your symptoms if its not something you do often and could read in to, because people will see that they have 50 different forms of cancers and then get an anxiety attack.</p>

<p>Seeing repeating numbers is nothing. You look at the clock 500 times a day, you see so many numbers every day, you only mentally note the times when the clock has convenient numbers for you... now you think you&#39;re seeing 9/11 everywhere!</p>

<p>Video games are not FUN ANYMORE! Video games are not designed to be fulfilling, not anymore.. They&#39;re designed to sell, and make money, to be marketed. Games are not marketed as &#39;fulfilling&#39;. If you feel fulfilled from video games, it&#39;s likely because you&#39;re 14 years old.</p>

<p>VIOLENCE HURTS ME! Yeah that Game of thrones episode was pretty graphic, it was quite exciting. The episode was designed to be shocking, even if you are desensitized to violence as in you watch Live Leak every day, it still has imagery that hasn&#39;t been seen before and therefore is shocking.</p>

<p>I feel like making a change in my life! It&#39;s fucking the end of the year, what the fuck, obviously.</p>

<p>Compulsions to seek the truth.. well this comes in waves and with all the recent events it&#39;s hard to believe they wouldn&#39;t rock the pool and make some waves.</p>

<p>Stop the subjective thinking! If you truly were programmed all along by media and everything, subjective thinking only keeps you in the loop. I.e. the coincidences you experience in your life, seeing 9:11 on the clock, they&#39;re not significant. Stop attributing meaning to everything, it&#39;s ok to not know or not understand. The person who can&#39;t fathom saying &quot;oh, its probably nothing&quot; when they see a pattern is not someone who is in control of their ideas.</p>

<p>This whole thing is no different than flat-earth... and I like flat-earthers it is quite entertaining, but I gotta call it like it is... bullshit.</p>

<p>Work is a strange one because I&#39;m not sure but it seems like I&#39;m shifting to an entirely new profession but my current one offers a great many opportunities financially and the new ones are.....well.....I haven&#39;t made ANY money from them yet.  I&#39;m currently unemployed, living on savings and it&#39;s suddenly starting to worry me where it didn&#39;t just 3 months before.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve been visiting my brother&#39;s house for holidays for the past 10 years or more.  In all that time this one female cat has never wanted anything to do with me.  She runs scared from me and never, ever gets close.</p>

<p>I was there on Labor Day and for Christmas and both times she came up and cuddled with me without me even asking or inviting.  She just wandered out of the bedroom and walked right up to me, zero hesitation, no looking around for what&#39;s going on in the room, just straight over to me, jumped up on the sofa and snuggled down right next to me letting me pet her and purring up a storm!!</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve had these severe neck pains.  I&#39;ve never had neck pains in my life and now....fuck this shit hurts and I didn&#39;t do anything to have stressed them out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more I could write.</p>

<p>The lights flickering and the shadows were kind of freaking me out at first. I kept thinking I was kind of seeing stuff in the corner of my eyes but was never anything. I don&#39;t have glasses and just had an eye exam. I assumed stress. And the light bulbs in my apartment keep flickering so I expect them to go out and they don&#39;t. They&#39;ve been randomly flickering for a couple weeks now. </p>

<p>I feel crazy because of it so I write it off. Interesting though that I learned about global consciousness a week ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds so much like my year. I wasn&#39;t necessarily a drug addict but for years was using heavy opiates for pain after multiple surgeries as well as other meds for adhd and depression, and once I got off that stuff and switched to medical marijuana, everything changed for the better. This year I gave birth to my first child, we bought our first home and my husband bought a brand new car. More importantly, my whole life, happiness, relationship is all the best it has ever been and I have never been more awake and aware. Cheers to everyone who is opening up to life and therefore allowing life to open up to you!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago I felt an energy surge through my entire body. I was laying in my bed and then strikingly suddenly, every muscle became tense and I was keeping my self kind of aloft with my head against the pillow/wall with my legs on the bed, but my back didn&#39;t touch the bed anymore because of the energy and muscle tension. Like I was as stiff as a plank. The energy coursed in intense waves, through my body until it got to my right leg which was damaged a few years ago in an incident where I had a massive panic attack and fell off of a building because of it. This energy unlocked the deepest tension in the leg...Causing intense pain like the worst super charlie horse. It lasted several minutes and then went away. This energy held my body entirely tense for many minutes, and I knew I could stop at any point if I wanted. My leg feels better than it ever has now that this happened, like it couldn&#39;t heal until this happened.  I think my body is conditioning me for things to come. Preparing. This is not the first incident but the most recent and perhaps intense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  I can&#39;t express how many times I&#39;ve said to my husband, &quot;I feel like a stranger in my own body and mind.&quot;  </p>

<p>I noticed trivial changes in myself over the past couple of years but in June 2016, I became a whole new person and I&#39;m still trying to figure myself out.</p>

<p>My &quot;symptoms&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Constantly feel out of place; feel like I don&#39;t belong anywhere</li>
<li>Agitated, anxious with a feeling like I&#39;m waiting for something but what, I&#39;m not sure.</li>
<li>Can no longer enjoy television </li>
<li>Can&#39;t concentrate to read books - as a niche topic blogger where reading is a large part of the livelihood, my income has suffered as a result because I hate that niche topic now for the pure evilness it focuses on.</li>
<li>Long-term friendships have ended because they now consider me &quot;weird.&quot;</li>
<li>I&#39;m obsessed with research about what has happened to me and reading others stories.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just the main ones. It has been such a drastic change, however, it has even resulted in estrangement from my family.  But this feels, for lack of a better word, good and I have no desire to return to who I was.</p>

<p>And if you want to see how many others like me may have crossed over to your timeline recently, just take a look at these Google Trends pages, which show the increase in searches for the MANDELA EFFECT:</p>

<p>Internet searches: <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=mandela%20effect">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=mandela%20effect</a></p>

<p>YouTube searches: <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?gprop=youtube&amp;amp;q=mandela%20effect">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?gprop=youtube&amp;amp;q=mandela%20effect</a></p>

<p>People naturally search for things they are familiar with, or which impact them. So it stands to reason that a lot of the people searching for these terms may be the ones both 1) aware of the effect and 2) looking for answers.</p>

<p>So you literally might just be looking at proof that in August a bunch of &quot;us&quot; starting switching to your timeline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is weird, but I was going to respond to your reply without having finished reading your whole response. Why? Because, after reading that your headache ended and you felt energy through your forehead, it aligned perfectly with my thoughts on my experiences feeling these frequencies within my head lately. Never was I a spiritual person prior to these past 10 months, but something has happened where I&#39;ve been drawn to it. I&#39;ve been drawn to the idea of the third eye and have even begun having strange, intuitive realizations. Like, for example, one day I was walking to work and it dawned on my that an atom, which makes up human form and is a center/nucleus with crazy fast electrons flying around it to make a sort of ring around the nucleus, I noticed how the atom looks incredibly similar to Saturn. What does that imply? That the make up of our being is similar in form to that of planets? Does that imply that I might be something grander than I&#39;ve been led to believe in this life time? Am I, in fact, the universe? Is the essence of consciousness the universe using me as a tool to see and, eventually, become aware of itself? What am I? What is it that is hearing these frequencies? It&#39;s the most beautiful and exciting thing to ponder! I&#39;m a pianist. Nice to hear from a fellow musician who shares interest in the supernatural :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is beyond overwhelming having found. I haven&#39;t been much of a redditor other than being someone who occupies himself with r/nosleep, so I&#39;m always on my toes. My palms are so sweaty I can barely type; reading your description OP made my heart sink. I&#39;ve been seeing reoccuring numbers beginning perhaps in the middle of 2016. At first it was super super scary, so I went to the internet and was sucked into the many aspects of Numerology. I would be cleaning and would decide to change the song currently playing and once unlocked my phone exactly at 3:33. I&#39;ve awoken up in the middle of the night merely to check my phone, only to be greeted by this reoccuring phenomenon. I&#39;ll be talking to a friend and for whatever reason get the urge to check the time and notice in her car that all the numbers were the same. Not trying to freak her out, I just keep a smile and just talk, for I&#39;m comfortable around her--but then I look at my phone after said conversation and realize her clock was minutes ahead, because I was directly looking at the 5:55 I had seen four minutes ago. Goosebumps rid over my entire body and I couldn&#39;t help but tell my friend what was happening. This has been happening for months now, and I&#39;m to the point where I&#39;ve accepted it and am embracing it. But seeing as how I&#39;ve found this, I too want to know similar experiences. It&#39;s most definitely a form of a calling, a seeking of my attention, because why else would the world be grasping at me as often as I see this recurrence?</p>

<p>Oh I’ve thought about that <em>ooooofffften</em>.  I think to myself “WTF did Africans do in a past life to deserve what’s happening to them collectively now?  Wow.”</p>

<p>And you know what I often think?  I regularly think that Africans might <em>actually</em> have been the super advanced, Egyptian/Lemurian peoples of ancient times.  They had great power and great knowledge.  However, I think there might have been a possibility that they got a bit too uppity/overconfident, etc with their power and maybe did some really bad things with it - destroyed themselves or just had <em>way</em> too many slaves and did too many debauchery-filled things, etc.  I don’t know.</p>

<p>So now?  In this day and age/civilization?  The people of that super advanced society of ancient times are coming back today as beaten down slaves.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t know.  Just spit balling.</p>

<p>Perhaps in another civilization or two from, karma will make Europeans come back as the slaves of the future.</p>

<p>Perhaps that would change your perspective</p>

<p>From what?</p>

<p>Yeah.  I can understand that.  I try to be as open as I can to realizations, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. I wonder if the simulation theory is real, and the more awareness that has grown about it has weakened the simulation&#39;s power. Maybe the human race is experiencing a true awakening and there are beginning to be tears in the simulation, hence the uptick in synchronistic events and such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! It&#39;s like a strange and fun roller coaster where we&#39;re all connecting. I had battled depression too which lead to my reality check.</p>

<p>To look deeper down the rabbit hole and experience something that is akin to ... <a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/">well can angels and sentient beings</a> get online?  This person has such a vast knowledge, it&#39;s like speaking to a computer that can give you emotion and feeling behind the facts and answers. That personal touch that a regular computer does not have.</p>

<p>But that link comes with the warning: as always there is lots of disinformation and misinformation, if this person is of any significance as it seems, just remind yourself that there are those that <em>will actively oppose</em> this person and have no problem voicing that opinion. </p>

<p>This person backs up what they say, and I&#39;m cool with learning whatever I can all the time. That&#39;s what matters to me, they&#39;re spreading good information that&#39;s backed up by fact, actively wanting to share good morals and ideas. Isn&#39;t that what we all want?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look at Alan Watts youtube videos, sounds fun! Thank you for that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s on thing I&#39;ve learned in my time on the planet, its that your intuition (&quot;gut feeling&quot;) is a powerful force.  Don&#39;t be afraid to &quot;hear&quot; / &quot;feel&quot; what it&#39;s telling you and follow it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been steered wrong, and have had many net gains out of potential large loss scenarios by listening to, and feeling, what mine is putting out for me.  Thinking strongly about it, there&#39;s never been a time in which I&#39;ve followed it (&quot;my gut&quot;), and had it lead me to something negative.  Always a neutral out of what easily could&#39;ve been deep negative, or a positive out of a neutral situation.</p>
