       ...then we are probably looking at a false flag asteroid threat coming up during the Trump presidency. There is however a 20 day window before Trump  swears the oath. A lot can change in 20  days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wernher von Braun threat sequence, as revealed by Carol Rosin, at the 2001 Disclosure Conference is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism.
Terrorism.
Rogue nations.
Asteroids.
E.T.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, this threat sequence  allegedly comes from WvB, a former Nazi scientist and unindicted war criminal? Does the threat sequence have merit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the Wernher von Braun threat sequence is gently moving forward from rogue nations to asteroids, in this decade. This is gradual change that happens over decades so the subtlety is lost on the  many, except for  the most astute observers of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I would also ask you, the reader, to consider just a few facts which you may not be aware of:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russians have never flown humans over 300 miles in space. Fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the Apollo landings occurred in
       <a href="/u/richard_nixon">
        /u/richard_nixon
       </a>
       's first term in office. Fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon cancelled Apollo missions and ordered the space shuttles, essentially keeping America in low earth orbit for 50 years. FACT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 1960 election it was Nixon's idea to land on the moon while JFK was unwilling to set a timetable on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay let's go back to the WvB threat sequence, and the first threat, communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the NWO narrative Communism was defeated by Ronald "Ronnie Raygun" Reagan. Pure Hollywood illusion, "Tear down this wall!". RR also made some curious statements about aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       New threats need to arise so that the powers that be can engage in a jolly game of
       <em>
        problem, reaction, solution
       </em>
       . [Credit: David Icke]
      </p>
      <p>
       Those new threats are terror and rogue nations. But those threats are getting a bit tiresome in the mainstream media. We have had 20-30 years of TV terror and rogue nations have consistently engaged American foreign policy for 50 years at least. These threats, as you will soon see in the headlines, will dissipate  and a new threat steadily take the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Asteroids
       </em>
       and then
       <em>
        E.T.
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Carol Rosin these threats are all false flags with ultimate goal being the full military weaponization of space.

       Interesting. I feel we are in the rouge nation phase though. This will last another 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       We left the EU (Brexit), and the USA put Trump in charge. France and Netherlands will be next in 'going rouge', and leaving the EU. After that, more nations will look at the other option. Try something new. The way the world works will change massively. Then I really do feel the banking system with be under threat. At that point, we move into the next phase. Keep people off the bank issues and into fear of death

       Going to the Moon was never about eventual colonization. It was a way for the US to prove it's technological superiority after the Russians firsts in space (Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the US went to the Moon, that was it. The USA had it's moment of triumph and it was back to business as usual.
