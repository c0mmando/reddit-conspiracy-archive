    <div class="md"><p>The Nazis were the good guys and they will be coming back soon to make the world right in Hitler&#39;s image. The Nazi vision for humanity was not world domination but freedom from the Jewish banking oligarchy that caused WW1 and other horrors throughout history. The Vril society wanted to use suppressed advanced technology to lift humanity from perpetual debt slavery and financial tyranny. The Nazis planned to arrest Rothschild and other Jewish banking oligarchs but the people of the world were brainwashed into fighting against their own liberation. The Holocaust was a hoax. It never happened and was just war propaganda to justify the atrocities of the allies. The holocaust is not something that was perpetrated by Germany. It was inflicted on Germany by the allies. Truth was then flipped upside down in the history books so the German people took the blame for their own destruction while the real aggressors were played off as victims.</p>

<p>After WW2 the Nazis escaped to Antartica where they created a secret base. In 1947 the US government under Admiral Byrd tried to destroy this base but were defeated by advanced Nazi aircraft. The Nazis are still in Antarctica and are waiting for the proper time to free humanity.  </p>

<p>Just watch these two short videos.

Not only does it NOT provide any sources for it&#39;s claims, a number of the pics don&#39;t load,the formatting is horrible, and more than half the page is devoted to a moneybeg ( not to mention that it talks abotu book burning as good. something the &quot;anti-censorship&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is usually opposed).</p>

Yes, it was engineered by banks (mostly on Wall St) and the rise of the Natzi party and what the Germans <em>thought</em> they were fighting against was a rigged global economy etc. but I just want to say, no matter what you believe, killing people is never good and never the answer. &quot;Jews&quot; as a group of people are not bad and in fact, many are poor and don&#39;t support their government either.

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi Germany invaded many countries in Europe and made use of concentration camps where they imprisoned innocent civilians for no good reason. </p>

<p>They may have had some good intentions, and I&#39;m sure Hitler thought he was doing the right thing for Germany and the world, but to call them &quot;the good guys&quot; would be like calling the USA the &quot;good guys&quot; based on our military&#39;s recent actions in the middle east. Having good intentions of spreading democracy or liberating from dictators doesn&#39;t excuse killing so many innocents on our part, and no amount of good intention that Nazi Germany had makes up for the deaths they caused with their aggressive wars and human rights violations. </p>

I can&#39;t offer a link to that although I have read similar material before, so I explained my relevant opinion on this topic by pointing out that them causing so much innocent death throughout Europe makes any good intention irrelevant. </p>

<p>Someone else replied saying something similar, talking about how the Nazis causing innocent death is bad, and you replied to them with &quot;Understood.&quot; Why accuse me of misreading your post but not them? That&#39;s weird. You shouldn&#39;t be surprised when you talk about Nazis being good and people come out to make it clear that they invaded multiple sovereign countries and killed a lot of people. </p>

<p>Factually wrong though. I have a feeling you&#39;ve never researched the topic. The bolshevik revolution was incredibly bloody and the following despotism brought unimaginable horror over the people of Russia (and not just Russia). Naturally when a similar revolution was attempted in germany 1918 under the flag of communism the germans had to react accordingly if they wanted to defend their people from the utter barbarism that had swept over Russia. </p>

<p>He was right. They imprisoned civilians for being gay, jewish, Jehovah&#39;s witnesses, Slavic etc., because they didn&#39;t like them, which is not a good reason. </p>

<p>The Bolshevik revolution has nothing to do with the Nazis. Yes it was bloody, mainly because there were a lot of people fighting on both sides, not because communism was inherently bloody. The 1918 revolution in Germany did not have anything do with the Nazis, and neither side was particularly barbaric or in fact violent at all, and for the most part, no one went to jail. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you think the Nazis were good guys for imprisoning and killing civilians. They were not involved in the 1918 revolution, and in fact the NSDAP party was  founded after it finished. After they assumed control, they crushed socialist and moderate dissent, before WW2 even started, but once it did start, they imprisoned and killed enemy civilians.</p>
