        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Beneficial1.html">Beneficial1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a quote from Seth, where he describes <a href="http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/coordinatepoints.html">Coordination Points</a></p>

<p>Tldr: there are energy points all over a world energy grid. It&#39;s a good read though, it explains how energy portals into our reality.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from another part of the Seth Material:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;A few clues here that might help you, or mathematicians. There is an ever-so-minute alteration of gravity forces in the neighbourhood of all of these points, even of the subordinate ones, and all the so-called physical laws to some extent or another will be found to have a wavering effect in these neighbourhoods. The subordinate points also serve in a way as supports, as structural intensification within the unseen fabric of energy that forms all realities and manifestations. While they are traces or accumulations of pure energy, there is a great difference between the amount of energy available in the various subordinate points, and between the main and the absolute points.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>It occurred to me that I once watched a Tellinger video where he goes to <a href="https://vimeo.com/user12206452/videos">ancient structures</a> particularly the ones in <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/adamscalendar.html">Africa</a> And not <a href="http://m.imgur.com/by3YWfE">Antarctica</a>.</p>

<p>But as Seth said the portal can be discovered by alterations in gravity.  Tellinger, went to these sites and discovered this<a href="https://youtu.be/gcD1h9DYitg"> difference in Gravity in this video here.</a> - Begin at 62 minutes to see what I mean.</p>

<p>So, first, how does a woman channeling a personality named Seth back in 1966 know this?</p>

<p>That I&#39;m not sure how to explain, but Regardless, we now have this information, and it&#39;s scientifically proven now that this is happening that all over our world there are these portals. Look at Africa, there are thousands of these structures being discovered and all over the world. And still in our times Tellinger is getting a reading. So they must still be active.</p>

<p>What do we do with them? How do we use them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming full circle...I like that. I can let you in on a little secret of being a genie. Anytime you can focus on a known portal you can ask a question to it and get an answer.
 Sometimes the answers though are in the tapestry of reality, they stand out just a little bit more so you can see them.</p>

I feel truths when I see them and ignore them if false.  Well put with tapestry of reality.  Resonates well.  The fun stuff has really just begun for me in the past 6 months.  Manipulating my reality bubble.  Just about daily I break down in tears of joy of how amazing it all really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;When Johan first introduced me to the ancient stone ruins of southern Africa, I had no idea of the incredible discoveries we would make in the year or two that followed. The photographs, artifacts and evidence we have accumulated points unquestionably to a lost and never-before-seen civilization that predates all others -- not by just a few hundred years, or a few thousand years... but many thousands of years. These discoveries are so staggering that they will not be easily digested by the mainstream historical and archaeological fraternity, as we have already experienced. It will require a complete paradigm shift in how we view our human history. &quot; -- Tellinger</p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you have any money in your budget to order a $120 4lb/can of chlorella?  that&#39;s what i recommend as a gentle way to detox from metals, pesticides, herbicides, and other toxins...take at least 25 grams per day in one dose to start, 1 can lasts 72 days on that dose.  i get it from Health Ranger, best price i have found anywhere</p>

<p>you&#39;ve got to cut chemicals and GMOs from your lifestyle as much as possible, body products, cleaning supplies, let things off-gas outside when you buy new products from China...etc.</p>

<p>they have a can of powder, which you could add to smoothies, or the tablets which are tiny, i can swallow those by the handful.</p>

<p>i recommend taking as much as you can afford, i have taken 50 grams almost every day for years.  i still don&#39;t eat fast food, but i don&#39;t worry as much when i can&#39;t eat organic every minute.  i also look half my age, haven&#39;t gotten sick in years, haven&#39;t been vaccinated in 20 years...feels pretty great to leave the matrix</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What type of diet would you suggest?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been into ufology and aliens for <em>a long time</em> and they&#39;ve said for many many years that a diet focused on fresh vegetable and meditation is the &quot;easiest way&quot; for contact with ETs. I haven&#39;t until recent time spent time going deeper into this theory and it&#39;s scary how many different fields suggest these tips for whatever the person want to &quot;become&quot; or &quot;goal to reach&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i eat organic sauerkraut, fermented organic miso, cultured organic sour cream, and organic ghee.  i would eat fish and seafood, but haven&#39;t for awhile, just the oils.  i have organic bone broth occasionally, but the rest is plant based.  i mostly avoid wheat, but still have it occasionally.  i consume a lot of raw seeds, like hemp, sunflower, chia, pumpkin, sesame...and sprouts are wonderful living foods, i sprinkle them on everything.  beans are great for you, the gas stops as you rebuild your microbiome/gut flora</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. From my understanding, these channelings happen when certain things line up just right. It&#39;s a bit complex but I&#39;m pretty sure we will all improve greatly in the channeling of basic wisdom in day to day life affairs soon which is a huge step since the wisdom is legit.

Heck, the world around us changes depending on how healthy our minds are. I was able to cure my own problem I had for about 10 years. Occasionally, at first weekly, I would get a serious pain in my back/waste area and doctors had no idea what it was. I adjusted my thinking and no longer have this problem. </p>
