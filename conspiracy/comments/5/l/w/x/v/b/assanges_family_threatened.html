<p>Could make sense why he&#39;s been silent. Basically contacting Australia and making sure his family is taken care of before he speaks up again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Everyone thinks/says the airport was evacuated and the DDOS attack went down so the U.S could give him the black hood treatment and stop the deadman&#39;s switch. </p>

<p>I posit that the reason those things happened were to actually get him out of there, and the DDOS could have actually been to disrupt any surveillance or communications going the other way just as easily as it could have been to disrupt Julian and the deadman&#39;s switch. </p>

<p>I think as soon as his internet was cut, the plan went into motion to get him out. Him and his people aren&#39;t stupid, and they knew that his internet being taken out would be an airtight sign of a forthcoming unwanted extraction of Julian. </p>

<p>I have no proof. Just a gut feeling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisley. Too much shit went down during that time for me to think he is in CIA hands. No, he is hiding in &quot;friendly&quot; hands... That being said, I do think that wikileaks is compromised by the West because they know that the spokesperson is in &quot;safe&quot; hands... 4D chess is being played.. I think JA is legit, just being used as a pawn, by the East. I also do not think Snowden really is in Russia. 4D chess people... Up is down, and left is right....</p>
