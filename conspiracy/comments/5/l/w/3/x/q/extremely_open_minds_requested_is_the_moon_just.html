       So I've been struggling with my belief in the moon, as we're told it is, for some time now. Here's where it all began.... feel free to ask questions or better yet, film it yourself some night. It is actually  quite amazing what you see with a little critical thinking. The original video is above and this is my explanation:

      </p>
      <p>
       No need to be harsh as I've already received death threats due to my so-called stupidity. I am, on the other hand, very open to criticism. An open mind is one of the most important attributes to me, so I'd love to gather some other thoughts that I might remain open.

       Well you can ping a laser off it because of the mirrors left up there.

       well what else out there is it hitting? You can measure the distance of the object by the time needed for the laser to come back, so there would have to be something at the same distance from the earth that has a mirror on it to aim the laser back

       such as? Light reflection is one of those sciences that they know quite alot about.

       What do you think could fake laser distance measurement or put it in other words, what things do you think can absorb light and fake reflection time back to the person?

       I'm afraid I don't know enough on that subject to answer, but to me it veers off from the original point about us not necessarily knowing the true nature of the moon. Perhaps it's nature includes its capability to bounce a laser back while still failing to be what textbooks have taught us?

       No the uneven surface of the moon would simply fracture the laser and scatter it too much to be registered, this is why the reflectors left on the moon are so necessary for the project. You need a proper reflector to have any hope
      </p>
      <p>
       This is another sort of reason why a few conspiracies concerning the moon fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you could make the argument if you want to stick to the hologram theory that the moon reflectors are simply a satellite with a reflector placed in an orbit to mimic the moon and place the hologram over it. Only problem with that is weve had photography longer than satellites and the moon was in those shots

       would you accept that rocketry was unable to get out of earth atmosphere before world war one or two?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this as these were times when the great super powers raged wars that led to countries failing and last ditch attempts at survival, that i would argue proves there was no advanced roacketry at that stage as if there was it would have been used in the wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously by the end of world war 2 rockets were getting pretty good. But would you accept that before that they were no good enough to leave earth orbit?

       Well cant fault your logic there, hmm a conundrum then, i suppose the only way then go through it is to see why you think it is a hologram and then work on proving if thats a possibility
      </p>
      <p>
       A good way i always found to move on with conspiracies if i got stuck was to go the other way and i tried to disprove the conspiracy i was interested in.

       As in be your own devils advocate and try tear your theory apart or find holes in it, if you find more holes in it that the "official story" your know to move on if not you know to keep diggin

       I also wanted to mention that in no way am I stuck to the hologram theory, so to speak. It was the first thing that came to mind and I used it as a talking point to get my questions out there many years ago. I am open to all kinds of theories. I have also heard some about the "lunar wave" though I am not sure I understand fully what is being proposed.

       Ah the lunar wave, tbh thats simply people with their personal telescopes not quite understanding some of the wave affects day to day things can cause and how that can distort ones lens and therefore view of the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example, ever drive down the road and its really hot and the end of the road seems to be shimmering or like wavey, this is heat waves rising and distorting the light coming through it, therefore your perception of the image on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best example i can think of is
       <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-8345812-stock-footage-very-long-telephoto-shot-of-shipping-coaster-sailing-over-a-a-heat-shimmering-arctic-sea-on-a.html?src=search/HjhZdseTqgmj6OsO6MSlYQ:1:10/gg">
        this
       </a>
       now you and i know the ship isnt some ripley wavey mess its simply the distortion affect of looking at it through the heat waves

       I have experienced seeing a heatwave but I was under the impression that the lunar wave was different. This is all a lot to take in though I've been researching for years. I'm going to look into your link now.

       I've watched his videos a few times all the live waves you can see the whole moon is shimmering given the distortion which clearly shows he is looking at it through distortion or pollution if he's near a big city, co2 emissions could do the same affect
      </p>
      <p>
       The only clip he showed that was questionable is the final one which is the only on that shows a full unbroken wave from top to bottom with no distortion of the rest of the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       However if you look this is not a wave. Look at the edges it looks more like a movie wipe. It looks like he doctored it and simply wiped up with a slightly larger image of the moon. Explains why you don't see that bottom of the screen it would show it to obviously

       The technical details go over my head, I'm afraid. I do have a question for you, though. What would you think if you did believe, without a doubt, that the "lunar wave" captured was genuine and not a camera artifact or other defect/glitch?

       If it was genuine and not a distortion affect well tbh the only reason a planet like object would do that is if it was some projection or glitch. Massive earthquakes which MAY be able to do something like this don't explain it as there is no tectonic plates activity on the moon the other option meteor impacts on the moon causing this again just wouldn't stack up given the frequency and lack of shoot off debris
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes if someone witnessed this affect via a satellite or an orbiter or just with a special lens and 100 percent no distortion I would go hologram. However I haven't seen anything from the lunar wave ATM that makes me think it's not distortion affects

       because the laser would not come back if there is no surface to reflect left at precise co ordinates
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact the laser comes back is proof if it didnt come back you know the moon was fake
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed of a laser is a scientific constant as its the speed of light, you cant fake it the measurement of distance comes from the time it takes to come back, if its closer the laser will come back quicker and youll know its closer
      </p>
      <p>
       for example if you bounce it off a shiny satellite just right itll come back quicker than from the moon mirror

       Thank you for your detailed comment. I appreciate you taking the time to explain all of that. Do you happen to know how I could go about performing this laser experiment myself? I'm someone who has a hard time just taking others' word for things and would like to give it a shot.

       Eh do you have like 30k to spend? You need a powerfull laser so you can actually measure it when it comes back and like a a pretty decent telescope to spot it
      </p>
      <p>
       Most are done in universites by students studying it given how much tech you need.
      </p>
      <p>

       I think this lack of accessibility that you bring up is precisely why I have so many questions. It seems it is difficult for the layman to prove, for himself, the validity of the moon story.

       understandable, you can book a spot and do the test when the spot comes up but you could be talking years.

      <p>
       You could try the ham radio method

       But im not sure if its the area of evidence that would work for you as the reason its proof as it were is alot more complicated to explain than the laser test

        another

       satellite with
       <em>

       Satelites are in much closer orbit to than the moon and as such are moving in orbit much faster than the moon, it takes the moon about 27 days to do an orbit where satelites do that in hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to try and work out a system that means there is always enough satelites so that if someone lasers the moon target this bouncing can begin but then make sure that the laser beam comes back exactly at the same angle its sent, as otherwise it couldnt be picked up would be imo pretty impossible
      </p>
      <p>
       Not going to say unlikely but you are talking 100 hundreds of dedicated satellites with precise guidance thrusters and some serious on the fly math

       They say it was left there during the later Apollo missions. Now do they actually receive the light signal back or just look for a light on the moon? Getting the signal to return perfectly to the transmitter seems very difficult.

       Secondly the ocean tides are another thing that shows us that the moon exists, you need a large mass to create that gravitational pull on the oceans so there has to be something the same size and mass and distance from the earth as the moon to have that affect

       A you can see the laser I put a photo up of a place doing the lasering
      </p>
      <p>
       B you can't see the laser hit the moon so if your litmus test for proof is being able to see not just the measured data but the actual thing before you'll believe it exists then I fear you won't believe much science to come as it's done on a nano scale
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't see an atom, you can't see gravity, you can't see alot of things that's why we have measurement equipment. I don't think it's the best starting point to go from if I'm honest

       That's like saying we did a radio wave test in class and apparently we bounced a signal halfway around the world and back but I didn't see the radio waves come back so...

       There is a reason you have equipment. If you want to start a discussion that the equipment is made up or just automated to give a certain response I feel that's something way too out their to be credible there is just too much info and science behind it

       radio works somehow. if it didn't work the way they say it does who cares. but we do need to investigate the moon. and yes if I can't see it with my own eyes the experiment is no good.

       My point is if you don't accept equipment driven data then we literally cannot talk about the moon as there is no way to offer you first hand visual proof as 90 percent of the data comes from equipment
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya get me? There's nothing I can link you that won't be equipment based at some point whether it be a camera used to measure or a scanner

       let's talk about the moon but let's get some actual proof. Let's have a manned mission there again. this time let's video everything with a high quality camera, let experts check it for signs of cgi or other trickery, and don't say after oops we lost the tapes.

       No, what you're doing is not "thinking critically". You are blatantly ignoring every bit of scientific evidence we have showing that, yes, the moon is actually real and not some made-up hoax since humans started to record history. There isn't some threshold of evidence that you'll finally admit to the moon being there or something, you're just being obstinate.

       There are exactly zero videos that do this.  There are videos that show an over exposed moon blowing out the clouds making it
       <em>

       as though they are behind the moon, but this isn't the case.

       I've taken literally thousands of photographs of the moon.  There is nothing strange about it, this is simply an overexposed video creating an illusion due to the limited dynamic range of cameras.

       Finally went through some of my photos and found a decent example.  Clearly demonstrates the effect shown in the video, you'd never think that the moon is in front of the tree, it's merely an illusion created by overexposure:

       I definitely see your point there. I wasn't viewing reality as a complete simulation, though I'm not against that theory. I was seeing it more as.. the powers that be could have duped us about the moon entirely.

       The Moon is definitely very strange compared to other satellites. Fuck it. My opinion is that it's a space station put in place by the aliens that really run the world.

       Scientists have 3 or 4 different (competing) theories about the origins of the moon. It is ok to speculate and use critical thinking.

       Clouds aren't solid objects, they're massive puddles of gas. They do a reasonably good job of blocking light, but they can very rarely block out something as big and bright as the moon.

       it does smell like a lie that there is a dark side of the moon that we never see and the moon just happens to turn at the same rate as the earth. how convenient.

       Everyone here is giving great, scientific explanations for how to prove the moon is real. Those are wonderful, but I want to take a more common sense approach. Every culture for all of recorded history has made some mention of the moon. If there were some conspiracy regarding it, this conspiracy would have to be common to every single culture that has ever existed without deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could such a conspiracy even be maintained? When rebels successfully pulled off a coup did the old leader say, "hold up! Before you brutally murder me just one thing. Don't tell people about the moon being fake"?

       We have a vast history of people saying "oh shit we have a moon!" and the only way to explain that away is to claim all that evidence is fabricated.

       You seem open to every possibility conceivable, no matter how bizarre or unfounded, except that it is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like almost all conspiracy theorists, you are striving for a sense of self importance and being "in the know", probably due to a living an uneventful life of chronic underachievement.

       My point is if you don't accept equipment driven data then we literally cannot talk about the moon as there is no way to offer you first hand visual proof as 90 percent of the data comes from equipment
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya get me? There's nothing I can link you that won't be equipment based at some point whether it be a camera used to measure or a scanner
