        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">148</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/GoFyourself2x.html">GoFyourself2x</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>PNAC:Project for a New America Century, is a document from the Israelis which list <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r8YtF76s-yM">7 nations America  was to invade beginning with Iraq in 2003.</a><br/>
In order to get the mass populations approval for the upcoming wars, a ‚Äùcatastrophic and catalyzing event‚Äî <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=YfffPzUvfWE">like a new Pearl Harbor.‚Äù</a> would have to take place. Was 9/11 their &quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;? </p>

<p>The 7 nations on the list of invasion:</p>

<p>üîπ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=k3-XJK0fpVo">Iraq </a> The war of Iraq was intended to mark the official emergence of the United States as a full-fledged global empire, seizing sole responsibility and authority as planetary policeman. It would be the culmination of a plan 10 years or more in the making, carried out by those who believe the United States must seize the opportunity for global domination, even if it means becoming the &quot;American imperialists&quot; that our enemies always claimed we were.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=ErJQ59qFpTE">Whistleblower for 9/11 and Iraq war</a></p>

<p>üîπ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=0onZuIA-ehw">Lebanon</a>: 
General Clark has recently said ISIS was created to attack Hezbollah for the Israelis. Israel was defeated by 3,500 Hezbollah fighters in the 2006 Lebanon war. ISIS has fought against Hezbollah but they also attacked Syria and Iraq. The Syrians are Hezbollah‚Äôs closest allies. The US hired Jihadist proxy armies including Al Qaeda and ISIS to attack Syria using false allegations of chemical weapons. The US paid the Jihadists to kill 300,000 Syrians including 100,000 Christians.</p>

<p>üîπ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=DvLF9x0kGIs">Syria</a> &amp; Libya 
President Obama surrounded himself with ‚ÄòSoft Power‚Äô advocates like Susan Rice and Samantha Power. Obama did attack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=1nszLUuILko">Libya</a> and Syria using proxies. That fit in with the ‚ÄòSoft Power‚Äô program. It also met the guidance given by Richard Perle in A Clean Break. He had written in 1996 that Syria should be attacked by proxy armies over the issue of chemical weapons. Nobody believed the charges the Obama admin just recently made that Syria was again using chemical weapons to kill civilians. All of the previous allegations had been proven false. Obama followed the Israeli agenda by attacking Libya and Syria for them. My question is... will American people wake up and put a stop to war crimes in Syria? Or will we sit around and let the US murder Assad like they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=LQCwgcZqStc">Gaddafi?</a></p>

<p>üîπ <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/content/war-sudan#axzz4UfrE5ulo">Sudan</a>
The USA and Israel encouraged the civil war. Since at least the early 1990s the USA funded the SPLA. Even former U.S president Jimmy Carter acknowledges the US role in destabilizing Sudan in the 1990‚Äôs. The Boston Globe in 1999 quoted Carter as saying, ‚ÄúThe people in Sudan want to resolve the conflict. The biggest obstacle is US government policy. The US is committed to overthrowing the government in Khartoum. Any sort of peace effort is aborted, basically by policies of the United States‚Ä¶. Instead of working for peace in Sudan, the US government has basically promoted a continuation of the war.‚Äù
In 2011, the US backed South Sudan independence. A  U.N. report in March 2016 accuses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=I_6lpOJVWGk">South Sudan‚Äôs pro-government forces of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including systematic rape of civilian</a>. Democracy is not what South Sudan wanted, but it wasn&#39;t up to them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=RA50TO7t2mY">Democracy in Sudan</a> was part of the PNAC and the US helped installed it. </p>

<p>üîπ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=N2XuK10xhzo">Somalia &amp; Yemen</a>
The Obama administration supports the Saudis in the Yemen war. 
Saudi Arabia is responsible for 60 percent of about 3,800 civilian deaths in Yemen, according to a UN human rights office report published in August. Saudi warplanes targeted markets, hospitals, schools and other civilian targets, the report says.
The US supports the Saudi war effort by selling arms to the Saudis and providing refueling and logistical assistance. In November 2015 the US announced a $1.29 billion deal for precision munitions specifically meant to replenish Saudi stockpiles used in Yemen. In September 2016 the US Senate gave the go-ahead for a $1.15 billion sale of tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia by blocking the bill opposing the controversial transaction.
In December 2016, the Obama administration is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=LMsUSEGFeas">expanding the war to Somalia.</a></p>

<p>üîπ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=tvq9pfaB6DI">Iran</a>
You might have noticed that the US never did get around to attacking Iran. In 2007 PNAC member Dick Cheney ordered US Navy Seals to attack a US Navy ship in the Persian Gulf so he could use the incident as an excuse to launch World War III by striking Iran for Israel. The Navy Seals refused to obey Cheney‚Äôs order so he backed down. Cheney had another go at starting WW III on August 8, 2008 when he and the Israelis convinced the nation of Georgia to fire a tank and artillery barrage at South Ossetia killing almost 2,000 civilians in the first few hours. That did not work out well for the conspirators. Russia defeated the Georgians and their US and Israeli advisers rather quickly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=Z41QaC-xAIo">Whistleblower on Iran</a></p>

<p>Today corporate media is programming the mass population to hate Russia, china and Iran and favor Israel. Are they setting up the foundation for WW3? Russia, Iran, china vs Israel &amp; US? The bankers could possibly get away with this if the majority of Americans fall for their propaganda, but I think many have woke and see right through them. </p>

<p>American soldiers have been subjected to one tour after another in poorly thought out wars. These wars all have something in common, the US banks use our military to invade countries the US banks yet to have control of. We take over their resourses, either it be oil to heroine in Afghan. We  overthrow their governments and replace with a friendly puppet/govt to the US banks. The wars in Iraq, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria appear to benefit Israel. Will American soldiers wake up and choose not to fight WW3 for the criminal bankers?  </p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts used the words Murder Incorporated to describe America. We are not a righteous nation defending the poor and oppressed. Historically, Murder Inc was an organized crime syndicate created by Louis ‚ÄòLepke‚Äô Buchalter who killed people for money. The United States is not being paid to invade countries for Israel. In fact the US paid Israel over $30 billion in aid which the Israelis cycle back in part to buy American politicians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for the record, PNAC is not a document. It&#39;s a neocon think tank.</p>

<p>The document you are referring to by PNAC is called Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses.</p>

<p>And yes, it basically admits to creating a false flag event in order to create pretext for war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I want to believe Trump
Is this anti NWO guy, and there sure seems to be a complete establishment attack on him, but it could be a complex ruse, or he could just get compromised or threatened. Only time will tell if his actions match his rhetoric.</p>

<p>I heard about PNAC 15 years ago, and this document through Alex Jones only a few months after 9-11. It baffles my mind that this public document that anyone can read in the public domain has stayed hidden for so long right in front of everyone&#39;s face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF he&#39;s the real deal, and once he&#39;s established himself this is what I&#39;d hope he addresses in the next 4 years:</p>

<p>Total ethics reform. 
Reopen 9-11 investigation.
End the Federal Reserve System that been illegal for 104 years and get us on a constitutional commodity backed economic system.
Pull us out of these fake wars.
Send every war criminal or crimes against humanity criminal to the AG for justice, maybe even The Hague for international war crimes.
Discuss our role in a multi polar macroeconomic world and how we will be cooperating with BRICS, and what it means for us.
Pushing for sequestered technologies to be released to the public.
Opening up the UFO investigation and getting it out of the fringe world into honest public debate.</p>

<p>If he and His cabinet along with cooperation from other leaders can do even a portion of that, we can reverse a century of insanity and move forward to a whole new way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would depend on what type of strategy they took to remove the debt. There has been proposals of global debt forgiveness, proposals of reimbursements to nations ravaged by western central banks and associated war, proposals of natural reversal through free energy technologies, natural reversal through BRICS, currency revaluations, and combinations of the aforementioned. </p>

<p>I saw a few articles about Trump taking on the Fed, but cannot confirm their merit.</p>

<p>But everything ties to the Fed. Everyone of these nations on the PNAC list had their own banks and own gold, and the first thing after invasion was installing Rothschild banking economies into them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syria and surrounding regions are sacred land and have been since at least ancient Egypt. </p>

<p>The US and Isreal want to hijack it. They want to sit an incarnated lucifer on a throne in Jerusalem, likely with symbology of the eye because they are desecrating God. No matter what name God takes, no matter the religion, those lands go back to ancient Egypt (See stories of Thoth, Set, Osiris and Isis, the latter two of which are credited with creating civilization as we know it). That story screams parallels to today&#39;s wars, simply because our lives are cyclical. We have all been here before.</p>

<p>The present day global elite powers are <em>trying</em> to incarnate and put the anti-christ in power, because they manifest in symbology. No matter what they do or how they do it, their actions shine through for those that look.</p>

<p>Symbology is everywhere. Ask yourself, why is the pope signing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqhxtMMIW2g&amp;amp;t=21s">666</a> with his hand? It&#39;s all deception, and lies to surreptitiously co-opt humanity. Humans can not fight what they do not believe exists.</p>

<p>Seek the light, glance but avoid the dark. Religions are our local realities, not universal. We are currently going through very serious energy amplifications, so misaligned will suffer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without going into too much detail, it references a modern day MKULTRA technique portal to split a human&#39;s psyche via trauma, AND represents three 6&#39;s (look again), which in numerology is Satan.</p>

<p>Some ask, why would the pope or a president make signs like this, or put out a logo in plain sight? This is part of their modus operendi, they are laughing at the masses, how stupid they think we are, that they are doing abhorrent things (crimes against humanity), showing us what they are doing via symbols, numbers, architecture [etc] and they take pleasure in knowing they are hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the masses are waking up to their psychic potential, to higher vibrations. The dark global elite cannot survive when we are all fully aware. This is why they have been repressing our psyches in every way possible like food, the air, medications, even simple toiletries.</p>

<p>I believe Israel&#39;s spying leading up to the attack was more so just checking to make sure things are running smooth. They were running this story a few months before 9/11 happened. The vid I posted is right after 9/11 though.</p>

<p>I know that is slightly off topic but it would certainly point towards evidence. </p>
