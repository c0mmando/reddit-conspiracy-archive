<p>Here is a very enlightening article on Dupont dumping a chemical into waterways known as PFOA.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;amp;module=second-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;amp;_r=0">New York Times:</a> ‘The thought that DuPont could get away with this for this long,’’ Bilott says, his tone landing halfway between wonder and rage, ‘‘that they could keep making a profit off it, then get the agreement of the governmental agencies to slowly phase it out, only to replace it with an alternative with unknown human effects — we told the agencies about this in 2001, and they’ve essentially done nothing. That’s 14 years of this stuff continuing to be used, continuing to be in the drinking water all over the country. DuPont just quietly switches over to the next substance. And in the meantime, they fight everyone who has been injured by it.’’</li>
</ul>

<p>The main problem with dumping chemicals into waterways is that we can&#39;t test for every single chemical that may be in the water. We don&#39;t know if water treatment plants are removing everything. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html">New York Times:</a> &quot;The Safe Drinking Water Act is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks — and still be legal. Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to EPA estimates.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Your tap water typically comes from a waterway, such as a river, then gets filtered, then routed to your home. Is the filtration good enough? In some cases, it may not be. The sources for our water are used as dumping grounds for all kinds of manufacturing plants. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/13water.html">Records analyzed by The New York Times</a> indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>If your water came from a decent source, does that mean your water is clean? Perhaps not. Because of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509614/">The Lead Lobby</a>, a lot of the city pipes that carry your water contain high levels of lead. Many of these are still in use. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just water. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html?_r=0">Many Americans assume that the chemicals in their shampoos, detergents and other consumer products have been thoroughly tested and proved to be safe.</a> This assumption is wrong. Unlike pharmaceuticals or pesticides, industrial chemicals do not have to be tested before they are put on the market. Under the law regulating chemicals, producers are only rarely required to provide the federal government with the information necessary to assess safety.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>If some conspiracy-related thing is true, you can typically find a mainstream media source or a credible website/blog that reports on it. You can also convince people who otherwise don&#39;t believe in conspiracies because they are conditioned to only accept whatever they see on television. That&#39;s why I always use those kinds of sources. I think it was Chomsky who said that he had conversations with a lot of journalists and they try to insert little tidbits of information into their articles that otherwise don&#39;t get decent coverage. You can&#39;t control every journalist all of the time. Dig deep enough, and you&#39;ll find a lot of stuff. </p>

<p>So, the media technically covered this issue with water quality, but that isn&#39;t to say that the mainstream media is <em>adequately</em> covering this issue. They aren&#39;t. There are millions of Americans who drink poison water and the media cares more about scaring people with misleading articles on Russia and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I basically agree with your point. But I&#39;ll also point out that these topics tend to be actually equally transient on a lot of alternative media sites too. The only difference there is that the first those sites report a story like this, they include inflammatory language about how this story has been buried deep by the powers that be. I think that media suppression by corporate interests is a real phenomenon. But I also think that these stories tend to die because there isn&#39;t a wide audience who want to hear about, and they&#39;re catering to their audience. So it&#39;s commendable that you&#39;re highlighting this stuff. My comment was more directed to the poster than to you, because I feel like he&#39;s uneccessarily trying to turn this into a media conspiracy story, rather than just staight up reminding us about it and arguing that it&#39;s a really important issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it, if some reporter had a crazy story about the dumping of chemicals into rivers, the high lead content of water in some city, etc, how is an editor going to look that reporter in the face and tell him that it can&#39;t be made public? Of course they will have to allow the story to go through, but they can slip it into the back of the paper and give the journalist a bunch of extra bullshit stories to work on so they can limit the amount of info that is disseminated. </p>

<p>They also probably try to convince their journalists not to &quot;alarm the public,&quot; but that can&#39;t work every time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made this a couple weeks ago.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest here. Flint was probably cheating the water tests and had lead in the system for years before Granholm was in office.</p>

<p>The lead was leaching from the pipes that transports water,and from lead joints</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michelsplumbing.com/cutaways.htm">http://www.michelsplumbing.com/cutaways.htm</a></p>

<p>At least 33 US cities used water testing &#39;cheats&#39; over lead concerns</p>

<p>As other cities dig up pipes made of toxic lead, Chicago resists</p>

<p>Beyond Flint: Excessive lead levels found in almost 2,000 water systems across all 50 states</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m not the only one who remembered all of that bitching over people who haven&#39;t been paying their water bill in Detroit for years, perhaps decades were finally cut off.</p>

<p>I remember guides being posted that showed people how to pour cement down the control valve pipes, that way those who haven&#39;t been paying their water bills for years wouldn&#39;t get their water shut off.</p>

<p>What probably what happened is that after the whole Detroit nonsense, some city worker or someone who has ties to a city worker threatened Rick Snyder. What Rick did was to cover up any blame for a problem that the city caused from harming his ass, even though the city was lying about their so-called clean water for decades.</p>

<p>Come on, about 2000 cities have been caught fudging their test results.The pipe that&#39;s leaching the lead in flint was installed 40 or more years ago. A few months of river water won&#39;t cause the lead levels that we&#39;re seeing in flint, when 2000 cites have the same problem Flint is having.</p>

<p>Look at this water sample. It&#39;s brown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/82/28982/full_hd/Flintwater.jpg">https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/82/28982/full_hd/Flintwater.jpg</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s not lead that&#39;s causing the water discoloration.</p>

<p>It&#39;s minerals that were flushed. (Not a picture of flint water pipe)</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/xV9bi8l.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/xV9bi8l.jpg</a></p>

<p>THIS is why we need to replace our water system in our communities nation wide.</p>

<p>The hydrants are routinely flushed to help prevent such built up. Perhaps Flint wasn&#39;t flushing their hydrants?</p>

<p>If I had my way I would jack up all communities in the nation like what happened in Chicago.</p>

<p>That way there would be tunnels which maintenance crews can access infrastructure such as buried power lines, fiber optic, gas lines, water lines, and grid-scale batteries for renewable energy. Right now in order to do maintenance work, you hire a construction crew to literally rip up streets.</p>

<p>So no, the city&#39;s health is not declining because of this artificial scandal.</p>
