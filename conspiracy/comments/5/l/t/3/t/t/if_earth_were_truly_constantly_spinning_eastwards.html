       He jumped from bout 40 k up apparently and 40k underneath the globe was spinning.

      <p>
       If it takes three hours to get down , why did he land in a similar spot?

      <p>
       Is the stratosphere 40k up rotating at the same speed as the planet earth?

       It didn't take three hours to get down... It was broadcast on live TV and it took him about 5 minutes to get down.

       Yes that is exactly what is happening. Everything within the Earth's atmosphere is rotating at the same speed as the Earth. That is how it works.

       A rocket takes off from the surface of the earth.  It exits the atmosphere.  Does that mean all of a sudden the earth begins spinning underneath it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the guy was
       <em>
        "ascending over New Mexico"
       </em>
       your point is invalid.  Why would he come down differently than he went up???
      </p>
      <p>
       He started off with 0 relative velocity to the surface of the earth.  Hes standing on the earth motionless, right?  Then he got into his balloon and went relative velocity straight up.  Then he got out of his balloon and went relative velocity straight down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless there is an force applied toward any horizontal vector, he is going to go up and down to the exact same spot.  Obviously there is wind involved, so he did not hit the exact same spot.

       I think you need to read up on some basic physics. The Earth is always accelerating but only because the direction is constantly changing. The Earth does not accelerate "towards the sun".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the constellations are constantly changing, so Im not sure what you're getting at there.

        Ever ride on a school bus?  If the bus is moving at 60 MPH and &gt;you jump absolutely straight up, does the bus move under you?  &gt;Would you land in the same spot you jumped from, or would you &gt;end up losing your place, and moving backward relative to the &gt;bus?
       </p>
       <p>
        You would stay in the same place.  The bus is moving at 60 MPH, &gt;and so are YOU.  You're moving WITH the bus.  Same goes for &gt;planes, and same goes for planes flying around the planet Earth.
       </p>

        BTW, planes do NOT take the same amount of time at the same &gt;speed to go from East to West as they do from West to East.  &gt;Your entire assumption is wrong from the onset.

       In the example you gave, the bus is moving at a constant speed. In this scenario the net force is zero as there is no acceleration.

      <p>
       The earth on the other hand is (supposedly) moving in a circle around the earth and is therefore accelerating. In this case we

        should

       Also, the Earth is moving at a constant speed as it rotates around its axis, and we are moving at the same speed as the Earth as it rotates.

       The earth is moving at a constant speed, yes. But because the earth is changing direction, it is accelerating.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as the earth moves around the sun it is experiencing a force, we should be able to feel this force.

       How is the Earth changing direction?  It's constantly spinning around an axis, and there is no direction change, it's also rotating at a constant rate around the Sun.

       Honestly, I'd recommend reading up on some basic physics to understand the concepts.

       This entire post is bullshit, but the Earth IS constantly changing direction. For example, at opposite sides of the rotation around the sun the directions are opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also does not rotate around the Sun at a constant rate. The Earth moves faster when it is closer to the sun; usually in January.

       I think your understanding of planetary physics might need some brushing up.

       Flat earthers are retarded, but the Earth is constantly changing direction. Any object not traveling in a straight line is changing direction. I'm not a flat Earther and this isn't bullshit; it is a proven scientific fact.

       Both this acceleration and the gravitational pull of the sun are minute compared to the gravitational pull of the Earth.  You did get me wondering if we are lighter when the sun is overhead and,

       I think you meant to say "the earth is moving in a circle around the sun." That's why nobody understands what you're trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that you're confusing acceleration caused by a speeding up or slowing down and an acceleration caused by a change in direction. But I don't see any reason to accept your premise that we should be able to feel the change in movement. If you're flying on an airplane, you will only feel sudden changes, like a hard turn or a sudden change in elevation. But gradual changes you don't feel. Same with the Earth around the Sun. The circular movement (what you call a change in direction) is very gradual.

       I seriously don’t understand your logic here.  You’re going to need to explain it to me.  The earth is rotating.  You seem to be saying that, in New Mexico, the earth is rotating about 830 MPH (2500 miles in 3 hours).  That actually sounds about right to me, so we’ll use that number.  So, our red bull jumper starts out moving 830 MPH (since he’s standing on the ground), and begins his ascent.  As he’s rising, he is still moving 830 MPH, in the same direction as the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he reaches his final altitude, but he’s still moving 830 MPH with the earth.  Nothing has happened to slow him down.  Where would all his kinetic energy have gone, anyway?  What force would have thrown him 830 MPH in the other direction?

       Flat Earthers don't understand how inertia works. They think as soon as you leave the surface of the earth you somehow lose all of your inertia. Or at least, they can't understand how you don't. And then they take their ignorance of how inertia works as proof of a flat earth (or disproof of Earth's rotation).

       Did you ever have a flying insect flying around in your car while you went at a fast speed, let's say down an interstate highway?  Does the insect  have to keep up with the car and fly at say 7 miles an hour to keep from being splatted against the back window, or does it lazily buzz around normally. The answer is that the atmosphere in the car travels with the car at the car's speed if the windows are up  and the insect has no problem keeping up because of that. That's what happens when the earth's atmosphere travels along with the earth. Keeping up while suspended in that atmosphere  is not a problem
