       How many more cases of Jimmy Savile (who was knighted by the queen and covered by the establishment while raping 600+ children/elderly/dead bodies) do we need before we wake up to this as a society?
You've outsheeped the sheep, to quote Icke. In fact that'd be insulting to sheep - at least they need a sheep dog to keep them in line. You idiots keep each other in line with your ignorance.
The evidence is out there.
Spread the word. To your family. To your coworkers. EVERYBODY.

       This is been going on since inception of the church. The base core of the Vatican never got rid of the Pegon rituals. There's more than just one religion in the world and more than one kind of Christianity.  You're just trying to pen it to one group in particular, The problem stems that they are individuals in many groups have nothing to do with said such activities.

       There's nothing new in human suffering. And to stop the suffering they have to take every right to freedom that you have. There is very little balance to it sadly. Even before the age of technology we were capable of keeping track of one another to great degree. Just look at any small towns rumor Mill.

       To save every child in the world you would have to except and pay a price. Nothing is without a price and no good deed goes on unpunished. And I say things because if you wondering why more people are not screaming about this. this is the reason why edit: a word

       these satanist cultists think in derivative mentality ...they feed offa power pain lust desire and poisons of the heart as they rob tender innocent children of their life force and energy
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact they lust for adrenilin so the most scared you are on impact the more they will derive from it
      </p>
      <p>
       think of the decay of our economy with their derivative paper
      </p>
      <p>
       think of the decay of humanity as they steal souls not theirs for their own nefarious ends
      </p>
      <p>
       everyone has a choice for good or evil  the heart decides which realm it chooses to live in

       Dude,  i don't know if you remember are you afraid of the dark,  but what you said about the adrenaline got to me.  The episode was the tale of the dangerous soup.  The chef would terrorize a person and make their greatest fear appear, and would add the pure fear into his soup.  Everyone loved the soup and kept coming back because of the secret recipe. I definitely see some thinly veiled similarities.

       they are so proud of themselves they always put a piece of their horror out there just like you describe over most heads but those in their knows knows the what whats underneath...plus i think its a way to tap all of our subconsciousnesses to their own maneouvers like enhancers  ...

       i guess it's the intent right? Not all paedophiles are satanic but the ones like the Clintons and Podestas and the presently being impeached South Korean President seem to rape and torture kids for satan/moloch/evil.
