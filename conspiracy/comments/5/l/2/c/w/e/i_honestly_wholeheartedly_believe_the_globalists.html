        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been criticized by my peers for being optimistic about this. It seems as if many in the &quot;conspiracy community&quot;, or whatever you would call us independent thinkers who seek the truth, seem to have a very apathetic attitude regarding the future of humanity. Many believe that it&#39;s too late. &quot;They have too much power, man. We&#39;re screwed&quot;. Or, &quot;They already have death camps set up and ready to go, and they&#39;re gonna get the guns, it&#39;s over&quot;. They seem to honestly believe that the establishment is this almighty unbeatable monster that has no weaknesses and cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>I know it is fully possible for us to stop them, and that we are already in the early stages of it. First off, these people make mistakes all the time. They have done a really sloppy job with their false flag operations, sloppier than they would have liked, and we have the internet to document and archive all of their mistakes. When they do make mistakes, they try to bury them as quickly as possible. 9/11 had the blatantly obvious &quot;WTC 7&quot; smoking gun along with several other leaks in the story (pentagon, explosions in basement, ect.), after the series of mass shootings from 2012-2015 people became really curious about the legitimacy of mainstream media narratives regarding gun control, especially after the sloppy job of Sandy Hook. Perhaps most damning of all is the recent Pizzagate scandal.  Obviously, they fucked up by allowing information to be leaked, but when the Pizzagate investigation began to unfold, they REALLY fucked up by going <em>way</em> too hard with the cover up. &quot;Fake news&quot;, hit pieces, blatant censorship and misinformation by mainstream media, Russia narrative, ALL in unison. They made it blatantly obvious that they had something to cover up, and people are starting to pick up on this kind of stuff now. Sure, theres a few flouridated zombies left out there who are going to eat up whatever Fox news is limpin&#39; to the barn with, but even the <em>sheeple</em> don&#39;t trust the mainstream media anymore. Their stranglehold of control over the information we recieve is dwindling.</p>

<p>They are not &quot;all powerfull and all knowing&quot;, or they wouldn&#39;t have to operate in secrecy and have to program us if they weren&#39;t afraid of what we were capable of when we were massively awakened. They need our acquiescence, we hold the power. You see massive uprisings in all these countries all over the world, Brazil, Korea, Egypt, Greece, Mexico. I think they are losing their grip on us, and they are going to be forced to rush their plan, and they will make more mistakes. </p>

<p>However, I will admit, I&#39;m sure these people have thought of everything. They have a plan A through Z, and they have made arrangements to flee or hide to avoid arrest. Some people believe that they will just &quot;nuke the world&quot; if they can&#39;t get their precious world government. But I believe it&#39;s possible if we start making real arrests, they will panic and start ratting on each other, and maybe that sort of chaos would cause them to back off a bit. </p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m at least optimistic about the future. We are alive in one of the craziest times in history on this planet. Will the evil technocrats succeed in enslaving humanity or can humanity spiritually awaken and unite to remove them from power? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A prophet is one who foretells of future events.</p>

<p>Essentially all those of divine inspiration, knowledge, are prophets.</p>

<p>For example, Aristotle, it is said, described insects in such a way that could not be confirmed for 1700 year. Effectively he was a prophet, of insects.</p>

<p>The stories of Jesus foretell of a political philosophy that wouldn&#39;t manifest for 1500 years (or more , you could say). Essentially Jesus is a political prophet.</p>

<p>Knowledge, truth, logic, are unchangeable, unstoppable. The ideal system of governance 4,000 years from now, can be understood today, or could have been understood 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The only thing that has changed from the times of Jesus to today, essentially, are that individual people worldwide can hold back and forth conversations in the span of seconds vs humanly impossible in 0 AD.</p>

<p>Up until about 20 years ago, it really wasn&#39;t possible to communicate with more than 1 person at a time beyond the distance of yelling. Today both, all person on a shared internet can do such a thing.</p>

<p>This globalization that will occur regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The so called God Ra is a false God stolen by the Egyptians from the true Hebrews. These stories are nothing more than conversions from the actual Bible in which they all have an end. They do not stand the test of time nor do their stories predict and show any of the prophecies happening in our time.</p>

<p>Both Joseph and Moses ruled under Pharaoh. When Joseph ruled, he helped the Egyptians learn the laws given to Jacob and helped saved the people from famine. Meaning, he was telling the stories that God had given to Jacob in which the scribes of Egypt took them for their own and taught them to their people.</p>

<p>Show me some prophecies happening from the stories of Egypt. You see how the Bible correlates directly with what&#39;s going in our time? Show me that with Ra. From the looks of it, Ra only gives this happy go lucky, nothing even matters at all feeling. </p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth, there is a reason why the evil twin is in rulership right now and a reason why his New World Order will fail. The Bible explains this.</p>

<p>Ra is an extraterrestrial. Anyways, Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of us define Infinity as Unity ~ everything can&#39;t help but be part of this Infinity and ultimately everything can&#39;t help but be the One Infinite Creator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, this is key. Finding a way to organize and have a plan. I&#39;m very confident that this will happen. People are a lot smarter than you think, and we will be forced to network and work together to overthrow these people. Brilliant people who will be able to come up with some way to hack police drones or 3d printing ammunition and firearms for us to use will invent and adapt for us to be able to fight back.  We will find ways to compete with them and hold our ground, because when people have nothing to lose, they go all out and fight for their lives and the sake of their names and ancestors. </p>

<p>We just have to make sure the racial divide and the SJW narrative of everybody being &quot;offended and racist and sexist&quot; doesn&#39;t split us apart and make us hate one another and distrust one another. If the collapse happens and we&#39;re in the middle of a race war, than we will not be able to focus and band together for a solution like we&#39;re destined to do. Thats why I always say how dangerous this media race war is, divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the book, but it&#39;s the foundation of what these people believe in, and it works...</p>

<p>yeah that isn&#39;t doing anything except giving them a way to vent.  once they are back on the reserve and drunk the government is going to make up some report on how it is safe to put it in, everyone will agree, and this will all be forgotten as the new pipeline is laid.  </p>

<p>same thing happened with occupy, same thing will happen this time, and it will continue to keep happening as long as you play by the rules they give you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%. But I didn&#39;t always feel that way. When I first had my eyes opened back in 2002 because of 9/11, my first thought was we can beat this if we tell everybody. And then I spent the next however many years of my life making myself out to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot; to everyone I tried to talk to. Knowing that politics was fake, the mainstream media was every bit as real as pro wrestling, and laws and decisions were not made in Congressional meetings, but were made in secret society meetings without anyone&#39;s knowledge. It started to get a bit difficult to fight. I remember I would ask my friends what do we do, and I would get 2 responses. Keep telling people and trying to wake them up, or nothing and hope for the best. I actually didn&#39;t even see a solution myself and that&#39;s why I kind of took myself out of current events for so long. Enter about 4 months ago. I knew Donald Trump was running for the president. I had heard that he had said things like he believe 911 was an inside job, he believed Barack Obama was not born in America, and he believed the Federal Reserve was evil. But I figured that by him actually being the Republican nominee, he was completely crooked or else he would have never made it to that position so I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the election. Then he did that speech in Florida where he said we will no longer surrender to the false flag of globalism. He was talking about how crooked everything was. He was talking about the corruption. And I heard it with my own ears. I avoid the mainstream media 100%. I don&#39;t have cable, so I never accidentally see it. And I don&#39;t ever go looking for it. However, I have subscribed to this sub pretty much since I got my Reddit account. And I was consistently seeing the headlines of Hillary Clinton, the emails, the health problems. And I knew the media wasn&#39;t talking about that. I had no idea they were painting Donald Trump out to be Hitler. And of course, I knew how corrupt the clintons were because their politicians. But once I heard Trump speaking of the corruption in front of these large crowds and everyone was behind him chanting &quot;lock her up&quot;, I realized I was no longer the minority, I was slowly becoming part of the majority. People were opening their eyes and becoming awake to this. All we needed was someone to spearhead the charge and that person was Donald Trump. Even if he had lost, he opened so many people&#39;s eyes up to the corruption that something would have had to done. Now I have very high hopes for president Trump and I hope he leads our country in the charge against globalism and we can save our Republic and bring it back to the way it was supposed to be where we are an independent nation and we are free as American people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I&#39;m still leaning towards Trump being a Trojan Horse, but who knows. Seems like he&#39;s the &quot;false prophet&quot; they are trying to get the conspiracy community to endorse and follow, and Alex Jones was the controlled opposition pied piper who led his viewers to endorsing him and the Republican Party (which is dumb, because he used to say the two party system was bullshit and the left and the right are just a wedge to divide the people). They are throwing so much at us right now that it&#39;s becoming really hard to break down their social engineering and forecast what they&#39;re going to do or how they steer certain events, especially the election. They are throwing us down different rabbit holes and trying to confuse us, because they know that we are smart and that they cant just roll out the same half ass narrative anymore and expect us to buy it and react how we are supposed to. But they are definitely in Damage control mode as you said above.</p>

<p>They have done a really sloppy job with their false flag operations,</p>

<p>I agree. But still, the general public doesn&#39;t notice anything wrong. In fact, us &quot;conspiratards&quot; are labeled insane for even believing there&#39;s such a thing as false flags. And that&#39;s why TPTB can continue being sloppy. Talk to ordinary people to confirm this. We&#39;re in an echo chamber here, so it&#39;s easy for us to get fooled and think that everyone is as &quot;woke&quot; as we are. News flash: Most people aren&#39;t woke. They&#39;re sheeple, and they&#39;re asleep. That might be changing, but the change is sloooow. </p>

<p>We still live under the old world order, and it&#39;s Trump&#39;s job to dismantle it to pave way for the new one, which is planned for 2023. We&#39;ll have to wait and see if they&#39;re successful in implementing it. </p>

<p>Assange is missing, and I think that if they let the news out that they killed him, they know the people would not be happy. Our last source of truth and real opposition to the NWO is gone, and if we knew that for sure, that would be the last straw for a lot of us. </p>

<p>A couple years ago when I found this sub, the state of apathy was almost depressing. Now, there are folks who are rightfully getting angry and want answers. It is time to start making demands and bring back real democracy.

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come&quot; - Victor Hugo</strong></p>

<p>The idea of globalization, of one central source of power, one unified organism IS the goal of this whole entire human experiment we call civilization. It&#39;s the holy grail of every conqueror, statesman, emperor, godking, etc. It&#39;s been a long journey but the elements are finally coming together. We are not exactly there yet but we will soon.</p>

<p>The old world of fractured political entities will fall one by one, swallowed by a more successful evolution in according to the most natural law no different from stronger microbes engulfing lesser ones. The people can die, actors can be disrupted, but the stage will continue to exist as a beacon for those who seek it. New generations will spring up, new actors will come forward. That is the power of ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a potential for a collapse and a violent uprising will likely follow, and we can see that they are planning for this by hoarding ammunition (DHS bought 4 billion rounds of hollow point ammo in 2013), the FEMA camps, militaized police ect.

<p>get with the program before you&#39;re reprogrammed.  you still have a chance to win the day if you stop failing at mocking me and go do something real and lasting.  like i&#39;ve said a thousand times before though, it&#39;s better that you stay here and tell me about all these victories that don&#39;t exist since capitalism is still very corrupt and very in power.  that way you don&#39;t hurt yourself, or change the status quo like the good slave you were born to be!</p>
