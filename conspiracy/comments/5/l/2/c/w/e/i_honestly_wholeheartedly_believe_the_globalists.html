       I have been criticized by my peers for being optimistic about this. It seems as if many in the "conspiracy community", or whatever you would call us independent thinkers who seek the truth, seem to have a very apathetic attitude regarding the future of humanity. Many believe that it's too late. "They have too much power, man. We're screwed". Or, "They already have death camps set up and ready to go, and they're gonna get the guns, it's over". They seem to honestly believe that the establishment is this almighty unbeatable monster that has no weaknesses and cannot be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it is fully possible for us to stop them, and that we are already in the early stages of it. First off, these people make mistakes all the time. They have done a really sloppy job with their false flag operations, sloppier than they would have liked, and we have the internet to document and archive all of their mistakes. When they do make mistakes, they try to bury them as quickly as possible. 9/11 had the blatantly obvious "WTC 7" smoking gun along with several other leaks in the story (pentagon, explosions in basement, ect.), after the series of mass shootings from 2012-2015 people became really curious about the legitimacy of mainstream media narratives regarding gun control, especially after the sloppy job of Sandy Hook. Perhaps most damning of all is the recent Pizzagate scandal.  Obviously, they fucked up by allowing information to be leaked, but when the Pizzagate investigation began to unfold, they REALLY fucked up by going
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too hard with the cover up. "Fake news", hit pieces, blatant censorship and misinformation by mainstream media, Russia narrative, ALL in unison. They made it blatantly obvious that they had something to cover up, and people are starting to pick up on this kind of stuff now. Sure, theres a few flouridated zombies left out there who are going to eat up whatever Fox news is limpin' to the barn with, but even the
       <em>
        sheeple
       </em>
       don't trust the mainstream media anymore. Their stranglehold of control over the information we recieve is dwindling.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not "all powerfull and all knowing", or they wouldn't have to operate in secrecy and have to program us if they weren't afraid of what we were capable of when we were massively awakened. They need our acquiescence, we hold the power. You see massive uprisings in all these countries all over the world, Brazil, Korea, Egypt, Greece, Mexico. I think they are losing their grip on us, and they are going to be forced to rush their plan, and they will make more mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will admit, I'm sure these people have thought of everything. They have a plan A through Z, and they have made arrangements to flee or hide to avoid arrest. Some people believe that they will just "nuke the world" if they can't get their precious world government. But I believe it's possible if we start making real arrests, they will panic and start ratting on each other, and maybe that sort of chaos would cause them to back off a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I'm at least optimistic about the future. We are alive in one of the craziest times in history on this planet. Will the evil technocrats succeed in enslaving humanity or can humanity spiritually awaken and unite to remove them from power?

       Yea, I'm definitely thinking they have made arrangements to avoid being thrown in prison or killed. But I bet you

       A prophet is one who foretells of future events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially all those of divine inspiration, knowledge, are prophets.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Aristotle, it is said, described insects in such a way that could not be confirmed for 1700 year. Effectively he was a prophet, of insects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories of Jesus foretell of a political philosophy that wouldn't manifest for 1500 years (or more , you could say). Essentially Jesus is a political prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge, truth, logic, are unchangeable, unstoppable. The ideal system of governance 4,000 years from now, can be understood today, or could have been understood 4,000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that has changed from the times of Jesus to today, essentially, are that individual people worldwide can hold back and forth conversations in the span of seconds vs humanly impossible in 0 AD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until about 20 years ago, it really wasn't possible to communicate with more than 1 person at a time beyond the distance of yelling. Today both, all person on a shared internet can do such a thing.

       The so called God Ra is a false God stolen by the Egyptians from the true Hebrews. These stories are nothing more than conversions from the actual Bible in which they all have an end. They do not stand the test of time nor do their stories predict and show any of the prophecies happening in our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Joseph and Moses ruled under Pharaoh. When Joseph ruled, he helped the Egyptians learn the laws given to Jacob and helped saved the people from famine. Meaning, he was telling the stories that God had given to Jacob in which the scribes of Egypt took them for their own and taught them to their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me some prophecies happening from the stories of Egypt. You see how the Bible correlates directly with what's going in our time? Show me that with Ra. From the looks of it, Ra only gives this happy go lucky, nothing even matters at all feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing could be further from the truth, there is a reason why the evil twin is in rulership right now and a reason why his New World Order will fail. The Bible explains this.

       Ra is an extraterrestrial. Anyways, Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of us define Infinity as Unity ~ everything can't help but be part of this Infinity and ultimately everything can't help but be the One Infinite Creator.

       Definitely, this is key. Finding a way to organize and have a plan. I'm very confident that this will happen. People are a lot smarter than you think, and we will be forced to network and work together to overthrow these people. Brilliant people who will be able to come up with some way to hack police drones or 3d printing ammunition and firearms for us to use will invent and adapt for us to be able to fight back.  We will find ways to compete with them and hold our ground, because when people have nothing to lose, they go all out and fight for their lives and the sake of their names and ancestors.
      </p>

       We just have to make sure the racial divide and the SJW narrative of everybody being "offended and racist and sexist" doesn't split us apart and make us hate one another and distrust one another. If the collapse happens and we're in the middle of a race war, than we will not be able to focus and band together for a solution like we're destined to do. Thats why I always say how dangerous this media race war is, divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the book, but it's the foundation of what these people believe in, and it works...

       If you guys want to unite then you have to take the plunge into doing so. Eliminate all divisions between people as fast as possible is the best place to start. Instead of competition, focus on cooperation. Every game and movie is people battling each other. This is intentional.

       You don't sound very informed about what's happening on the ground. The water protectors are still there, fucking shit up, and serving as role models. How many stuffy, boring liberals have gotten far more insurrectionary because of their participation there, and the experiences they had with state terror? Any conflict with TPTB that makes it into the public eye to begin with is a huge win, one event can sully decades of propaganda

       Obviously once donald is in, things will get far worse. But that will only clarify his position as the figurehead of the largest terrorist organization the world has ever seen.

       yeah that isn't doing anything except giving them a way to vent.  once they are back on the reserve and drunk the government is going to make up some report on how it is safe to put it in, everyone will agree, and this will all be forgotten as the new pipeline is laid.

       like i said, i'm really happy the 'victory'  your masters gave you has embolden you enough to say some strong words to a stranger on the internet, but like occupy, and every other protest in america before it, you aren't going to get what you want because they just have to wait for you to forget, or to move on to the next 'issue.'  seeing as i told occupy the same thing 8 years ago i feel pretty safe in that assumption.

       "going strong"  is a strange way to say 'faffing about and trying to look important.'  was occupy 'going strong'  when wall street wasn't going to jail for the crimes they committed?  how strong where the hippies going when we america moved it's endless war from vietnam to the middle east?
      </p>

       keep 'going strong'  by all means, i insist.  the end is going to be so much funnier if you do.

       Explain how you think Rojava is "controlled opposition". If they're just a US pawn, why is the US giving material aid to their enemies? Why do they declare the philosophical basis of US law

       someoone has to get paid to do it.  like the Mujahideen, and the contras before them.  the only reason anyone is fighting in the middle east is so they can be the ones exploiting resources, or so the us/russia can by proxy.    if the bar was any lower on your requirements for a 'glorious socialist revolution'  it would have melted  somewhere close to the earths core.

       Now you're just refusing to leave your own fantasy world and read a fucking article I linked you. Whatever, have fun, the real world will still be here when you're done. You have no evidence of any of this, and a cursory examination of the facts, which you have not done, would reveal any state you could accuse of being in collusion with them as taking military action against them
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty funny you think "well SOMEONE has to be paying the YPG?!" when just about every soldier is paid solely in rations. They're doing it to save their homes, or because they believe in the cause, and if you could take your head out of your ass for a few seconds you might understand it's merits.

       talking about yourself is a sure sine of insanity.  replying to someones post while you do so even more so.  since you are the one saying we should continue trying outdated systems of revolt, i'll let the irony of what you said sink in.  also, i never said anything about fake news, so you might not want to play that card unless you want people to see your true colors.

       This is fucking hilarious. I have patiently explained tons of things to you, given you plenty of oppurtunities to present an alternative to my methods or evidence that they've been coopted as you claim, you can do neither. You have no arguments because you have no reason to believe I'm wrong, it's a wholly emotional response emanating from your sense of identity. I'm sorry you've let external forces seize that for their own use.

       get with the program before you're reprogrammed.  you still have a chance to win the day if you stop failing at mocking me and go do something real and lasting.  like i've said a thousand times before though, it's better that you stay here and tell me about all these victories that don't exist since capitalism is still very corrupt and very in power.  that way you don't hurt yourself, or change the status quo like the good slave you were born to be!

       You've presented no evidence, you've just been repeating, "I disagree with this!!" again and again. And how marvelous that you'd recommend I stop wasting my time with networking and evangelism, and stick with your strategy of doing absolutely nothing, bragging about doing absolutely nothing, and jealously lashing out at others who dare to try anything. I think I'll stick with my method.

       if people need to wake up, i'm the guy that gets them off their phone and out of bed.  i get them moving around and taking action.  until everyone realizes reddit isn't for action, but is one giant echo chamber to keep you complacent and bombarded with your own views, nothing is going to be resolved.  get out of bed and stop them.  you can start by removing money from the corporations that use it to buy your governments.  its a lot easier to hear the voice of the people when you aren't listening to money.

       Exactly. They are trying to sell the New World Order to us as a "humanitarian" thing, coming together and being as one peacefully. However, their reasoning behind it is much more sinister obviously, but they market that to us like we're progressing as a species and it's for the good of humanity, when in reality they are just posing as the saviors and consolidating us so were easier to control.

       I agree with you 100%. But I didn't always feel that way. When I first had my eyes opened back in 2002 because of 9/11, my first thought was we can beat this if we tell everybody. And then I spent the next however many years of my life making myself out to be a "conspiracy theorist" and "crazy" to everyone I tried to talk to. Knowing that politics was fake, the mainstream media was every bit as real as pro wrestling, and laws and decisions were not made in Congressional meetings, but were made in secret society meetings without anyone's knowledge. It started to get a bit difficult to fight. I remember I would ask my friends what do we do, and I would get 2 responses. Keep telling people and trying to wake them up, or nothing and hope for the best. I actually didn't even see a solution myself and that's why I kind of took myself out of current events for so long. Enter about 4 months ago. I knew Donald Trump was running for the president. I had heard that he had said things like he believe 911 was an inside job, he believed Barack Obama was not born in America, and he believed the Federal Reserve was evil. But I figured that by him actually being the Republican nominee, he was completely crooked or else he would have never made it to that position so I wasn't paying attention to the election. Then he did that speech in Florida where he said we will no longer surrender to the false flag of globalism. He was talking about how crooked everything was. He was talking about the corruption. And I heard it with my own ears. I avoid the mainstream media 100%. I don't have cable, so I never accidentally see it. And I don't ever go looking for it. However, I have subscribed to this sub pretty much since I got my Reddit account. And I was consistently seeing the headlines of Hillary Clinton, the emails, the health problems. And I knew the media wasn't talking about that. I had no idea they were painting Donald Trump out to be Hitler. And of course, I knew how corrupt the clintons were because their politicians. But once I heard Trump speaking of the corruption in front of these large crowds and everyone was behind him chanting "lock her up", I realized I was no longer the minority, I was slowly becoming part of the majority. People were opening their eyes and becoming awake to this. All we needed was someone to spearhead the charge and that person was Donald Trump. Even if he had lost, he opened so many people's eyes up to the corruption that something would have had to done. Now I have very high hopes for president Trump and I hope he leads our country in the charge against globalism and we can save our Republic and bring it back to the way it was supposed to be where we are an independent nation and we are free as American people.

       That was a terrible answer. In my defense that is the type of question one must grok on. It will be based on that type of science, but that doesn't do it justice. I've never been a star gazer, but it's undeniable, the age of Aquarius has arrived. Breath taking is the right word for it.

       Agreed. I'm still leaning towards Trump being a Trojan Horse, but who knows. Seems like he's the "false prophet" they are trying to get the conspiracy community to endorse and follow, and Alex Jones was the controlled opposition pied piper who led his viewers to endorsing him and the Republican Party (which is dumb, because he used to say the two party system was bullshit and the left and the right are just a wedge to divide the people). They are throwing so much at us right now that it's becoming really hard to break down their social engineering and forecast what they're going to do or how they steer certain events, especially the election. They are throwing us down different rabbit holes and trying to confuse us, because they know that we are smart and that they cant just roll out the same half ass narrative anymore and expect us to buy it and react how we are supposed to. But they are definitely in Damage control mode as you said above.

       I agree with this wholeheartedly I don't understand how so many conspiracy theorist blindly trust Trump. If he won the election it was because he serves some purpose.

       I agree. But still, the general public doesn't notice anything wrong. In fact, us "conspiratards" are labeled insane for even believing there's such a thing as false flags. And that's why TPTB can continue being sloppy. Talk to ordinary people to confirm this. We're in an echo chamber here, so it's easy for us to get fooled and think that everyone is as "woke" as we are. News flash: Most people aren't woke. They're sheeple, and they're asleep. That might be changing, but the change is sloooow.

       We still live under the old world order, and it's Trump's job to dismantle it to pave way for the new one, which is planned for 2023. We'll have to wait and see if they're successful in implementing it.

       I want to think you're right but sadly the foundations are set for world government. The United Nations will play a big role in this. Sovereignty of almost every nation has been destroyed including the US. According to the bible the beast with 7 heads and 10 horns represent an entity with worldwide power. But the good news is that it only rules a very short time before being destroyed.

       Good post, man. I agree that we have the true power. And we are willingly giving it to these sick fucks every day that we don't demand answers from them. The problem right now is that no one wants to get off their asses and do something about this blatant injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is missing, and I think that if they let the news out that they killed him, they know the people would not be happy. Our last source of truth and real opposition to the NWO is gone, and if we knew that for sure, that would be the last straw for a lot of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple years ago when I found this sub, the state of apathy was almost depressing. Now, there are folks who are rightfully getting angry and want answers. It is time to start making demands and bring back real democracy. The people must be aware of this stuff, and I hope trump surprises me with transparency and a real government for the people because otherwise, it's gonna be an even longer future of rebellion ahead.

       The irony of the so-called "New World Order" is that there's nothing "new" about it.

      <p>
       It's the attempt to re-constitute the old British Imperial structure by using the Commonwealth of Nations + a re-captured America. It's an attempt to maintain the old British Empire and Atlantic banking structure.

       The bottom line i'm getting at is the group of psychopaths who are trying to establish a world government are going to fuck it up, and that we should rejoice in this. However, I'm a little appalled at some of the pessimistic comments and attempts to shut down and brush off my optimistic outlook on the matter. To those of you are still have faith, keep fighting. We will win.

       The idea of globalization, of one central source of power, one unified organism IS the goal of this whole entire human experiment we call civilization. It's the holy grail of every conqueror, statesman, emperor, godking, etc. It's been a long journey but the elements are finally coming together. We are not exactly there yet but we will soon.

       The old world of fractured political entities will fall one by one, swallowed by a more successful evolution in according to the most natural law no different from stronger microbes engulfing lesser ones. The people can die, actors can be disrupted, but the stage will continue to exist as a beacon for those who seek it. New generations will spring up, new actors will come forward. That is the power of ideas.

       We hold the guns and we hold the nukes. The elite just point them in the right place, trick us into thinking what we're doing is good and pay us to do their dirty work.

       These people don't have the balls to do anything themselves, but they are smart. Arrogant, but smart enough to persuade you to do anything they want.

       Well, what would be the point of scowering this sub then if you didn't have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       kind of hope or passion to keep up with the current events that are unfolding? If we are doomed to a New World Order, why bother keeping informed with whats happening? We should just live it up for the moment and go out with a bang right?

       I think we have the advantage in numbers and that these people can be stopped because they are foolish and arrogant.

       I think there is a potential for a collapse and a violent uprising will likely follow, and we can see that they are planning for this by hoarding ammunition (DHS bought 4 billion rounds of hollow point ammo in 2013), the FEMA camps, militaized police ect. However, if we are smart and we expose these people and force them to back off, then we have a shot of either avoiding that conflict or at least greatly reducing it.

       too be this stupid.  you must live a blessed life.  how you get dressed without killing yourself is a marvel of modern society sweetie.

      <p>
       get with the program before you're reprogrammed.  you still have a chance to win the day if you stop failing at mocking me and go do something real and lasting.  like i've said a thousand times before though, it's better that you stay here and tell me about all these victories that don't exist since capitalism is still very corrupt and very in power.  that way you don't hurt yourself, or change the status quo like the good slave you were born to be!
