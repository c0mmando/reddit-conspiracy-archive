        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">277</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/dontkillmehillary.html">dontkillmehillary</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the disinformation projects currently at work is to convince us that Podesta&#39;s email was hacked by Russian secret agents or some other bullshit. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>As we can see in <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36355">this email here</a> that it&#39;s very likely Podesta fell for a simple phishing scam run through an IP in the Ukraine. The phishing email was sent March 19, and the final WL email from Podesta&#39;s account seems to be <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5210">this one from March 21</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Assuming the scam is where the password was compromised this gave hackers roughly 2 days to offload the emails. </p></li>
<li><p>As you can see from the phishing email, Google sends a warning email when accounts are accessed from new locations. This format email is what the hackers mimicked to trick Podesta into the phishing link.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So if the original Google warning was part of the phishing scam, where is the real google warning? It&#39;s possible (likely) it was deleted by the scammers as it came in, however Google will have a sending record of this on their own email servers. <strong>Google can tell us where the hack originated</strong>. Even if the hack was coming from the same IP as the original scam email, or VPN proxy Google can confirm this information.</p>

<p>A second option for the password breach was Podesta&#39;s missing cell phone as we see <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25364">in this email from July 2015</a>. If this was the breach date then hackers had 8 months to mine the emails slowly and less noticeably.</p>

<p>If the hack did not actually happen because of the phishing scam (it&#39;s possible that DNC IT actually did their job and caught it) and someone got the password from another source such as the phone then Google can still check their servers to identify the location of the computer which accessed and downloaded all 38,000 (or so) emails. Again, <strong>Google can tell us the location of the hacking IP</strong>.   </p>

<p>We are being lied to over and over. Podesta could allow Google to release the information on the hacking IP and possibly solve the question once and for all. Even if the IP reveals an remote VPN IP address this might clear up the question of whether the hack was an internal or external leak. Discovery of an internal DNC IP address data mining Podesta&#39;s email would be a massive break in the story if it was true. Likewise, confirming a Russian IP would be equally explosive as it would add confirmation and justification to the White House claims of Russian hacking.  </p>

<p>Pressure should be applied to Podesta and Google to release this information as it has moved from a private email debacle to potentially an incident of State security.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>edit</strong>; I just wanted to mention that the same information can be gathered on the DNC leaked emails. I&#39;m not sure if they were using a Google or Outlook server but the information record remains all the same.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>edit 2</strong> u/2many2Toss points out some interesting facts about the IP address in the original phishing email I thought worthwhile noting here;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correct. The phishing email reads:</p>

<p>Someone just used your password to try to sign in to your Google Account<br/>
<a href="mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com">john.podesta@gmail.com</a>.<br/>
Details:<br/>
Saturday, 19 March, 8:34:30 UTC<br/>
IP Address: 134.249.139.239<br/>
Location: Ukraine  </p>

<p>That&#39;s all bogus, made up by the attacker.</p>

<p>The .tk domain could have been registered by anybody, anywhere. It looks like the <a href="http://dot.tk">http://dot.tk</a> is willing to do this for free (although there&#39;s no reason a cybercriminal couldn&#39;t use a stolen CC to register a domain through any registrar).</p>

<p>So unfortunately the .tk part doesn&#39;t tell us much -- nor does it implicate anybody having anything to do with New Zealand. I don&#39;t have enough information available to me (and the actual .tk phishing site is offline so I can&#39;t find much out about it) to tell beyond that. </p>

<p>What does seem clear is that this attack was most likely carried out using resources available to the general public -- meaning we can&#39;t rule out state sponsorship, but I would expect a Russian intelligence op to be more sophisticated than this (unless they deliberately lean towards more amateur techniques to throw researchers off their trail).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>edit 3</strong> Thanks to u/webofslime for this little detail! Turns out .tk is out of the Netherlands  </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>&quot;The link to the website where Podesta was encouraged to change his Gmail password actually directed him instead to a computer in the Netherlands with a web address associated with Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand located in the South Pacific.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It kind of blows my mind that everyone isn&#39;t shouting all over the place that the server was in the Netherlands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming the FBI, NSA, or CIA already has it. They very likely would have subpoenaed Google for the information ages ago, and Google drops their pants faster than a cheerleader on prom night for those official requests. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we will see any official action until after inauguration as too many people are trying to jockey for jobs right now and no one wants to upset the apple cart. Maybe after the new administration is in we might see some kind of action from official sources?</p>

<p>I think the best way we &quot;the internet&quot; can get the information is a viral campaign of pressure on tptb.  Flooding Google, the DNC, and Podesta to release that information could cause movement on that front. Hitting them on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere to create public awareness that the data does actually exist might start making a few faces red.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with Apple was that they didn&#39;t currently have a back door to the iphone and didn&#39;t want to make one. The lawsuit the FBI pursued was to force Apple to create (or at least reveal) their back door.

Apart from his love of hot dogs, pizza, freaky art, and rejecting pool parties we also discovered Obama knew about Clinton&#39;s email server and lied on television about it, Clinton received money from Saudi Arabia and Qatar (strangely not considered evidence of foreign influence on campaign), people were paid to incite violence, Clinton knew deleting emails was wrong, Clinton was involved in massive pay-to-play schemes, and Podesta likes having vaginal blood smeared on his walls.

    <div class="md"><p>The best part is where Charles Delavan confirms that &quot;This is a legitimate email&quot;.  Right in changing password and setting up 2FA though.  The link in the email (at least now) shows a warning from BitLy that you&#39;re probably being phished:</p>

<p>&quot;The link you requested may contain inappropriate content, or even spam or malicious code that could be downloaded to your computer without your consent, or may be a forgery or imitation of another website, designed to trick users into sharing personal or financial information.&quot;</p>

<p>So Podesta/team would have had to ignore that and click through anyway. The phishing domain/site seems to have been taken down since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Ukrainian IP on the phish? The one referenced in the body of the phishing email is bogus. The actual phishing attack linked to a bit.ly location (hXXps :// bit .ly/1PibSU0).</p>

<p>Bit.ly still shows the original destination for this link (which is now offline) as hXXp: //myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage .tk/security/signinoptions/password?e=am9obi5wb2Rlc3RhQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ%3D%3D&amp;fn=Sm9obiBQb2Rlc3Rh&amp;n=Sm9obg%3D%3D&amp;img=Ly9saDQuZ29vZ2xldXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tLy1RZVlPbHJkVGp2WS9BQUFBQUFBQUFBSS9BQUFBQUFBQUFCTS9CQldVOVQ0bUZUWS9waG90by5qcGc%3D&amp;id=1sutlodlwe</p>

<p>So the actual domain hosting the phishing site was com-securitysettingpage .tk </p>

<p>This is classic phishing, and not very sophisticated at that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but if the hack was internal from a DNC owned computer then a reveal of the IP address would show this. As it stands right now nobody (except Wikileaks apparently) knows exactly where the leak came from. We are speculating it was from the phishing email because the timing on that lines up perfectly. The phishing email could be a happy coincidence also. </p>

<p>Even if it was the subject of a federal investigation Podesta could request from Google that information (as it&#39;s his own personal info anyhow) and release it himself. Additionally if it were part of an investigation then the White House would have access to that and could have released it as part of their &quot;proof&quot; of Russian hacking. </p>

<p>The White House, DNC, Clinton camp, and Podesta have all failed to release the IP which Google could supply. If the truth of the IP location runs counter to the Russian narrative then we have a major problem of the White House being hawkish with a nuclear power using false evidence. That&#39;s upsetting to say the least. If the WH cites the DNC and Podesta leaks as evidence of Russian hacking then the onus is on them to prove it, especially if they shift the US onto a confrontational footing with Russia mere weeks before an administration change.</p>

<p>If the IP proves Russian hacking then we have the right to that knowledge also. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The accusations being made by the WH is that &quot;Russia&quot; was responsible for the hacks, and they have also made political moves against Russia in response - <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-obama-russia-sanctions-20161229-story.html">see this article detailing some of the political retaliations</a>.</p>

<p>The moves by the White House have changed the context of the Podesta leaks from a domestic one to an international one.  </p>

<p>In a domestic case keeping the IPs confidential protects American citizens and confines the case to domestic courts and enforcement. Exposing the IPs could jeopardize an investigation (as you rightly pointed out). </p>

<p>However now that the WH has expanded this to an international issue and they WH claims hackers were a foreign entity, no citizens of the US are at risk of having their constitutional rights violated and the representatives of the American people are beholden to their constituents to maintain transparency on their actions if those actions might lead to war. The current administrations actions do indeed threaten Russia and could lead to retaliatory action from Russia which impacts the whole US (and not a single individual) therefore transparent justification for their actions is needed. This would take the form of revealing the IP and any other details they have about international hackers.... unless those hackers are domestic, in which case the WH is lying to the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t require them to do that. It&#39;s like giving out the home address of an international criminal. It&#39;s just not a necessary thing, especially when we can&#39;t use it for some sort of vigilante justice or conduct our own investigations when we probably don&#39;t have the confidential intelligence information they have (for anything, whether you believe them on this case or not).

    <div class="md"><p>There is precedent though. The &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; demonstration by Colin Powell was just that. The government maintained that Iraq had chemical weapons and presented that (wrong) evidence to the UN. Any vigilantes that wished to seek and destroy chemical weapons following the UN disclosure would be acting separate from US authority and protection. Revealing a Russian (or any other foreign national) spy&#39;s IP address and endangering the spy should have no bearing on American security procedure.</p>

<p>If the White House (and President) is going to argue hacking, and use that argument to potentially put the nation on a war footing against a nuclear super power, then it behooves the President to provide proof to congress, and the people they represent, such a stance is necessary. The constitution grants <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress">the right to congress to make these decisions</a>, not the President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the same kind of precedent. And it wouldn&#39;t just be about endangering someone, moreso about endangering the investigation (revealing things the perpetrators might not know we know, people making wrong assumptions by what would probably be a proxied IP, etc). </p>

<p>Regarding the WMD evidence, that was used as justification for war, which we haven&#39;t come close to actually discussing yet. And it wasn&#39;t the same kind of revealing evidence to the public. And the CIA actually had heavy doubts about an active program in their report and didn&#39;t purport clear certainty. The Bush administration manipulated their info to make their case, whereas in this case the CIA is claiming with near certainty that this involves Russian government sources. These are completely different cases. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t even have to release the entire IP address. Just a portion of it would be enough to establish where it came from without giving up some phony &quot;privacy&quot; concern. A criminal state espionage hack that the governement and federal intel agencies have already concluded that it is in FACT Russia requires no further privacy protection. Nor does it involve any legal hurdle to release such information since we expelled the supposed culprits rather than charge them with any crimes.  Such a phony cover up it is rather comical.</p>

<em>The link to the website where Podesta was encouraged to change his Gmail password actually directed him instead to a computer in the Netherlands with a web address associated with Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand located in the South Pacific. The hackers carefully disguised the link using a service that shortens lengthy online addresses. But even for anyone checking more diligently, the address — ‘‘google.com-securitysettingpage’’ — was crafted to appear genuine.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>An IP is not proof of identity as they can be spoofed or rerouted through any country using proxies or a VPN. We already know from the JAR file and released IPs most of them were untraceable Tor nodes, and the majority came from the US with Russia being the 3rd largest amount by comparison.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also missing the NSA and their capabilities. They track all network activity of major service providers like Google so they could have seen the emails being downloaded and transmitted, especially the DNC emails. The fact the NSA isn&#39;t part of this official narrative is highly suspicious considering they&#39;re the one agency with the capabilities to prove conclusively what happened. </p>

<p>What this means is whoever downloaded the emails did so locally, and then likely physically put them on a thumb drive or other device then handed over the storage device to Wikileaks. Had they sent the files to Wikileaks electronically over the Internet the NSA absolutely could have tracked the upload and likely traced the source. Had they used Tor it would have taken days or weeks to send that much data even with a decent connection.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of the data, the amount, and the lack of network activity that someone would have noticed either at the DNC, Google, or the NSA indicates it&#39;s far more likely this is a leak, and someone who had access to the data legally, accessed it locally, saved it locally, and then physically handed it off, which is exactly what Craig Murray an activist with Wikileaks stated happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, but that IP is meaningless if the hacker used Tor, or a VPN or both. If the hacker didn&#39;t use something to mask their IP then the odds of this being a state sponsored attack decrease significantly. It&#39;s basic OpSec to cover your tracks when accessing someone else&#39;s Gmail. You&#39;d have to be an idiot to do so without a VPN/Tor. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the network activity that would have to be monitored to determine if there was actually a data breach and transfer. Any decent hacker would have masked their location. It is possible they downloaded the data slowly over time but again that&#39;s higher risk of getting caught or making a mistake and having someone notice every time they access the system from different IPs. Plus passwords get changed over time, etc.</p>

<p>For someone to get in, download everything without a noticeable transfer to somewhere else means it was downloaded locally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not likely. The Podesta leaks seem to be timed around March 19-21 2016, which is also around the time the phishing email came through. Either it was the email scam that caught him, or someone physically copied the emails and the phishing scam is a happy coincidence at the same time, or Wikileaks only leaked the emails they had up to the 21st to make it seem like the phishing email was he source. There is a possibility (remote) there is more emails after the 21 of March, but WL hasn&#39;t released anything like that or even indicated they have anything. </p>

<p>There was a rumor I read somewhere here on r/conspiracy that there was a second batch hacked from him, but I don&#39;t think anything came of that... yet (or ever?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I am personally most concerned about. </p>

<p>If gmail did get hacked by the Russians, as Pres Obama, The govt. and our intel agencies proclaim, then how extensive is it?</p>

<p>Yahoo had 500,000,000 accounts hacked. In 2014...</p>

<p>But didn&#39;t release that info publicly until Sept 2016. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-500-million-accounts-hacked-data-breach/">Yahoo hit in worst hack ever, 500 million accounts swiped</a>  WTF.</p>

<p>AND if you had used a password for google that you use on other websites then you would have been at risk with your info and financial data etc for about 2 years.</p>

<p>Are we dealing with that here also? Maybe. Google should come clean and tell us what is exactly going on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the truth is there was no major Russian hack and that is a story being spun to sow discord. If a major hack like Yahoo&#39;s occured then I think Google would immediately come forward with that information because they could stand to lose billions of dollars to law suits if they tried to conceal that and were caught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from an IT perspective. If a machine that was on the DNC&#39;s network (which Podesta&#39;s probably frequently was) was downloading his gmail Inbox or simply logging into it, as far as Google is concerned the IP address would be the same as if Podesta himself was on that network accessing it. External sources will not see the internal IP address of the machine but only the public IP address assigned by the ISP. </p>

<p>That being said, if only the DNC IPs and others that can be traced back to Podesta (his home, starbucks, etc..) are ones that accessed his gmail account, then that means it was not an outside source. </p>

<p>The thing is, Google uses so much more than just the IP address you are coming from to verify it is you. Every new device that you sign into your gmail with, will notify you (assuming you dont have that disabled if possible). However, if you have the credentials to the gmail account and have the inbox  open as soon as you access, you have access to delete the notification email that comes in to that inbox. </p>

<p>So my guess is more likely that the compromised phone was in possession of someone else and being used to continue downloading the emails. Podesta would have had to specifically go and disable access from that device (again, if even possible) if he chose not to change his password after his phone was lost. So his dumbass just kept going on doing his business with a replacement phone probably, his emails were constantly synced with the lost device. And likely, a DNC insider would be in a prime position to swipe his phone at some point. </p>

<p>There should definitely be (and probably is) a complete record of every device that access his mailbox and where the IPs came from, etc. However it has become pretty clear that Google is in the pocket of US Government and has probably already erased this information. I am sure they could &quot;produce&quot; results that corroborate the DNC&#39;s story of Ukrainian IPs, so once again we may just be fucked because of Silicon Valleys cooperation with the government. </p>
