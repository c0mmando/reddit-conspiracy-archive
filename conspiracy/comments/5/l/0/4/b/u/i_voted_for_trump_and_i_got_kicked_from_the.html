    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not too sure of the first two, but the third quote does not appear to be legitimate. The earliest source attributing it to Orwell seems to be a <a href="http://www.realistnews.net/Thread-realist-news-was-the-capital-gains-tax-just-removed-regarding-bullion">forum post from 2011</a>. Prior to that, it was used (without attribution to Orwell) in an opinion piece by columnist Selwyn Duke, <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/duke/090506">&quot;Stopping Truth At The Border: Banning Michael Savage From Britain&quot;</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, if Israel is as bad as we think it is, Trump cannot afford any negative press. Especially since he&#39;s probably agreed to be their best friend for 8 years.</p>

<p>The thing is, Trump cannot make America great without dismantling the CIA. Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s his plan.</p>

<p>He never had much love for Israel, in fact in the early campaign he said some pretty harsh things about it. That all changed right before his foreign policy speech and he&#39;s been pro-Israel since. I think he&#39;s been made aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m along these lines from what I&#39;ve seen too.  He knows it&#39;d be a pretty obvious move to be anti Israel when they run the PC game basically.  He&#39;s biding his time before the tower comes crumbling down on its own.  He&#39;s holding the blueprints and waiting for the weaknesses to buckle.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s always seemed informed about what&#39;s coming before it does.  Not sure if he actually is but hopefully his luck doesn&#39;t run out.  Objectively he&#39;s the only person with enough balls to start to call out politicians.  Once that keg is tapped it&#39;ll keep flowing on its own. </p>

<p>That said, I suspect he is realizing that this guy could fall very quickly so he probably has made deal with the FBI to nuke down Clinton and the CIA (in favor of Session in the AG). With Obama&#39;s change of stance (he probably predicted it), and Netanyahu corruption charge present, it&#39;s a perfect &quot;divide and conquer&quot; ploy and he could pretty much just wait till all side destroy each other through mud slinging.
