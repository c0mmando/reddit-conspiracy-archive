<p>They have a squeaky clean record 100% accuracy.  He has earned the respect from his sources and from governments around the world.  Duhh give me a break and show PROOF of russian hacking. We havent seen anything yet.  Julian assange is the only man in the world privvy to this info and he has cultivated trust over the decade.  What does intelligence have?

    <div class="md"><p>Assange said himself just last night that they are a political organization.  But he clarified they are not a partisan organization at all.  They&#39;ll leak on &quot;whoever&quot; and they have done so many times.  He went into great detail on what they deem safe to leak and what is not safe to leak.  But most importantly, Julian said that they are always very transparent about the process and if it puts people at risk they let people know.  He went on to discuss how they never redact things to protect entities from bad publicity, but only redact things if there is a safety concern.
But yes, they are political.  His own words.</p>

<p>Assange offered a $20,000 reward for info relating to Seth Rich&#39;s death. He also spoke about him in the following interview with Nieuwsuur amongst others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.</p>

<p>Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Julian Assange: No. There’s no finding. So… I’m suggesting that our sources take risks.</p>

<p>I read a good reddit comment just yesterday that gave a theoretical timeline but God knows where. There was the interesting bit about WL talking about having info about Russia, the Russians then saying how they could take them down, then Russia is all matey with them.</p>

<p><strong>Rest</strong></p>

<p>I get the impression that he&#39;s your hero that you think can do no wrong, that&#39;s how your comments read. You did skip the bit about us not knowing if everything is released, and its timing too.</p>

<p>He and WikiLeaks cannot simultaneously make political comments claim that they&#39;re not a political organisation, and no they&#39;re not just political because the leaks have political effects.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the persecution of Assange and a lot of the attacks on WikiLeaks, but they&#39;ve acted like knobs for a long time now.</p>

<p>Yeah all those sources have a high chsnce of being infiltrated and compromised. 
I guess you trust thr new york times over julian??? </p>

<p>Well you are inferring way too much about my thought on julian
I merely speak on the facts of his record. 100%with dkim verification. </p>

<p>He is allowed to make political remarks.  If everything is verified with dkim emails he is allowed to speak on it.  Wtf he isnt some wierd bell boy not allowed to speak when you hand him luggage.   He lives in an embassy and has been missing out on his children.  And you&#39;re over here saying hes making political remarks??  Makes no sense. </p>

<p>Hillary has public and private positions assange is allowed to comment him.  There isnt Journalistic integrity on the line.  How have they acted like &quot;knobs&quot;  you havent given a single viable point</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, do I think it&#39;s a coincidence that David Bowie and Elvis were both born on January 8? While Elvis&#39;s twin brother is said to have been stillborn? And that Elvis would have been 81 in 2015, while 8 and 1 add up to 9, which 2016 also adds up to, while being 1 more than 2015? And that he died in August, which is the eight month, which in Dutch (and Latin) consists of 9 letters (augustus), 1 letter more than the first month of the year? (januari) At the age of 42, while 4<em>2 equals 8? And that David Bowie, who died on the tenth of january (10 = 1 + 9 (9=2+1+6)) has 10 letters in his name, or 8 unique letters, while 8 + 1 (1+0) equals 9? While I, the ninth letter of the alphabet, appears twice in the name David Bowie (2</em>9=18, 1+8=9 again) and D, the 4th letter of the alphabet, also appears twice (2*4=8)? Meanwhile, eight consists of 5 letters, and one consists of 3 letters, which makes 8 again! Not to mention that I looks like Roman one (1), and that David Bowie and Elvis Presley have 3 I&#39;s between them, (Elvis was born first, he&#39;s number I), Roman 3 being III (3 * one)?</p>

That interview is a ratings getter and if FOXNEWS betrays trust then they won&#39;t have a next interview.
