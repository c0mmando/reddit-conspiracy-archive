      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s no secret anymore that there are actually negative forces called archons/reptilians that are vibrating at lower frequencies, that thrive on negative, destructive energies. In order to exist they manipulate humans (because humans are highly emotional beings) to exhibit NEGATIVE LOW VIBRATING emotions. By creating various events in our daily lives to force us into dropping our guard (lowering our vibration) by orchestrating various events to throw us off balance. That is why you constantly are reading everywhere about the importance of RAISING YOUR VIBRATIONS. The reason? Its simple, as soon as our vibration goes up (we begin to feel calm, peace, joy, excitement, love, light, etc) these beings can no longer survive in our energy field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the solution is simple, to always keep your vibrations high, BUT it doesn’t seem to be quite possible to do so at all times. However, it is incredibly important for all of us to try and do so at this time, because our bodies ARE changing, because we ARE moving into another dimension, and archons wishing to survive are trying to keep humanity locked in the fear, anger, frustration mode at all costs in order to keep themselves alive. The beauty of all of this is, that YOU CAN change your vibration at any given moment in time.
      </p>

       True dat.

      <p>
       The best way to raise your vibration is to do your shadow work. If something elicits a resistance or negative response from you, try properly to figure out what's making you feel that way. Often times you'll find it can be reduced to lacking love or having a perception of a lack of love. Work on this and recognise the way your ego reacts. Your emotions are a gift. When you get negative feelings come up, recognise that is the ego trying to protect itself but in doing so gives itself away.

       Thank you! I noticed lately that I used to suffer from feelings of jealousy and inadequacy and have finally fought those demons head on and have not felt those issues anymore.

       It seems running Away only worsens the problem. I'm still trying to understand why all humans have an ego. It seems to do more harm than good at this point

       I think it's a survival mechanism. I takes in all available data and tries to make sense of everything. The problems come from being purposely bombarded with negative programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I visualize the ego like a house that doesn't get cleaned. It usually starts with a kitchen sink full of dirty dishes. Slowly over time garbage starts building up throughout the place. Eventually, if left unchecked, it turns into an episode of Hoarders where you need to carve lane-ways through the garbage to get to the engine you're rebuilding on the kitchen table!.
      </p>
      <p>
       So like
       <a href="/u/whipnil">
        /u/whipnil
       </a>
       pointed out, we have to be willing to put in the hard work it takes to start cleaning out the junk. Recognizing the ego for what it is helps recognize the behavior it manifests.
      </p>
      <p>
       To use the show Hoarders again as an analogy: At the end of each show everyone usually starts crying. It's such a relief to be finally free of the things that have weighed down on us for so long.

       Dude, you nailed my mantra in there.  Whenever I get that feeling that "fate" is fucking with me, I remember "the light of love and truth."  And I swear to God the air around me lifts and becomes less oppressive.  Like I scared away that hooded Satan archon from

       It is incredibly sad that people who expose this truth are ridiculed and called "insane". The Archons/Reptilians are real. People who ridicule the theory are only hurting themselves. Humanity has been hijacked and enslaved by these Satanic beings..

       it's my understanding that as we rise in frequency to 4th then 5th dimension, these being will rise, too.  i also believe that part of the stargate/timegates that we are moving through together are limiting their abilities to feed off of us and manipulate us

       What people laugh at is the invisible concentration of evil that we choose to just flat out acknowledge is there.  The grand inspiration for these acts should be all the proof we need that something exists manipulating human beings.  We're aware of what normal human beings are and what influences them to be good or bad.  Negative reinforcement comes from somewhere and that source is Satan/Archons/"Reptilians"   Fortunately many people also do the same with positive reinforcement and the emotion of love and are willing to admit that those frequencies are more powerful than them and they call it God.  It's a goal for them and just the same there are people with goals toward the opposite.  The constant attempts towards each polarity are what make the dieties real whether you'll admit it or not.  It really just comes down to your perspective and willingness to entertain thoughts against your own instincts from conditioning.  It's more comfortable for there to be no mystical magical inspiration for people, but just because you don't act on these things doesn't mean every other person around you isn't too.  And now of those imagine how many are convinced that they are growing in that way.  There you have your Satanists, Christians, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way is see it, dismissing spirituality and its influence on each individual's actions puts you in a major disadvantage to understanding beyond your limits.

       I wouldn't say we're moving into another dimension. It's easy to confuse our three dimensions with 4D and 5D, but should be clear, 4th
       <strong>
        density
       </strong>
       and 5th etc. (As per Law of One.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Our scientists say our math points to 11 dimensions, but I'd venture to say they are working in a very limited paradigm. There are thousands if not infinite parallel world's.  This is how and why time is an illusion to us.

       In our reality the 4th dimension is (by most) considered time. Length × width (2D) × depth (3D) × time (4D). Many but probably not all scientists would agree to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our solar system as far as I've researched is going through very rare (25,000 - 50,000 year) but almost unbearable energetic waves. I say almost because some will not be able to bare it. You'll start seeing apparitions, certain friends will act crazier and crazier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming no earth based disasters like war, disease, asteroid hits etc, I believe the key to overcome these increasing waves of solar energy will be in self-purity. Because we are
       <em>
        light
       </em>
       at our core, we need to stop consuming impure food, lotions, deodorant, dark or negative thoughts, and emanate more light.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Law of One refers to our planet being in 3rd density. It makes more sense if you think of vibration and light from our one reality as perhaps moving through air - a gas - a liquid in its own bubble etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take the two paragraphs above together. Do you see how if solar energy is increasing many times every day, there will be an inflection point? We do not know exactly what that will look like, but people that move with the planet into a much higher vibration, or 4th density as it will be, must
       <em>
        by nature
       </em>
       have to also be of a higher vibration, in sync with the planet's graduation.

       Now, I have a scientific background and i'm sure many others who visit this subreddit do too.  I have a fairly detailed understanding of Physics, chemistry and most of all biology.  I did post grad studies in biogical oceanography.
So when i read sentences like the one quoted above my fucking head implodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to know how things work, i don't want interpretations of other peoples opinions on how things work.  Especially when that other person clearly has no understanding of which they speak and no references to give credence (I referring to whoever created the Ra manual).
      </p>
      <p>
       It reads like a Mistic Meg star-sign reading.  Which is bad.

       This is spiritualistic voodoo horseshit with random scientific terminology thrown in to make it sound clever to the layman.  The terminology used often makes no sense in the context it is used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically gibberish with intent.  The intent being to gain clicks and therefore money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about this with some confidence so it is difficult for me to determine if you yourself are a layperson just passing on acquired information or someone who is willing misinforming people.
If you are the prior i suggest getting a basic understanding of Physics, chemistry and biology so you see this for yourself.  I will help you do this if i can.

       It would take time to summarize various sources, hence why I didn't cite any in my original comment. I could this eve if you'd like.

       You must already understand though, at a high level, it's a matter of a paradigm. When Copernicus claimed all bodies did not revolve around the sun, he was a heretic, a lunatic. The scientists at the time wholeheartedly disagreed. While I have an intermediate understanding of most sciences, I have advanced knowledge of what some scientists may call fringe or pseudo science. But they call it that because it does not fit the mental container they have fashioned for themselves, so their own reality can still fit. I am not a pseudo scientist, but a researcher and practitioner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given your background, I want to congratulate you for even entertaining what might seem like "crazy theories". I don't mean to come off as arrogant, but the first step in seeking truth is to be honestly open to alternate ideas and beliefs (not deny for comfort then parrot what the
       <em>
        system
       </em>
       tells you). Questioning, doubting and researching is a very long process that comes after.
      </p>
      <p>
       The science vs religious paradigm that we live in now is so ingrained in our being, that most are too distracted to seek the truth.

       It's always fascinating to me, how many high-level "men of responsibility" who believe in the Archons. Read Nick Redfern's Final Events, about a group inside the government called "The Collins Elite". They are hard-nosed intelligence agency people, and, after investigating this subject for decades, they no longer believe that humans are top of the food chain on the planet. They're being farmed, like cattle for their energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like economics, and every once in a while I'll be listened to Catherine Austin Fitts [a fund manager, and a former assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development] and she'll be talking about rock-ribbed economics [sober-as-hell stuff] and then suddenly she'll let her guard down and you find out she believes in this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       "V the Guerilla Economist" on Youtube shocked me, as well. He's the most down-to-earth dude, talking about finance, and then boom! You find out that, according to his sources, many highly placed people believe this stuff is real.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: I've always wondered if the people pushing the materialist agenda are being manipulated by their interdimensionals. Promoting a world-view that cuts people off from their higher senses to keep them blinded and in the pen. It's probably no coincidence that professional skeptics, like the Amazing Randi, are also pedophiles. Low-vibrational Pizzagate motherfuckers, given CIA funding to convince you to shut your Third Eye. According to the Collins Elite, the "Archons" feed off of negative energy generated by violence, contention and perverted sexuality. Hence why these behaviors are being promoted in the media and academia. Anything to condition the children.
