       Post indicating Soros was killed since 11/20/16, or sooner:
       <a href="http://benjaminfulford.net/2016/11/20/i-just-received-this-from-my-white-hat-contact-in-dc-who-is-with-the-agency/">

      </p>
      <p>
       And another article claiming mass arrests took place:

      </p>
      <p>
       "Mass arrests began right after the election, butt hurt Hillary cried a river when told to concede or she’ll be arrested, [President] Obama was ordered to stay in DC, finish ISIS, stop delaying the Global Currency Reset, and meet Trump to ensure a smooth transition.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And this article says a prominent member of the Council of 300, who is cited as having died from natural causes, was taken out:
       <a href="http://benjaminfulford.net/2016/12/19/old-reality-fading-quickly-as-pole-shift-now-fully-underway/">

      </p>
      <p>
       "One of the most senior members of the cabal behind the atrocities in Syria and elsewhere, Bishop Javier Echevaria, the head of the fascist Opus Dei Vatican organization was killed last week after he tried to overturn the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Pentagon sources say. The Vatican says he died of natural causes."
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's this, Fulford's biggest announcement to date:

Khazarian mafia chickens coming home to roost in the Year of the Rooster
Posted by benjamin
January 2, 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       “As ye shall sow, so you shall reap,” has never been more true than in 2016 when the Khazarian mafia’s long list of crimes against humanity began to finally catch up with them. That year saw the removal from power and/or from this world of many top Khazarian mobsters including the Rockefellers, the Bushes, the Clintons and top henchmen like George Soros and Barack Obama. We also saw a revolt in the Anglo Saxon world that led to the end of Khazarian controlled regimes in the UK (Brexit) and the US (the election of the Donald Trump military government). Now in 2017, the Year of the Rooster, their chickens are really going to come home to roost. This will be the year of mass arrests, war crime trials and regime change as the final mop up of Khazarian mob rule takes place, sources in the Pentagon, the Gnostic Illuminati, Asian Secret Societies and the White Dragon Society all agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US, the arrest of over 15,000 Khazarian mobsters by the FBI already began January 1st, Pentagon sources say. The perpetrators of 911, the illegal Iraq invasion, the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear terror attacks on Japan and other crimes against humanity are being rounded up and there will be public disclosure about this in all major mass media, WDS sources promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Cabal underground bases in Nevada, Denver, New Zealand as well as a cloning base under Camp David were destroyed and more bases in Australia, San Diego, Hawaii and Arkansas may be targeted,” the Pentagon sources report. “As Cabalists seek to escape to New Zealand, Congo, Brazil, or Paraguay, there may be more kinetic actions to stop them,” the sources promise."

       This is what I'm inclined to say. All that is very, very wishful thinking and I can't believe it. But ya know, I'm about where Descartes ended up and all I'm sure of anymore is that I exist. So fuck it, let's all believe this and maybe we will make it happen.

       Fulford is a Canadian author &amp; journalist living in Japan. He is the former Asian chief correspondent for Forbes magazine. He writes books in Japanese &amp; has a tv show. He got involved with Neil Keenan a few years ago who was the point-person for a massive lawsuit against several prominent Americans &amp; Europeans for stealing from the Japanese treasury. He has been following this since then and using his contacts, reporting on what basically amounts to a financial war going on between multiple countries &amp; members of governments.

       That is a very basic description of a very complicated situation. You can find a lot more on him with a little research. Idk how correct or truthful he is, but his claims are very interesting.

       Agreed. Much of what he claims has a fantastical vibe to it; however, he has been historically accurate on many details that were verifiable. The main problem with fulford is so much of what he says is completely unverifiable, as it is behind the scenes gossip &amp; not public knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own opinion of Ben has vascillated between wanting to believe what he writes &amp; full-on, "no freakin' way." He's an interesting cat. When I read his stuff, I take it with a grain of salt just like I would any other gossip.

       My approach is: read it. Be thankful I'm reading positive propaganda at minimum.  Compare to other things I've read.  Acknowledge the things I can't know.  Move on and stay happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanna know what's out there at this point.  Don't care if I waste my time as its good fiction at least.  As things maybe start lining up with these reports my mind will change whether I look at them or not.  I want people to keep this info coming.  The synchronicities between different articles and "sources" makes for a very interesting time on Reddit.

       The Keenan stuff is fascinating, especially the photos of all those crazy treasury bonds, etc., but that story (and a lot of what one hears from Fulford) does not comport easily with the rest of the narratives going around. For that reason, I tend to ignore it, because it has a strange dissonance with every other information source. I would like what they're saying to not be complete bullshit, FWIW!

       Ben Fulford is constantly LARPing that Asian Dragon societies are taking down the globalists with mass arrests or something like that. It was ridiculous the first time, but now he's become like the televangelist constantly resetting the day of the apocalypse.

       Glad to see this mentioned. I love reading Benjamin's updates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm almost certain this is true. Normally my bull shit sensors go off when I'm reading something false but something about his articles ring true to me and it just feels right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am so glad to see all the negative cabals that have fed off the energy of human fear are finally collapsing and ceasing to exist and function. Can't believe such a parasite has controlled humanity so long. It's saddened me to learn of all of it but I am so ecstatic humanity is awakening and tapping into God source and relinquishing fear and negativity for oneness and wholeness.

       It was rumored Queen Elizabeth wasn't seen at Sunday mass. Any appearances on television can be faked or rehashed from old viewings.

       they have a slight excuse for disappearing, unlike assange, these people are old as dirt and could have the flu or pneumonia right now and I could understand why they then aren't out in public. And for the queen they did say as such. She probably is about to die but what do you expect at age 90.

       The media has been pursuing stories like who would inherit the crown and other what ifs and pushing the question would they have the same power. It's sounding like they are prefacing a breakup of power with the news narrative. The only suspicious thing is that the news has no real explainable reason they would think or want this. They have been working with the elite for years.
