    <div class="md"><p>but why would they think something huge would leak, thats the question.  </p>

<p>Remember Hillary going insane during the interview after the debate with Matt lauer and telling her staff &quot;if that bastard trump wins we all are hanging from nooses&quot;.</p>

<p>Why did she think this would happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s around when they got control of wikileaks. I believe the &quot;good guys&quot; had to regroup and wait until after the 20th. I believe the leaks contain information linking the clinton foundation and the CIA to child trafficking in haiti, syria, libya, as well as high treason via selling state secrets, as well as the crooked oil play that has already been exposed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will leak 100% whether it comes from wikileaks or not. This is a very very difficult situation. My personal investigation as well as the work of others leads me to believe that this will be the beginning of the most important thing to ever happen to us as humans. That&#39;s why Obama and co are being so erratic, this is it folks</p>
