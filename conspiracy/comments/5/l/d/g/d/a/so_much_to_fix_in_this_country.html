       The thing is this is a global phenomenon. When you introduce a new legal category like terrorism and claim previous checks and balances no longer apply you get a way to circumvent all the checks of government overreach.  Habeas corpus forget it, military operating on us soil doing law enforcement work, forget it - terrorism, etc.  Until someone nips that in the bud and closes that loophole I don't know what can be done.

       It's not a new legal category. Isn't even close to new. The largest of its kind in the US (911) but not new... at all.

       Yes... they do. The founding fathers warned against this mindset. We face nuclear devastation against a system that stood diametrically opposed to us for 50 years and never budged an inch.... not openly. Suddenly a small band of nitwits pinches us on the arm and we are locking everything down and cowering in fear. How can we reasonably have 'Land of the brave' in our national anthem if we are prepared to throw everything that makes this nation great over something relatively small? This country has and never will ever come close to falling or succumbing to even a nuclear capable terrorist... even multiple nuclear terrorist attacks... and yet we are prepared to throw it ALL away over much, much less. Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will NEVER stop a person or persons dedicated to hurting others. All you can do is act as the enlightened party and don't submit yourself to their level.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can be done? You face hatred, you face fear, you face terrorism and maintain. You maintain what makes this country great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the things I listed? What do we have? Coke Cola, Flags and jets? Whats it all for if not for the ideals so many in this country fought for?
      </p>
      <p>
       STOP BEING AFRAID. Start living up to the national anthem of this country - land of the brave. Reinstitute all of these protections and face the fire of anger and hate with PRIDE THAT WE ARE THE BETTER PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be willing to face utter destruction before we budge an inch and yet we have sacrificed everything over relatively nothing.

       It's important to have an accurate grasp of political developments in the US since WWII. The creation of secret courts was in 1978
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Courtt">
        1978!
       </a>
       The rulings of the court are secret and the laws are secret. The claim that 'we' never budged an inch, is ahistorical and false.  The ideology of American Exceptionalism is largely to blame for not realizing what was and what is happening today.

       OK. But I'm not interested in debating when these things changed... that's not the core of what I'm getting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is American exceptionalism. It is the only country not built on skin color or monarchy. It is a country built on an idea of freedom and liberty for all men. It was built on a stolen country, and many, many crimes have been committed, opposed to these ideals... but the principles remained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the crux...
       <strong>
        how do we fix the issues I listed
       </strong>
       Because they need to be fixed. Now when did they go wrong, now who caused them to go wrong, now what caused them. How do we fix them?

       Since most of these were Republican initiatives, and with a newly elected Republican regime, I doubt there will be any progress on these.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to think change is possible, but the Republican traditionalists are busy licking boots in hopes of passing new draconian laws. The old draconian laws are likely here to stay.

       The Obama administration was responsible for the Freedom act and the NDAA. He expanded the Bush foreign policy, didn't end torture and increased drone programs and surveillance.

       These trends are bipartisan.

       Okay, good thought. I appreciate that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us take a close look at those two items.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Freedom Act actually reigned in the powers conferred by the Patriot Act. The Freedom Act placed restrictions on the Patriot act, requiring judges to use closer scrutiny before allowing such measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the Freedom Act, there were NO protections against Mass Surveillance. With the Freedom Act there are numerous, dozens of protections. I do not agree that the Patriot Act, which BUSH pushed for, should have been allowed. Mr. Obama has worked to roll back that law. See here:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to the NDAA, you are telling a lie. The NDAA, with its many letters, is simply the National Defense Authorization Act. This is the law that EVERY president passes which allocates money for our armed forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you prefer that we disband our military and send all our soldiers home? The NDAA is the most vital part of our military budget. To oppose is should be considered treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why on earth, of all the laws you could call into question, would you choose this one? That is insane.

       NDAA section 1021 
"indefinite detention of American citizens without due process at the discretion of the President."
      </p>
      <p>
       The ACLU said, "The statute is particularly dangerous because it has no temporal or geographic limitations, and can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield."
      </p>

       I am fully with you on that issue. It is terrible.

      <p>
       But it was attached to a much larger and more important bill.

       We need to address how, and who, can attach such things to the NDAA or anything else.

       Along with mass surveillance, torture, and all the other stuff I listed - yes... and I would argue the worlds future is at stake because America is the only nation built on the idea of personal liberty.

       If we do not return to a suitable course... it may be a very, very long time before humanity ever has the opportunity to attempt such an experiment. With the advent of technology which increases the ability for the establishment to influence and control society, it may be the last.

       Many are being forcibly coaxed into being shills and Martyrs for fake causes. Laws and Rights are being sabotaged by the new slave workers. Torture tactics are being used by managers, and the slave race is happy to be Identity Thieves and Traitors.

       Torture tactics are being used to perfect the ideal slave worker. What can be done?

       To be extremely clear... when I say torture, I mean actually torturing prisoners of war in places like Guantanamo Bay, CIA black sites and places like Abu Ghraib where prisoners were sexually assaulted, severely injured, electrocuted and waterboarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about actual torture, not metaphorical torture.
