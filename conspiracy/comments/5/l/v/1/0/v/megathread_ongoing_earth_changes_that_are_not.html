        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,
I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me pre-face with the reason I think everything is getting &quot;wacky,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. </p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. Climate scientists will tell you that our water levels are causing this to happen.. but this is actually a debated topic and not proven.. essentially a &quot;theory.&quot; This is just a theory of mine, so bash it all you will but take in some of the rest of this information seriously and take note because this isn&#39;t a fucking joke.</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>That was just November! </p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do.. but;
There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/">http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/</a></p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.</p>

<p>does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE</a> - WAVES OF ENERGY BEING PICKED UP MIMIC?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oecmq94Bt7E&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oecmq94Bt7E&amp;t=4s</a> - HELIUM?</p>

<p>as a caveat to the brown dwarf statement.. we are constantly moving through space so its possible we&#39;ve just entered a fuck off massive helium cloud (our entire solar system) through no means of anything nibiru, end times, or whatever related.</p>

<p>READY?

    <div class="md"><p>Folks! If your don&#39;t have a scientific answer about these phenomena please withhold conclusions until you do.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be combative here.  The earth climate is indeed destabilizing, and the weather consequences will be scary.  But from what I can tell as a scientist, the poles are not making any unusual movements (just plodding along at the 40000 and 100000 year cycles).</p>

<p>CERN is not a weather installation whatsoever.  It&#39;s a racetrack for many times less atoms than your expel in every breath, along with two giant digital cameras.  It&#39;s high energy per atom, but so few atoms that it can&#39;t have a significant effect on the planet.  If anybody is deeply worried let me know and I&#39;ll run some numbers on it.</p>

<p>We do face some severe challenges from climate and resource depletion in our lifetime.  Also, our monetary and energy systems are unstable.  There is grounds for concern, and yes the corporate news media does regularly present biased/misinformed stories as well as outright propaganda.  So if something feels amiss you are right.  I&#39;m just asking that we stay level headed and scientifically accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s all well and good, but this is a conspiracy theory. I did explicitly say immediately in my comment that my opinion was unscientific. Conjecture, in fact.

Maybe a year or so ago. I really cant remember much. I&#39;m not going to take everything they say as fact though. I&#39;m going to assume that they do experiments that they do not tell the public about, just as I assume Nasa does the same. Black projects (as opposed to &quot;white&quot; projects - ones the public know about). I&#39;m not asking you to take my thoughts as fact at all, it&#39;s purely a premise or thought to entertain.</p>

Would seem we are just in the turning point again and would suggest the tilt will start to settle down again. Seems also the wavelength is about 20 years.</p>

<p>Here is the same data that in OPs post, but from 1975: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O2idk8p.png">http://i.imgur.com/O2idk8p.png</a>
See we have been much more off tilt earlier and the center of the rotation seems to switch places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well its been lovely i must say but its off</p>

<p>honestly when they had the flood sunami in indonesia i think it was in like 2005 they didnt say anything but all the astrologers came out saying their degrees were off by this event!!! &lt;-something to think about what could trigger that but a complete shift in our axis our tilt? more mandela it was pre CERN i think </p>

<p>after the astrologers caome out they admited that i think the tilt shifted .... something its beyond my savey but i remember my feeling was they fucked some serious shit and was now asking americans to antie up for their behavior &lt;--- which is why they are rich and we are pooor</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do not intend to poop on the scientists but they are wrong. We did not evolve from non living matter and if you know about genetics and dna you would see that it&#39;s IMPOSSIBLE for a creature of any type to mate with something else, or to create an entire new species without high level technology to do gene splicing. Adaptation is correct though as dna is elastic and changes based on environmental factors but the creatures will still stay in the &quot;family&quot; of that kind of creature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matter is matter. The sodium ions caring thoughts in my brain were in table salt last week.  Life could have originated from basic elements.  The nitrogen in the air reacts with CO2 when lightening strikes; clay particles catalyze formation of the kind of building blocks in our body.  Life has a chirality (sugars have &quot;right handed&quot; chirality, amino acids are L) that isn&#39;t chemically necessary but probably a relic if abiotic synthesis of organic molecules.  When these molecules are irradiated by sunlight the UV can break, join, and rearrange then.  At some point in the deep past, enough of these molecules had accumulated and been shuffled that one of them or a community of molecules arose that could catalyze the reactions to copy it itself.  The copies of the copies began to compete for chemical resources and the more efficient self-copiers multiplied.  With more competition and more time complexity grew.  The fossil record shows it took at least a billion years for any cellular life to arise.  It&#39;s hard to think in deep time like that, but even if it was slow and bumbling, the early molecules had time since nothing was alive to eat them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a biochemist and I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions on what we do and don&#39;t know about it to the best of my abilities.  We have worked so hard to learn these things.  When you don&#39;t even try to learn scientific findings and just make stuff up, you are shitting on scientists.  Technological advancement has brought many negative things, but science and engineering have also unveiled a verifiable explanation of human origins- this is a treasure.</p>

Solar wind (ionized hydrogen mostly) travels along the magnetic lines of flux and impacts the atmosphere at high latitudes to predict the auroras.  The moon is unpowered except for the momentum imparted to it during its formation and the mutual pull of gravity between the earth and the moon.  The sun is powered by fusion of hydrogen nuclei deep in its core; fusion of two protons to make helium releases a large amount of energy.  None of this was known to ancient humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the rate of change. We have potentially triggered the most massive extinction event the world will ever face. The last time this much carbon was released into the air, the volcanic traps of siberia erupted releasing all of the methane from the arctic sea floor into the air. This time we dug up all of the fucking carbon around the entire planet and it will with 100% certainty trigger methane release from the arctic sea floor at some point. It&#39;s already fucking happening. Now we&#39;ll have the arctic methane AND about 500 million years worth of stored carbon that humans have released into the atmosphere. This bitch could turn into Venus and it&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible (..I don&#39;t care if you believe or not) talks about the Earth being destroyed by fire as one of the last great events of the end times. As a child, I used to think &quot;How/Why would God do that??&quot; Anyway, I got older aaaaand..</p>

<p>I find it interesting to watch the logorithmic increase of uncontrollable wildfires as a result of climate change (turns out that little bark beetle <em>really</em> likes warm weather). And fire <strong>really</strong> likes dead trees.</p>

<p>We have models showing water scarcity will be a global pattern, and that the poles are warming..</p>

<p>We know that methane is being unlocked, and we know that low oxygen oceans are cultivating purple bacteria (not seen on the surface of this planet for a geological timeframe) that spew hydrogen sulfide gas as a byproduct.</p>

<p>But still, how would a fire engulf the globe? Unless the Boreal Forest warmed.. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that Paul wasn&#39;t visualizing an Act of God (the fire). I think he was witnessing the culmination of human created climate change. Like when entire continents would burn, before bacteria evolved the means to digest plant cellulose.</p>

<p>An accelerated warming trend, trillions of dead trees, insane amounts of extra energy in the climate system (40 million Hiroshimas and counting?), a sudden catastrophic release of methane, and a breakdown of the jet stream could coalesce to create the conditions a fire of that scale would require.</p>

<p>Just a thought, in the context of my upbringing. Interesting.</p>

<p>I would like to draw attention to this while on the subject of His Earth being destroyed:</p>

<p>Nephilim have been a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, especially in areas such as Soloman islands. A brief search can probably find how there has been &quot;conspiracy bombings at Soloman islands, regarding Giants in caves&quot; and other locations. In Iraq, special forces had to be called in to slay Giants in some caves. The mightiest of Red Haired giants - the warriors who can detect blood and dna vibrations, the <em>attack dogs</em> of the areas - slain by man. </p>

<p>Again we are all free to form our own opinions and seek our own understandings of the planet, everything to be taken with a grain of salt. For those that <em>believe</em>, I wish you all of our collective blessing</p>

<p>The May 30, 2015 M7.8 earthquake WNW of Chichi-shima, Japan occurred as the result of oblique-normal faulting at a depth of over 660 km beneath the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake is located within the interior of the Pacific plate that subducts beneath Japan starting at the Izu trench, several hundred kilometers to the east of the event (and at the surface of the Earth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should post to <a href="/r/StormComing">/r/StormComing</a>. This list you have posted is the reason I started the sub a couple of years ago, because I expected an increase in these sorts of events. </p>

<p>In 2009 I started noticing that our Jet Stream was performing some pretty anomalous maneuvers. Flowing very far north and dipping far south, breaking off large eddies - and slowing a great deal. This was pushing heat into areas that should have been cold, pulling arctic air down into areas that should have been warm and setting up long-lasting, &#39;stuck&#39; weather patterns. </p>

<p>In 2012 <a href="https://marine.rutgers.edu/%7Efrancis/pres/Francis_Vavrus_2012GL051000_pub.pdf">I found a scientific study that was co authored by Japanese researchers and Rutgers researchers that explained this</a>. To-date this study has held firm and since then more evidence has strengthened it. <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=francis+arctic+amplification&amp;amp;&amp;amp;view=detail&amp;amp;mid=FD2740E887BE0C943648FD2740E887BE0C943648&amp;amp;FORM=VRDGAR">Here is a short video explanation.</a></p>

<p>If you do find mention of this in major media it is very brief, because frankly, the implications are terrifying. The implications being the events you have listed there. Frankly, I can&#39;t see it getting better in the near future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I&#39;d written this in reference to the earlier thread...</strong></p>

<p><em>(Note I am working on a piece addressing the variables at play that will correspond to the antartic sheets calving), but this is my take on the post at hand...</em></p>

<p><strong>This isn&#39;t easy to address in its entirety however; I will touch base on it as best I can. (the formatting is harder in a comment reply box then on a MS Word document).</strong></p>

<p>A personal Note: The user is truly an intelligent person, vivisected by media; But your factually correct; Just off; Just the way they intended it to be;</p>

<p>So lets hit the basis of this; Firstly remove the biblical aspects and focus on the stories themselves. Revelations &quot;an endtime&quot; prophecy is likely a story that&#39;s repeated itself in our history; We see things like rising of locusts; Rivers turning to blood, and earthquakes, (trumpets), and mostly flooding;</p>

<p>What most people think however is that some Magical deity was ultimately responsible for this; Which isn&#39;t how modern science dictates these event&#39;s at all; (have we seen similar events on earth lately). Yes, it is confirmed; There have been rivers that have turned red (in recent years), as well as locust, and large amounts of flooding;</p>

<p>Now second fable: In antartica There is a hollow earth! And an ancient society under the ice masses That is why they are there!
Unlikely...</p>

<p>What does that have to do with anything; Well it is important;
Thirdly Chemtrails. They are trying to kill us all! - (we have virus strands that are so volatile that we could literally cause an extinction in a single years time), (or near extinction), so Factually the silver sparkles in the sky aren&#39;t a secret... Or are they?</p>

<p>Chemtrails have every reason to be secrets, but your operating under the prospective reasoning that everyone on earth is evil (inherently). What if the truth was more frightening; So frightening that you have to lie about it, but not evil at all. Do those that wind up dead getting to the bottom of these incidents fall into a rampant coincidence? Likely not; But that is where my post will take a dark turn all the same...</p>

<p>What if the real truth, is that for years climatologists have been researching factors such as aerial methane depositing; Via oceanic and ground ice patches being thawed and released into the environment; This having caused a vast amount of ozone decay.
What if the ozone decay, leads to more caustic radiation waves via solar depositing; Leading to global warming; Essentially melting more Ice, and in turn more methane. (accelerating the process).
What if the acceleration of these processes are causing all of the problems mentioned in this post?</p>

<p><strong>Introducing &quot;the holocene extinction&quot;.</strong>
Rule out the basic conspiracies when dealing with science, and ask yourself; Why did buzz aldrin, and John Kerry fly to antartica. What do we know about the trip?</p>

<p>Well Buzz is a figure head of the NASA Complex. Likely a genius John Kerry is a figure head of the Whitehouse. Likely a Gov Reporter. (who does John report to?) The president of the united states.
What is the president doing? Emergency electric grid restructuring;</p>

<p><strong>What does that confirm:</strong></p>

<p>Well we know that an ice sheet the size of Deleware is factually melting off the antartic peninsula, and that the mass is enough to likely swamp large cities on coastal plains. Built on sealevel, and sometimes below. (are we seeing that sort of destabilization yet)?
Yes By example the beaches in both Florida, and California are decaying. Katrina&#39;s had multiple flooding incidents. (so the gulf of new mexico is taking effect. From Thailand, to Japan, and Chile, Brazil. Their coasts are beginning to decay (tsunamis).
Why? It&#39;s likely the original process, and everything to do with the original topic; (Protection from space weather)...</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that the sun is going supernova early, it is that the magnetosphere, is weakening; Hence the chemtrails as mentioned before, and the US Airforces (obviously secret mission), to combat them. Those grids are likely introduced to the upper atmosphere to fight off highly decayed sections of the ozone layer itself. This is if anything an attempt to cool the planet; Virtually attempting to thwart off the very humanistic abuses that were rampantly destroying our planet for centuries. Everything from oil, to carbon, methane, and radioactivity; Pesticides, poisons, you name it.
Were living in the middle of an extinction, and don&#39;t think that Chinas recent exploration into going green is because the costs are effective. I mean think rationally. On certain days they shut down the entire city so people can simply breath in the vast amount of ppm10 particulate active coating their lungs. It&#39;s more often then not kitty cats fall off skyscrapers from oxygen loss, as their lungs aren&#39;t even equipped as well as a humans...</p>

<p><strong>The grid itself</strong></p>

<p>To protect the grid, is the ultimate duty as humans, because more than any mentionable threat to this planet current date if you take the grid out; Multiple nuclear failures will occur simultaneously. Factually 11 power stations taken offline, could lead to complete nuclear failure, and planetary extinction, and this is all well known. Hence the push for Breeder reactors, which are a safer utility for power production... (I won&#39;t say how much safer because they are still on trial, and for all we really know they really still aren&#39;t that safe). (I am a bit of a cunt though, and don&#39;t like actinides)...</p>

<p><strong>So Back on track</strong></p>

<p>How do we know it is the holocene? That is the simplest part. Just look at all the wildlife dieoffs the op has mentioned. These are not coincidences as if millions of species suddenly commit mass suicide; No, these are indications that the geo magnetic mechanisms that control their flight paths, or submarine geolocations are being severely delimited in nature itself.</p>

<p><strong>Now lets take antartica more expressly</strong></p>

<p>Antartica = global heating. The global heating leads to self cooling; Stagnant waters lead to invasive species and diseases. Think locust and birdflu by primary examples. Although they also lead to apple maggots, viruses in plant life; Less crops; And we are factually seeing this in real time. Leading to even more mass dieoffs and situations we can&#39;t control.</p>

<p>If the icesheets are destabilizing; Its due to temperatures in the ocean rising; If the ocean is rising in temperature; It means that the magma chambers are responding, and a mass volcanic episode is nearing; Because at a fundamental level; When we gave not one damn about mothernature; She gives not one damn about us, and our considerations to save her now are a laughing stock to her having been tested.</p>

<p>So when the iceshelf detatches, she will flood and cool what she can, and if that isn&#39;t enough then fields such as old faithful, and mega volcanoes will act accordingly, erasing the heat from the planet itself, by shielding the earth itself from the sun light; Thus causing an event we will no longer write about in the history books, Because the future won&#39;t exist;</p>

<p>So Is antartica important <strong>Yes</strong>. But not because we found some ancient species, but because it is our species itself becoming ancient; Do the rivers have blood in them. No, because scientists now know the discoloration is caused by arsenic deposits, from weakening submarine volcanic tubes, that are escalating in self decay.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Paging: Globalhell ;)</p>

<p><strong>This is no coincidence-</strong> <em>The truth is lie&#39;s exist so you can&#39;t put the pieces together; So when obama makes additions to the grid; Its not because there isn&#39;t a situation; It is because the situation itself is so un-contained, that they would rather lie to you, then tell you the truth, as it were. Hence the epa being tight lipped about the crop failures, The airforce being tight lipped about the chem-trails, ence every lie and misfactuation of the truth; and every preposterous theory, and media grab pulling you in every direction; Accept toward the truth, because no one has the balls to tell you that this is the truth, and the world itself is ending.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hope that helped. Not sure it does, But at least now you know...</strong></p>

<p>honestly when they had the flood sunami in indonesia i think it was in like 2005 they didnt say anything but all the astrologers came out saying their degrees were off by this event!!! &lt;-something to think about what could trigger that but a complete shift in our axis our tilt? more mandela it was pre CERN i think </p>

<p>after the astrologers caome out they admited that i think the tilt shifted .... something its beyond my savey but i remember my feeling was they fucked some serious shit and was now asking americans to antie up for their behavior &lt;--- which is why they are rich and we are pooor</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matter is matter. The sodium ions caring thoughts in my brain were in table salt last week.  Life could have originated from basic elements.  The nitrogen in the air reacts with CO2 when lightening strikes; clay particles catalyze formation of the kind of building blocks in our body.  Life has a chirality (sugars have &quot;right handed&quot; chirality, amino acids are L) that isn&#39;t chemically necessary but probably a relic if abiotic synthesis of organic molecules.  When these molecules are irradiated by sunlight the UV can break, join, and rearrange then.  At some point in the deep past, enough of these molecules had accumulated and been shuffled that one of them or a community of molecules arose that could catalyze the reactions to copy it itself.  The copies of the copies began to compete for chemical resources and the more efficient self-copiers multiplied.  With more competition and more time complexity grew.  The fossil record shows it took at least a billion years for any cellular life to arise.  It&#39;s hard to think in deep time like that, but even if it was slow and bumbling, the early molecules had time since nothing was alive to eat them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a biochemist and I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions on what we do and don&#39;t know about it to the best of my abilities.  We have worked so hard to learn these things.  When you don&#39;t even try to learn scientific findings and just make stuff up, you are shitting on scientists.  Technological advancement has brought many negative things, but science and engineering have also unveiled a verifiable explanation of human origins- this is a treasure.</p>
