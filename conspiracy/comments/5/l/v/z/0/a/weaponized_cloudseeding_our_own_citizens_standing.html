        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, full disclaimer here: I am most assuredly the type of person to that tends to play devil&#39;s advocate with most conspiracies and discussions about them. I believe that the chaotic natural evolution of capitilism is mainly responsible for the irregularities that often times look conspiratorial...
That being said, this time while trying to play the devil&#39;s part, I left with more questions than I ever entered with, and definitely would like some help seeing if there is anything I am missing.</p>

<p>So a little backstory: I have been traveling around for the last year anywhere people have congregated for action. Started out traveling for Bernie, with that ending in getting arrested in Philly at the DNC. After that the next logical step was Standing Rock for me. I was there for just over two months, and was involved in most of the big actions that got media attention. I listened to many people who had very compelling evidence of the private security companies using all sorts of advanced surveillance on us,and while some of the more far fetched ideas I dismissed, many of our actions were known about in advance, and there were many attempts to infiltrate our camp from same outside security. As the size of the camp started to grow, so did the attempts to monitor us. The critical mass of the camp continued to grow, even if there was an influx and outflow of people. Right up until the first very bad winter storm. After that everything changed. People flocked out in droves, the people that stayed were in bad spirits, in-fighting and bickering between the natives and white people became more pronounced. </p>

<p>I chalked this up to the weather, and stayed until we &quot;won&quot;.
One of my friends then went on to tell me about how we had been cloud seeded. Immediately I dismissed this as unscientific. I had heard of people talking about chem trails, and assumed it was the same thing. I had assumed I was a reasonably intelligent and open-minded person, but the -30 degree weather fried my computer and I was unable to connect to the internet. I now know my intelligence is directly tied to my ability to use google, but whatever. I got back to society and started looking up what he was talking about. I try to remain as science-based as possible, so when I saw on the wikipedia page that it had never been shown to be scientifically proven, I was like &quot;Oh ok, well that is that.&quot;  </p>

<p>Naturally I kept reading until I found this : 
&quot;Cloud seeding has been shown to be effective in altering cloud structure and size and in converting supercooled liquid water to ice particles. The amount of precipitation due to seeding is difficult to quantify. There is statistical evidence for seasonal precipitation increases of about 10 percent with winter seeding.&quot;
This intrigued me, as I saw how much money was spent annually by governments and private companies alike. I also found out that the  1977 UN Environmental Modification Convention banned the use of weather modification ...on hostile combatants. I was pretty sure using this as a weapon on your own citizens would have been a big deal then.</p>

<p>Then I found this article:
&quot;<a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/pilot-of-weather-modification-plane-dies-in-crash-south-of/article_9a6bfcd9-6186-5345-aaef-9d0a5978f7cb.html">http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/pilot-of-weather-modification-plane-dies-in-crash-south-of/article_9a6bfcd9-6186-5345-aaef-9d0a5978f7cb.html</a></p>

<p>This prompted me to research the company, Weather Modification Inc. , which is one of the largest companies of its kind in the world, and based in Fargo, ND. The head scientist had a resume that made me think he was probably very good at his job.</p>

<p>Curiosity peaked, I continued to dig, learning that the FAA requires flights to be tracked, plane serial numbers to be visible on the tails. I then turned up this article, naming the dead pilot as one of the company execs:
<a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4171525-pilot-killed-fargo-plane-crash-was-area-company-exec">http://www.inforum.com/news/4171525-pilot-killed-fargo-plane-crash-was-area-company-exec</a></p>

<p>In the pictures I was able to ID some of the N-number, which lead me here:</p>

<p><a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=WEATHER+MOD&amp;sort_option=1&amp;PageNo=1">http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=WEATHER+MOD&amp;sort_option=1&amp;PageNo=1</a>  </p>

<p>This is a list of all the planes registered to WMI. I am reasonably sure the number on the plane is 123KK based on the model of plane and the available registrations.</p>

<p>The flight data from that day indicates that the plane left from Fargo, as indicated by all the news articles. The news articles did not state that after heading south the pilot then headed to a spot a few counties over from Standing Rock.</p>

<p><a href="http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N123KK/history/20161201/2020Z/KFAR/KFAR">http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N123KK/history/20161201/2020Z/KFAR/KFAR</a></p>

<p>Here is a story I found stating similar ideas, from a few days before:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/power-structure-wages-weather-warfare-against-dakota-pipeline-protesters/">http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/power-structure-wages-weather-warfare-against-dakota-pipeline-protesters/</a></p>

<p>A few days after the storm described above, we had another massive post apocalyptic shitstorm:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.weather.gov/fgf/2016_12_6_WinterStormSummary">https://www.weather.gov/fgf/2016_12_6_WinterStormSummary</a></p>

<p>So that is pretty much the information I cobbled together. I was wondering about a few things, which is why I came to ask you wonderful people. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there anyone who knows anything about what a typical landing/take-off pattern look like from the air?  The news article about the pilot being an exec said that the plane was heading to Carrington to drop off something for the National Weather Service, but I can find no address for them online in that city. The Flight Tracker data to my (admittedly untrained) eye looks like two passes over a very general area.</p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone know how long that sort of seeding would take before weather patterns started to change? There are videos online from as far back as mid November describing Small engine Cessna&#39;s with small hoses on the wings flying over camp, with most people postulating chemical agents designed to make people sick. The storms happened later. Anyone have any clue over a time-frame? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry for the long post, but could think of no other way to structure all of the info. Really have no idea what to make of all this, but would much appreciate anyone&#39;s insight or opinion.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some conspiracy facts that might change your mind: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5l8q9r/hillary_clinton_under_fire_for_buying_2_million/dbu7q3b/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5l8q9r/hillary_clinton_under_fire_for_buying_2_million/dbu7q3b/</a></p>

<p>It is human nature to conspire. When you hear somebody say that the most likely explanation is usually the correct one, remember that when people plan to conspire, they come up elaborate plots that, if detected, a fall-back plan can be used. If there is even the slightest chance they could get caught, they will plan out the conspiracy within certain parameters that would seem like incompetence to an investigator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you&#39;re not saying that flight seeded the storm, only that its possible that someone did at some point. I can&#39;t find an issue in that logic, it would be nice to see the data on the flight that actually did that though. Lets all keep in mind most of the upper midwest is getting pounded, I doubt they seeded all of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;m usually one for a good conspiracy but I&#39;m also a little skeptical as well but here&#39;s the simple truth about this and take it from someone who has lived in North Dakota all my life: this was nothing out of the norm. Despite your research this first storm of the season was just that the first storm of the season. There is so much more to the pipeline protests and the majority of the North Dakota people are sick of the outside protesters being bussed in in some cases to &quot;help&quot; stand up for &quot;water rights&quot;. Most of the violence incited was by protesters not even from the tribe or even on behalf of the tribe. Sorry to go off on a diatribe here but I&#39;m sick of all the bullshit being thrown about by the MSM about what is taking place out there. The pipeline is way safer for everyone than transporting by rail as we had a derailment with a massive fire just in the last couple years that could have been disastrous and wiped out an entire city in North Dakota.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you completely about normal ND weather, and also saw first hand how much misinformation was thrown around; I was out there on those actions, and know that WE were instigators in all but a few situations (The North Camp raid). Hell even I could only find one article about Sophie possibly having a bomb, instead of a concussion grenade that morton county doesn&#39;t even own. I dislike the dishonesty, but understand how it works in terms of resistance and dissent on a very general scale. Different movements have traditionally used &quot;fake news&quot; , this didn&#39;t just pop up all of the sudden. I completely respect all of the North Dakota natives who don&#39;t want outsiders there causing trouble.I think the same problem plaguing ND is the same one troubling us at large: an inability to communicate the need for change on a universal level. It&#39;s too polarized, with too many different viewpoints that people don&#39;t take into consideration as they blindly try to hammer home whatever it is that they think the problem is. I naively thought that &quot;water is life&quot; was possibly an answer for this, a universal sentiment that every human needs to internalize, but sadly I think we did what humans always do and fucked it up. Definitely agree with you on most things about whats going on up there. Just choose to look at info most of the time, and all this looks very strange set of coincidences. I know alot of times these things look completely different with a new set of eyes. Just trying it out to see if anyone ran with it and did anymore digging. Ive about spent my limit with this, hit a wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally can understand your viewpoint and respect it whole heartedly. I do have to tell you as this is one of my first serious posts on Reddit this was not the response I expected and I am cautiously optimistic for our future. You didn&#39;t systematically call me an idiot or a shill or part of the establishment or a racist or any of the other trigger words that normally get bandied about. We actually had a conversation about the issues and I for one did not walk away from it going Eff that guy. Thank you for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for being honest... Its a relief seeing a Protester admit that! I know the police didn&#39;t exactly handle the situation perfectly either... But for the most part.. The cops in this state are still good people. Its a shame the way the country feels towards Police, and slandering the name of good Police Officers is only going to result in those good Police becoming bitter and becoming bad Police Officers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a great excerpt from &quot;Discovery of Global Warming&quot; (required reading in my Philosophy of Science class at University) on climate modification schemes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the Cold War got underway, U.S. military agencies devoted significant funds to research on what came to be called “climatological warfare.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the U.S. government had secretly been spending many millions of dollars on a grand experiment in actual climatological warfare. The Department of Defense directed extensive cloud-seeding over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, hoping to increase rainfall and bog down the North Vietnamese Army’s supply line in mud. Hints about the program were leaked in 1971, but the public did not learn the full extent of the effort until 1974, two years after it wound down in failure. Many people were dismayed when they learned of the experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another article about cloud seeding that was to be done in Oklahoma in 2015.  Before they were able to implement it, the state had a lot of rain across the state that resulted in major river flooding.</p>

<p>Cloud seeding is one of those things that happens often, but just seems too weird to be true for most people.  It was reported that China was looking into doing cloud seeding for their Olympics too, which you could probably find a lot on as well if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<p>How much the powers that be can manipulate the weather is certainly up for debate, but they most certainly can and do.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does anyone know how long that sort of seeding would take before weather patterns started to change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on a few things, like the weather conditions they&#39;re trying to manipulate and the chemicals being used, it could be quite rapid e.g. from a few hours till the next day.</p>

<p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding">&quot;cloud seeding&quot;</a> used silver iodide but these days they use all sorts of things!</p>

<p>Methodology</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide, potassium iodide and dry ice (solid carbon dioxide). Liquid propane, which expands into a gas, has also been used. This can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide. After promising research, the use of hygroscopic materials, such as table salt, is becoming more popular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.&gt; When Cloud seeding increases snowfall takes place when temperatures within the clouds are between 19 and −4 °F (−7 and −20 °C). Introduction of a substance such as silver iodide, which has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice, will induce freezing nucleation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the general idea</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article <em>stating</em> that &quot;cloud seeding&quot; has been going on since at least 2002! <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/cloud-seeding-humans-helped-make-rain-el-nio/story?id=37523484">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/cloud-seeding-humans-helped-make-rain-el-nio/story?id=37523484</a></p>

<p>Then of course there&#39;s this statement by the Us govt/military;</p>

<p>*Current technologies which will mature over the next thirty years will offer anyone who has the necessary resources the ability to modify weather patterns and their corresponding effects, at least on the local scale. Current demographic, economic, and environmental trends will create global stresses that provide the impetus necessary for many countries or groups to turn this weather modification ability into a capability. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the US, weather modification will likely become a part of national security policy with both domestic and international applications. Our government will pursue such a policy, depending on its interests, at various levels.</strong></p>

<p>These levels could include: unilateral actions, participation in a security framework such as NATO, membership in an international organization such as the UN, or participation in a coalition. <strong>Assuming that in 2025 our national security strategy includes weather modification, its use in our national military strategy will naturally follow</strong>. </p>

<p>Besides the significant benefits an operational capability would provide, another motivation to pursue weather modification is to deter and counter potential adversaries.</p>

<p><strong>In this paper we show that appropriate application of weather modification can provide battlespace dominance to a degree never before imagined.</strong> </p>

<p>In the future, such operations will enhance air and space superiority and provide new options for battlespace shaping and battlespace awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;The technology is there, waiting for us to pull it all together;&quot; in 2025 we can &quot;Own the Weather.&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a great write up of what you&#39;ve been looking into! It&#39;s organized, easy to follow, not overly wordy, &amp; your sources are great. I really appreciate that you only presented what you know (first hand &amp; through your research). 
I&#39;ve known cloud seeding was not only possible, but actually carried out in the US &amp; elsewhere. The speculation that it could have been used as a tool against the camp of protesters, however is terrifying. Without smoking gun evidence, speculating a motive is all we can do on that front. I think there&#39;s plenty of evidence to suggest strong motivations to do such a thing:
1. &quot;Over two-dozen banks&quot; (US &amp; foreign) had billions of dollars invested in the pipeline.
<a href="http://m.democracynow.org/web_exclusives/2983">http://m.democracynow.org/web_exclusives/2983</a>
2. This was highly worthy of mainstream news coverage, but was sparsely ever mentioned. Journalists had even prosecuted for their active coverage (i.e. Sarah Goodman, Democracy Now). 
<a href="http://m.democracynow.org/blog_posts/2995#full_transcript_more">http://m.democracynow.org/blog_posts/2995#full_transcript_more</a>
3. Despite protests beginning in October of 2014, it wasn&#39;t until August of 2016 when they garnered national attention &amp; interest. The treatment of protesters &amp; journalists along with the company&#39;s disregard for a pending legal injunction was getting negative attention. Following this, politicians, environmental advocacy groups, civil rights groups, &amp; Native American organizations were speaking out; more journalists were investigating the funding &amp; planning of the pipeline; even the UN &amp; Amnesty International got involved. This story had become too large to hide from the public. The project couldn&#39;t be successful with this amount of public backlash (which I don&#39;t think they expected), so they were forced to halt their plans and attempt to smooth the situation over. (Wikipedia pg sources)
4. By September, the camp had grown to become &quot;the largest gathering of Native Americans in more than 100 years.&quot; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37249617">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37249617</a> The company needs to calm the situation down while avoiding any further attention. After pipeline security was caught on video (Sarah Goodman) attacking protesters with dogs &amp; pepper spray AND subsequent failed attempts to clear the camps (ending in questionable arrests), they can&#39;t clear the camp legally &amp; further attempts = greater public backlash.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s enough evidence in these points alone to speculate a motive great enough to lead to the use of weather modification against citizens as a means of crowd control. Again, this is total speculation, but I&#39;m going to look more into the cloud seeding company you mentioned &amp; see if I can find any concrete sources on weather modification as its used today in the US. I&#39;d be interested to know if it&#39;s been privatized &amp; the process of utilizing it. </p>
