<p>THEY&#39;RE DOING THEIR JOBs. So you have to spoon feed them everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may be right - spoon feeding the Heroes who will be able to activate the machinery of the state might be necessary to get pizzagate investigated.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s one of the big problems in our systems - that you have to spoon feed them to work.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the state itself is The System that enables child trafficking, abuse and murder?  This is always a possibility when the state itself treats examination of this issue as if it were made of anti-matter.  </p>

<p>Personally I think it will be more effective if people do nothing.  By isolating themselves from Our Heroes, we will see exactly how broken they are.  This is a much more valuable lesson to all of Us than anything else.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure what i&#39;ve said that needs proof beyond the stated hypotheses, whatever that even means (as a general concept, proof in the vernacular sense doesn&#39;t really exist!  but ignoring that..).  </p>

<p>Seriously guys, the sheeple out there think Pizzagate is all about memes, so OP has made a valid point. My roommate told me r/Pizzagate was fake news because that&#39;s what snopes told him. Let&#39;s get a grip and not act like those kinds of sheeple. OP is the first user I&#39;ve seen to propose formal papers with citations and annotations to be used as evidence to indict.

I was asking if it was OP that did it is all - not so much what the content of it was.  I get what it was enough.  It was something that broke the rules.  Nuff said.  I was just wondering if it was OP that did it because if it was, then that would simply let me and others have an even better idea that OP isn&#39;t all that super even-keeled - which would lend more credibility to being very careful and wary of what he&#39;s requesting.

<p>Yes, I agree.  BUT do you actually think the average person could digest the massive world wide sex slave/pedophile rings and then find out it&#39;s all about sacrifices to a strange god?  &lt;--- This is why that is not needed.
