    <div class="md"><p>The shill battle is just another part of their distraction to make us talk about anything else except the clinton foundation. Notably this hyping of russian hacking. </p>

<p>Focusing on Russia so much that people forget to look into the corruption of the clinton foundation. To forget that alefantis visited the white house and stayed overnight while a clinton global initiative meeting on human trafficking was happening.<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1513813">source</a> They literally are ready to start a war to avoid this subject being in the spotlight with any type of intelligent discussion happening. </p>

<p>I think the CGI might be a focus point we are really really forgetting about. As well as Where is assange and where is eric braverman. FBIAnon told us about this all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beware the distraction of the &quot;emails&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the russia hacking incident. That is their distraction being used right now and it&#39;s working great. I haven&#39;t seen anything pedophilia related on MSM tv in awhile. </p>

<p>They are setting it up to argue that wikileaks is not credible by using our own fighting to prove it. I believe their twitter account might be truly compromised. It&#39;s hard to say that all of wikileaks is. If they are all under gag orders there is no proof they can legally tell us.</p>

<p>However I think the combination of making people fight over, if wikileaks is compromised, the russian hacking distraction, fake news, and their general strategies in general to focus the narrative on attacking everything except the corruption exposed is the &quot;quite brilliant psyop&quot; fbianon mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that the missing emails were found but not leaked is very telling that pizza gate has a lot more truth to it than most people want to admit. I was implying that alefantis might be higher up in the cult hierarchy than we might give him credit for but the proof is well hidden.</p>

<p>The timing of that white house visit is quite strange. I think real change is coming when trump is in power.. I believe they are going to throw the democrat pedo&#39;s under the bus to save the republican pedo&#39;s. It&#39;s a start but that&#39;s just a guess on my part.</p>

<p>Some like to believe he has steeled his resolve and truly wants to take out the satanist pedophiles. It&#39;s a possibility, trump did do rallies back to back working 20 hour days to get elected. He had to be passionate about something but it could just be that lust for power.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Focusing on Russia so much that people forget to look into the corruption of the clinton foundation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, let&#39;s look into that. So the Clinton Foundation is a registered non-profit (under 501(c)(3) ), which means their tax filings have to disclose everything they spend money on and most importantly everyone they pay. (This is distinct from the Trump Foundation, which is <em>not</em> a registered non-profit and has no such disclosure requirement.)</p>

<p>So, sure. Let&#39;s say that it&#39;s 2012 and you wanted to influence Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and you figure a cool million to the foundation with her name on it is a way to do that. So you cut the check and then... what, exactly? How does she get influenced? Like, Hillary says &quot;great, I&#39;ve never served on the board of that foundation, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll use that money to do some good. My husband hired the people who run it and they&#39;re a good bunch. Now, you wanted to meet? Sorry, I&#39;m booked up.&quot;</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s not at all clear how a donation to a charity she&#39;s not at all connected with can be <em>corrupting.</em> She was never paid by the foundation (none of the Clintons ever have been), she only joined the board after resigning as SecState, and then resigned again in April 2015 to run for President. So a donation to the Foundation is like taking a stack of hundreds, writing the name &quot;Clinton&quot; on them in sharpie, and then <em>lighting them on fire</em> for all the good it does Hillary Clinton. You have to assume, absent any evidence, that she&#39;s <em>so invested</em> in the success of an already incredibly successful charity for no other reason than her <em>husband&#39;s name is on it</em> that she&#39;d completely pervert the legitimacy of her office at great personal risk (since this is <em>extremely illegal.</em>) There&#39;s no avenue by which she <em>personally benefits</em> from a donation to the Clinton Foundation, so how can it possibly be &quot;corrupt&quot;? It would be like me donating to the Gates Foundation in the hope that my internet will get faster. There&#39;s just no possible <em>connection.</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe you read the whole thing and that&#39;s all you got from it. But ok, let me dumb it down for you - when people do illegal stuff, it&#39;s for personal gain. How does she gain, personally, from a donation to a charity she doesn&#39;t work for and has never been paid by? How is that different from just writing &quot;Clinton&quot; on some money and burning it, for all the good it would do Hillary Clinton? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, did you read Clinton Cash or just decided that it was against Clinton, so I&#39;m going to ignore it?

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Now, did you read Clinton Cash or just decided that it was against Clinton, so I&#39;m going to ignore it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time I&#39;d heard of it, it was in the context of its complete debunking, so no, it didn&#39;t make the top of my reading list. (Something tells me you didn&#39;t read it, either.) But to my knowledge Peter Schweitzer isn&#39;t able to draw the line between donations to the Clinton Foundation and payments to the Clintons, either. Everybody acts like a donation to the Clinton Foundation is just like putting money in Hillary&#39;s pocket, but it doesn&#39;t work like that. We <em>can see</em> that it doesn&#39;t work like that because it&#39;s a 501c(3) and its expenditures go onto the public record. It&#39;s just a donation to a charity that their names are on; they don&#39;t get to spend it. It&#39;s like trying to bribe you with a photograph of money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And did you read the news stories that say since Clinton is no longer in office or running for president, no one is donating to her foundation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but that was fake news. There&#39;s no way to know that because the Foundation won&#39;t have made its tax filings for the most recent quarter yet. Look, I mean, it&#39;s no secret that the Foundation traded pretty heavily on Bill&#39;s involvement, but that was the <em>whole point.</em> That&#39;s why he started the foundation - to mine his high profile, his notoriety, and his ability to organize and fundraise to charitable purpose. That&#39;s the whole point, there&#39;s nothing corrupt about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How then did the Clintons go from being dead broke when they left the white house (including take publicly-owned furniture and china</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a conservative myth. No, they didn&#39;t take the furniture. No, they didn&#39;t take all the &quot;W&#39;s&quot; from the computer keyboards. Those things are slanders that people have made up about the Clintons for ages. Immature nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How then did the Clintons go from being dead broke when they left the white house (including take publicly-owned furniture and china) to Hillary alone being worth $50 million dollars in 2010?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, because gosh, who would want to hire a former US president to do anything at all? What could that guy possibly know that would be useful or valuable? Yeah, can&#39;t imagine how they made any money at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed over the past few months that every now and then a ridiculous post gets upvoted super high, only for the top comment to be dismissing the post. There were a couple comments that had like 5k upvotes and were guilded (which doesn&#39;t really happen in here too often). There are two possibilities that jumped out at me:</p>

<p>-the less tinfoil-ly possibility is that it reached r/all and had a larger population view the post and upvote the confidently written, &quot;rational&quot; sounding point of view</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>-vote manipulation to get a post to 3k+ upvotes for a topic moderately related to the popular topics on here, only for it to be &quot;dismissed&quot; by the top comment (with mass upvotes and gold) so that visitors to the sub will see the post and assume that all of the arguments are just as easily debunked. Like a dumb post is planted, upvoted, and debunked to discredit any of the &quot;fake news&quot; this sub is supposedly propagating.</p>

<p>Also the possibility that people are just desperate to find evidence that aligns with their theories to shoehorn into their argument without doing their due diligence. I don&#39;t have any evidence to back this up, just that some posts look fishy and we&#39;ve seen vote manipulation by reddit in the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now, most American liberals are arguing that Trump&#39;s victory was the result of firehose propaganda.  Trump&#39;s policy credentials got ignored because the press obsessed over his twitter tantrums.  Clinton&#39;s policy goals were ignored because the press focused on scandals.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense that his critics would be furthering that model of communication, putting out a firehose of falsehoods with cited contradictions for those reading the comments, with the assumption that it&#39;s going to suddenly start changing popular opinion.</p>

<p>A few days ago one of the mods (with a long post history in certain political subreddits) posted some disinfo.  I corrected it with a citation and an explanation, and I pointed out how people were firehosing out that disinfo and never fixing their comments afterwards so people would see the falsehood first, before they ever saw the correction.</p>

<p>He never fixed the comment.  He tried to justify it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d believe that people were desperate to find evidence to shoehorn into their pre-existing political beliefs.  But a mod of conspiracy <em>knows</em> how propaganda  works.  People don&#39;t need to be banned because that would be suspicious.  The message just needs to be spread before the facts catch up with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Shills have a set of sources they have ready ( probably given by their employer ) if they&#39;re asked. I had a shill who claim Marijuana caused permanent brain damage. When asked for source he linked a peer reviewed paper that was one paragraph long which had little or nothing to do with permanent brain damage, in fact in the article it even said their evidence were conflicting. It&#39;s usually some vague shit that has little to do with the subject. They do this to give others the impression that they are credible. </p>

<p>When it comes to pizzagate, they&#39;ll ask for sources that claim pizza=children. Just tell them it was the FBI who had established that before they were born. If they say the FBI isn&#39;t a credible source, they&#39;re not wrong but you will know they are a shill then.</p>

<p>Remember, they have preemptive sources ready written and reviewed by their people, i.e the tobacco company, pharmaceuticals, anything government, journalists from fake news agency.</p>

<p>The FBI would be a GREAT source. The &quot;shills&quot; are asking for a source because your claim is bullshit. The FBI has released no documents backing the &#39;pizza = children&#39; pedo code. Or any of the other supposed code words that were invented to correspond to the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>You have to work on the basis that NO source is infallible. Even &quot;credible&quot; sources miss things out or get things wrong, either by accident or by design. Sometimes the truth has be triangulated from a combination of credible journalism, eye-witnesses, background knowledge and an analysis of what is being said by whom and establishing their possible motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the whole &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; debacle a few years ago? That whole thing was an excuse for people to erase inconvenient truths about a person&#39;s past from the web. There&#39;s also groups like the Anti Defamation League, which basically is just CTR but with different goals. And of course there&#39;s astroturfing companies such CTR themselves who try and control narratives and influence news sites to post some types of news and avoid others.</p>

<p>All of these things are about controlling narratives, and one tool they use to do that is to try and erase evidence. There&#39;s also more innocent reasons, such as old servers being forgotten about and breaking down, other technical failures, legitimate errors in reporting, etc.</p>

<p>As for specific instances of any of these things happening, I have none, you would have to ask others who are more involved in this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t provide a source for your reasonably contestable claim, then you don&#39;t know whether or not what you&#39;re claiming is true.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I read it once somewhere&quot; isn&#39;t evidence. &quot;I got it from a source I trust, but don&#39;t want to share it with you&quot; isn&#39;t evidence. &quot;Go google it&quot; isn&#39;t evidence. &quot;I saw a lot of headlines about it, so it must be true&quot; isn&#39;t evidence. &quot;All my friends are talking about it&quot; isn&#39;t evidence. </p>

<p>Anyone who resorts to any of these things once confronted on their inability to provide a source for what they insist to be true doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, full stop.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right; the contribution comes from the person being asked replying with a source for what they claimed, thereby demonstrating that they&#39;re not making shit up <em>and</em> subjecting their source to exactly the public scrutiny this sub is supposed to be all about. </p>

<p>Knowledge doesn&#39;t spring fourth from nowhere. If you&#39;ve come to a conclusion, you should be able to demonstrate the basis on which you formed it. If the thought of that scares you, you&#39;re probably just insisting that what you <em>want</em> to be true, rather than what you <em>know</em> to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for doing my own research, but asking for a source from the person making the claim is my first step in seeing if the claim even warrants that effort. I can&#39;t tell you how many times a person has made a claim, I find a supporting evidence for that claim, find something wrong with and bring it back to that person, only to get &quot;yeah, that&#39;s not my argument, its &lt;other source&gt;.&quot; (And more often than not, &lt;other source&gt; wasn&#39;t actually any better.)</p>

<p>Why should I waste my time with that? If a person is making a claim and truly believes it, I want to see the evidence that convinced <em>them</em>. If that evidence looks convincing to me, I&#39;ll dig into it further, and try to find counter-arguments. But if that first piece of evidence is not convincing, I&#39;ve saved my self the trouble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree the two political parties Americans seem to swoon over offer no choice between left and right, it&#39;s pretty ridiculous to suggest that there is no difference between right and left ideologies. They are massively and fundamentally different, and most threads on this subreddit lately just seem to devolve into an off topic argument between them. I know I&#39;m never going to convince someone with conservative values that the church is a lie for control ,  capitalism is the root problem in our society, Trump us a salesman who lied to everyone for his own profits, and the poor people we are bombing and displacing for profit are not the enemy.

There was no evidence beyond some miss interpretation of a few Beatle lyrics and Paul being barefoot on the cover of Abbey Road. Same with PG. </p>

<p>But the other conspiracy subs I&#39;m on, even mod some, I don&#39;t control and a new conspiracy sub, and I HATE to say this, needs some mods willing to cull the nonsense and ban the shills.</p>

<p>Only people who want to fool you would say this. How do you verify anything if nothing is a reliable source? And how is it evidence of someone being a shill if they provide a source? This mindset is based on the premise that the &quot;Illuminati&quot; or whatever control literally every journalist and every publication out there.

<p>It&#39;s the world we live in now. There is no discussion, just name calling. Creating a bigger and bigger divide so that soon that&#39;s all we know.

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Shills are only necessary under the assumption that these conspiratorial beliefs are true. If they&#39;re not, than the alleged shills are just regular people, like me, who are interested in these subjects despite not buying into the theories. It&#39;s honestly kinda frustrating that I can&#39;t have a discussion around here without accusations that I&#39;m being paid to take a different stance. If someone is paid to tell me pizzagate is true, or paid to tell me pizzagate is false, the validity of that should come from the evidence and arguments regardless of any perceived motivations. </p>

<p>If I ran such an organization, I would base the operations on black propaganda and forum sliding, discrediting anything that I didn&#39;t like by association and hiding the truth behind a mountain of bullshit. That would be invisible to people who are looking for shills.</p>

<p>One of the links there is about a DARPA project to manipulate Redditors. These are not amateurs. </p>

<p>You may think that it doesn&#39;t really matter that shills exist, but it does. As for what to do about it, we should not call other people shills. The only thing you can do is spread information about them so that other people can immunize themselves and become aware of their tactics. For instance, there are reputation management service that push stuff to the 10th page a google search. They do the same thing on forums, pushing the good stuff to the bottom where nobody will read it. </p>

<p>Then you have to ask yourself why <em>actual</em> organizations don&#39;t do this. How would you justify the <em>expense?</em> Remember, it&#39;s an organization, so you have to justify each line item - and that&#39;s true whether your organization is profit-driven or a non-profit charity. You&#39;re accountable for the money you spend, and that&#39;s true even in the Mafia and ISIS - we intercept a decent amount of ISIS&#39;s email, and it turns out that a lot of it is people <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/isis-budget-crunch-1.3450646">grumbling about the ISIS bean counters,</a> making them justify their expense reports. Funny ol&#39; world, huh?</p>

<p>So, ok. You go to your shareholders and accountants and you&#39;re like &quot;ok, I want to hire a bunch of people to start this disinformation campaign, black propaganda and forum sliding. Shills in r/conspiracy and so forth.&quot; And your shareholders say &quot;...um, why, exactly? We already spend a lot on marketing, I don&#39;t see how a disinformation campaign is revenue-positive.&quot; Somebody pipes up and says &quot;uh, yeah, anyway there&#39;s studies about &#39;disinformation&#39;, and it turns out that any time you mention a claim, even in the context of refuting it, most people come away with their belief in that claim strengthened. A disinfo campaign just makes people believe the thing you&#39;re trying to refute.&quot; Somebody says &quot;wait, you want full-time staff to reach the 500,000 subscribers in r/conspiracy? That&#39;s stupid, even at minimum wage we&#39;d pay $15,000 a year, and for that much money we could make a YouTube ad and reach millions.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, well, if you say so. Look, you should be skeptical of <em>any</em> claim someone makes on the internet. People are <em>always</em> trying to manipulate you to their viewpoint, and whether they&#39;re doing it for a paycheck, for a personal payoff, or for the thrill of the troll is irrelevant. You should believe things on the basis of compelling evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are tons of governments that hire shills, which means that you are claiming that governments are financially efficient. This is obviously false, but let&#39;s assume it&#39;s true. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easily justified if the shills concentrate on the top 1 or 2 threads on large subreddits. This subreddit has 416,000 subscribers. Realistically, we could say that 30 or 40 thousand people may view the top post on their front page. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic/">this is backed up by the traffic stats</a>) Is it worth it to pay a guy to manipulate that thread and how much would it cost? Shills probably work 8 or 10 hours, and maybe they make 15 bucks an hour. They might spend a half hour on that thread total if they notice something that they want to hide. They can then spend the rest of the time on other threads in other large subreddits. So we are talking 7 bucks to manipulate what 40,000 people see on a thread. This is wayyy cheaper than television advertising. </p>

<p>Why did the US government decide to control the media via Operation Mockingbird? The answer is obvious. </p>

<p>Years ago, most people watched TV. Now, there is a significant amount of people who don&#39;t. They are social media instead. How is the US government (and other governments) going to manipulate the information feed to these people? Through social media, of course. </p>

<p>Answered above. </p>

<p>If you push a comment down even 20 percent of the way on a large thread, virtually nobody will read it. This is the same reason that there are services out there that push certain results off of the first few pages of a google search. People are lazy. </p>

<p>You can confirm this by looking at a thread that is on the front page somewhere, then checking what comments are on the top, which ones are 20 percent down, etc, then checking again in a few hours to see how many votes each comment accumulated since you last checked. The top comments are the ones that receive tons of additional upvotes. Comments near the bottom might stay at +20 or whatever they were when you first checked. </p>

<p>Yes, it was very speculative.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just a really funny way to describe a government agency with an official Twitter account. Are <em>you</em> currently &quot;manipulating Reddit&quot;? You&#39;re using Reddit to try to shift my viewpoint, aren&#39;t you? Isn&#39;t that exactly what you&#39;re accusing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the US government decide to control the media via Operation Mockingbird?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the CIA had no public face and a PR problem, because when an organization is silent, people can pretend it&#39;s saying anything at all. People believe the accusations you don&#39;t respond to and the viewpoints you don&#39;t try to balance. And sure, because there&#39;s geopolitical advantage in having influence over the newspapers your adversary is reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through social media, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. By participating in social media. Hence, the White House has a Twitter account and a Facebook page. That&#39;s not what you&#39;re talking about, is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you push a comment down even 20 percent of the way on a large thread, virtually nobody will read it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you leave it at the top of the thread, <em>also</em> virtually nobody will read it. And among the small fraction of readers, an even smaller fraction will believe it. Probably the most widely-read, most compellingly-argued Reddit comment convinces all of 20 people. And those people were already predisposed to believe it, anyway, so you haven&#39;t moved the needle. You could expose the Kennedy assassination as a Reddit comment and 99% of the people who read it would be like &quot;this is horseshit.&quot; What&#39;s the point of burying it, then?</p>

<p>Because the <em>actual dangerous part</em> is all speculation. &quot;A government could use social media as a kind of thought control!&quot; Well, yes, like they could try to convince you to stop smoking. Ooo, &quot;thought control.&quot; I mean, and I guess it works since people smoke less now. But so what? Is it <em>thought control</em> if I tell you something you didn&#39;t know, and then you modify your thinking and behavior in response? Sure, if you&#39;re some kind of child, I guess you&#39;d think that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, right.  Thanks for the clarification.  </p>

<p>The Hillary Clinton subreddit currently has 32,876 subscribers.<br/>
The_Donald subreddit currently has 328,165 subscribers, almost ten times as many.<br/>
Even the Hillary For Prison subreddit has 66,399 subscribers, more than double.</p>

<p>And yet despite these subscriber rates, look at the Politics subreddit.  If you trusted the Politics subreddit you&#39;d assume every person in the world was a Trump-hating Hillary Clinton fan.  The Politics subreddit, and also the World News subreddit, were taken over and turned into Hillary Clinton echo chambers.  I believe this hurt Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign.  Echo chambers can be useful for dedicated supporters - The Donald and the Hillary Clinton subreddits <em>should</em> be echo chambers - but subreddits which are supposed to be neutral shouldn&#39;t be taken over and turned into echo chambers.  Every action has an opposite action.  When you remove the opposite voices, you become complacent.  You lose energy.  </p>

<p>Look at the massive number of upvotes and comments on threads on The_Donald compared to threads on the Hillary Clinton subreddit.  Donald Trump supporters are genuinely high energy.  Their voices were suppressed on reddit, and that motivated them.</p>

<p>Any candidate who wants to win the election needs to genuinely motivate their supporters.  Real supporters are far more effective than paid shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The time to pay shills would be before the election.</p>

<p>The Donald subreddit is just as high energy now as it was before the election.  There would be no reason to continue to pay shills after the election was won.  Trump fans are genuinely full of enthusiasm and energy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Hilary Clinton subreddit, and the subreddits which were turned into Clinton echo chambers, such as Politics, have seen their activity levels drop off dramatically since the election.</p>

<p>To be fair, this <em>is</em> a conspiracy subreddit, and the whole point of being here is to talk about suspicions, so you&#39;re rising your theory in the right place.  However, the statistics relating to drop off in Clinton activity since the election, and the continuation of Trump activity, don&#39;t correspond with your theory.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, do you genuinely believe it&#39;s impossible that Trump&#39;s fans are energised?  Look at the rallies.  <a href="https://i.sli.mg/i1NiF4.jpg">Trump was filling stadiums.  Clinton sometimes struggled to fill halls.</a> I know that&#39;s not what you want to believe, but sometimes the truth isn&#39;t what we want to hear.</p>

<p>I would encourage anyone without confirmation bias to examine the reddit activity statistics pre and post election and then make a decision on which candidate needed to use paid shills.  Donald Trump has said that he believes that one of his strengths is his ability to energise people, and the evidence would support that.  His supporters are high energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The activity in the Donald has definitely dropped somewhat since the election. Everything politics related would drop after an election. It is just natural. Particularly for the losing candidate. </p>

<p>The issue of whether the astroturfing would continue after an election really depends on the motives of whoever perpetrate it. If it is just to win the election then sure it would disappear. But if the motive is to sway public opinion then there isn&#39;t any reason to stop.</p>

<p>I have long suspected that Russia is funding astroturfing for far left and far right political movements in the US to destabilize the country.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7?client=ms-android-verizon">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7?client=ms-android-verizon</a></p>

<p>There is actually decent evidence for this. And as is clearly apparent Trumps election is certainly the best thing to happen to Putin this year.</p>

<p>I suspect that this subreddit, hillaryforprison, latestagecapitalism and many other subreddits are being targeted by Russia to spur the growth of destabilizing radical political movements in the country. </p>

<p>My suspicion is that this goes well beyond reddit, from Twitter to the radical propaganda news websites you can find on facebook. </p>

<p>If true it would be particularly effective because all they need to do is give  a little push to these radical political movements that will develop mostly organically.</p>

<p>I know it seems pretty crazy but this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after all. So I guess this is the right place for this sort of shit.</p>

<p>The energy is as high as ever!</p>

<p>The Reddit admins have repeatedly manipulated their algorithms to block The Donald from the front page of Reddit.  They have also introduced discriminatory rules against The Donald (for example stickied posts are blocked from the front page, but only for The Donald - this rue doesn&#39;t apply to any other subreddits).  These discriminatory &#39;adjustments&#39;, may have tricked a few naive people into thinking The Donald activity has dropped off.</p>

<p>But as you can see by the comments totals above, the reverse is true.  The Donald is as high energy as ever!  Suppressing The Donald from the front page hasn&#39;t dampened the energy of Donald Trump supporters.  If anything, having your voice suppressed only motivates people even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trolling part come from the moving the goal posts. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Person: We should be looking at the content of the DNC/Podesta emails instead of focusing all of our attention on the source.</p>

<p>Concern Troll: From what I&#39;ve heard there is nothing incriminating in the emails, the FBI even said so. The fact that Russia hacked the election should be concerning us. Do you have any proof of any wrong doing from the emails? </p>

<p>Person: It was clear from (link 1) and (link 2) that the DNC was directly coordinating with media sources. It looks like they even wined and dined them. How can we trust the media to be impartial when this reporter (link 3) is openly talking about how the campaign can strategize to help their PR with Podesta himself? Also its be shown here (link 4) and here (link 5) that questions were leaked to Clinton&#39;s team. And in this email&#39;s attachment (link 6) you can see Clinton&#39;s wall street speeches where she offers different policy solutions than she has declared publicly.</p>

<p>Concern Troll: If there were any foul play then the FBI would have called them out on it. We know for a fact from 13 intelligence agencies that the election was hacked. For all we know those emails, which aren&#39;t even incriminating (btw), could be complete fabrications. Do you have proof (real proof this time) of any wrong doing in the emails? Do you have any proof that those emails are not fabricated? And more importantly why would Russia leak only Clinton&#39;s emails through its wikileaks apparatus if it were not trying to hack our election? It is completely unfair that the American people didn&#39;t get to see dirt on Trump. But again you haven&#39;t provided a shred of real evidence to back up your claims. </p>

<p>And it&#39;d go on like this for several more cycles. Usually the responses by the troll are canned and generic, along the lines  of &quot;That doesn&#39;t prove anything. I need something more substantial than what is likely a compromised email.&quot;  This means that the person might actually be trying to convince a bot designed to seek out certain topics and engage advocates. They&#39;re designed to waste someones time and hurt their confidence by dismissing their well thought out ideas as if they&#39;re juvenile. It is easy to write this sort of bot because the more curt and disbelieving the responses are the more likely the person is to feel as if they are not valued and try to convince the bot that their ideas are worthwhile. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t disagree that shilling exists (this is verifiably proven at this point), but can people stop calling everyone who simply disagrees with them shills? It makes you look like petulent children who can&#39;t handle someone disagreeing with you. There are real, reasonable human beings who hold beliefs that are contrary to yours, and that&#39;s always going to be a fact of life. Some of those people are wrong, some are right, and sometimes they have no god damn clue what they&#39;re talking about. Grow up, provide sources to make an argument, or move on. Just dismissing dissenting opinions as &quot;shills&quot; because you disagree with them is fucking childish. </p>

<p>Also, just because people have a differing opinion, it doesn&#39;t <em>automatically</em> mean they&#39;re &quot;concern trolling&quot; either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck?  Is this Wikipedia now?  What exactly about &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; says to you &quot;well-documented evidence from reliable sources exists for this topic?&quot;</p>

<p>Asking for sources is nothing more than trying to win an argument via an appeal to authority.  You think JFK wasn&#39;t killed by Lee Harvey Oswald?  Too bad, I have a lot of sources that say otherwise.  You think 9/11 was a CIA plot?  Too bad again, because I have a lot of sources that say otherwise.  You see how well sources work?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t find truth by asking the authorities.  We find truth with conjecture and reasoning.  Sometimes there&#39;s a little evidence to back it up, but sometimes there isn&#39;t, and that lack of evidence doesn&#39;t always mean that the theory isn&#39;t true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have enough experience in life to know that the world is a tough old place, full of hard stuff. i have been under the delusion that people make sense and as individuals we may agree or disagree on how, but that we all more or less wanted things to be better.</p>

<p>but the &quot;shills&quot; of the world, and i am sure a some of them are on some sort of payroll, have come out of the woodwork.  i think that a big portion of these new &quot;shills&quot; are people who have been emboldened by President &quot;The Clown&quot; and his ability to spew his gibberish and be taken seriously.  They are your 54ish uncle that stares at your sisters ass and tells you racist jokes to show how hip he is, there may be variations but these guys are legion.</p>

<p>i know must typical reddit users would scoff at the idea of reddit or facebook being what &quot;Intellectuals&quot; do, but there is a generation lurking that is disenfranchised and more or less thinks the internet is like a series of tubes or some sort of &quot;magic&quot; TV,  that has avoided exposing itself to ridicule from the &quot;nerds&quot;.  these people are not out to talk, they want to shout the shit they have had to keep quiet, they dont like any of you, or want a debate, they are a sort of &quot;fuck you, i am winner, deal with it&quot;  go to any worn out looking bar and i bet you would hear quite a bit of what the &quot;shills&quot; propagate.</p>

<p>i would not care but it is not just reddit where these guys are turning up in the analog world!  the other day at work a customer flipped out on me cause he overheard me and another coworker talk about the the election hack, the customer literally started screaming that the hacks didnt happen.</p>

<p>and as a white guy i am VERY scared of the number of other whities that have begun to feel free to tell race jokes as soon as the &quot;ethnics&quot; are not around.  I honestly thought the US was past this shit, maybe not completely but at least on the down hill side.  I was wrong, and completely fooled.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, the thing is, i personally know I&#39;m not a &quot;shill.&quot; I work for a living and come here to decompress and bleed out all the weird ideas that run through my head. I can&#39;t tell you the amount of times I&#39;ve been called a shill and everyone has just decided I am one. </p>

<p>What if there are <em>no</em> shills? What if we are all just bickering with each other and every time we hear an idea or opinion that is contradictory to ours, instead of speaking candidly about it, we just jump to the easy conclusion of &quot;they must be a shill.&quot; to make ourselves feel better in our own opinion?</p>

<p>I mean, the truth will come out regardless. I think, for the sake of discourse and for the sake of free speech, we should at least <em>entertain</em> some differing opinions so we can better rectify our own beliefs, or even change our minds on some subjects. </p>

<p>Now, of course, you can&#39;t see me, you don&#39;t know me, and you&#39;ve never met me. It would be easy to think what I&#39;m saying is being fed to me from some government agency somewhere. But what if that&#39;s exactly what the people in power want? To splinter us, breed discontent, and make us all doubt each other to the point where it all <em>stays</em> and bickering and never becomes anything more?</p>

<p>All I&#39;m trying to get at is immediately thinking &quot;SHILL!&quot; is unhealthy for the modus operandi of this subreddit. If we can just up and decide someone isn&#39;t worth listening to then who&#39;s to say our opinion won&#39;t be next?</p>

<p>Food for thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I have to ask: did you even <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">read the link that I provided?</a> It says quite clearly that numerous government manipulate social media for propaganda purposes. You seem to think that they won&#39;t do this because TV is more efficient. Why are they funding these programs then? Are they just lying about shilling on social media? Why would they lie?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m saying that I don&#39;t see the point. Direct engagement via Reddit is absurdly labor intensive for what payoff?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did the US government decide to control the media via Operation Mockingbird? The answer is obvious. </p>

<p>Years ago, most people watched TV. Now, there is a significant amount of people who don&#39;t. They are social media instead. How is the US government (and other governments) going to manipulate the information feed to these people? Through social media, of course. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, and I know that seems like a lot to you; if you reached 40,000 people that would be the biggest megaphone you&#39;d ever had in your life. But governments have far larger ones. Russia owns a US news network. If Russia wants to put something in front of eyeballs they put it on TV. For free, basically. If the USG wants US citizens to believe something then they issue a press release and it&#39;s front page news on newspapers with combined circulation in the hundred millions.</p>

<p>Answered above. </p>

<p>And reordering the rank of posts in a thread has what effect, exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you push a comment down even 20 percent of the way on a large thread, virtually nobody will read it. This is the same reason that there are services out there that push certain results off of the first few pages of a google search. People are lazy. </p>

<p>You can confirm this by looking at a thread that is on the front page somewhere, then checking what comments are on the top, which ones are 20 percent down, etc, then checking again in a few hours to see how many votes each comment accumulated since you last checked. The top comments are the ones that receive tons of additional upvotes. Comments near the bottom might stay at +20 or whatever they were when you first checked. </p>

<p>Now, did you read Clinton Cash or just decided that it was against Clinton, so I&#39;m going to ignore it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time I&#39;d heard of it, it was in the context of its complete debunking, so no, it didn&#39;t make the top of my reading list. (Something tells me you didn&#39;t read it, either.) But to my knowledge Peter Schweitzer isn&#39;t able to draw the line between donations to the Clinton Foundation and payments to the Clintons, either. Everybody acts like a donation to the Clinton Foundation is just like putting money in Hillary&#39;s pocket, but it doesn&#39;t work like that. We <em>can see</em> that it doesn&#39;t work like that because it&#39;s a 501c(3) and its expenditures go onto the public record. It&#39;s just a donation to a charity that their names are on; they don&#39;t get to spend it. It&#39;s like trying to bribe you with a photograph of money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And did you read the news stories that say since Clinton is no longer in office or running for president, no one is donating to her foundation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but that was fake news. There&#39;s no way to know that because the Foundation won&#39;t have made its tax filings for the most recent quarter yet. Look, I mean, it&#39;s no secret that the Foundation traded pretty heavily on Bill&#39;s involvement, but that was the <em>whole point.</em> That&#39;s why he started the foundation - to mine his high profile, his notoriety, and his ability to organize and fundraise to charitable purpose. That&#39;s the whole point, there&#39;s nothing corrupt about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How then did the Clintons go from being dead broke when they left the white house (including take publicly-owned furniture and china</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a conservative myth. No, they didn&#39;t take the furniture. No, they didn&#39;t take all the &quot;W&#39;s&quot; from the computer keyboards. Those things are slanders that people have made up about the Clintons for ages. Immature nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How then did the Clintons go from being dead broke when they left the white house (including take publicly-owned furniture and china) to Hillary alone being worth $50 million dollars in 2010?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, because gosh, who would want to hire a former US president to do anything at all? What could that guy possibly know that would be useful or valuable? Yeah, can&#39;t imagine how they made any money at all.</p>
