<p>If there was all this power suerly what ever was going to happen would of happened already? Who is the oposing force?</p>

<p>I have heard somuch about secret societies but the fact remains the governments are clearly and have been for a while more than ready to &quot;strike&quot; so whats stopping this from happening?</p>

<p>I am talking right back to the source here light vrs dark, dark has clear power its unimaginatively obvious however where is the &quot;light&quot; side like litterally where? </p>

<p>I am mot saying ohh come save us i am genuinely asking who is the light? What have they got that money, nukes, gun&#39;s  corruption etc cant simply destroy? Please dont insullt me ans say ohh Christianity or the church is stopping it, where is it? We know sooooo much about theories and &quot;secret&quot; groupes who the players are etc.. But no one can say who the light side is and how it is stopping the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assumption is conviction without evidence. Under the guise your describing we could assume there is some type of metaphysical plane over lapping and war is happening on another plane than physical. That&#39;s where all the light and darkness comes from. But even seeing or hearing things is speculation, albeit somethings may be real or may not be. I&#39;d look at it more realistically and think about the fact that logistics for these groups is hard to organize so controlling everything on a more direct level would be too hard to maintain until there is much less dissidence. There is a illusion of some fighting back other than places like this sub and small groups just because of the sheer level of what is unfolding and has been unfolding for centuries. A life time is really a very short amount of time in the grand scheme of things.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I am thinking.  A lot of them had issues doing what they did in Iraq and Afghanistan.  If they are ordered to do it to Americans, I think it will really hit home.  It is easy to teach them that Iraqis and Afghanis are sub-human or whatever it is they are taught.  It is much more difficult to dehumanize Americans to them.  </p>

<p>Either way, I hope the US government is changed through peaceful means, but I know government forces would lose a guerilla war against Americans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, there&#39;s no sense in the actions of the powerful. Power is an end in itself. The &quot;end of history&quot; might be the goal, in that the powerful can endlessly confuse and mislead the global population into being constantly in a state of manipulation. Even when a guy like Soros thinks he&#39;s being moral by donating to a bunch of &quot;open society&quot; idealistic foundations, he&#39;s really just making excuses for giving into his own greedy drive towards more power and influence over the world. Sure it&#39;s possible humanity is fucked. But isn&#39;t that one of the oldest ideas? the fall from innocence?<br/>
I think there is still potential, I&#39;m not yet so pessimistic as Orwell when he said the future of humanity was the picture of a boot stamping a human face, forever. We have a chance to communicate. Our biggest challenge will be to root out the hate we have for each other and unite in common meaning. Their endgame is to mitigate the risk that we the people might become more informed of elite crimes. It must seem pretty hopeless living in the USA right now, with the corporate media controlling your thoughts. Don&#39;t give up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Art of War dictates the importance of timing.  Especially when everything is at stake.  </p>

<p>It takes time to change thinking on a global scale.  The idea of a one-world government is frightening to the masses and therefore must be implanted over the course of 3 generations or more.  So they&#39;ve been busy setting up the stage.  </p>

<p>With the introduction of computers, Internet, and AI, they have found new tools to help with the transition.  Secret societies are often attracted to symbolism and the idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a> is symbolically pleasing for initiating the official transition to the NWO.  Since they know it&#39;s already on the horizon, it&#39;s just a matter of timing.  The million dollar question is how far off is it?  A technologically singularity will bring about massive social change as well as drastically altering our thinking.  For example, once AIs start building other AIs, it will-have a runaway effect that is not unlike magic.  People will no longer be able to trust photographs and video as evidence.  It will literally be a time that new gods are invented.  What better time could there be to implement a NWO?  </p>

<p>Better to wait a few decades and guarantee success than to do it now and blow it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>4chan has had a very compelling series of threads in recent months of a self-proclaimed High Level Insider. He claims to be part of a benevolent secret society which has been historically opposed to many of the other secret society factions, mainly the masonic lodges.</p>

<p>Their faction supposedly goes by the name of Three and this anon claims their group was the driving force behind the American Revolution, a well-intentioned attempt at creating a society not ruled by Kings, but by Kings among Kings, a society of an enlightened and free population, the first of its kind.</p>

<p>This project was then supposedly gradually undermined by opposing factions who were of the opinion, that some knowledge and power is best kept from these masses, taking the world back to an uninformed population of slaves to &quot;enlightened&quot; Kings.</p>

<p>Take all of that as you will, it&#39;s near impossible to dispute or verify, but I have found the perspective of this anon rather thought-provoking. Who knows, perhaps it&#39;s true and what you&#39;re looking for. Decide for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There appear to be several stories going around about there being a few groups fighting for dominance.  So when you hear the term TPTB, it doesn&#39;t appear to revolve around one group yet.  So if true, you have a few groups that are nearly infinitely wealthy, wanting to be dominant.  If high level insider is benevolent, seems odd.</p>

<p>Even the rumors of the soft coup during the last election you had a few string pullers, including NSA and CIA acting separately and somewhat at odds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. And perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have used the term benevolent, as people may have different ideas about what that entails.</p>

<p>All of the factions strive for power, but according to these ideas, some want power only for themselves and view the general populations as mere cattle to do with whatever they like, while others, including this supposed insider, want power and agency for anyone willing to participate in the conscious human experience. Neither &quot;side&quot; seems to be shying away from using force and even deadly force to further their ideas, so benevolent is surely a relative term in this.</p>

<p>Weird, but interesting times indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The light/REAL opposing force is US, the PEOPLE of the world. The &quot;peasants&quot;/commoners. We seriously outnumber their morally corrupt asses.
We could crush them (literally or otherwise) but not enough people know about how deep government corruption goes. Many people are lazy, scared, apathetic, unsure, distracted, etc.
 At least people now know about corporate/banker/wallstreet corruption, that&#39;s a great start, thanks Bernie. :D
But there&#39;s plenty left to conquer. The truths about 9/11, (lots of people think it was an inside job, so why are we still not grilling the government????)
 middle eastern wars, assassinations, false flags, JFK, etc. But people are waking up every day so we&#39;ll win this in the end.</p>

<p>As for &quot;why are they so slow to implement the NWO if they&#39;re so powerful?&quot;</p>

<p>I would guess that either the elite aren&#39;t quite as powerful as they want us to think (trillions of dollars, owning most big corporations, media,  etc. is very powerful, but they&#39;re not gods and they have to avoid paper trails, suspicions and such). Although I wonder why police follow orders when they see occupy wallstreet protestors....maybe they&#39;re brainwashed into thinking &quot;these protestors are just stupid hippies complaining about nothing&quot; or &quot;they&#39;re no good lazy teenagers&quot; etc.
Or just simply bribed with pay rises or something...Hmmmm...
It&#39;s a shame because the police should be on our side, not the ruling class.
Anyway, the mainstream media is already becoming the LEGACY/DEAD MAINSTREAM MEDIA. Because of their 24/7 bullshit in the election.</p>

<p>Either the elite are not as powerful as we think or they&#39;re trying to avoid backfiring steps and playing the long game.
 For example, if they tried to launch full on martial law in the U.S., people would be outraged and storm the white house, police and army would be on the peoples&#39; side.
 I&#39;m usually someone who hates guns and prefers society to be absent of such bloody weapons, but if it stops the elite going full dictator on us, maybe only dumbass city gangs should be targeted?
 I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea but it seems a lot of pro-gun right wingers live outside cities so they wouldn&#39;t care so much.
 Not even a total city gun ban, just loser gang members.
(If you&#39;re part of a gang and not a bad person, sorry for judging you, but gangstaaaa culture is dumb,
leave that shit if you can.)</p>

<p>I know some gangster members say they only carry guns for protection but it&#39;s a dangerous situation either way. The other gangstaaa wannabes who shoot out of anger/fear/gain respect/retarded arguments, etc. are even worse.
 We know the CIA smuggled drugs into neighborhoods but maybe guns are also spread so they can escalate gun crime and then make us think &quot;see, guns should be banned&quot;, bait race wars, hate against police,
divide the people, etc.
I slightly sympathize with pro-gun right wingers. Maybe that&#39;s why Bernie wasn&#39;t totally anti-gun, because he knew that would weaken the people&#39;s defenses a bit?</p>

<p>I never really hear that many stories about outside city areas having lots of gun crime, it
seems to be more &quot;gangstaaaa&quot; inhabited city areas and police brutality. (I could be wrong though.)
 Guns are really shitty, but if we&#39;re going to get rid of them, we shouldn&#39;t
get rid of them totally until this shit establishment fucks off to hell.
But maybe I&#39;ve fallen for NRA propaganda, not sure.</p>

<p>I feel like we&#39;re already in NWO waters. For thousands of years,
humanity has been under imperialistic control, generic slavery, economic slavery, etc.</p>

<p>But I think the NWO plan is a whole other level.
 They&#39;re probably slowly taking away our freedoms so we don&#39;t notice and then before we know it,
 we&#39;ll be in a cashless society, as slaves under a global one world government, being denied money/resources unless we stand in line, etc. maybe even more sinister than that if they really are satanist/luciferian nuts and want to cut the population down to 10% or whatever. It&#39;s already a hell hole and they want it to become even worse for some reason. </p>

<p>Unless we&#39;re vigilant and start waking more people up. Eventually there will be an uprising of the commoners against the parasitic elite.
 The political left vs right divide however, is pretty damn annoying but we can still work with the trumper people if we just have a non-partisan, non-left/right focus and just look at things from a US vs the elite perspective.
The mainstream media needs to die. They stabbed the people in the back for money,
they can go to hell for all I care. </p>

<p>And finally, there&#39;s a possibility that Russia/Putin is the &quot;opposing force&quot; against the NWO
BUT it&#39;s possible that he&#39;s not as benevolent as he acts in public. He could be a lesser evil or he could be a full on actor and the east/west power struggle is just an illusion....I don&#39;t know.
 I hope Putin is on our side but I don&#39;t think all the &quot;he assassinates people like journalists&quot; stories aren&#39;t completely false propaganda....maybe he only kills assassins that pretend to be journalists?
I don&#39;t know enough of Putin to tell how good/bad he is. I don&#39;t necessarily trust him but I sure as heck don&#39;t trust the western governments. Some conspiracy website I read, claims
the NWO plan involves Putin will implement &quot;BRICS&quot; as a false alternative to the NWO but actually
just a trap into the same thing. The website author could have just guessed wrong or be a propagandist liar. I don&#39;t know, but we have to take all possibilities into account.
 Whether there is a east/west illusion or not, we have to question everyone&#39;s actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about timing. The &#39;big event&#39; hasn&#39;t happened simply because it&#39;s not time yet. This year, however, you will see all the pieces fall into place and the gears will start to turn. Everything before was nothing more than preparation, a staging process of sorts. There is evidence for this and if you would like I can share.</p>
