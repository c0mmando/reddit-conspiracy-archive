<p>The Snapple fact said &quot;Antarctica holds 90% of the worlds fresh water&quot;</p>

<p>With companies like Nestle trying to privatize fresh water, do you think this has anything to do with the sketchiness surrounding it? </p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts guys I just found it odd when I connected the posts with it </p>

It was triggered because news got out that both John Kerry and Buzz Aldrin were recently in Antarctica for unspecified reasons and Buzz was air-lifted out due to medical reasons.  Beyond that it&#39;s a lot of pointing to weird Google maps images showing what could either be an alien space ship or a shadow.  Hard to tell.  </p>

Obviously I&#39;ve learned that sometimes things are just bullshit, sometimes things are real, there is plenty of proof of loads of legit conspiracies that I do believe in but for everyone of those there are dozens have shitty evidence and are usually the source and their supporters just confirming their biases against whomever the theories revolve around you can&#39;t just take things for granted, you have to have evidence, you have to prove your case, especially to someone like myself. Like Fox Mulder I want to believe, but just like Fox Mulder, regardless of your initial belief things need to be investigated. </p>

<p>My best guess for the &quot;sketchiness&quot; surrounding Antarctica is that the US and other governments are working to create a moving documentary that shows global warming melting glaciers and such.  Sort of a hail mary pass now that we are nearly past the point of no return.  Bring down some popular celebrities and politicians &quot;to the scene of the crime&quot; and get them to speak-out on how important it is.  </p>
