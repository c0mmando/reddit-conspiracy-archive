<p>I have been seeing this, too! I feel like I&#39;m not taking crazy pills now that others are seeing it. There has been some changing of the script here, en masse. The discussions and learning from one another, has devolved in to &quot;right and wrong&quot; only. </p>

<p>Something is going on. Lots of insta-downvotes right out of the gates of new submissions, lots of high upvotes for political issues. Definitely seeing a strange trend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to keep pressing on, doing my thing. Linking and sharing information and weird happenings. This site may or may not be in its death throes, it&#39;s not the same as it was a year ago.... even last month, for that matter.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant in your pursuits of knowledge and learning and remember, it&#39;s just fake internet points. There are those here that are paid to provide false information (TONS of misinformation and disinformation!!) and bots doing work. Can I prove it? No. Does it look pretty freaking obvious, well we can see for ourselves right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a concerted and long term effort to undermine free thinkers. What you tuned into is one aspect.</p>

<p>The Fake News movement is another.</p>

<p>The essence of all the pieces is meant to undermine all people in the USA, to provide an avenue for opposition (Russia, I believe) to sow discord among Americans. The first goal was easily won, the election of Trump who is a puppet, possibly unwittingly, of Putin.</p>

<p>The ongoing efforts will continue. Right now I doubt they know or even have planned any ultimate endgame. But as long as they continue the effort successfully, they will later find uses for it all.</p>

<p>It is really disheartening for those of us who maintained a healthy distrust. All of our fears are being realized, right in front of everyone and all of our warning calls have been for nothing.</p>

<p>Many, or most, Americans would shudder if we believed that our nation was being influenced.</p>

<p>And it is, but too many of us do not see this truth. Instead, many of us decided to, based on lies and propaganda, to decide the Russian view was more reliable. And it only took a couple months.</p>

<p>I am in mourning. Our free thinkers have decided to let someone else think for them.</p>

<p>This sub has <em>always</em> had a lot of Nazi-sympathizing posts. Not that I agree with it, but the &quot;Jews run the world&quot; conspiracy is one of the oldest not just in this sub but in the conspiracy world in general. If you&#39;re saying you didn&#39;t notice this before the election, I&#39;d have to say then that you must not have been very observant. If anything, the recent spate of posts driven by current political developments (regardless of how you feel about that trend) has diluted the concentration of Nazi sympathizing posts (but also of lizard people posts, UFO posts, flat earth posts, etc.)</p>

<p>What specific conspiracy are you referring to here, that is being denied? Maybe people see things differently. This comment space affords us an opportunity of hashing out the arguments, and readers can decide what to think based on the quality of those arguments (and up or downvote as they see fit). But to see whether your concern has any merit, you&#39;d first need to name what it is you think &quot;this sub&quot; is collectively and unjustly denying.</p>

<p>Well, every conspiracy made by the left wing like russia hacking the election. Or rather: everything that has to do with Putin/Trump. I wouldn&#39;t mind if they would do this, but on the other hand, they are supporting pizza gate. If you think pizzagate is true or not, you wont find anyone successfully denying pizzagate here.  </p>

<p>I think a major evidece that this is true, is that only posts are getting insane, while the coment-section stays very critical. That confuses me very much, maybe their bots (if they exist) don&#39;t go to the comment-section?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m definitely someone who is skeptical of that claim, so I can respond. I&#39;ll skip the details of why I&#39;m skeptical—check my post history to see a recent comment on that. Instead, I&#39;ll address your broader concern here by pointing out two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The source of the claims of Russian hacking is the CIA and the White House, and I think you should be surprised that people on this sub are skeptical of these sources&#39; motivations for making the claims. The fact the senators McCain and Graham are blowing the trumpet loudest against Russia is a sign, if you know anything about those two, that a rapprochement between the US and Russia <em>is a good thing</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people on this sub who are actually into conspiracies (and not shills or mere passersby) believe in some form of the NWO conspiracy. Whether they believe the ultimate puppet-masters to be the Illuminati, the Jews, the Catholic Church, or reptilians, those who believe there is a conspiracy to make a one world government controlled by an elite class of parasites might naturally be inspired by the election of Trump because it at least <em>seems</em> to frustrate their ambitions. From this perspective, an alliance with Russia actually offers <em>hope</em>, not worry, because Russia also seems to be working against the plans of the global elite.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I will not commit to a firm conclusion there, since it is at least possible that Trump is also merely playing a part in bringing the NWO to fruition. For example, he may crash the American economy, thereby bringing the reputation of resurgent nationalist movements into discredit. And he may be knowingly playing that role, or perhaps he is unaware that though he has been handed the reins the system crash to come is inevitable.</p>

<p>However, that is just speculation. The desperation exhibited by the mainstream media in its coverage of Trump is at least a clue that his election represents something that the global elite definitely did not want. That doesn&#39;t mean Trump&#39;s politics are suddenly more agreeable, but naturally in the conspiracy sub people are more concerned about what is happening behind the curtain, and less concerned about the superficial 2-dimensional political policy space.</p>
