<p>Instead of trying to regain their journalistic integrity, they start spewing the fake news story.</p>

<p>But the timing is too coincidental. It started right when Pizzagate hit, and it is directly aimed at online alternative media and the stories they publish (and sometimes directly citing Pizzagate).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the Fox News organization, but the millions of people who watch Fox News would have been ready-made to understand this and understand its validity....they already believe the government is corrupt and distrust the media (other than Fox News of course).</p>

<p>The was sheer awful msm strategery and smoke and mirrors.  When Fox  -- read Megyn Kelly -- through in their non-debunked-debunking -- the mushroom cloud of truth that was building really took a hit.</p>

You&#39;re shaming tactics have no effect here. I don&#39;t care to argure issues with you shills and I never will, that&#39;s not the point. The point is to make sure that other people reading this exchange can clearly see how each response you have authored me includes one well established shilling technique or another. As you all can see, this time he tried the conspiracy theorist shaming method to discredit me instead of using facts. They can&#39;t use facts and will always strive to shame, censor, and confuse because they are ultimately wrong and the facts are going to be the end of them, thank you for helping provide examples </p>

Except, the Denver Guardian turned out to be a wordpress site that a democrat from california bought.

<p>&quot;The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction.&quot;</p>

<p>He said it was intially just a way to poke fun at republicans and prove they would believe anything. And then, it took off and other websites started following the same trend to make ad money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fake news&quot; has never been around. It does not exist. Propaganda exists. Saying &quot;Fake news has been around for a long time&quot; is like saying &quot;The McDonald&#39;s Big Mac has been around since hamburgers were invented&quot; (but at least the Big Mac is real)</p>

<p>You&#39;re accepting the term as being something meaningful, which is the whole point of them pushing it. They need something that resonates and they&#39;re banking on people not being smart enough, quite frankly, to use more sophisticated and less &quot;ball of mud&quot; type terms like propaganda, rumors, slander, lies, tabloids, etc.</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is something a 1st grader would find meaningful, simply because they don&#39;t have the vocabulary to express themselves in a more direct and useful way to adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started with news that Google was going to de-list &quot;fake news&quot; web sites, which Google rather specifically defined as news sites which misrepresent who they are, e.g. claiming to be FOX News when not FOX News.  This is a rather narrow definition, and it doesn&#39;t include most alternative news sources, as they claim to be only themselves and so they&#39;re OK in Google&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>However, never missing an opportunity to misunderstand, the alternative news sites, specifically the ones which distort reality to make it more interesting to their readers, distorted this story as Google wanting to de-list them.  This brought the term &quot;fake news&quot; into everyone&#39;s mind, but without the definition Google had given it, but instead the &quot;who gets to decide which news is fake news?&quot; lack of definition that the scummy alternative media sites had given it.</p>

<p>This all prompted a lot of discussion which ensured that &quot;fake news&quot; became a part of everyone&#39;s vocabulary, and since it entered without a proper definition, everyone basically made up their own:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Google thinks &quot;fake news&quot; is news from web sites that lie about who they are, regardless of the content of their news stories.</p></li>
<li><p>The MSM thinks &quot;fake news&quot; is any news from alternative media which doesn&#39;t agree with what the MSM is saying.</p></li>
<li><p>The government thinks &quot;fake news&quot; is Russian propaganda and Wikileaks.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> crowd thinks &quot;fake news&quot; is the truth that the government wants to silence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So &quot;fake news&quot; is just a really popular meme.  I think a lot of that comes from the fact that it isn&#39;t well-defined, and so everyone can basically assume it means whatever they want it to mean, and thus assume everyone is talking about what they want to talk about.</p>

Everything from Russians &quot;hacking&quot;, to DNC screwing Bernie, to Podesta playing dominoes on &quot;pasta&quot;, to CP, and a pizza parlor - possible shadow front. I see it as the Western Cabal trying to control something they cannot completely control, the Great Awakening/Unveiling, which was the End of the Mayan Calendar... Not a destruction of the world, per se, just humanities veil of reality of the world, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks leaked the Podesta emails etc.  which further exposed the Hillary campaign as corrupt at many levels,  exposed the corporate fake news,  and created the form PG has recently taken.</p>

<p>Out of those leaks,   came PG,  the attack on PG,  and the attack on independent news.</p>

<p>However,  just as the current elite would have preferred other than Trump,  would have preferred other than the current situation in Syria,  etc.   it would have preferred not to have its lies and propaganda exposed.   Fake has backfired on the elite,  as they have no credibility at all.    Yet the elite will continue to try to save face and try to execute their criminal,   corrupt,  and treasonous agendas.    And don&#39;t get me wrong,  they will use Trump,  he is one of their own.</p>

<p>PG will eventually be a footnote to a much broader and longer lasting exposure of perversion in Washington DC,  yet to be properly documented.   I doubt anyone will be investigated for PG in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Operation &#39;Fake News&#39; was launched right as people began noticing Podesta&#39;s leaked emails. The repeating use of the term is a simple deflection tactic, an intentional psi-op. Just as the term &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; became a deflection tactic.</p>

<p>The Russian-blaming was kicked up to further distract people from the content of the emails. It&#39;s possible that they&#39;re also prepared to blame Russian hacking for any pedophilia-related digital evidence found in investigations against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CTR began to be all over r/pol about 1 month before the elections. That&#39;s about making everything discredit Trump moreso than electing Hillary, because they knew they won&#39;t be able to make non-Hillary voters believe anything non-corrupt connected to her. The best way to make the pill pass was basically to make her the least bad choice. It&#39;s about the same time pizzagate happened. But I am pretty sure it started with CTR, then anti-pizzagate propaganda started a bit afterwards as it began trending on Twitter. CTR owner is elephantis&#39; boyfriend so really no surprise there. In fact, <em>it is</em> how we connected the pedosta emails to Hillary to CTR to comet ping pong. That&#39;s how they got on the radar, the initial connection. It probably would not have happened without this link. So anyway, all of this to say it didn&#39;t start with pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Around that time but there are signs of preparations for censorship that also launched at that time but must have been worked on well before that. One example:around September mozilla default settings in security changed to block dangerous and DECEPTIVE content. This is/was new and to uncheck it you have to expose your computer to other scary things (that are most probably bullshit) to keep users from unchecking. How much they are already blocking is unclear, but alt news website have been reporting sinking traffic and it is clear that they can, at anytime, block much more with this in place. Uncheck it and if your using google, chrome or fakebook or yahoo  etc. there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s  at least as bad. I now only use linux and  TOR and it seems nothing is blocked but can&#39;t confirm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The term and concept has been around forever, and had a heavy focus in the past year or two. Some of this was to do with &quot;sponsored content&quot; and advertising disguised as news, but there was also the rise of sites peddling bullshit that tried to look like legitimate sources (either completely, or legit sounding names).</p>

<p>It became a much bigger deal during and after the election because there were loads of people trying to capitalise on the interest for ad revenue and/or political reasons since everyone just likes/shares without thinking.</p>

<p>Obviously when the election had a surprise result this became a focal point and a topic of ongoing interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Did this whole fake news thing started happening right with pizzagate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>basically, yes.</p>

<p>it started when HRC began to warn people that there would some real &quot;whoppers&quot; coming out of wikileaks over the coming months.</p>

<p>basically, HRC started defining wikileaks as a liar.  and that any &quot;news&quot; from wikileaks was lies.</p>

<p>but the #pizzagate wave but it over the top... suddenly that was all &quot;fake news&quot; (generally categorized)... wikileaks, blogs, facebook, anything that was not main stream to be &quot;fake&quot;.</p>

<p>.#pizzagate was absolutely the final straw that triggered the &quot;fake news&quot; narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The meme was started by Politifact before pizzagate but it wasn&#39;t mainstream. It was a buzzword they used occasionally. It wasn&#39;t until the Washington Post forced it into a news context when they reported on the gun incident at Comet Ping Pong, like &quot;as a result of a fake news story,&quot; that your typical copycat journalists jumped on it.</p>

<p>So while it did have some traction before pizzagate, until that Washington Post article it was almost entirely limited to left-leaning &quot;fact-check&quot; groups and was used in an editorialized way, as sort of a trademark to drum up views for their articles.</p>

<p>Given these media organizations like Politifact were in talks with major players like Facebook to sell them their fact-checking services at the same time as pizzagate, it makes sense that they and their clients would try to push the &quot;fake news&quot; meme when they got the chance.</p>

<p>It was because they were forced to report on it and didn&#39;t have any capacity to investigate that they adopted Politifact&#39;s term (via the Washington Post) to dismiss it.</p>

<p>Pizzagate started early November.

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. While following pizzagate&#39;s development here, which came almost pre-packaged with the Marina Abramovich dinner blood rituals thing (early November, funny time to up the ante on such things isn&#39;t it), the first mention of &quot;Fake News&quot; I heard was on NPR, they were equating the term to clearly designed false &quot;breaking news&quot; such as &quot;The Pope now supports Trump!&quot; and others, mostly (I assume) the products of Macedonian teenagers and maybe Americans as well. Such sites seem designed to be shared, the kind of stuff undiscerning readers might Share on facebook before reading the article, checking references, etc. Those early examples were spread and spread and spread, all since debunked. </p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; was applied by the MSM upon pizzagate&#39;s proliferation-- they could have called it rumor, conspiracy theory, but doing so allows for the possibility that it MIGHT be true, and as the concept is based entirely in innuendo and interpretation (as opposed to real, hard, persecutable evidence and smoking gun) as well as widespread distrust of big media, government, and elites in general, it was officially called Fake. </p>

<p>That proponents of pizzagate (and foxnews etc) have launched a counter-campaign in which everything critical of Trump and/or Russia is labeled as &quot;fake news&quot; is not surprising. The term is elastic and was not well defined from the start, and can be applied to label anything you don&#39;t like as unfounded propaganda. Both sides of things have used it willy nilly so far, and truth has been thrown out the window. </p>

<p>I would like to see some catalog of &quot;stories&quot; that have so far been given the label Fake News. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>read the definition of a straw man argument. Did I ever once defend pedophiles? no. Did I ever once say we shouldn&#39;t go after pedophiles? no. Did I say that there is no child sex ring in the basement of a DC pizza parlor based off Alex Jones-esque fabrication? yes. There&#39;s a difference. Just because I don&#39;t believe in pizza gate doesnt mean I love pedophiles, thats the exact kind of black and white thinking republican elites want you to engage in. </p>
