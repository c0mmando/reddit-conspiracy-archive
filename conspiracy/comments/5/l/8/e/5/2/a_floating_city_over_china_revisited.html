       China 2015:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fP2csFr.jpg">

      </p>

       So, I know at this point a TON of people have decided this was either the result of 'Project Blue Beam', parallel universes opening up or, surprisingly less believable, a mirage. The sheer height of the 'mirage' is enough to raise questions. What makes it more interesting is the fact that around the same time in 2015 a similar image appeared over the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       See here:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/a2Rynce.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also an additional sighting in California, USA. However, the evidence against the California sighting outweighs the evidence for it. So, I have decided to exclude this from my research.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the story from the UK broke a few weeks after the china one, I had an epiphany.. Hy-Brasil..
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil_(mythical_island)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil_(mythical_island)
       </a>
       Funny enough, the floating city of the UK appeared over the Atlantic to the west.. the same place all those old maps placed hy-brasil. Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       it seemed I was on to something but after a few weeks with no new evidence, I had put this event on the back-burners of my mind. months and months went by with no new break in sight.
That is until, one day, I decided to look at the Denver International Airport paintings again. Nothing from my research led me there, I just realized my thought process and knowledge of symbology had evolved since the last time I looked at them and decided to, again, try my luck at deciphering them. If only you could have seen my face when I realized there was a floating city in one of the Murals..
      </p>
      <p>
       See here:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3jit8Vt.jpg">
        http://i.imgur.com/3jit8Vt.jpg
       </a>
       I laughed to myself for close to a week...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was consulting a friend about what I had learned and he started crying.. He is very religious and follows prophecy very diligently. It seems this floating city appears in the bible as well.. In the very end of revelations there is a place called New Jerusalem.. I honestly do not know what this all means, which I why I brought what i have learned to you..
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I wrote this in a hurried excitement, do not be to harsh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also, I may be wrong but the only way that this 'mirage' could appear over 2 cities on opposite sides of the earth is if we did indeed live on a flat plain. if we live on a globe, this city would have to be in space, high above the north pole, in order for it to project such an image at drastic angles

       Wow I can't get over this find, this is great op! I would have never made the connection even though I've studied Denver airport and the floating city thing for quite sometime, just never together! Spreading it like wildfire.

       The
       <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/hopi2.html">
        9 signs
       </a>
       of the Hopi Prophecies:
      </p>
      <p>
       (I always thought that the city in the sky was the ISS and it would fall from an EMP)
      </p>
      <p>
       "My people await Pahana, the lost White Brother, [from the stars] as do all our brothers in the land. He will not be like the white men we know now, who are cruel and greedy. we were told of their coming long ago. But still we await Pahana.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He will bring with him the symbols, and the missing piece of that sacred tablet now kept by the elders, given to him when he left, that shall identify him as our True White Brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Fourth World shall end soon, and the Fifth World will begin. This the elders everywhere know. The Signs over many years have been fulfilled, and so few are left.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the First Sign: We are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana men who took the land that was not theirs. And men who struck their enemies with thunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Second Sign: Our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes -- the white men bringing their families in wagons across the prairies."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Third Sign: A strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These White Feather saw with his eyes -- the coming of the white men's cattle."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Fourth Sign: The land will be crossed by snakes of iron."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Fifth Sign: The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider's web."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Sixth sign: The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Seventh Sign: You will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the Eight Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And this is the Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.
      </p>
      <p>
       "These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock to and fro. The white man will battle against other people in other lands -- with those who possessed the first light of wisdom. There will be many columns of smoke and fire such as White Feather has seen the white man make in the deserts not far from here. Only those which come will cause disease and a great dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Many of my people, understanding the prophecies, shall be safe. Those who stay and live in the places of my people also shall be safe. Then there will be much to rebuild. And soon -- very soon afterward -- Pahana will return. He shall bring with him the dawn of the Fifth World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their hearts. Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall smooth the way to the Emergence into the Fifth World.

       Have you seen the Chinese space station, Tiangong-1? It's set to fall back to earth in the latter part of 2017. Tiangong translates to 'heavenly palace'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting mainly because it coincides with other events that seem to mark the beginning of other prophecy. The name translation is a big plus though.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Heavenly Palace': 2nd 1/2 of 2017
Full solar eclipse: August 2017
Revelation 12 sign: September 2017
Daniels 70 weeks: 1947(Israel became a nation)-2017

       I can't stand him either but he does present arguments of media-magic I cannot account for. Mainly because I did not see the city myself. But with the evidence I have found outside of that singular event that he explained away, I feel it merits further investigation.

       In the Mahabharata there are stories about Hiran Yapura, a floating city of gold. I wonder if there's a relationship here? Also, I'm more inclined to believe that the flying city is moving than that the Earth is flat. Just some food for thought, lol

       One photo in China, one in the UK, a nebulous link to mythology, and a heaping of wishful thinking.

       In China
       <strong>
        everyone
       </strong>
       has a smart phone. If a floating city were spotted over a Chinese city, the internet would be flooded with photos and video.
