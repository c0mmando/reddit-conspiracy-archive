    <div class="md"><p>Try and let us know. Protip though, saying Zionist Jews with other stupid shit with make readers roll their eyes. You should compare an contrtast, with history, and power behind said group.I see this many times, even on here... Yes, some elites are Zionist Jews, but are they really, and who do they work fore? Give history. People truly love history and a tale, especially one that contains lots of nuggets of info/truth. It&#39;s not &quot;Zionist Jews Rule world!!!!&quot;, they are but a cog to a bigger machine, imo. Make sense? Hope it does... My two cents, anyways...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I prefer David Icke&#39;s &quot;Rothschild Zionist&quot; term.  It removes the hint of antisemitism and makes it more historically accurate.  jacob Rothschild <em>himself</em> tried to sue a British newspaper who said his family &quot;funded every war since Napoleon&quot; and he <em>LOST</em> because the judge found that statement true.  So yes, it is legal British precedent that the Rothschilds are Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve recently <em>really</em> really cracked down on this site and &quot;fake news&quot; etc. You may be shadowbanned, they may also have altered your site in ways that you cannot see (filters and such, behind the curtain)</p>

<p>I have read a few bits and pieces here on r/conspiracy lately that have stated as such about the crackdowns. The israeli and Palestinian conflict has set fires on that site (remember this is a business for them) and they are in damage control mode. They have to make that almighty dollar! The reality doesn&#39;t matter, the &quot;invisible feel good happiness&quot; and money, do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need to shadowban, as Facebook&#39;s default sort order for your newsfeed has never shown you all of your friend&#39;s posts in the order that they posted them.  That&#39;s how they make money.  If Pepsi pays Facebook, then every time one of your friends mentions Pepsi in a positive light, you&#39;ll be more likely to see that post, and if they mention Pepsi in a negative light, you&#39;ll be less likely to see that post.  The post is always there if you go look at your friend&#39;s feed, but most people don&#39;t do that, and instead only look at what shows up in their newsfeed.  So they can easily censor stuff without technically censoring it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Use TOR, and create several fake fakebook accounts. Log into each account after you have switches IPs on TOR. Comment on your original account with the fake accounts, and see what happens. </p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t expand your screen, so fakebook&#39;s security algorithm won&#39;t identity you as the same location. </p>

<p>Easy as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck Facebook. I deleted Facebook account and got rid of both fb and Google off my phone because I got sick of their constant relentlessness in regards to getting more personal information from me. &quot;where do you work? Who&#39;s your family? Where do you live? Do you want to post a video live and show everyone who and where you are?&quot;<br/>
Just fuck off. I haven&#39;t given Facebook any real information in at least a year (fake job, age, etc) and with the Snoopers Charter passing just yesterday here in the UK I thought I&#39;d duck out the way of the government&#39;s mass surveillance as much as I can and as soon as I can.  </p>

<p>No human intervention so far (although some domains might be banned due to recent concern about the impact of fake news on the US election). this is called the edgerank algorythm<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdgeRank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdgeRank</a> </p>

<p>My guess is that you have been sharing uninteresting or eye rolling conspiracy news a lot recently. </p>

<p>Try your best sharing interesting stories, create few fake account to like reshare and comment them and to avoid getting some stories from banned domains just copy and paste the whole article in a status instead of sharing a link. </p>

<p>That should greatly improve the reach of your propaganda campaign against Zionist Jews...</p>
