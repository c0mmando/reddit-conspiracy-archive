<p>Dr. Lasha Darkmoon
“I don’t care if Americans think we’re running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government,” Jewish columnist Joel Stein wrote in the Los Angeles Times in December 2008. “I just care that we get to keep running them.”</p>

<p>Mr Stein’s reckless candor in admitting that the Jews ran America was to cost him his job at the LA Times.</p>

<p>If Americans have lost their country to organized Jewry, they lost it slowly and imperceptibly. Indeed, most Americans remain unaware that their country no longer belongs to them. They fervently believe they still live in a democracy. This was a takeover not without precedent, however. It had happened to Germany. It had happened to Russia. It has now happened to America.</p>

<p>Take Germany and Russia.</p>

<p>Germany, a mere shadow of what it might have been, is now a defeated and demoralized nation, thoroughly browbeaten by Jewry and terrified of their masters in Israel. Without stretching it too far, one could say that Germany has become Israel’s cash cow.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly controversial about this observation. It had occurred to Eustace Mullins over twenty years ago:</p>

<p>To finance the State of Israel, which was created as a direct result of the Jewish victory over the Christian nations in World War II, Jews…now imposed enormous “reparations” demands on the conquered German people.</p>

<p>To date, they have extorted more than thirty-five billion dollars from German workers, money which has been collected at the points of bayonets, not Jewish bayonets but the bayonets of the American Army, which has been maintained as an occupying force in West Germany for nearly four decades, solely to provide military power behind the puppet German Government which has as its primary function the furnishing of money for the parasitic state of Israel. (See here)</p>

<p>In December 2009, the Israelis demanded another billion euros from Germany ($1.4 billion). The survivors of the Holocaust, surprisingly, seem to increase in number with time. This prompted Norman Finkelstein’s mother to ask somewhat cynically, after she had been cheated out of her reparations money by the rabbis who administered the Holocaust Fund: “If everyone who claims to be a survivor actually is one, who did Hitler kill?”</p>

<p>Mullins is not exaggerating when he says that the American troops foisted on Germany after World War II were in fact an “occupying force”: an army moreover acting on behalf, and at the behest, of organized Jewry.</p>

<p>It was the Morgenthau Plan, specifically designed by the vengeful Henry Morgenthau as a collective punishment against the German people for the crimes of Hitler, that was to turn post-war Germany into “the largest concentration camp on earth.”</p>

<p>As late as 1991, German chancellors were still being forced, like enslaved vassals under the Roman Empire, to sign an “act of submission” to their Allied conquerors.</p>

<p>“The Jew Morgenthau wants to turn Germany into a giant potato patch,” Goebbels complained bitterly. He was right. Anti-Semites sometimes are.</p>

<p>Russia too, like Germany, was to fall under Jewish domination.</p>

<p>According to Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago, 66 million Russian Christians were put to death on the orders of the Cheka or Russian secret police. Those devising the tortures, and giving the orders to rape and kill ethnic Russians, were mostly Jews.</p>

<p>Yuri Slezkine’s candid quote from historian Leonard Shapiro is too well known to be casually dismissed: “Anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with and possibly shot by a Jewish investigator.”</p>

<p>Out of 388 members of the new revolutionary government in Russia, only sixteen were real Russians. “Apart from one negro,” we are told, “the rest were Jews.”</p>

<p>These revolutionaries did their best to hide their Jewish identities by taking new names. Lenin was originally Ulyanov, Trotsky was Bronstein, Zinoviev was Apfelbaum, Sverdlov was Solomon, Zinoviev was Radomyslsky, Radek was Sobelsohn, Litvonov was Wallach, Kamenev was Rosenfeld, Parvus was Helphand, Martov was Zederbaum, Bohrin was Nathanson. Not one of these Jewish revolutionaries was prepared to go under his own name or be identified as a Jew. Under Stalin, merely to draw attention to the fact that unpopular officials were Jewish was to incur the death penalty.</p>

<p>Another interesting titbit of information that court historians prefer not to mention is this: many of the Jews propping up the new Bolshevik government, happy to issue instructions for the torture and execution of Russian Christians, were actually Jews who had been shipped in from the East Side of New York.</p>

<p>No surprise here. After all, the man who helped to finance the Russian Revolution from his base in Wall Street—to the tune of $20 million—was Jewish American banker Jacob Schiff.</p>

<p>A well-known French journal, L’Illustration, had this to say in its edition of September 14, 1918:</p>

<p>When one comes in contact with the functionaries serving in the Bolshevik Government, one feature strikes the attention: almost all of them are Jews. I am not at all anti-Semitic, but I must state what strikes the eye. Everywhere—in Petrograd, in Moscow, in provincial districts, in commissariats, in district offices, in Smolny, in the Soviets—I have met nothing but Jews and again Jews.</p>

<p>Germany…Russia…America. They all fell under Jewish hegemony. They had their hour in the sun, and then they had their eclipse.
It’s now America’s turn.</p>

<p>“Once we squeeze all we can out of the United States, it can dry up and blow away.” — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 2002. (Widely reported, see here)</p>

<p>Israel, America’s albatross</p>

<p>In Part 1 of my article, Goodbye, America,
I discussed the problems facing America today and suggested that they are far more serious than those facing National Socialist Germany in the 1930s. Of the seven problems I listed, the four most intractable ones are these:</p>

<p>(1) The nuclear-armed state of Israel and its Samson Option, neither of which existed as threats to peace before the establishment of the Zionist state in the wake of WW-2.</p>

<p>(2) The presence of 60 million Christian Zionists in America who are hand in glove with our new Masters, aiding and abetting them in their violation of international law and the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>(3) The existence of a tentacular network of Jewish organizations in America, such as the ADL and AIPAC, holding the entire country to ransom; specifically, its mercenary and morally bankrupt politicans.</p>

<p>(4) The lethal weapon of multiculturalism, a weapon unavailable for use against either Germany or Russia but now deployed to devastating effect against America’s Euro-American majority. “Global elites view the White Western world as the main obstacle standing in the way of a future world government,” Pat Buchanan is widely reported to have said in a 2004 speech. “Multiculturalism is a tool used by such elites to dismantle White Western civilization.”</p>

<p>Given that the Jews managed to achieve almost complete control of Germany and Russia even before the foundation of the Jewish state in 1948, it must surely be obvious that their executive power has increased exponentially with the acquisition of a military base in the Middle East, armed to the teeth with the deadliest nuclear warheads, many of these aimed at European capitals and some of them probably at the United States. It would be foolish to think that a country that killed Americans in cold blood in the USS Liberty attack of 1967, would have any scruples about doing so on a much vaster scale if ever America became the object of their hatred.</p>

<p>It is important at his point to consider the hidden facts surrounding the foundation of the state of Israel, if only because this will help us to get a better perspective of the Jewish problem.</p>

<p>The Jews were given Israel on the tacit understanding that most of them would go and live there, leaving the rest of the world Judenfrei or Jew-free. They reneged on their collective promise however—made implicitly on their behalf by their then leaders Theodor Hertzl and Chaim Weizmann—and they prefer now to regard Israel as a second home and place of refuge if things get too hot for them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Israel’s first president, Chaim Weizmann, wrote in his memoirs:</p>

<p>Whenever the quantity of Jews in any country reaches the saturation point, that country reacts against them. [This] reaction…cannot be looked upon as anti-Semitism in the ordinary or vulgar sense of that word; it is a universal social and economic concomitant of Jewish immigration, and we cannot shake it off. — Chaim Weizmann, Trial and Error (1949). Quoted in Albert S. Lindemann’s The Jew Accused, 1991 (p. 277).</p>

<p>Herzl himself had made the same point much earlier. Anti-Semitism, he wrote, is “an understandable reaction to Jewish defects.” And in his diary he added: “I find the anti-Semites are fully within their rights.” (See here)</p>

<p>Having been given a homeland on the tacit understanding that they had to go and live there, the Jews were clearly under an obligation to do so. The object of the exercise is otherwise defeated. So why is it that 58 percent of the world’s 14 million Jews now live in America and Europe and only 37 percent in Israel? It certainly needs to be asked: why were the Palestinians expelled from their own country in order to accommodate another people who mostly choose to live elsewhere?
“Nothing here in America compares to the horrors of Palestine…Women are raped by Israeli military officials….Palestinian children are doused with gasoline and set on fire for the amusement of the IDF.” — Jonathan Azaziah, Mizrahi American Jew</p>

<p>It is almost universally believed, thanks to Jewish ownership of the mass media, that the UN created Israel and that everyone was delighted when this happened. This is demonstrably false. Even the US government—or 99 percent of it—was adamantly opposed to the foundation of Israel. Indeed, former Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson was one of many who raised strenuous objections to America recognizing the Jewish state, predicting that “the West would pay a high price for Israel.” In spite of all these misgivings, the Jews got their state.</p>

<p>In reality [Alison Weir notes] while the UN General Assembly recommended the creation of a Jewish state in part of Palestine, that recommendation was non-binding and never implemented by the Security Council.</p>

<p>Second, the General Assembly passed that recommendation only after Israel proponents threatened and bribed numerous countries in order to gain a required two-thirds of votes.</p>

<p>Third, the US administration supported the recommendation out of domestic electoral considerations, and took this position over the strenuous objections of the State Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Despite the shallow patina of legality its partisans extracted from the General Assembly, Israel was born over the opposition of American experts and of governments around the world, who opposed it on both pragmatic and moral grounds.
(Emphasis added)</p>

<p>Why the Zionist landgrabbers should now be held in such high esteem in America and elsewhere, and their Palestinian victims spat upon and spurned at every opportunity, can be easily explained.</p>

<p>Apart from the Jewish-owned mass media which has managed to glamorize and cast a rose-tinted glow over its Frankenstein monster, the answer lies in one word: Holocaust. The Zionists have managed to convince the world that they are the moral legatees of the victims of the Holocaust. As such, they remain the Ultimate Victims.</p>

<p>Like Finkelstein, we are entitled to express concern over the cheap exploitation of Jewish suffering.</p>

<p>It is an undeniable fact that the Holocaust is a major industry and that it is used as moral blackmail and carte blanche for monstrous crimes.</p>

<p>Israeli writer Ari Shavit summed it up neatly when he said: “We may murder with impunity, because the Holocaust museum is on our side”. The Enemy Within</p>

<p>It can be convincingly argued, with a wealth of supportive quotations, that the presence of Jews in large numbers in any given country has always had catastrophic consequences for that country. (See Weizmann and Herzl quotes above). Organized Jewry has now spread its influence far and wide via the internet, newspapers, magazines and books. Hollywood, its most effective hasbara agent, spreads its poisonous propaganda all over the world, offering the ill-educated masses its lies and distortions and its laissez-faire Freudian sexual morality. Meanwhile the porn industry, dominated by Jews, promotes the demoralization of countless millions, creating sex addicts even out of children and driving many of its victims to despair and suicide.</p>

<p>With the triumph of Jewry comes the subjugation and enslavement of the entire non-Jewish world. Christianity becomes the first casualty, the family unit the second. Homosexuality and radical feminism become more strident in their attitudes and more extreme in their demands, opening up a Pandora’s box of evils: the push to normalize pedophilia, for example, and the systematic corruption of children through the promotion of child porn in the classroom.</p>

<p>We are in a critical situation. It was never Palestine on its own that organized Jewry wanted. Palestine was simply to be their base of operations for the conquest of the rest of the world. According to Israel Shamir:</p>

<p>Palestine is not the ultimate goal of the Jews; the world is. Palestine is just the place for world state headquarters…..The Jews intend to turn Jerusalem into the supreme capital of the world, and its rebuilt temple into the focal point of the Spirit on Earth. Christianity will die, the spirit will depart from the nations in our part of the world, and our present dubious democracy will be supplanted by a vast theocratic state. De-spiritualized and uprooted, homeless and lonely, yesterday’s Masters of the World [WASPs] will become slaves in all but name….</p>

<p>The Jewish universe is good for Jews. It is a curse for others. In the US, as Jewish influence has grown steadily since 1968, the lives of ordinary people have worsened. A good time for the Jews is not a good time for mankind. The blessing of the Jews is a curse for others. The regimes that are “good for Jews” are rarely good for anybody else.</p>

<p>The runes are easy enough to read. From the domination of Germany and Russia, the Jews contrived to leapfrog to the domination of America.</p>

<p>We see through a glass darkly, but what we see through the gathering gloom is the grim specter of an American dystopia: a Third World country hardly worth living in for its rapidly diminishing Euro-American majority.</p>

<p>It costs the American taxpayer $12 million an hour just to keep US troops in Afghanistan, a country America decided to invade on a rollercoaster of neoconservative lies. “The neocons,” Gilad Azmon comments cuttingly in a recent book, “transform the American army into an Israeli mission force.”</p>

<p>Incredibly, America’s closest ally, Israel, has yet to contribute a single soldier to Washington’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nor are American Jews particularly noted for their presence, let alone their heroism, in the fighting forces. And yet they fight with their pens most valiantly, far from the din of battle. It is they who beat the war drums the loudest, who profit most from the wanton slaughter of innocents, and who “get others to fight and die for them.”</p>

<p>The days of wine and roses are over. The American Dream is dead. Like Germany and Russia before it, America lies vanquished.
“The goal for which we have striven so concertedly for three thousand years is at last within our reach. I can safely promise you that our race will soon take its rightful place in the world, with every Jew a king and every Gentile a slave.”</p>

<p>— Rabbi Emmanuel Rabbinovich, speech delivered at a special conference of European rabbis in Budapest, January 12, 1952
Ruled by a Jewish elite and their Shabbat goy underlings, beyond the reach of international law and hated throughout the world, America is now an Israeli colony in all but name.</p>

<p>Part 2 – America Under Jewish Rule</p>

<p>“When the world looks at America, what it sees is an Israeli colony.” — Paul Craig Roberts</p>

<p>America has been taken over.</p>

<p>Slowly and imperceptibly, duped by lies and lulled into complacency, Americans have let their country slip into the hands of a fifth column: of a hostile ethnic elite whose primary allegiance is to Israel, a country built on stolen land and engaged in systematic genocide.</p>

<p>This is the rogue state that is arguably responsible for the greatest mass murder in history: the catastrophe of 9-11. If scientific evidence and forensic logic are anything to go on, Israel has to be suspect number one here, given its unbroken record of terrorism and its endless breaches of international law. Any country that can orchestrate such a spectacular crime and get away with it—while somehow managing to pin the blame on nineteen Arabs with box cutters—is clearly a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>More than 200 senior military, intelligence, and law enforcement officials, including two generals, have now questioned the 9-11 Commission’s report. They have been joined by over 1500 top architects and engineers, 250 pilots and aviation experts, 400 university professors, and 250 survivors and their families. David Ray Griffin, author of eleven books on 9-11 and a distinguished professor emeritus, has concluded definitively: “All the proffered evidence that America was attacked by Muslims on 9-11 appears to have been fabricated.”</p>

<p>Dr Alan Sabrosky, former director of the Army War College, has upped the ante and unequivocally identified Israel as the guilty party. “What we need to stand up and say is not only did they [the Israelis] attack the USS Liberty, but that it is 100 percent certain 9/11 was a Mossad operation.”</p>

<p>Personally, I am not altogether sure about this. That Israel has to be Suspect Number One, given the plethora of suppressed evidence pointing in its direction, is undeniable. Unless there is an impartial investigation led by a panel of experts with no ties to Israel, we can never be sure who committed this monstrous crime.</p>

<p>If any further proof were needed of America’s abject enslavement to Zionist interests, however, it would be Obama’s humiliation at the hands of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this year. This humiliation has occurred on three separate occasions: in September 2009, in July 2010, and again only last May. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank writes almost gloatingly of Obama flying “the white flag of surrender” in the White House—where he sat“routed and humiliated.”</p>

<p>Obama’s offense?</p>

<p>He had asked the Israelis to observe international law by stopping settlement construction on Palestinian land. He had pleaded with them to withdraw to the 1967 borders, in accordance with UN Resolution 242—a reasonable enough request which every American President before him has asked the Israelis to consider in the interests of peace.</p>

<p>The Israeli Prime Minister’s response? — “Israel will NOT return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967!”</p>

<p>So how is it that this rude and recalcitrant “ally” of America still continues to receive its $3 billion a year subsidy? Is America so besotted with love for the Jewish state that it cannot say ‘No’? Silly question. Since it rests on the Chomskyite assumption that America is still the lord and master and little Israel the dependent colony.</p>

<p>The riddle is easily solved if one turns Chomsky’s assumption on its head: organized Jewry, having taken over America, has transformed it into an Israeli colony. The $8.2 million per day that the American taxpayer pays his Jewish master is not a subsidy. It is tribute money. It is a tax or levy imposed on a vanquished people by their conquerors.</p>

<p>Hear the note of contempt for one’s own President in this extraordinary account of Obama’s humiliation at the hands of Netanyahu, his Jewish victor:</p>

<p>Netanyahu beat Obama like a red-headed stepchild; he played him like a fiddle; he pounded him like a big brass drum. The Prime Minister of Israel danced rings around his arrogant, professorial opponent. The Prime Minister mopped the floor with our guy….Bibi ripped him to shreds…demonstrating to the whole world that the Prime Minister of Israel has substantially more support in both the House and the Senate than the President of the United States. [Emphasis added]</p>

<p>I guess that says it all. Poor Obama. He has been symbolically castrated and buried in excrement up to the neck. Those 29 standing ovations Netanyahu received in Congress were equivalent to a lump of spit in the President’s face.
According to political pundit Philip Giraldi, this was “the first time in recorded history that a small nation with less than eight million citizens has subjugated a much larger country with a population of more than 310 million.”</p>

<p>The Zionization of America is complete, with AIPAC appointing the government and 60 million Christian Zionists ready to die for their new masters in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>America is now Israel’s slave.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen a President stand up to them. They always get what they want. If the American people understood what a grip those people have got on our government, they would rise up in arms.” (Admiral Thomas Moorer, former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1983)</p>

<p>At this point I feel the need to apologize for the picture of the finger-wagging rabbi at the end of Part 1 of this essay, together with the inflammatory words he is purported to have uttered about the Jewish desire for world domination. I can hear my critics cry: “Silly airhead, why do you spout all this Protocolian poppycock? Don’t you know the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an anti-Semitic forgery?”</p>

<p>Yes, I confess with a sigh that I have heard the word “forgery” often advanced as a reason not to read this brilliant political treatise, second only to Plato’s Republic in its profundity.</p>

<p>What I am saying, however, has nothing to do with the Protocols.</p>

<p>I am not a conspiracy theorist. I am a historian who is interested only in facts. Truth alone stirs my heart.
Let’s take another quick look at Zionism.</p>

<p>In a recent essay called Why Palestine is Important, Israel Shamir presents a picture that puts this entire Protocolian nonsense into perspective:</p>

<p>Palestine is important because it is believed to be a linchpin of Empire, one of the key points necessary to control the world. Such was the conviction of the 19th century British Empire-builders of the Rhodes variety….Once an arcane theory developed by HJ Mackinder, it has grown up to become a driving force behind globalism …. Mackinder planned the subjugation of the whole planet to the Empire …. Napoleon [had earlier] toyed with the idea of planting Jews in Palestine as France’s foot soldiers, but there were no takers among Jews. The Brits achieved what the French could not.</p>

<p>Zionism, in other words, according to Shamir’s recent take on the subject, was a British inspiration and a tool in the armory of Pax Britannica. It was the way the Brits intended to conquer the world. They would plonk the unwanted Jews in Palestine as their proxies. Israel, in effect, was to be a British colony. And Lord Balfour, when he drew up the famous Balfour Declaration in 1917, had a glint in his beady little eye. He was more interested in advancing the designs of the British Empire than in being nice to the Jews.</p>

<p>If all this is true—and I think it possibly is—we can see what happened next. By 1948 the British Empire had collapsed in ruins. It was no longer in a position to use Israel as its cat’s paw. Another emerging nation however, the chief beneficiary of World War II, certainly was. This was America. Yet even as far back as 1948, America was largely controlled by its Jews. Their influence, though it was to grow by leaps and bounds after 1967, was enormous even in 1948.</p>

<p>It was the Jews who twisted President Truman’s arm and got him to give his full backing to their fledgling state. It was the Jews again, through the vengeful Morgenthau, as I indicated in Part 1 of this essay, who were to make life a living hell for the conquered Germans in the aftermath of World War II. The Jews were always in the background, it seems, the shadowy lurkers in the cabbage patch of history.</p>

<p>The colony that the Brits had failed to acquire in the Middle East, Israel, was inherited by America. So Chomsky was right after all. To start with, anyway. Israel was to be America’s aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The Americans would use it as a gigantic military base from which to plunder Arab oil. Nor would they have any problems with Ben Gurion’s dreams of a Greater Israel stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates. After all, why not give the Jews what they wanted?</p>

<p>Greater Israel was simply to be an extension of America: its fifty-first state.</p>

<p>Things didn’t work out as planned. The best-laid schemes of mice and men, we are told, often go askew. The tables were turned on the simple-minded Americans. The Jews were much smarter than their WASP masters could ever be. They had acquired through three thousand years of bitter experience the arts of duplicity and cunning. Guile was their genetic patrimony. They were the Ultimate Survivors.</p>

<p>One has to hand it to the Jews. The hitherto oppressed decided to become the oppressors. The former victims decided to take on the role of predators. The cat’s paw decided it would rather be the Cat from now on—and it became the Cat’s Pajamas.
In short, the Jews took over America and turned it into a Jewish colony. As simple as that. Their American hosts were hoist with their own petard.</p>

<p>But why worry? American Jews are Americans, are they not? If they’re smart enough to take over America, as they have demonstrably done, why shouldn’t they proceed to the next logical step and take over the world—yes, dominate the world through America? No one denies this is America’s aim: full spectrum dominance. So if the Jews control America, and if America controls the world, doesn’t it follow logically that the Jews control the world? The logic is irrefutable.</p>

<p>Jewish world domination takes on a different perspective when viewed through this historical prism. No “conspiracy theories” here. No hook-nosed Jews grasping the globe in their cruel talons. No Illuminati trying to sodomize your children and drink their blood. Just logic. Just history. Just America striving for full-spectrum dominance with Jews leading the pack.</p>

<p>You could say the wild-eyed dreams of the Protocols have at last been realized, but not in the way their original masterminds intended.</p>

<p>The shape of things to come…?</p>

<p>Allow me now to present the testimony of Eustace Mullins, if only for the vivid pictures he presents to the mind of the terrors endured by millions of Russian Christians in Bolshevik Russia when it was under Jewish hegemony. Could this be the fate of American Christians in the not too distant future?</p>

<p>There are too many well documented massacres in history in which the Jews tortured and murdered their victims with the greatest glee, gloating in such barbaric practices as tearing out the hearts of women and children and smearing the blood on their faces.</p>

<p>The orgy of murder, torture and pillage which followed the Jewish triumph in Russia [after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917] has never been equaled in the history of the world. The Jews were free to indulge their most fervent fantasies of mass murder of helpless victims.</p>

<p>Christians were dragged from their beds, tortured and killed. Some were actually sliced to pieces, bit by bit, while others were branded with hot irons, their eyes poked out to induce unbearable pain.</p>

<p>Others were placed in boxes…then hungry rats placed in the boxes to gnaw upon their bodies. Some were nailed to the ceiling by their fingers or by their feet, and left hanging until they died of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Others were chained to the floor and hot lead poured into their mouths. Many were tied to horses and dragged through the streets of the city, while the mob attacked them with rocks and kicked them to death.</p>

<p>Mothers were taken to the public square and their babies snatched from their arms….the baby [was] tossed into the air while another member of the mob rushed to catch it on the tip of his bayonet.</p>

<p>Pregnant Christian women were chained to trees and their babies cut out of their bodies. (Seehere)</p>

<p>“We should never forget what happened when Jews were a hostile elite in the USSR,” Prof. Kevin MacDonald notes bleakly. “The loathing and contempt for the traditional people and culture of Russia was a major factor in the avid Jewish participation in the greatest crimes of the 20th century.”</p>

<p>MacDonald is referring to the systematic murder of over 50 million Russians under Lenin and Stalin: a period of mass murder spanning 36 years (1917-1953).</p>

<p>The new American elite—as I pointed out in Part 1 of this article, “America as an Israeli Colony”—is a Jewish elite. Exactly like the elite in Bolshevik Russia and Stalin’s USSR. And it is essentially a hostile elite that “loathes the nation it rules.”</p>

<p>So we need to watch out.</p>

<p>Because what happened to millions of Russians in the first half of the 20th century—systematic genocide—could well happen to millions of Americans in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>“It is quite possible,” Kevin MacDonald muses, “that we are entering into a racial dystopia of unimaginable cruelty.”</p>

<p>A game called Survival</p>

<p>The extraordinary success of the Jews, who make up only 2.5 percent of America’s population, can be attributed to meticulous organization, coordination and networking. This advantageous cohesiveness derives from an evolutionary characteristic of the Jews: an exceptionally strong ethnocentricism which has enabled them to infiltrate almost every single organization that could possibly threaten them as a group. In America, highly gifted Jews whose primary loyalty is to Israel have managed to insinuate their way into key policy positions, including the Departments of Treasury and State, the Pentagon, the National Security Council and the White House.</p>

<p>Over the past 24 months not a single policy maker [James Petras tells us]</p>

<p>has voiced any criticism of Israel’s most heinous crimes, ranging from the savaging of Gaza to the massacre of the humanitarian flotilla and the expansion of new settlements in Jerusalem and the West Bank….Many of the leading Zionist policy makers rose to power through a deliberate strategy of infiltrating the government to shape policy promoting Israel’s interest over and above the interests of the US populace.</p>

<p>If the goyim have lost the game of life and their hard-won freedoms to the Jews, it was because they didn’t know they were playing a game in the first place. A game for the highest possible stakes.</p>

<p>A game called Survival.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>The world that awaits us, if our New Masters prevail, will be a grim dystopia. It will be a spiritual wasteland in which an unprincipled elite rides roughshod over the teeming masses. It will be a cruel world of exploitation, moral darkness, and unspeakable brutality.</p>

<p>“Death solves all problems,” Stalin quipped cynically. “No man, no problem.”</p>

<p>When mass extermination becomes the miracle cure, exciting times can be expected.
In Otto Friedrich’s widely acclaimed Holocaust study, The Kingdom of Auschwitz, a concentration camp survivor is quoted as saying:</p>

<p>Concentration camp existence taught us that the whole world is really like a concentration camp. The world is ruled by neither justice nor morality. Crime is not punished nor virtue rewarded. The world is ruled by power. We are laying the foundation for some new, monstrous civilization.</p>

<p>An innocent victim of this “new, monstrous civilization”, a Palestinian child, his arm cut off by an Israeli settler for throwing a stone. (See here)</p>

<p>So this is where we are now: in the eye of the storm.</p>

<p>America, once a democracy, is now a crypto-fascist country ruled by a corporate and cosmopolitan elite. “There is no freedom, no democracy, and no government accountability in Amerika, a fascist state,”</p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts concludes ruefully in one of his recent essays.</p>

<p>The Jews, fulfilling the wildest dreams conjured up in the Protocols, stand surveying the killing fields of the world they have conquered. Iraq and Afghanistan lie in ruins, thanks to their machinations. Iran lies in the cross-hairs, awaiting its expected doom. And meanwhile in America, as the body bags are flown in from foreign parts and the lurid circus of bread and games grinds on relentlessly, there is nothing much to live for except sex and death.</p>

<p>Stalin’s willing executioners, the Jews, are now the ruling elite in America. As in Weimar Germany, the Jews make most of the money and help to create a culture of neo-paganism and nihilism, decadence and despair. Nothing has changed except the country.</p>

<p>Russia, Germany, America — they all went down like skittles in a row.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quote from OP&#39;s offering:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(4) <strong>The lethal weapon of multiculturalism</strong>, a weapon unavailable for use against either Germany or Russia but now deployed to devastating effect against America’s Euro-American majority. “<strong>Global elites view the White Western world as the main obstacle standing in the way of a future world government</strong>,” Pat Buchanan is widely reported to have said in a 2004 speech. “<strong>Multiculturalism is a tool used by such elites to dismantle White Western civilization.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I may, here is a short video clip in which a <em>(lovely and talented!)</em> lady discusses the future of Europe, and how &quot;multiculturalism&quot; will shape that future...</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this video was shot in 2010 - long BEFORE the massive waves of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa SWARMED into Europe - changing the continent forever...</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Barbara Lerner Spectre - unquestionably one of the most  <em>lovely and talented</em> (AND PROPHETIC) Jewish women ever to grace the face of the Earth.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFE0qAiofMQ">Ms Spectre Speaks</a></strong></p>

<p>Two lessons to be learned here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>That the massive wave of uncultured and unassimilable Muslim migrants that have since swarmed Europe did NOT just show up by &quot;accident,&quot; and;</p></li>
<li><p>That you and your people are AT WAR, and have been for centuries - but your enemy is not who you THINK it is... <em>(but don&#39;t you DARE think</em> <strong><em>THAT</em></strong>, <em>you anti-Semite!)</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Its disturbing that you can point out the objective fact that, say, <a href="https://mynameisjoecortina.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3d7bd-jewishnewsmedia.jpeg?w=700">a lot of people in journalism are Jewish.</a>  They just are, I&#39;m not even stating anything further.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s wrong, Jewish people are just people like he said. My only qualm is that pure Jewish people have the genetic makeup that allows them to subjugate populations easily, not much data for that just the fact that Jews score highest in IQ tests and overall seem very genetically motivated to help their race much like OP was saying. They don&#39;t meet in shadowy meetings, they leave all the clues in the open then tell us we&#39;re wrong when we point them out, but other Jews can see the twist and know which clues are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. I say this because Ashkenazi jews are said to have an average IQ of 115-117 and are a disproportionately well-represented group in many places, education, etc.</p>

<p>In Israel however Ashkenazi jews specifically have an average IQ significantly lower, estimates range from 103-106. This is <a href="http://sq.4mg.com/IQIsraeli.htm">one of many irregularities that doesn&#39;t make sense with the &quot;super intelligent&quot; idea</a>.</p>

<p>The author claims that &quot;The lower IQ of Israeli Ashkenazi&#39;s is caused by non-genetic factors&quot;. I find this conclusion inaccurate and propose that the higher IQ of European Ashkenazi is due to non-genetic factors. I do so because of further confounding factors;</p>

<p>1- IQ is a test designed not for intelligence but rather to group students by appropriate learning potential, this requires ideally a homogeneous society group, not a diverse group with significantly different ethnicity/cultures that can be hard to differentiate from genetics. The IQ differences don&#39;t consistently pop up when you compare isolated genetically European groups vs isolated Ashkenazi groups. </p>

<p>2- The native christian populations in Israel are actually more intelligent and better educated per-capita than the overall jewish population (similar to how jews tend to be in european society). Perhaps being a minority culture gives an intelligence edge?</p>

<p>&quot;The CBS noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4323529,00.html">For example, in 2011 the number of Arab Christian students eligible for a high-school diploma stood at 64% in comparison to only 48% among Muslim children, 55% among Druze and 59% in the Jewish education system in general.&quot;</a></p>

<p>If you wanna brag about high IQ then you better put up or shut up, mine is over 140, but I don&#39;t go around bragging to people if they are lower because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a complete picture (and even if it was that would be being an elitist prick).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a different perspective, that <em>might</em> be true.</p>

<p>Why do people want to control the world? Look at the incentive structure for people that seek power - people like Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, and to a lesser degree, Joel Stein - all of these people enough fame and fortune to have pretty much whatever goods or services are legitimately offered in society. They can drive the nicest cars, dine at the nicest restaurants, do whatever they want - they <em>should</em> be sated.</p>

<p>But, they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Bear with me through this and don&#39;t stop halfway through - Joel Stein is an obviously quite intelligent, handsome and in particular, an incredibly funny and exceptional writer (seriously, <em>he is</em>). Why is that not enough for him? What is it possibly that his ego is missing?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a feeling of power or racial superiority.  <em>I read</em> Joel Stein - I&#39;ve never been convinced he has feelings of insecurity in him - he just doesn&#39;t strike me as racial supremacist.</p>

<p>I think if you read between the lines here, Joel Stein&#39;s writing here uses <em>irony</em> - in other words, his intended message is not what is literally conveyed. </p>

<p>I really believe Joel Stein&#39;s actual intention is simply to try to illuminate the racial supremacy that exists.</p>

<p>Why do I believe that? Two reasons. (1) His writing; and (2) his motivations</p>

<p>1 -<br/>
Take a look at what Joel Stein said just before the OP quoted him:    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe my life spent in a New Jersey-New York/Bay Area-L.A. pro-Semitic cocoon has left me naive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full quote is:     </p>

<p>maybe my life spent in a New Jersey-New York/Bay Area-L.A. pro-Semitic cocoon has left me naive. But I don&#39;t care if Americans think we&#39;re running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government. I just care that we get to keep running them.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe he is saying that <strong>his cultural upbringing -- the very culture that he is indicting in this article -- is the problem.</strong> He couldn&#39;t write that racial supremacy exists in Jewish culture--well, technically he could, but he gets the message across here while saving his own skin as much as he can. He illuminates the problem while not betraying his team, his tribe, his race. Maybe he has a guilty conscience, but he also does not want to be a martyr.  </p>

<p>2 -<br/>
Joel Stein had to have some motivation to write this article. He is not stupid enough to write this without having a particular motivation - and he is not stupid enough to believe this article would favour a continuation of the type of racial supremacy that exists in America.</p>

<p>I believe he just had a guilty conscience. Joel Stein is likely someone that has no insecurities fueling anger or power. He has shown no negative motivations towards racial hatred or supremacy -- in other words, this particular writing sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br/>
Joel Stein was trying to illuminate a problem of racism and tribalism - he is not stupid or insecure to write something like this.</p>

<p>There are good and bad people of every race. What&#39;s bad is racism, tribalism and racial supremacy, and that can exist in any culture. Unfortunately, for some unexplained reason, right now our media and academic institutions have taught us that it&#39;s only politically correct to say whites can be guilty of these problems - Joel Stein was trying to find a way to say this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they&#39;ve been &quot;condemned&quot;.  How many times has this happened already?  Dozens?  Hundreds of times?  The key word here is control, and control is what Israel has had to a great degree for decades.  It seems they are finally wearing out their welcome with many though, which is heartwarming.  You&#39;ll also notice that this condemnation was followed not by contrition, but by threats.</p>
