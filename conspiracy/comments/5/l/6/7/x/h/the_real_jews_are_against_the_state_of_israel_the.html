        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Orthodox Jews are the REAL JEWS and they are against the creation of Israel. The Torah forbids them to have a state, so they do not approve of Israel. The Torah also forbids them to steal and kill. The Jews in Israel are stealing land from Palestine and killing them. The REAL Jews do not approve of this! They were happy living Amongst the Muslims and are sad the Zionist movement is stealing land and causing chaos </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nkusa.org/AboutUs/Zionism/opposition.cfm">The REAL JEWS are AGAINST Zionism and Israel </a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=l-wmKF9RQBs">Orthodox Jews against Zionism and ROTHSCHILD </a></p>

<p>Everyone knows Hitler was part of the bloodlines, who control the world. The Orthodox Jews say the Holocaust was to try and force the Jews OUT of Europe and SETTLE in Palestine. After the Holocaust the ROTHSCHILD CREATED THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND ZIONISM. This way the mass population will always bow down to Israel bc the Bible says they are the chosen ones. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mUms50htsuM">Rothschild created Israel </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jesusisprecious.org/prophecy/satans_counterfeit.htm">Israel is the Synagogue of Satan, counterfeit Israel </a></p>

<p>These REAL JEWS are all over trying to spread their message but there&#39;s a MEDIA BLACKOUT! imagine that!! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=377A7vCWaX4">10,000+ Real Jews in NYC conference AGAINST Israel and Zionism </a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=9ynf_gllFEU">Jews Protest against Zionism </a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=Dg6QfALsqlI">Orthodox Jews speak their mind at protest against Zionism </a></p>

<p>Just like the American schools brainwash the people, the Jews of Israel are being brainwashed too! The schools is Israel are pushing Zionism onto the students and burying 2,000 years of the true Jewish history. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=NtQKCfQiu7w">Rewriting Jewish History to form Zionism </a></p>

<p>So, after reviewing all the info above.. what do you think about this... </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jared-kushner-defends-donald-trump-media-interview/story?id=43714096"> &quot;Steve Bannon is an Incredible Zionist&quot; </a></p>

<p>If Israel was created by the Rothschilds, then where does the 38 billion dollars the US gives to Israel REALLY GO? Germany also has given Israel 61 Billion since the Holocaust.  Are these countries actually owned by the Rothshilds?  </p>

<p>Also, do you think the elites framed the Muslims for 9/11, so we will grow hate for the Islamic states? That way the mass population will agree with the Jews rather then the Muslims when it came to giving land to Jews?  Are the Jews using Muslims as a scapegoat?

    <div class="md"><p>I know this comes across as anti-semitic but it&#39;s truly not. Imagine if the Atheist said they had a giant golden statue of Jesus for you. That&#39;s essentially what occurred in Basel to the Jews.</p>

<p>And while it&#39;s not taught in school, much of the Holocaust began in Switzerland, but 600 years before Hitler. You can read about the Basel Massacre, which will show a google result.</p>

<p>House Savoy, who was heir to the Knights Templar fortunes, were some of the leaders in Jew hatred, and were also one of the if not the biggest noble families in Switzerland.</p>

<p>It was through the Castles at Savoy that the Jews were tortured until they got their proper &#39;confession&#39; , claiming the Jews spread the plague as a means of warfare, and thus all Jews were guilty and needed a series of live burnings and extermination to wipe them from Switzerland and the Rhine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orthodox jews might be against israel or not, they really aren&#39;t doing anything to prove it but they sure do love their child rape and organ/human trafficking. Don&#39;t go thinking Orthodox jews are saints. They are brothel frequenting kid lovers and for a religious people they&#39;re insatiable. They believe foreign women aren&#39;t human and don&#39;t count as victims. These are the values they bring to Western civilization. Why work on relationships when you can buy sex and treat people like objects. Orthodox jews have also been known to be very intolerant and aggressive towards other people in all countries. These real jews are actually a welfare burden in every nation including israel. They believe they are the real/correct/right jew and should be indulged.</p>

<p>Monsters like Ovadia Yosef, a scholar who brought jews back to the Torah said garbage like, &quot;Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel.&quot; Among other disgusting, religious and racist quotes.</p>

Jesus was killed for outing jews as greedy money manipulators and warmongers and pervert sinners.

Spain, Germany, Russia, the middle-East. They are a cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Palestinian, Muslim, and American. Most of us just want a peaceful, secular Middle East. We feel for the civilians of the region; and worry about our own family members out there. It&#39;s taken  years of reading about the Middle East and i&#39;m still no expert nor am I even close to being one. The political history of that region is too complex. What I do know is that Zionism isn&#39;t the only problem, Saudi&#39;s Wahhabism is too. To keep it basic: A man named Abd Al-Wahhab  collaborated with the Brit&#39;s to create a contradictory version of the Islam. The goal was to use this alleged scholar&#39;s &quot;school of thought&quot; to contaminate the religion; more specifically the &quot;Sunni&quot; sect. This &quot;political Islam&quot; is used as a divide N&#39; conquer tactic to create greater division amongst Muslims. Not only that, it promotes intolerance and justifies the atrocities committed against religious minority groups. The Al-Sauds were put into power of the Arabian peninsula; this man&#39;s &quot;school of thought&quot; was adopted to be the law of the land. The Wahhabi movement is a huge problem not only for the Middle East, but for the world. It is also a problem for us Muslims b/c many learn religion by what we are told to believe. Also many &quot;uninformed&quot; or illiterate Muslims trust these Saudi-funded Wahhabi &quot;Scholars&quot; that are infiltrating the mosques worldwide. The terrorist you see on the TV are a product of both the CIA/Saudi money and Wahhabi brainwashing. Yet it&#39;s comical how the U.S. and Israel are allied with Saudi. They all somehow manage to benefit each other&#39;s causes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well explained. The crazy thing about Wahhabism is Abd Al-Wahab was a nobody; he wasn&#39;t a big deal.  He was a like Terry Jones with no internet. </p>

<p>My mother went to Mecca for pilgrimage, and the Saudis constantly harassed her, an elderly woman,  mid prayer because she prayed with her hands at her sides, in a Muslim country.... Yet Muslims in the US pray any which way they want, and Americans are usually very respectful of that. Just goes to show how backwards that country is. </p>

<p>Saudis pimp out handicapped people that are missing limbs on the climb to the Mountain of Light, taking advantage of people feeling charitable in the holy months. How in the world does a man with no legs climb halfway up a mountain to beg for money? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah. Interesting question. Wish I had a direct answer. I&#39;ll share my opinion though. </p>

<p>Labeling a group of people is problematic in itself. I would rather others judge me by my character. I view everyone as a human first despite our differences and/or preferences.</p>

<p>You are totally right; the media does depict Muslims negatively. They always show the Niqabi/burka lady and the random angry haji man yelling in Arabic. This stereotypical portrayal benefits an  agenda &quot;they&quot; need to promote. I&#39;m Arab as well. Hollywood tends to portray us to be savages. It all starts with Disney&#39;s Aladdin, which is my favorite childhood movie btw. Took years of growing up to realize how badly we are portrayed in it. Lol. </p>

<p>Fun fact: Arabs only make up ~20% of the 1.6 Billion Muslims. Many correlate being Arab with Islam. Not all Arabs are Muslim, not all Muslims are Arabs. The only link is that the Quran is in Arabic. </p>

<p>With that said, I&#39;m only 1 out of 1.6 Billion. The evil actions of a few others does not reflect who I am as an individual. Keep that in mind for every other religious group too. </p>

<p>When people ask me about my religious views: I tell them I&#39;m Muslim. Not Sunni or Shia; I don&#39;t claim a sect. Most people are generally shocked. I&#39;m a female that doesn&#39;t wear hijab; also currently a med student. Many of my Muslim friends are integrated into society; we are living an average American lifestyle. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a few people tell me &quot;but u look so normal!&quot; I&#39;ve also had people ask how my dad lets me leave the house without the garb. 😂 Its quite comical tbh; I never take offense. Growing up in the South, I have been told by others that I&#39;m the first Muslim they have ever met. So I keep an open mind and am willing to answer all questions. I believe that engaging/interacting with others is the only best way to break stereotypes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a really good friend who&#39;s a Qatari be lives in Qatar. He has friends in Qatar who are killed by Isis and friends who are fighting Isis too. But, the media makes them out to look like they are all involved with Isis. 
What I know is TRUE is...Those countries are involved with pedophilia and slave labor. But even the UN is cracking down on slave labor. Saudi is the only country that beheads for punishment. They behead on Friday&#39;s in public after prayer. Qatar will give you lashes  if you drink alcohol in public. So they are pretty strict when it comes to their &quot;religion&quot; I think this is why the elites have used them for a scapegoat bc their religion is so foreign to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s saying God is aware of the evil doers, and he&#39;s warning them to not be evil. </p>

<p>You see, the Jews believe they are the chosen ones, however, the Quran states that all people are equal: &quot; O you mankind, surely We created you of a male and a female, and We have made you races and tribes that you may get mutually acquainted. Surely the most honorable among you in the Providence of God are the most pious; surely God is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Cognizant&quot; [Quran 49:13]</p>

<p>The reason God in the Quran tells them to &quot;ask for death if ye are truthful&quot; is because the Jews claim they are the chosen ones, therefore, they will enter heaven. So why live through the struggle of life, dealing with all the BS of this life, when you can die and go straight to heaven? But the follow up  says they&#39;ll never ask for that because of their past actions (getting Jesus killed, betrayal of contracts, disobeying God after saving them from the Egyptians etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clergy response teams are clergy enlisted by the government to keep people calm and compliant in the event of martial law and encourage them to trust the government. It&#39;s not really denomination specific. You can find &quot;corporate&quot; churches in all flavours. The government would never let churches get out of their propaganda machine..its an environment of trust towards the clergy and they take advantage of that.</p>

<p>While churches may not endorse politicians or parties, they push agendas through interpretive doctrine such as &quot;good Christians obey authority figures&quot; and &quot;good Christians love Israel (the nation-state)&quot; They don&#39;t approve of revolutionary ideas and they certainly don&#39;t approve of civil disobedience. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the description of Isreal&#39;s return, ask yourself if any of it sounds like the war torn nation we know as Israel now or the world in general as we know it now:</p>

<p>&quot;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</p>

<p>And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</p>

<p>And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#39; den</p>

<p>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>

<p>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 11:6-11</p>

<p>Also, did this happen?</p>

<p>And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. - 11:15</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you or somebody else made this up.  As for keeping calm and obedient, this has been the mode of Christianity since its beginning under the pagan Roman empire.  You don&#39;t need a good government to be a good citizen, and the purpose of being a good citizen is not to prop up governance, but to be an ambassador for Christ, representing God well before the people you meet, including those in government.  Meanwhile, by all means encourage lawful and ethical behavior among the rulers.  This is Christianity, and not a subversion of Christianity by government.</p>

<p>Anyway, as to those verses you cite, many believe these are descriptions of the millenial kingdom after Christ&#39;s return, but that before then Israel will set up and restore the temple, and then Armaggedon, the battle of nations on the plains of Megiddo will happen and then the Return will occur.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Love your enemies and pray for those who spitefully use you&quot;.  Hate evil, but never hate people.   And Paul and Peter and Jesus did indeed board &quot;trains&quot; when the authorities came for them.  But in case you&#39;re wondering about me, none of this has been discussed in any churches I&#39;ve attended in decades (probably because there is not visible threat of arrest for most people, so it&#39;s just not a subject).  I&#39;m just telling what I see in the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only half right; the ancient sign for the Kingdom of Israel was the candleholder we see during the Jewish celebration of Chanukah. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the modern nation of Israel has a white flag with a blue six pointed star today. This was never a symbol known to ancient Israel. In fact, in several pagan cultures, the six pointed star is associated with satan and satanic child sacrifice murders. </p>

<p>The true origin of this current flag proves modern Israel&#39;s not a creation of God, but the work of greedy powerful men. Rothschild was the name adopted by the trillionaire world banking family, it means red-shield in German. When the Rothschild&#39;s donated money to build the Zionist secular socialist state of modern Israel, they chose their red-shield, but changed the color of the six pointed star from blood red to sky blue!</p>

<p>The promise was first made to Abraham (Genesis 15:18-21), then confirmed to his son Isaac (Genesis 26:3), and then to Isaac&#39;s son Jacob (Genesis 28:13), Abraham&#39;s grandson. The promised land was described in terms of the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates river (Exodus 23:31). A smaller area of former Canaanite land and land east of the Jordan River was conquered and occupied by their descendants, the Israelites, after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt (Numbers 34:1-12), and this occupation was interpreted as God&#39;s fulfilment of the promise (Deuteronomy 1:8). Moses anticipated that God might subsequently give the Israelites land reflecting the boundaries of God&#39;s original promise, if they were obedient to the covenant (Deuteronomy 19:8-9).</p>

<p>Palestine began with the Sykes-Picot Agreement in May 1916</p>

<p>Many people do not realize this argument is over a piece of land smaller than Los Angeles County. This is how absurd the arguements is. Why can&#39;t the muslims allow the Jewish state to exist? It links back to a fundimental tenant of islam, jihad against the infidel. islam must defeat the infidel and the islamic flag must fly over the world under one religion, islam. </p>

<p>The koran never mentions Jerusalem as a holy site while the Torah and the Old Testament is clear, Israel is promised by God to the descendants of Abraham. </p>

<p>The arguements really rest on the fact that in order to wrest legitimacy from Jews and Christians the muslim must conquer their lands and build mosques to prove that Allah favors the muslim over the other religions laying claim over the region. In essence the muslim must conquer Jerusalem to destroy Judaism and Christianity and exert the power over the Holy Land as the true belief as the final profit of Allah. It is, in the eyes of muslims, the death of the Jewish and Christian faiths. </p>

<p>Here is the prymary fact. islam was founded between 610 and 632 AD (CE for the Secular Snobs). Until the conquest of Jerusalem in 680 AD the area was largely Christian. In fact Christianity was the prymary religion across North Africa, Egypt, the Levant and across Southern Europe.  </p>

<p>jihad was waged even until the late 1800s in Europe. In fact the first foreign war fought by the United States was against muslims in North Africa against the Barbary pirates. The United States tired of paying Jizya and having their sailors taken in to slavery fought the Muslims to protect our shipping. Jefferson, in fact, read a translation of the koran in  English university.  He later felt it was an important work for Americans to understand the adversary the United States faced. </p>

<p>Why am I mentioning this in a discussion of Jerusalem?  To put the history largely forgotten by the west in perspective. Palestine was a artificial creation after World War I when the English and French with some help from the Russians divided the Middle East in to the countries now on the map under the Sykes Picot Agreement.
When the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany in WWI the Middle East was divided by the Sykes Picot Agreement creating Palestine a newly formed country in the Levant after the dissolution of vast areas controlled by Turkey. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 19, 1916, representatives of Great Britain and France secretly reach an accord, known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, by which most of the Arab lands under the rule of the Ottoman Empire are to be divided into British and French spheres of influence with the conclusion of World War I. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the State of Israel wasn&#39;t formed until 1948 the exodus from Europe began in the late 1800 early 1900 and Jews began to buy up land in modern Isreal as a reaction to European anti-Semitism. </p>

<p>Palestine never existed as a country in muslim control until the dissolution of Turkey, it was at best,  a  riegion in the Ottoman Empire. The Jewish revolt against the Roman empire began in 68 AD and the temple was destroyed in 70 AD. It was the Jewish capitol until their dispersal by the Romans in 139 AD. For 500 years it was the center of Christian culture until the muslim jihad took Jerusalem in 680 AD. This is the same jihad that has continuously attacked Christian states for 1400 years destroying churches and talking &quot;Kaphirs&quot; in to slavery. jihad took much of the land in the Middle East, North Africa, and until they were driven back, much of Mediterranean Europe. </p>

<p>When a riegion is conquered mosques are built over the churches to display islam&#39;s dominance over the riegion. That could also explain why it was so important to build the 9/11 mosque in New York and to fly this islamic flag over the White House under Obama&#39;s rule. </p>

<p>These events may seem remote in history and isolated in location but they are all related to islam&#39;s need to conquer the infidel and create a muslim world. They are all integral to political Islam&#39;s aim to control the world under the flag of islam. Israel, more specifically Jerusalem, are key points in the battle against Judaism and Christianity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting point of view, I&#39;m an open minded Jewish and I always try to be emphatic with people, no matter who they are.</p>

<p>The only thing I guess the muslim world is fighting for (when I say muslim I mean those who believe in the Quran, no extremists) is that Jewish and Muslims came from Abraham, he had two sons the first was Ismael (Muslim World) and then Isaac (Jewish world), we both have the same respect and love for him, so Abraham&#39;s grave is in the dispute area, I think that&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Again it&#39;s a personal and maybe a little bit religious point of view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do view themselves as descended from Ismael, but the dispute in Jerusalem and Israel is not about Abraham&#39;s grave.  It is about Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock, the manifest destiny of Islam to rule the world, and how the religious loss of territory to Israel is a direct repudiation of that faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manifest destiny to rule the world?  Come on man, really?</p>

<p>&quot;Say: O unbelievers!
I do not serve that which you serve,
Nor do you serve Him Whom I serve:
Nor am I going to serve that which you serve,
Nor are you going to serve Him Whom I serve:
You shall have your religion and I shall have my religion.&quot;</p>

<p>Quran 109</p>

<p>“Let there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made clear from error.  Whoever rejects false worship and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that never breaks.  And God hears and knows all things.” (Quran 2:256)</p>

<p>Does that sound like manifest destiny to rule the world? Even I, an idiot, read that as &quot;you don&#39;t bug me, and I won&#39;t bug you.&quot;  It is literally against my religion to force it on anyone. Anyone who has done so in the past has done it out of sheer ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you reject the conquests carried out by the four caliphates and those of the subsequent generations, the heavy taxation of non-Muslims and the benefits granted to any who chose to submit to Islam?  </p>

<p>Do you disagree with this: &quot;While truces between Islamic and non-Muslim polities were acceptable, the Koran taught that these were to be limited in duration. Ultimately, no permanent peace between Muslims and nonbelievers was possible until all nonbelievers submitted to Muslim rule, and the Dar al-Islam encompassed the whole world. Jihad, either in the form of the &quot;greater jihad&quot; (the struggle all Muslims must wage against sin) or the &quot;lesser jihad&quot; (the armed struggle with nonbelievers), was integral to bringing wholeness and unity to a divided world.&quot;  Source: <a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7022">http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7022</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t agree, because the quote you gave is baseless. Find me a single verse in the Quran that says all treaties with non Muslims must be temporary and I&#39;ll convert to worshipping duck-billed platypus for the rest of my life.  Also, &quot;greater Jihad&quot; is the &quot;struggle of oneself,&quot; not &quot;a struggle all Muslims must wage against sin,&quot; because the latter quote sounds like Muslims everywhere must wage a war on anyone committing a sin. It&#39;s misleading and makes clear the authors agenda, and consequently, your agenda. </p>

<p>The expansion wasn&#39;t carried out by &quot;four&quot; khalifehs. It was done under the hand of Omar ibn Al Aas and the Bani Umayya (who should&#39;ve never been a khalifeh in the first place but that&#39;s another topic). Also, that was 1400 years ago. While you&#39;re at it, you may as well say that Christians have a manifest destiny because the crusades happened therefore something something something manifest destiny. </p>

<p>Imperialism is not in my religion, it was an action of politicians 1400 years ago. If it is in my religion, please provide me with evidence from the Quran, because I assure you that the 2 billion Muslims in the world have a copy of the Quran in their homes, not a bookmark to some catholic polemics webpage.</p>

<p>Besides, who are you to determine the taxation was heavy? In America we get nearly 25% of our money taken out in taxes EVERY paycheck, (not sure how much they take from your check in Israel). Some may consider that heavy, or nothing at all, its subjective. I&#39;m sure many were happy to pay a tax instead of going to die in war. </p>

<p>Christians or Jews who did not want to help their Muslim army in war were charged a tax. Sounds fair to me.  Nowadays, we&#39;re charged tax EVERY TIME we earn, buy, and also when we die. Ain&#39;t that a bitch. At least they were given an option, unlike the draft implemented by the U.S. and they still taxed the poor soldiers they sent to die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay this is a lot to read and even more to process. I don&#39;t have an agenda here other than to discuss your understanding of things, my understanding and how other Muslim groups are thinking.  I don&#39;t have answers for you now, but I do have two questions: Do you also accept the writings about your prophet in addition to the Quran (is this the Hadith?) or only the Quran?  Independent of the first question, do most branches of Islam believe the things you wrote above is the right interpretation or is there a divide say between Sunni and Shiite?</p>

<p>I am surprised you say oh that was 1400 years ago, because I was under the impression students of Islam were taught to have the highest regard for the first generation of followers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just ask you to be rational and logical. There are 2 billion Muslims in the world, what have we conquered? Where in the Quran does it say for me to conquer? We&#39;re just trying to live life like everyone else. These are fear tactics deployed by the western military to justify their presence in Arabia. The spread of a religion does not mean we and moved in flipped everything upside down like the Romans or the Brits or the Americans for that matter. This is why Israel is such a key ally to the US. Without the excuse of protecting Israel, the US loses many of its excuses for being in the region. It&#39;s their entry way into a land filled with stupid amounts of oil. </p>

<p>I accept what is logical and rational. Many writings of my prophet are false, I only accept what is logical and rational and what lines up with the teachings of The Quran. </p>

<p>The problem here is policitians are blaming religions for the chaos caused by.... politicians. And people eat that shit up. Atheists love to say &quot;all war is caused by religion.&quot; But that&#39;s a false argument. War is caused by politicians. Was WW1 or WW2 caused by religion? Was Vietnam caused by religion? The Cold War? Etc? </p>

<p>Then you ask if students of Islam are taught to respect leaders of that time. Yes they are. Are students of America taught to respect the early leaders? Yes. Does that mean they&#39;re being taught to buy and sell slaves, commit genocide, and rebel against their homeland? Come on man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quran (9:29) - &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot; </p>

<p>Quran (47:3-4) - &quot;Those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord... So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah&#39;s Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives)... If it had been Allah&#39;s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.&quot; </p>

<p>Quran (66:9) - &quot;O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey&#39;s end.&quot;</p>

<p>Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;</p>

<p>Sahih Muslim (31:5918) - &quot;I will fight them until they are like us.&quot; Ali&#39;s reply to Muhammad, after receiving clarification that the pretext for attack Khaibar was to convert the people (see above verse).</p>

<p>Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 992: - &quot;Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah.&quot; </p>

<p>Tabari 9:69 &quot;Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us&quot; The words of Muhammad, prophet of Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Christian friend of mine opened my eyes to this: the Bible states that the covenant with the children of Israel was conditional. I did more research on this. What I understood: the Prophet Moses promised the land ONLY if the Jews [at the time] followed the message of God. They continued to engage in greedy behavior, commit sin, and disobey the Prophet. The message wasn&#39;t relayed the first time around. That is why God sent a second messenger: Jesus.</p>
