       Even though I'm attracting shills like flies on poop, I don't care. I just want the real people out there to know it's a real issue and I'm not going to hide in the shadows. Conspiracy has never dealt with the issue because the intimidation factor was too strong. I want you to understand, we won't be silenced.

       In 1872 Capt. Gibson and crewmates, sailing the ship “Thomas Wood” from China to London, reported seeing the entirety of St. Helena Island on a clear day from 75 miles away. Factoring in their height during measurement on a ball-Earth 25,000 miles in circumference, it was found the island should have been 3,650 feet below their line of sight.

       From Genoa, Italy at a height of just 70 feet above sea- level, the island of Gorgona can often be seen 81 miles away. If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Gorgona should be hidden beyond 3,332 feet of curvature.

       Bwahaha you took that "maths" off of a meme, instead of doing any real calculations, but if you had any math skills at all you would easily see that this is completely false. Really, anyone with out any real math skills, but rather an ounce of common sense can quickly determine that this is completely false.

       I say a ball on a plate cause it's easy to watch a ball roll, that's all. I guess you could put a  GI Joe on a dinner plate and make it go around and around and around too.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was you don't need to travel around the outside of a ball to make a complete circle. You could make a complete circle on a 'flat plane' (or plate) just the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I believe the worlds flat.

       Couple of questions...
      </p>
      <p>
       So whats the point of a flat earth cover up? 
Who could possibly benefit from it and how? 
What about the countless pieces of evidence supporting the earth being a globe? Many of which can be obesrved  with the naked eye.
      </p>

       From my understanding the myth came about from feuding mathematicians. It was used as an insult ie: "you probably think the earth is flat too"
I'm genuinely interested in your reasoning to believe such a theory.

       You're not going to get answers unless you quit pretending to be smart just because your paternal figures taught you how to regurgitate 'facts'. It's not my reasoning or his reasoning, it's just natural reasoning, logic etc. As soon as you forget about being on the right team and realize that you have to decide what is true. You can't play this game as a spectator, you actually have to actually put some skin in the game and risk being proven wrong. That step is generally too much for most people.

       Nice speech, but you haven't given me anything of substance. Im open minded and willing to hear any evidence of a flat earth. But no one has presented any yet. You've just skirted the issue. Tell me your logic behind your belief, what piece(s) of evidence convinced you the earth is flat?

       I spent many hours looking into it, trying to find a decent argument that isn't easily picked apart. There isn't one. I regret every moment I spent, and I am simply trying to prevent others from having the same regret. There is nothing in flat earth that is the least bit informative, except that it will give you some indication of how credulous people are and how shitty our education system is. Also, wasting people's time is one of the major purposes of the flat earth psyop. I'm trying to prevent that.

      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with that! I've spent hours of my time looking at both sides of a fence just to realize I can't figure it out, or other times where I debunked my own way of thinking.

       Thanks. I appreciate your glass half full perspective. But at the same time I feel like an appropriate analogy here would be if somebody told me that Santa Claus was real. Is that claim worth spending the time to look at the other side of the fence? No. Should I feel good about myself for spending hours considering the arguments for Santa's existence? No. I just feel like a chump. Well it's the same here. Anybody who is credulous enough to buy into Flat Earth deserves all the derision and insta-downvotes they get.

       We pick and choose! What we can easily debunk and move on from (Like Santa Claus)
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay okay, how about an analogy and then we can leave it as it is? I really don't want to come off as preachy or anything, I'm just chatty today and I can tell you're a nice person. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the same vein of Santa being taught to us as real, when we were children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, we didn't know better, we were told "this is just how it is!" until one day your parents, who you
       <em>
        trusted
       </em>
       say "Santa was never real". It disrupts reality! Why would they lie to us?! Those adults were supposed to be truthful. How could they hide this from us all these years and we just believed them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if adults who
       <em>
        don't like us
       </em>
       and have nefarious ways/evil inside them want to hide
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       things from us too. That's entirely plausible! It does happen, we're not that naive. But we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be fed propaganda our whole lives, which makes finding reality very hard some times. (Aliens, Religions, Sea monsters, Alien planets, Ghosts) hey, maybe some of that stuff
       <em>
        is bogus
       </em>
       but damn, I've seen some really creepy places and some really creepy ghost pictures, no way I'd ever venture near that stuff. Same with aliens, that stuff freaks me out... I'm good, I'll just wait over here til it's done thanks! But is it fake? Probably, hopefully, there's some damning evidence that Aliens are real. I've never seen anything live, so I don't know. I choose to believe they don't, despite the evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adults lied to us then and those were the ones
       <em>
        we loved
       </em>
       , sure it was all in good fun and for the sake of goodness. But what if we were lied to about
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       things, from other adults? There is a globe in every classroom, the world is
       <em>
        round
       </em>
       ! This is the way it is. I've never seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       evil really does reside on this Earth, what
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       that evil was so corrupt it manifested its way to destroy religions and split people apart to give us each less hope. That is troubling to me. The thing that shook me to my soul after hearing it when I was younger was 
"The greatest lie the devil ever told, was convincing the world he did not exist."
      </p>
      <p>
       What if? It doesn't take much for me to believe in a higher power, all I need to do is be a better person. I want to bring knowledge and life and happiness everywhere. I want to grab a beer with people overseas and have a blast telling stories. I don't need to go to church and listen to old men who didn't get married, tell me how it should be. A connection with a higher power isn't their choice, it's
       <em>
        ours
       </em>
       . So the things I've read religiously, I've tracked along in books, teachings, etc... I've seen some stuff. I choose to believe. We are all free to do as we please :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, have a good day and happy new year! don't let taking a few minutes/hour of your time rifling through videos or texts feel like a waste. There's nothing wrong with knowledge

      <p>
       They will quote it, break it down, and show the "science" behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the NIST report is total bullshit. It defies every fundamental property of basic physics. But that never stopped millions from believing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth theory is just like the NIST report. It denies fundamental laws of physics. But people buy that load of bullshit every day too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth theory was a mind control project to see a) how many people could believe such a thing and b) to be used as a straw man argument against the truth movement. That way, when some researcher points out crimes committed by government, the officials can say " oh you conspiracy theorists and your flat earth."

       Serious question. What kind of experiment would be acceptable to prove the shape of the earth, in your view?
      </p>
      <p>
       The heliocentrists have used a light based experiment conducted by Eratosthenes to prove their model.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the experiment assumes that light is straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a remake of the
       <a href="http://www.rolf-keppler.de/lot.jpg">

       mine shaft experiment, or a

       Op, this is a shame.  Please use your beautiful mind to assume the earth is in fact a planet, then research accordingly to avoid confirmation bias.  If you feel in your heart like it may be flat, then your mind will find evidence to confirm your incorrect feeling.
Flat Earth has been disproven many times on this sub, in great length and detail.
We won't go round and round just cause it keeps getting posted despite the evidence.
But its just nonsense.  Space, galaxies, cosmos, just tossed aside.

       Earth is a prison PLANET.  If you feel lost or like there is a hidden truth, then you are correct.

Would you be mad at a 8 year old throwing a tantrum at you for finally understanding there's no Santa? Nope!

       But you learned something, and you have found enough out that you can/would be able to carry a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with that! I've spent hours of my time looking at both sides of a fence just to realize I can't figure it out, or other times where I debunked my own way of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all fun until it's not, then we move on to the next thing. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care, glad you at least looked. That's showing more gumption than the insta-downvoters who don't say anything or the "lol moron" argument.

       We pick and choose! What we can easily debunk and move on from (Like Santa Claus)
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay okay, how about an analogy and then we can leave it as it is? I really don't want to come off as preachy or anything, I'm just chatty today and I can tell you're a nice person. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the same vein of Santa being taught to us as real, when we were children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, we didn't know better, we were told "this is just how it is!" until one day your parents, who you
       <em>
        trusted
       </em>
       say "Santa was never real". It disrupts reality! Why would they lie to us?! Those adults were supposed to be truthful. How could they hide this from us all these years and we just believed them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if adults who
       <em>
        don't like us
       </em>
       and have nefarious ways/evil inside them want to hide
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       things from us too. That's entirely plausible! It does happen, we're not that naive. But we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be fed propaganda our whole lives, which makes finding reality very hard some times. (Aliens, Religions, Sea monsters, Alien planets, Ghosts) hey, maybe some of that stuff
       <em>
        is bogus
       </em>
       but damn, I've seen some really creepy places and some really creepy ghost pictures, no way I'd ever venture near that stuff. Same with aliens, that stuff freaks me out... I'm good, I'll just wait over here til it's done thanks! But is it fake? Probably, hopefully, there's some damning evidence that Aliens are real. I've never seen anything live, so I don't know. I choose to believe they don't, despite the evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adults lied to us then and those were the ones
       <em>
        we loved
       </em>
       , sure it was all in good fun and for the sake of goodness. But what if we were lied to about
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       things, from other adults? There is a globe in every classroom, the world is
       <em>
        round
       </em>
       ! This is the way it is. I've never seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       evil really does reside on this Earth, what
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       that evil was so corrupt it manifested its way to destroy religions and split people apart to give us each less hope. That is troubling to me. The thing that shook me to my soul after hearing it when I was younger was 
"The greatest lie the devil ever told, was convincing the world he did not exist."
      </p>
      <p>
       What if? It doesn't take much for me to believe in a higher power, all I need to do is be a better person. I want to bring knowledge and life and happiness everywhere. I want to grab a beer with people overseas and have a blast telling stories. I don't need to go to church and listen to old men who didn't get married, tell me how it should be. A connection with a higher power isn't their choice, it's
       <em>
        ours
       </em>
       . So the things I've read religiously, I've tracked along in books, teachings, etc... I've seen some stuff. I choose to believe. We are all free to do as we please :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, have a good day and happy new year! don't let taking a few minutes/hour of your time rifling through videos or texts feel like a waste. There's nothing wrong with knowledge
