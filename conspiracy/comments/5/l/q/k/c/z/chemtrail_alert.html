    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been paying attention to the grid patterns for at least 20yrs. It was when I&#39;d be sitting in my office at work and realize I was beginning to wheeze for no reason (never had asthma and my lungs still work great unless they spray a certain blend). </p>

<p>After it happened a few times, I finally started checking the sky. Sure as shit, they&#39;d be out there gridding around 3:30p, just before rush hour started. They&#39;re very structured when it comes to the times they spray, I&#39;ll give them that. </p>

<p>I think the nighttime spraying began early last December. I&#39;ve nothing to go on other than I started to have trouble breathing. Since then, when the nighttime wheezing happens out of nowhere, I&#39;ve started going outside to look. Only twice have I actually seen the grids being laid; they&#39;re hard to see at night because they aren&#39;t nearly as dense as the daytime trails and begin to dissipate immediately and create a very thin haze. </p>

<p>Do you know anything about the really low altitude ones they drop occasionally during the day? Those ones almost seem targeted, although I&#39;ve no clue why they might do that. They&#39;re ridic dense and are done in very short bursts in an &quot;X&quot; (which is what made me think they&#39;re being laid in a specific area). I wasn&#39;t too keen on  the one that would&#39;ve landed in my backyard had it floated straight down. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll shoot you a message the next time it happens at night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, is that then scientific proof tese things affect our atmosphere as is currectly accepted as &quot;speculation&quot;? They have a damn forecast! Persisting contrails arent what theyre claiming they are so i dont believe its contrails for a second. A persisting contrail is the one you see behing a plane for a few hundred feet, maybe 3-5 lengths of a plane or sometimes even shorter or a tad longer. Dissipates rather quickly. A normal contrail is usually seen on wing tips or a moment out of a jet engine. Most often seen from quick maneuvers in fighter jets or from the moisture at high altitude on commercial wingtips. Not the ones you see covering 50+ miles and lasting for 5 hours and combining with the ones from 4 and 3 hours ago to create a new cloud formation. Those are the chemtrails theyre forecasting there...</p>

<p>You are confused. Do you understand what &#39;persist&#39; means? A persistent contrail persists... i.e., sticks around. What you are calling a &#39;normal&#39; contrail is actually an Aerodynamic Contrail. You often see them coming off the wingtips of airliners landing in foul weather. There is a simple scientific explanation for contrails, which is what this website puts into practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that typical abuse of the word &quot;persisting&quot; and accepting the horizon spanning &quot;contrail&quot; at just about any altitude or moisture level is the nonsense weve had to believe as the spraying has kicked up over the decades. </p>

<p>watch a video of a  &quot;passenger&quot; or &quot;cargo&quot; aircraft literally filling in a gap in the clouds for miles and believing its anything less than deliberate is nonsense, though this in little way supports it being a con or chem. </p>

<p>and lol still goes on to ascert that chemtrails are contrails. </p>

And all those other peeps and poops that have talked about these &quot;persisting contrails&quot; at conferences are just as politically correct. The use of phrases like &quot;with what we can prove&quot; doesnt fall inline with my way of thinking.  My mind is suddenly changed and free of waffling words. 90% free actually, i waffled.
