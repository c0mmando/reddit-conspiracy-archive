Since this election though I&#39;ve become aware for the first time mainstream media influence on the masses, of the elite ring that makes all the important decision in my life, of the misinformation campaigns, of the false flags, how the show is put on and we all watch blindly. Now I&#39;m questioning some of my most basic beliefs such as gun control, I&#39;m actively campaigning against human Trafficking to my friends and family on Facebook who hear those words and think I&#39;m a nut because evil things like that aren&#39;t a part of their lives, and I watch how everyone is conditioned to be aware and desensitized to terrible things yet when it comes close to home they have the greatest ability to block it out and ignore it. At the same time it seems like the only places I can go also are filled with their own misinformation campaigns to delegitimize those communities such as all the satanic theories here with the cringe worthy visuals. How have you guys dealt with becoming more aware and where else can I go to stay properly informed.</p>

<p>Just keeping using your channels to inform the ones you love. Remember you can&#39;t convince anybody they are wrong. All you can do is show them stuff they didn&#39;t know. </p>

<p>In 2003 I was a 9/11 truther. Back in those days it was blasphemy to question it. I was loud, showed my friends my family, even got my class room to play loosechange once. Everyone always gave me the same shit, although after showing them stuff they didn&#39;t know everybody would go back to their own homes and research it for themselves. </p>

<p>To this day, I still get random phone calls from friends saying &quot;Robbie, there was a third building that fell on 9/11 or did you know the CIA is trafficking drugs?&quot;</p>

<p>All I can think is they remembered what I showed them and went further to find out for themselves. That&#39;s all you can do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yooo I&#39;m 21. I went from super lefty to moderate conservative in the last year. I believe there is a conspiracy to destroy the most important conservative values in our society like temperance and personal responsibility. </p>

<p>I really recommend listening to Andrew Breitbart. He is not a hardcore conservative like many would believe, he just hates the extreme left. If you can get your hands on it, his book Righteous Indignation is pretty amazing and reminds me of myself very much. </p>

<p>As far as economic liberalism vs conservativism, I believe liberal economics leads to a break down in society unless you have a highly moral society. Which we do not.</p>

<p>I find that conservatism is more grounded in realism while liberalism is grounded in idealism. Unfortunately human nature is flawed so I think conservative policies are the best we can get without going down the road to tyranny or economic collapse. </p>

<p>As for social issues, I don&#39;t blame god fearing conservatives for their stance. It&#39;s unfortunate we have to agree in policy on existential issues like: are souls real? Is marriage just a legal document or a sacred bonding of man and women?</p>

<p>Believe what you will, but never vilify ideologies based on their perceived leaders. Personally I think each individual policy needs to find a sweet spot between liberal and conservative based on the culture in that society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been weird for me listening to all these conservative opinions because I&#39;ve been so conditioned to ignore them. It&#39;s eye opening to truly look at both sides of the aisle. I guess my fight is I don&#39;t want to give up on the idealism. Yes we have to be rooted in reality but we also still should strive work for each other and not just ourselves. Sort of a &quot;society grows greater when men plant trees whose shade they&#39;ll never sit under&quot; and I&#39;m not economy major I only believe progressive tax is better then a flat tax. I guess I&#39;m in this weird purgatory of beliefs right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not an idealistic person after learning the horrors of what people are capable of. And it only takes on person to shit i the pool to ruin it for everyone else. If we had fully transparent government and fully informed engaged democratic engagement idealism would be great. For the time being we have basically the opposite.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered that taxation is theft? If so, wouldn&#39;t you expect people to stop working if they are just robbed more for working harder? </p>

<p>I understand that they still make more money, but their marginal return on investment becomes lower, thus encouraging less investment than they normally would. If businesses across the board become less profitable, then our societies benefit goes down.</p>

<p>This is the core of the libertarian perspective. I understand that some taxation seems like the greatest option, but how do we decide as a society? What is too far?</p>

<p>I great metaphors to understand your personal philosophy on this:</p>

<p>If you are stuck in a desert oasis with a magical freezer full of a set amount of ice cream and there is another oasis a mile away with another person there, how much ice cream will you allow to melt before you stop going over to deliver the other person ice cream? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man &quot;conservative values&quot;....I could write a novel on the bullshit that is &quot;conservatism&quot;.
But to speed this shit up,
is this &quot;Breitbart&quot; guy the same guy who started
the alt right website Breibart??</p>

<p>It&#39;s zionist.
Look at this shit dude:
<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/11/17/breitbart-news-network-born-in-the-usa-conceived-in-israel/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/11/17/breitbart-news-network-born-in-the-usa-conceived-in-israel/</a></p>

<p>Which is enough to make you question the entire
ideology if Netanyahu (Satanyahu) is on board.</p>

<p>But I never believed the alt right narrative that
it&#39;s &quot;immigration and political correctness&quot;
to blame for the problems in the world.
It&#39;s so dumb, it&#39;s amazing how many people have fallen for it.
I can understand believing the anti-immigration thing (makes more sense even if it&#39;s mostly not true)
but the political correctness thing is such a blatant scapegoat
on such a childish level.</p>

<p>Warning: sarcasm imminent: (purely to get a point across, not to insult anyone)
No no, don&#39;t blame the bankers who control the 
politicians....( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

<p>....blame how people talk! (Political correctness) ¯_(ツ)_/¯
....blame immigrants fleeing
wars that the elite started! (generally wars in the middle east nowadays)
.....blame immigrants fleeing from the economic
oppression from the corporate jobs outsourcing
the elite pushed for! (Super low wages in third world countries and moving
jobs there so natives in first world countries have less jobs and blame the natives
while third world country workers move to stop being screwed over in sweat shops and stuff)</p>

<p>....do you see what I mean?
Scapegoat. And Netanyahu likes it, probably because
it distracts from the real problems that fascism
and NEOconservatism have made by the ruling class.
Conservatism and the NEOs are political ideologies
were made to serve the ruling class (bankers, corporations, etc.)</p>

<p>Breitbart is not just after &quot;extreme left&quot; whatever that means.
(Does that mean communists or feminists??
(BTW I&#39;m not a feminist, I&#39;m a humanist....it&#39;s far less biased.)</p>

<p>But anyway, democratic socialism (left center),
centrism (center),
and social democracy (just between those two)
are the best regions IMO.
These are the true anti-establishment regions.</p>

<p>The elite don&#39;t want socialism for the peasants, they
want it for themselves (e.g. subsidies taking tax money from us and
giving it to corporations who don&#39;t even pay full tax and don&#39;t pay
their workers an acceptable wage).
But they don&#39;t want us to have fully tax-funded health care,
because they want to profit (privatize) from it.</p>

<p>Democratic socialism (George Orwell himself described himself as such)
is just nationalizing essential services such healthcare, education,
transport infrastructure, energy and science.</p>

<p>Privatization is the opposite (Obamacare is heavily privatized
with insurance companies and pharmaceutical company middle men
taking subsidies while pocketing the profits instead of putting it back into the system,
hence Obamacare is inefficient and shit....it&#39;s better than nothing, but still shit. 
The UK&#39;s NHS is much better but also failing as well because it&#39;s been privatized heavily in the past
several years by conservatives/NEOcons and NEOlibs).</p>

<p>Also, democratic socialism involves taxing the super rich at a more acceptable percentage
because they can easily afford to support the nation that helped them get that wealth in the first place.
E.g. a multi millionaire could keep the first 100K or 200K (a year) they earn,
but everything ABOVE that should be taxed at something like
30-70% depending on how badly the nation needs economic recovery
for the average Joe.
I&#39;m just giving rough numbers, I don&#39;t remember Bernie&#39;s
exact tax plan but it was decent.
Mine would probably more socialist than his but his is still good enough compared
to this shit system where we give corrupt billionaires tax breaks....
and then a lot of them just dodge tax anyway....O_o</p>

<p>In 2012, we had a right winger VS a right winger:
<a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2012.png">https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2012.png</a></p>

<p>Illusion of choice. They want us to pick one of their puppets.
The last 3 presidents (ALL SHIT) have been right wingers.
Yet there are still people who cling onto right wing politics (e.g. &quot;alt right&quot;)
because they think the establishment is communist....(ridiculous, the establishment
have gone to war with countries that wanted communism....)</p>

<p>The establishment is fascist (fascism/NWO is the goal) and the NEOcons are slowly trying to transition to fascists with false flags and shit trying to convince us to give away our freedom bit by bit.
That&#39;s my view.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t planning for this post to be so long
but I might as well add that
left wing means &quot;on the side of the people&quot;
and right wing means &quot;on the side of the king&quot; (the ruler)
since left wing and right wing were
coined from the French Revolution
where people sat to the left or right
of the king, depending on if they were
against the ruling class or not.</p>

<p>Just in case I didn&#39;t address your post properly,
I&#39;ll add this:</p>

<p>You said temperance and personal responsibility
are under attack....</p>

<p>But alcohol consumption isn&#39;t political at all.
For some it&#39;s just for social reasons
or they like the taste....
I hate the shit, it&#39;s toxic to the liver,
gives you a &quot;beer belly&quot;,
increases oestrogen levels in men (hormonal balance disruption)
and tastes shit anyway.
Politics plays no part in this, I don&#39;t know
how reading Breitbart made you think
the left is making us alcoholic, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying.</p>

<p>As far personal responsibility...
do you mean economically?
Because that&#39;s just the ruling class
saying
&quot;SOCIALISM?? NO PEASANT. WORK HARD IN MY SWEAT SHOP,
I MEAN BUSINESS, YOU&#39;RE POOR BECAUSE YOU DON&#39;T WORK HARD,
PEASANT&quot;</p>

<p>Dude, I&#39;ve met plenty of people who
work hard as hell and yet are taxed unfairly (too high a percentage for the poor)
and pay too much rent (haven&#39;t got a choice)
and so struggle....why should people work hard
only to struggle? That&#39;s economic slavery and I&#39;ve seen it first hand.</p>

<p>This is why I see conservative/right wing and the establishment
as being obsessed with trying to suppress the people,
stopping them climb the economic ladder.
They want us ALL POOR,
while they get richer and richer.</p>

<p>What&#39;s greed got to do with NWO?
I don&#39;t really know how the psychopath elite bankers
think but they literally have TRILLIONS of dollars.
So at that high level, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s greed.
I think it&#39;s control/slavery.
No idea why they&#39;re so petty that they want to
enslave humanity but history has shown that&#39;s
exactly what they want.</p>

<p>While the puppets (generally most politicians and corporations)
are in the &quot;greed&quot; category.</p>

<p>This is my world view.
Hope it makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Warning: long post, but hopefully it will open your eyes on what&#39;s really going on:
More of the same right wing crap isn&#39;t going to fix things:</p>

<p>Not saying Israeli people are evil, I&#39;m saying the Israeli government is generally pretty damn evil
with how they&#39;re occupying, oppressing and killing Palestinians, carrying out false flags, etc.
The Palestinians need that so called &quot;aid&quot; much more than the Israeli government. And America is struggling
because of the rigged system, so why should the struggling average Joe&#39;s tax money go to them? It should
be those zionist billionaires who <em>apparently</em> love Israel so much....but the truth is, they don&#39;t give a damn about the Israeli people
or pretty much anyone else outside the elite club.
Zionism is political, nothing more.
I&#39;m not thinking in black and white, trust me. 
But a political and economical movement founded with Netanyahu on board....
come on, that should raise alarm bells big time, even if you&#39;re not knowledgeable on politics.</p>

<p>Yeah I know what you mean with the tax burden being shifted to the poor and middle classes.
But that&#39;s not the fault of the left wing politicians like Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein who can&#39;t even
implement their policies because of money in politics strangling the honest politicians while enriching
the corrupt ones with corporate media airtime, funding, etc. (Bernie only got significant air time because he ran
in the two party system.....if he was a third party candidate, it would have been a near media blackout)</p>

<p>We are ruled by a NEOliberal and NEOconservative system controlled by fascist wannabes (hence the NWO is fascist/enslavement.)
&quot;Liberal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean left wing. The political spectrum has a left/right (economic) axis
and a libertarian/authoritarian (social) axis. </p>

<p>The liberal/conservative and democrat/republican thing is a corrupt
American-centric false dichotomy.
They are almost the same, in reality.
So liberal doesn&#39;t have a meaningful....well....meaning, anymore. (If it ever did.)</p>

<p>Let me explain a few things:
-Hillary is a right winger who happens to support LGBT rights, pro choice on reproductive rights,
you know, the incredibly easy shit. Yet, just because of that,
you can call her &quot;more liberal&quot; than crazy Ted Cruz, even though
she is ALSO a PRO-TPP, PRO-privatization, PRO-war, right winger.
It doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s a left winger like Bernie.
And do you see how useless calling something &quot;liberal&quot; is in practice?</p>

<p>As an analogy, Hillary&#39;s policies are like a pool of shit (right wing)
with sprinkled gold dust here and there (slight to moderate left wing policies here and there).
But it&#39;s still a pool of shit and she&#39;s still very right wing and very authoritarian.
Just because she has mercy on things like abortion, doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s left wing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean anything in practice.
If you tell me you&#39;re a &quot;liberal&quot;
I haven&#39;t got a clue where on the spectrum you are.
Hillary calls herself a liberal and gets away with it
(although to be fair, she even pulled the &quot;I&#39;m a progressive, not a liberal&quot;
trick only months ago.....HA!)
even though she&#39;s a NEOliberal
and nowhere near &quot;progressive&quot;.</p>

<p>So calling someone a liberal doesn&#39;t tell me anything.
Just like calling someone a &quot;radical&quot;.
No idea where on the spectrum that is because it&#39;s not an objective, specific area.
Only seems to be useful as an adjective when comparing people.</p>

<p>If you say &quot;Bernie is left wing&quot;
then I know he&#39;s on the left side of the political spectrum.
If you tell me he&#39;s a &quot;democratic socialist&quot; 
then I know he&#39;s left center
(but actually he seems to be almost centrist, so
it&#39;s probably more accurate to call him a social democrat,
someone who supports social democracy rather than democratic socialism
even though they&#39;re just next next to each other on the spectrum)</p>

<p>Many economists agreed with Bernie.
You&#39;re saying &quot;progressive&quot; high taxes are hurting the poor.
But who is delivering the so called &quot;progressive&quot; tax?
Right wingers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like calling Obamacare &quot;a leftist dream&quot;
IT ISN&#39;T.
Sure, it&#39;s a social program (left wing)
which is better than having absolutely nothing in place, (republican bullshit I believe?)
but it&#39;s privatized (right wing)
so runs for profit.....middle men like
rip off pharmaceutical corporations and insurance companies
take in huge profits with special contracts (rigged/favoritism/crony capitalism, a right wing concept).
They pocket profits they don&#39;t deserve (some drug companies charge like 5000% of what a pill
is really worth....some CEOs are literally sociopaths).
And they don&#39;t put the profits back into the system either.
The super rich are leeching from the poor and middle classes.</p>

<p>Why does walmart get subsidies (tax money)
while small businesses don&#39;t?
That&#39;s crony capitalism. The government is giving
an unfair advantage to a BIG corporation that doesn&#39;t
even need financial help, dodges tax, pays their workers low wages, etc.
Terrible.</p>

<p>Also, the way taxes work is also rigged.
Poor people are taxed a certain % that
most would consider unreasonable especially
with bills and housing costs, etc. added in.
Many people work hard only to come home late
and STILL struggle to pay the bills
and enjoy life. That is the conspiracy here.
Economic slavery.
Bernie offered a way out
with his &quot;new deal&quot;/political revolution.</p>

<p>The problem:
-corporations and billionaires dodge tax.
-the poor are disadvantaged (e.g. expensive AND shitty education).
-the bills are manufactured deliberately to be HIGH. (Gotta keep those peasant slaves busy! :/ )
-social programs are more expensive than they need to be. (e.g. Obamacare)
-tax is stolen from the people in other ways too like
war that no one signed up for, giving Israel aid to kill Palestinians, false flags, nuclear program and other nefarious agendas.
-nearly all wealth is generated by the bottom 90% yet most
goes to the top 1-10%....in what world is that fair, reasonable, necessary or logical?</p>

<p>The real fix:
-everyone&#39;s taxes don&#39;t get wasted, and don&#39;t get leeched by greedy corrupt bastards and warmongers.</p>

<p>-the super rich pay a more reasonable amount of tax, and ALL legal loopholes for dodging taxes become closed.</p>

<p>-everyone&#39;s taxes go towards educating the population (an extremely sound investment),</p>

<p>science/medical research encouraged by steady incomes rather than &quot;this company wants you to pretend to check if GMOs are safe wink wink...not ethical enough professor? Find another job.&quot; :o</p>

<p>-as well as more efficient/cleaner renewable energy, transport infrastructure,
nationalized healthcare and transportation for the working, traveling population.</p>

<p>In essence, it&#39;s about giving back the control to the people
rather than the corporations.
People become much more efficient when they receive help from others.</p>

<p>Imagine 2 groups of cavemen.
Group &quot;conservative&quot; want to discover things on their own.
Group &quot;democratic socialists&quot; want to nurture and educate everyone,
everyone shares knowledge, helps the vulnerable, no one is left behind, etc.</p>

<p>Who invents the wheel first?
This is why I say conservatism is literally conserving the status quo.
Our taxes should be used to better humanity, not fill the pockets of warmonger bankers and corporations.
It&#39;s nowhere near as &quot;pie in the sky&quot;
as it sounds, (even renewable energy is way more plausible than a decade ago)
it&#39;s just that there&#39;s so much misinformation out there
and we&#39;re so used to a corrupt system where there&#39;s always some &quot;problem&quot; (terrorism, poverty, war, homelessness, etc.).
It&#39;s bullshit. These are manufactured problems.
Humanity isn&#39;t this stupid, but the ruling class is just psychopathic.</p>

<p>The super rich take away our ladders.
Why not get us commoners organized and make our own?</p>

<p>Imperialism, dictatorships, the status quo, etc.
these have slowed down human progress for thousands of years.
We probably would have invented teleportation by now
if it wasn&#39;t for the psychopath ruling class.
Some time ago only
the rich could be educated or earn resources for discovery. 
Being <em>against</em> improving that, would have made you a &quot;conservative&quot;.
(&quot;no no, everything&#39;s fine, look my economy! I mean....our economy!&quot;)
It&#39;s playing on the side of the ruling class.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t joking about the French Revolution thing.
The entire ideology of conservatism is to protect the ruling class
while screwing ourselves over.</p>

I tried my best with the formatting....</p>

<p>Not saying Israeli people are evil, I&#39;m saying the Israeli government is generally pretty damn evil
with how they&#39;re occupying, oppressing and killing Palestinians, carrying out false flags, etc.
The Palestinians need that so called &quot;aid&quot; much more than the Israeli government. And America is struggling
because of the rigged system, so why should the struggling average Joe&#39;s tax money go to them?</p>

<p>It should
be those zionist billionaires who <em>apparently</em> love Israel so much....but the truth is, they don&#39;t give a damn about the Israeli people
or pretty much anyone else outside the elite club.
Zionism is political, nothing more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not thinking in black and white, trust me. 
But a political and economical movement founded with Netanyahu on board....
come on, that should raise alarm bells big time, even if you&#39;re not knowledgeable on politics.</p>

<p>Yeah I know what you mean with the tax burden being shifted to the poor and middle classes.
But that&#39;s not the fault of the left wing politicians like Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein who can&#39;t even
implement their policies because of money in politics strangling the honest politicians while enriching
the corrupt ones with corporate media airtime, funding, etc. (Bernie only got significant air time because he ran
in the two party system.....if he was a third party candidate, it would have been a near media blackout)</p>

<p>We are ruled by a NEOliberal and NEOconservative system controlled by fascist wannabes (hence the NWO is fascist/enslavement.)
&quot;Liberal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean left wing. The political spectrum has a left/right (economic) axis
and a libertarian/authoritarian (social) axis. </p>

<p>The liberal/conservative and democrat/republican thing is a corrupt
American-centric false dichotomy.
They are almost the same, in reality.
So liberal doesn&#39;t have a meaningful....well....meaning, anymore. (If it ever did.)</p>

<p>Let me explain a few things:
-Hillary is a right winger who happens to support LGBT rights, pro choice on reproductive rights,
you know, the incredibly easy shit. Yet, just because of that,
you can call her &quot;more liberal&quot; than crazy Ted Cruz, even though
she is ALSO a PRO-TPP, PRO-privatization, PRO-war, right winger.
It doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s a left winger like Bernie.
And do you see how useless calling something &quot;liberal&quot; is in practice?</p>

<p>As an analogy, Hillary&#39;s policies are like a pool of shit (right wing)
with sprinkled gold dust here and there (slight to moderate left wing policies here and there).
But it&#39;s still a pool of shit and she&#39;s still very right wing and very authoritarian.
Just because she has mercy on things like abortion, doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s left wing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean anything in practice.
If you tell me you&#39;re a &quot;liberal&quot;
I haven&#39;t got a clue where on the spectrum you are.
Hillary calls herself a liberal and gets away with it
(although to be fair, she even pulled the &quot;I&#39;m a progressive, not a liberal&quot;
trick only months ago.....HA!)
even though she&#39;s a NEOliberal
and nowhere near &quot;progressive&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment was really insightful to me. Thanks for putting the effort to write it up. I agree that humans are best if we work together. If everyone was honest 100% of the time and people asked questions we would have utopia in about 10 years I bet. </p>

<p>The thing we must figure out is how much can we trust our fellow man as a whole today? Another way of putting it, is we must know our enemy. And I believe our enemy is fear and it lives in all of us.</p>

<p>A good tl;dr for your comment is:
Everything is dualistic, but humanity is holistic. Humanity is Holly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m extremely glad you actually read my (admittedly long) post.
I did put a lot of time into it, edited it several times to ensure I didn&#39;t put unnecessarily long or irrelevant details.</p>

<p>I once made another very long post only to find the person I replied to, mocked it by replying with a meme GIF of George W Bush saying &quot;this shit here and this shit there, I didn&#39;t read&quot;
which pissed me off but I guess there&#39;s a lesson to be learned.
Don&#39;t give too much of your time/energy to someone who may not appreciate it
and even worse, spit in your face. :/
But with your comment, you seemed much more open and intelligent enough to consider different views. </p>

<p>Anyway, I strongly believe that while the human race has plenty of savages,
most people are naturally fairly reasonable.
It seems most evil is the result of ignorance, mental illness
or some other misunderstandings. I don&#39;t believe Satan exists
but I do think that evil has survived and replicated ONLY because
the people who rule us are evil themselves (or some of them, maybe some elites are
sympathetic to us commoners but scared of the psychopathic bloodlines or something
to really go against the NWO agenda, just speculating.)</p>

<p>We are ruled by the bankers who own the corporations
that bribe our politicians which make our policies. Everything comes back to politics
as a centralized issue. (&quot;Money in politics&quot;)
Nearly all our problems (poverty, homelessness, terrorism, global warming, mental illness/crime, energy crises, etc.)
are the indirect and direct result of how politics is played out.
He who owns the money supply, owns the nation/world.</p>

<p>I <em>also</em> believe that a utopia could be achieved in 10 years
or so with the right policies.
Or at least, a much more prosperous world.
It sounds like a cartoon ONLY because
we are so used to this system
which is controlled by the corporate banking elite.</p>

<p>Scientific research has been compromized for
a long time so I&#39;m sure we could have
made plenty of discoveries like
curing mental illnesses, aging, death,
unlimited clean energy, etc.
There&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that
Nikola Tesla found out how to obtain
free energy from the &quot;ether&quot; (the air? Gravity? Background radiation? Not sure)
and that some security agency (probably CIA)
confiscated the plans.
Man, Nikola Tesla was a damn genius
even if this isn&#39;t true
and yet he still died poor I think.
Shameful how brilliant people have been treated. :(
I think Benjamin Franklin conned Tesla
by not paying him for an invention Tesla was hired to make
for him (AC motor I believe).
Money is just paper. People are real. And life is finite.
The elite have absolutely no foresight in my opinion.
&quot;Enlightened ones&quot; my ass. Lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you just wrote. In a way I feel as though I am speaking to my brother right now. What I think is amazing to consider is we started out this dialog in disagreement. </p>

<p>I really believe Orwell hit the nail on the head with double-speak and double-think. The missing part of that equation is our conscience, which I like to call God. If people learn how to speak to people&#39;s subconscious, and do it for Good, eventually all beings on this earth will feel Loved. Our conscience is all we can truly trust at this point, because it only takes one &quot;demon&quot; to poison the well. </p>

<p>My father said it best, we are all naturally great rationalizers yet great estimators. For example, mathematically modeling the throwing of a balled up paper into a trash can would be extremely complicated. Yet we can do it instinctually. This is the balance I believe Neoplatonists advocate. </p>

<p>In my experience, people who have not learned to Trust unconditional Love have the hardest time seeing and bearing things. They are also some of the most atheistic, depressed, nihilistic people I know. </p>

<p>Everything goes back to dualism in my mind. 
People who want to be happy all the time will never find joy.</p>

<p>I also believe schizophrenia is a myth for people to not trust their tue nature. Why do we call it devil&#39;s advocate, and why do people enjoy winning at it so much?</p>

<p>Everything goes back to: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang</a></p>

<p>And many other true representations of this One idea.</p>

<p>Nothing is abstract.</p>

<p>And you are right, anyone who calls and thinks of  themselves personally enlightened is an ass.</p>

(I&#39;m also a millennial by the way) 
But no matter what age, we&#39;re all on the same side (of the people, rather than the immoral ruling class that abuse power consistently) 
but of course some people have been conditioned or misled to think
ideology X,Y,Z is the fairest way to run society, when it might actually be ideology A,B,C.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curios what it was in my explanations that clicked most
in <em>your</em> mind and cleared up specific misconceptions you personally had.
Maybe there&#39;s no point asking since everyone will respond differently
as different people have different misconceptions
(e.g. some blame &quot;immigration&quot;, &quot;political correctness&quot;, &quot;tax is theft&quot;, and other types of propaganda for
explaining why the world is not operating in a decent way, when it&#39;s actually the policies implemented by
the elite that drive us to war and poverty.)</p>

<p>but I&#39;m still interested what it was for you, whether
it was a specific topic (democratic socialism policies, conservatism, banking ruling elite, etc.)
or if it was how I explained why some misconceptions originated from.
Or simply that I spoke enough of my mind to make it clear to you that
I&#39;m genuinely on the peoples&#39; side rather than having a malicious agenda for personal gain, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess it was the tax explanation since
I can see why you think &quot;high taxes&quot; hurt the poor
but if you have the big picture added in (mass tax evasion, privatization and war wasting our tax money, etc.)
then you can see how it doesn&#39;t make sense to trust
the &quot;left wing policies&quot; that right wingers claim to implement.
I read that in the UK, the conservative party claims
they put £10 billion into their healthcare system
which sounds great, but they&#39;re either lying
or telling a half truth....those billions
aren&#39;t going to stretch as far
because privatization puts much of the money to
corporate (pharmaceutical/insurance/administrative)
profits that don&#39;t go back into the system.
Hence why the Red Cross has announced their
British healthcare service it&#39;s on its knees more
than ever, I hope people wake up and see the right wing governments
are not serving the people, but the ruling class.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the Yin Yang thing,
does it mean moderation/balance is important?
Like selfishness and selflessness?
Too much selflessness (e.g. letting someone use you unfairly)
hurts yourself and those that care about you.
Or have I totally missed the point?
Interesting perspective nonetheless.
Is this spiritual or philosophical?
I never understood spirituality due to my logical nature
(or alternatively, if you believe the third eye is the seat to the soul,
then I guess mine&#39;s really blocked....if that&#39;s a bad thing :/) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha welcome to the club my friend. It can be a dizzying and trying experience. I know people that have willfully given up on it and returned to being &#39;normal&#39; because it&#39;s too much to deal with.</p>

<p>Facing a world where the vast majority of the people that you know and interact with consider most of this stuff to be wacko talk can be frustrating. Trying to share info with them can result in them turning on you, at worst, and often times just losing respect for you and your opinions. This gives rise a difficult situation because you want to help them understand what&#39;s going on but also don&#39;t want to bring that stress on yourself and your relationships. Finding a balance between the two is key to not losing your mind on this front.</p>

<p>The differing info from all sorts of sources is also hugely problematic, as you mentioned. I&#39;ve been at this for a rather long time and I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve found two &#39;conspiratorial&#39; public figures, or even just two people that venture into these waters, that share the exact same beliefs about what exactly is happening. This causes immense headbutting and widespread labeling of almost everyone in the &#39;movement&#39; as disinfo agents, cointel, shills by this or that group or person etc. This can make it extremely tough to decipher what is real and what info you should take into consideration.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of other pitfalls that I have found but the best advice that I can offer is to take in as much info as you can (within the bounds of reason, not the &quot;Dairy Queen and Mick Jagger are trying to take over the world&quot; stupid level conspiracy theories) and use your personal discernment and be open minded. Doing so is important because you will have to piece together what you think is actually legitimate within this crazy moasic that the &#39;conspiracy&#39; world has to offer on your own ultimately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really easy to be overwhelmed by the scale of the fundamental shift in your view of realty that occurs as you become more awake. It&#39;s terrifying, especially when you&#39;re in the transition phase where you&#39;re still trying to live in normal society even though the sky is fucking falling haha. </p>

<p>Try to stay grounded and remember how all of this relates to your own life. You can&#39;t control much but you have control your small sphere of influence. The people around you want what you want: freedom and a better world for all, but they&#39;ve been conditioned to reject the truth. </p>

<p>At first this made me feel lonely and helpless, to not be able to communicate these things to people. But then I realized that if you try to force more on people than they can handle, you will hurt more than help, and it&#39;s actually selfish to upset their whole world view at once. </p>

<p>Meet people where they are. Everyone has issues they care about, and you can use those to lead them to deeper questions. People who care a lot about kids might be willing to consider the child trafficking rings and then from there learn about the cabals who run them and the tactics they use. Your friend who is very interested in wealth or economics could be led into a conversation about the federal reserve and money laundering, etc. </p>

<p>You just gotta be listening to people and looking for an opportunity to get them to ask questions, rather than just forcing a bunch of information on them. Make it feel like it was their idea, haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How have you guys dealt with becoming more aware and where else can I go to stay properly informed.</p>

<p>First, the definition of what a liberal is is from conservatives,notwhatactual liberals are, and that followed up when the conservatives took over the Democratic party and designated what were to be, &quot;liberal,&quot;policies and what were to be conservative.
The actual liberal voters were not consulted, this was imposed upon the Democratic voter as what a liberal is.</p>

<p>I had no idea so many fell for theliesand mostly ignoredthe, then very much to my surprise found that actual liberals thought other liberals believed that pile of horseshit, that included,</p>

<p>Liberals are opposed to individual gun rights, a lie.</p>

<p>Liberals are all anti-war peace freaks, (this lie while promoting that liberals started the Vietnam War,) a ridiculous contradiction carried out for 30 years.</p>

<p>Liberals are anti-religious, when liberals only want a strong separation between any religion and our government.</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>The main thing is to notice what they are trying to get you to believe, versus what is actually going  on, in your neighborhood, your community, at your schools, in your workplace, at your state government  versus what is being said, and who is behind the policies, conservatives or liberals and why.</p>

<p>Example,  OP do you know when wage suppression became national policy with a law?</p>

<p>OP, did you know that privatization of tax paid government services is not only theft of tax funds for profit, but part of the wage suppression policy?</p>

And I scrolled through it a little and wound up going through his whole account, that&#39;s when it changed me. I craved more, more truth. My life has always been boring, (same routine go to school do homework, shower, sleep). And this has really livened it up, knowing that there&#39;s more out there (even through its bad). But atleast I have something to fight against. Ive been a trigger ever since, and it&#39;s really impacted my life. I never used to be suicidal until I found out the truth. I deal with it by thinking it as I&#39;m doing god&#39;s work fighting against these globalist satanist scum. And that&#39;s what keeps me going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend you look into Ron Paul, read his best writings (such as the book End the Fed). Many left-wing activists are very honorable, have very good intentions (against war, against injustice, against carceral society, etc.). They are just misinformed.</p>

<p>Note that IMO right-wing people are also very often misinformed (pro-Israel, pro-capital punishment, etc.). </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the point, this fake left/right hegelian dialectic is sustained to divert people from the truth, i.e. the philosophy of liberty. Liberty is not an abstract or relative concept. Many authors have characterized it very well. Start with Ron Paul. Then move onto Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek, Murray Rothbard. Yet later to Bastiat, Tocqueville, Jefferson, etc.</p>

<p>I surmise ALL good-intended, non-traumatized, free-minded people are libertarian, whether they know it or not. For the simple reason liberty is True, it is congruent with nature.</p>

<p>So you were a liberal - recognize that term has been usurped. You are now a classical liberal. Since the &quot;presidential election&quot; has just ended, start with <a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">this</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you for being open minded. The key to beating fake news, satanic cultists, wars, trafficking, bailouts, and all the evils we see in the world is to strip government of their power. <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/mCAIj3YJUmg">All they do is steal our money and give it to their rich friends. Regulations are not there to protect anyone but the powerful</a></strong> by making it harder for smaller groups to start business and compete with the Comcast&#39;s and Exxon Mobil&#39;s of the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost 40. At my age, I tend to joke about mainstream news as though it&#39;s all fake. I remind people jokingly, &quot;you remember when we all died of ebola and Iraq had nukes?&quot; I hope my attitude demonstrates an absurdity and a confidence all at once. I started off years ago by being very indignant about it all, but of course, that never goes over very well.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a disagreement, ask leading questions. Never make accusations or allow yourself to get riled up.</p>

<p>Also, listen to podcasts that help you make sense of the world without getting you down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of them.</p>

<p>Free movement of goods, people and capital is a globalist idea.</p>

<p>It&#39;s  globalist ideology. And though they talk about unsound currency, they seem to forget all that when it&#39;s time to little corporate cheerleaders.</p>

The free movement of goods/info/people is awesome as long as there is no government taxing/regulating the shit out of it.

    <div class="md"><p>Too be fair libertarianism&#39;s foreign policy of isolation is kind of unrealistic in the modern world. Yes ideally wed like to just mind our own business but that is not the world we live in. Limited government is great but taxation is not theft also. The government created that money your job pays you to build an economy and brings portions of it back through income, gross product, estate taxes, etc etc instead of taking the bills directly out of the press so as to not cause inflation. You have no right to your money beyond what your work gives you and what the government takes back. Now how taxes how appropriated and collected is a fair debate but when I hear libertarians cry &quot;taxation is theft&quot; I laugh. Now socially libertarians are above all others. The across the board attitude of just letting oneself decide is beautiful and I wholeheartedly follow it. This is where regulations come in though as you need laws to stop outliers from abusing and oppressing others in society such as Thieves and murderers. You need an FDA and executive branch to make sure Martin Srhkeli isn&#39;t monopolizing the depression medicine industry, then starts selling you sugar mixed with Adderall and advertising it as the only medicine for depression at an outrageous price. The libertarians dream was the Golden Age in the 1920&#39;s and Tammany Hall is the perfect example of why regulation is needed. </p>

Make sure you have a skill within the profession that you can make money with as you try to score acting jobs (learn to grip, produce, edit, whatever). And as an actor, you&#39;ll be dependent on other people to cast you. To get around this, PRODUCE YOUR OWN PROJECTS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;satanic theories&quot; are here to hide and discredit what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>People like the Bushes and John Kerry go to college and join fraternities and secret societies, like Skull and Bones. They dress up in robes, light candles, chant secret songs, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>When they leave college, they join Bohemian Grove. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove</a> you can see a picture of Reagan and Nixon at the Grove, a picture of the giant owl sculpture they congregate around, and a picture of members dressed in robes performing the Cremation of Care ritual around the owl sculpture. There&#39;s also video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE&amp;amp;ab_channel=KevinGallagher">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE&amp;amp;ab_channel=KevinGallagher</a>.</p>

<p>The owl is also on the Bohemian Grove crest, and represents the roman goddess Minerva. The Podesta Wikileaks show Hillary making specific mention to Owl/Minerva <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680">https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680</a>.</p>

<p>The Podesta Wikileaks also show (presumably humorous) references to making sacrifices to Moloch, the Canaanite god of child sacrifice.
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333</a></p>

<p>Moloch is also associate with Baal, a Carthinian god. Baal was also the Skull and Bones nickname of Henry Luce, considered the most influential private citizen of his day.</p>

<p>George HW Bush&#39;s Skull and Bones nickname was Magog, referenced in the apocalyptic Book of Revelations as an enemy of God.</p>

<p>These traditions aren&#39;t so much satanist as occult, pagan, or pre-Christian. Some of the gods, like Minerva, are good, while others, like Moloch, are bad and likely inspiration for satan/lucifer/devil in later religions.</p>

I apply the same logic to myself, so don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m pointing a finger. I&#39;ve had moments in my life where I was chasing after something that didn&#39;t exist.

    <div class="md"><p>Kudos to you friend for being awoken! I have at one point in my life found myself in the very same shoes you have been wearing. In 2008, I was so against the Bush Administration and everything that crony capitalism was about I needed to voice my opinion for an outsider and that&#39;s why I chose Barry in 08&#39;. Soon after, actually it was in my political science class my freshman year of college when I was introduced to the struggle between realism and idealism and I came to the same conclusion as you. Human nature is flawed, mostly of what the left wants and preaches cannot be attained in a society therefore the mostly acceptable and realistic approach is through conservative policies.</p>

<p>I do agree with you for social issues such as abortion, marriage etc.. that there is no ultimate solution to this issue. This is going to be something that will be debated and fought for years to come. </p>

<p>The best thing I could recommend for you is to <em>always</em> question everything it is you come across. Follow the money and look at the endgame as I say. 9/10 out of you&#39;ll be able to find the real answer under the rubble of bullshit the left and right spit at each other. </p>

<p>If you are looking to find some honest journalism (which at this point you would be hard pressed to find) I always liked the NY Post. Based on the coverage of the election this year it seems that out of all the major news outlets they gave equal negative coverage to Hillary and Donald. </p>

<p>I would personally avoid the Washington Post at all costs because they aren&#39;t even trying to pretend anymore that they report 1 side of the story anymore. Also, I would try to keep an open mind about what some of the participants in this subreddit have to say. Most of the time they are so well versed all the information that is tossed around on here, you can take some of the more important points they uncover and be able to do your own homework on whatever it is they are saying and that way you can also draw your own conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, the &quot;shitty leftists&quot; thing is just stereotype crap
to make right wingers cringe at the left wing side of the spectrum
because as soon as you hear &quot;left wing&quot;,
BAM, you get an image of the dumbass &quot;smug liberal druggie woman activist with dreadlocks&quot; meme
(NOTE: left wing and liberal do NOT mean the same thing, but you get what I mean.
Clinton is MORE liberal than Ted Cruz because she at least is pro LGBT rights and basic shit like that
but she is NOT left wing, she&#39;s very right wing and very authoritarian.
I think &quot;liberal&quot; is only accurately used when comparing right wingers.
NEOliberals/NEOlibs and NEOconservatives/NEOcons are both very right wing and very authoritarian. 
That&#39;s the establishment&#39;s favorite, after fascism of course.)</p>

<p>As for right wingers, the stereotypical image is &quot;redneck gun nut with no education&quot;.</p>

<p>These are just stereotypes, maybe sometimes true but certainly
not true for most left and right. Most are just normal people
swayed one way or another due to certain circumstances or because
their neighborhood traditionally is left or right or whatever.</p>

<p>Even intelligent people get confused in politics when
they don&#39;t pay attention or don&#39;t care about politics.
I saw a reddit poster say &quot;hey, I thought the republicans
was the freedom party, am I missing something?&quot;
and this is an example of a normal person
having been conditioned to think the republican party is pro-freedom (LOOOOOOOOL)
when it&#39;s actually EXTREMELY authoritarian.</p>

<p>These stereotypes are there to divide us.
Some manufactured by the establishment, some made by
useful idiots who became super partisan (sadly).
There used to be people who said good things about Bush
and imagine now what they think after the 9/11 inside job thing.</p>

<p>I get frustrated at right wingers thinking the establishment is left wing when it&#39;s actually right wing,
but we need to focus on US (the people) VS THEM (the ruling class)
and not fight between ourselves.</p>

<p>But yeah....I&#39;m left center like Bernie but I don&#39;t do drugs.
Even so, I don&#39;t really mind if you smoke pot,
as long as you&#39;re aware of the dangers and make up your own mind, like with alcohol.</p>

<p>I think I understand why you wrote the left wing thing at the beginning of your paragraph.
It&#39;s because you want the Trump supporters 
(generally right wingers, mostly alt right)
to think this conspiracy sub isn&#39;t just full of right wingers (it isn&#39;t).
Plenty of pro Bernie posts in this sub.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the interesting thing.
You always hear &quot;right wing conspiracy nut&quot;
but the left are more awake because they looked
at the political angle too.</p>

<p>Right wing is literally serving the ruling class.
I can&#39;t believe people can&#39;t see it.
I think people avoid talking about this conspiracy
because it divides the people since
it takes an enormous amount of effort
to reverse the brainwashing of someone.</p>

<p>As for the gun rights thing, I understand your point, OP.
I hate guns, but this tyrannical government
can&#39;t be trusted.
Maybe a good compromize is to
only take away guns from dumbass gang members
in cities?
That still leaves an armed population in rural areas
and in cities where responsible people (not stupid gang members)
have access to guns.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;ve been skeptical because
the government has all kinds of shit
(drones, grenades, tanks, rocket launchers, etc.)
and so I think &quot;how the hell would pistols and rifles
stop a tyrannical government??&quot;</p>

<p>....but then again, maybe it&#39;s a little more complicated than that.
I wonder if guns were smuggled by the CIA,
not just drugs.....hmmm?
That could explain why gun crime is so damn
high in city areas.
So while I&#39;m still against guns in general,
maybe we should topple the government before
doing such a risky move.</p>

<p>In the meantime, taking guns away
from gangs seems like a good idea
in lowering gun crime without unarming the population.
What you say?
I think it&#39;s a good idea but I would need to see
hard statistics to confirm if it&#39;s a good idea
and if the establishment did or did not smuggle guns
into city neighborhoods like the Nixon administration
admitted to doing with drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel when it comes to gun control you either have to let everyone have them (as the rights argument is its a right we can&#39;t take away so you can&#39;t be selective about rights) or you need to take them away from cities and rural areas. I guess in this climate in an age where normal people I know all say they would revolt against the government if somebody else shot first... you can&#39;t take our only weapon away that the government doesn&#39;t control. But in a state or country where the government actually represents the people I see no reason to have this weapons that are more likely to accidentally kill someone then be used effectively for defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t see it as a right, I see defending yourself as a right but guns are just contraptions that kill.
That&#39;s my view, and I&#39;m only holding onto this &quot;wait a minute, don&#39;t completely ban guns yet, we have a tyrannical government&quot; idea because the government nearly never does things out of the kindness of their hearts, but for some nefarious purpose.</p>

<p>If there is a relatively safe way to crackdown on gangs (as in, not putting police in danger, but maybe use a water canon or something to destabilize them and then take their weapons and prosecute them)
then that could really bring gun crime rates down. </p>

<p>But of course, the biggest impact would be from improving education, massively killing the &quot;thug life/gangstaaa&quot; culture bullshit because people would actually want to learn rather than feel useless in this society (because of poor teaching quality/training) and resort to &quot;feeling at home&quot; with a gang of people in a similar situation, expressing themselves outside of the system that let them down. 
The music industry is so guilty with this shit.</p>

<p>Rap/hip hop/pop songs talking about violence, drugs, cars, sex, money, etc.
 Nothing against poetry, if you can make a living writing poetry, cool. But gangsta shit makes people value human life less and generally act like egocentric idiots. I know it&#39;s not all gangs and some are really just a bunch of friends &quot;acting cool&quot; without weapons or anything harmful but the gangstaaaa culture is <em>generally</em> toxic. </p>

<p>So IMO improving education (teacher training accommodating for all types of learners, visual, auditory, etc. stopping bullying the proper way) and cracking down on gangs would massively lower gun crime. I don&#39;t know why people shoot each other, but mostly likely the reasons are out of stupidity or anger and this can be avoided. As for police brutality, there&#39;s got to be something dodgy in the police training that makes them trigger happy against certain people compared to if they weren&#39;t wearing their uniforms.</p>

<p>.....but the government won&#39;t implement this shit because it won&#39;t help their agenda. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;satanic theories&quot; are here to hide and discredit what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>People like the Bushes and John Kerry go to college and join fraternities and secret societies, like Skull and Bones. They dress up in robes, light candles, chant secret songs, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>When they leave college, they join Bohemian Grove. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove</a> you can see a picture of Reagan and Nixon at the Grove, a picture of the giant owl sculpture they congregate around, and a picture of members dressed in robes performing the Cremation of Care ritual around the owl sculpture. There&#39;s also video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE&amp;amp;ab_channel=KevinGallagher">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE&amp;amp;ab_channel=KevinGallagher</a>.</p>

<p>The owl is also on the Bohemian Grove crest, and represents the roman goddess Minerva. The Podesta Wikileaks show Hillary making specific mention to Owl/Minerva <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680">https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680</a>.</p>

<p>The Podesta Wikileaks also show (presumably humorous) references to making sacrifices to Moloch, the Canaanite god of child sacrifice. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333</a></p>

<p>Moloch is also associate with Baal, a Carthinian god. Baal was also the Skull and Bones nickname of Henry Luce, considered the most influential private citizen of his day.</p>

<p>George HW Bush&#39;s Skull and Bones nickname was Magog, referenced in the apocalyptic Book of Revelations as an enemy of God.</p>

<p>These traditions aren&#39;t so much satanist as occult, pagan, or pre-Christian. Some of the gods, like Minerva, are good, while others, like Moloch, are bad and likely inspiration for satan/lucifer/devil in later religions.</p>

<p>Most of these people don&#39;t likely believe in these deities, any more than the guy in a fraternity believes in wearing a robe and paddling pledges as a form of religion. These are fun bonding exercises for the group.</p>

<p>However, some probably do believe. Singer Madonna, a Clinton supporter, seems very into Kabbalah, which is occult Judaism. Spirit cooking has a list of practitioners that seem pretty serious about it, like Podesta who hung a picture of it on his office wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chicago has some of the strictest gun control and some of the worst violence. Gun control is not about stopping violence.</p>

<p>Globalists like the Koch brothers own the Republican Bush family while Soros owns the Democrat Clinton family. Both were furiously trying to rig their own party primaries against outside candidates Trump and Sanders, in favor of owned candidates like Jeb and Hillary.</p>

<p>When that failed, they pushed narratives of fake news, faithless electors, and Russian hacking. None of these worked. The only option left is a total coup or declaration of martial law.</p>

<p>There are 100 million gun owners in the US. The armies of the US, Russia, China, all of Europe, and India don&#39;t even come close to 10 million combined. &quot;Common sense gun control&quot; of &quot;weapons of war&quot; that Hillary wanted is an attempt to disarm the largest standing army in the world, by an order of magnitude, the US population.</p>

<p>It&#39;s zionist.
Look at this shit dude:
<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/11/17/breitbart-news-network-born-in-the-usa-conceived-in-israel/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/11/17/breitbart-news-network-born-in-the-usa-conceived-in-israel/</a></p>

<p>Which is enough to make you question the entire
ideology if Netanyahu (Satanyahu) is on board.</p>

<p>But I never believed the alt right narrative that
it&#39;s &quot;immigration and political correctness&quot;
to blame for the problems in the world.
It&#39;s so dumb, it&#39;s amazing how many people have fallen for it.
I can understand believing the anti-immigration thing (makes more sense even if it&#39;s mostly not true)
but the political correctness thing is such a blatant scapegoat
on such a childish level.</p>

<p>Warning: sarcasm imminent: (purely to get a point across, not to insult anyone)
No no, don&#39;t blame the bankers who control the 
politicians....( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

<p>....blame how people talk! (Political correctness) ¯_(ツ)_/¯
....blame immigrants fleeing
wars that the elite started! (generally wars in the middle east nowadays)
.....blame immigrants fleeing from the economic
oppression from the corporate jobs outsourcing
the elite pushed for! (Super low wages in third world countries and moving
jobs there so natives in first world countries have less jobs and blame the natives
while third world country workers move to stop being screwed over in sweat shops and stuff)</p>

<p>....do you see what I mean?
Scapegoat. And Netanyahu likes it, probably because
it distracts from the real problems that fascism
and NEOconservatism have made by the ruling class.
Conservatism and the NEOs are political ideologies
were made to serve the ruling class (bankers, corporations, etc.)</p>

<p>Breitbart is not just after &quot;extreme left&quot; whatever that means.
(Does that mean communists or feminists??
(BTW I&#39;m not a feminist, I&#39;m a humanist....it&#39;s far less biased.)</p>

<p>But anyway, democratic socialism (left center),
centrism (center),
and social democracy (just between those two)
are the best regions IMO.
These are the true anti-establishment regions.</p>

<p>The elite don&#39;t want socialism for the peasants, they
want it for themselves (e.g. subsidies taking tax money from us and
giving it to corporations who don&#39;t even pay full tax and don&#39;t pay
their workers an acceptable wage).
But they don&#39;t want us to have fully tax-funded health care,
because they want to profit (privatize) from it.</p>

<p>Democratic socialism (George Orwell himself described himself as such)
is just nationalizing essential services such healthcare, education,
transport infrastructure, energy and science.</p>

<p>Privatization is the opposite (Obamacare is heavily privatized
with insurance companies and pharmaceutical company middle men
taking subsidies while pocketing the profits instead of putting it back into the system,
hence Obamacare is inefficient and shit....it&#39;s better than nothing, but still shit. 
The UK&#39;s NHS is much better but also failing as well because it&#39;s been privatized heavily in the past
several years by conservatives/NEOcons and NEOlibs).</p>

<p>Also, democratic socialism involves taxing the super rich at a more acceptable percentage
because they can easily afford to support the nation that helped them get that wealth in the first place.
E.g. a multi millionaire could keep the first 100K or 200K (a year) they earn,
but everything ABOVE that should be taxed at something like
30-70% depending on how badly the nation needs economic recovery
for the average Joe.
I&#39;m just giving rough numbers, I don&#39;t remember Bernie&#39;s
exact tax plan but it was decent.
Mine would probably more socialist than his but his is still good enough compared
to this shit system where we give corrupt billionaires tax breaks....
and then a lot of them just dodge tax anyway....O_o</p>

<p>In 2012, we had a right winger VS a right winger:
<a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2012.png">https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2012.png</a></p>

<p>Illusion of choice. They want us to pick one of their puppets.
The last 3 presidents (ALL SHIT) have been right wingers.
Yet there are still people who cling onto right wing politics (e.g. &quot;alt right&quot;)
because they think the establishment is communist....(ridiculous, the establishment
have gone to war with countries that wanted communism....)</p>

<p>The establishment is fascist (fascism/NWO is the goal) and the NEOcons are slowly trying to transition to fascists with false flags and shit trying to convince us to give away our freedom bit by bit.
That&#39;s my view.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t planning for this post to be so long
but I might as well add that
left wing means &quot;on the side of the people&quot;
and right wing means &quot;on the side of the king&quot; (the ruler)
since left wing and right wing were
coined from the French Revolution
where people sat to the left or right
of the king, depending on if they were
against the ruling class or not.</p>

<p>Just in case I didn&#39;t address your post properly,
I&#39;ll add this:</p>

<p>You said temperance and personal responsibility
are under attack....</p>

<p>But alcohol consumption isn&#39;t political at all.
For some it&#39;s just for social reasons
or they like the taste....
I hate the shit, it&#39;s toxic to the liver,
gives you a &quot;beer belly&quot;,
increases oestrogen levels in men (hormonal balance disruption)
and tastes shit anyway.
Politics plays no part in this, I don&#39;t know
how reading Breitbart made you think
the left is making us alcoholic, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying.</p>

<p>As far personal responsibility...
do you mean economically?
Because that&#39;s just the ruling class
saying
&quot;SOCIALISM?? NO PEASANT. WORK HARD IN MY SWEAT SHOP,
I MEAN BUSINESS, YOU&#39;RE POOR BECAUSE YOU DON&#39;T WORK HARD,
PEASANT&quot;</p>

<p>Dude, I&#39;ve met plenty of people who
work hard as hell and yet are taxed unfairly (too high a percentage for the poor)
and pay too much rent (haven&#39;t got a choice)
and so struggle....why should people work hard
only to struggle? That&#39;s economic slavery and I&#39;ve seen it first hand.</p>

<p>This is why I see conservative/right wing and the establishment
as being obsessed with trying to suppress the people,
stopping them climb the economic ladder.
They want us ALL POOR,
while they get richer and richer.</p>

<p>What&#39;s greed got to do with NWO?
I don&#39;t really know how the psychopath elite bankers
think but they literally have TRILLIONS of dollars.
So at that high level, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s greed.
I think it&#39;s control/slavery.
No idea why they&#39;re so petty that they want to
enslave humanity but history has shown that&#39;s
exactly what they want.</p>

<p>While the puppets (generally most politicians and corporations)
are in the &quot;greed&quot; category.</p>

<p>This is my world view.
Hope it makes sense.</p>
