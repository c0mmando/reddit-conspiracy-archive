    <div class="md"><p>CTR drove people off other subs.   Hence the large percentage of Trump supporters here.   If you visited eg R/politics during the election and said something anti-Hillary you would receive a dozen downvotes in seconds.   I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s like now, I no longer read the sub.   These people were being paid by the post and given obvious astroturf silliness like &quot;BidenBro&quot; they probably still are.   Hillary was merely a cog in the Soros machine.   It is still functioning.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Trump.   I support his supposed goal of detente with Russia, but I&#39;ll have to see it to believe it.   If he continues his current position of &quot;Israel first&quot; accompanied by bellicosity toward Iran (which shares a border with Russia) he will prove himself no better than Hillary would have been, possibly even worse.   </p>

<p>The arrogance of Hillary supporters and corporate Democrats provides another reason why non-affiliated people have a particular loathing toward latte swilling hipsters obsessed with feminism and identity politics.   Hence some people will come to Trump&#39;s defense even if they despise him.     </p>

<p>I would imagine that most posters here aren&#39;t ignorant enough to regard politics as anything more than (bad) entertainment.   The real decisions are made behind the scenes.  I mean Citibank chose Obama&#39;s cabinet for Christ&#39;s sake.  What does that tell you?  </p>

<p>The arrogance of Hillary supporters and corporate Democrats (and their disdain toward working class white men)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>can you provide some links to what exactly you&#39;re talking about? </p>

<p>unless you&#39;re part of the 1% that thinks more accessible health care, protecting unions and collective bargaining rights, protecting social security and Medicaid/medicare, raising minimum wage, and trying to raise the Salary overtime limit, are all bad things, they really do not have disdain toward <em>&quot;working class white men&quot;</em>, I&#39;m sorry that if you think the Democratic party isn&#39;t treating you like a special little snowflake by directing polices at only the <em>&quot;working class white men&quot;</em> while shitting on minorities but ultimately we want to see those same things you probably consider as good for your <em>&quot;working class white men&quot;</em> to be accessible to everyone not just white men.....  and if offering something to a bigger group than just white men makes that policy unrealistic, than maybe that policy shouldn&#39;t exist at all?</p>

<p>but let&#39;s look at some republicans that just LOVE the <em>&quot;working class white men&quot;</em>:</p>

<p>Wisconsin governor Scott Walker: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>compared busting up unions to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_compares_unions_to_isis_the_wisconsin_governor_thinks_fighting.html">fighting terrorist</a>, and proudly signed in to effect Right-to-work laws </p></li>
<li><p>opposed raising minimum wage because as he put it &quot;those are young people job&quot;.......(fyi wal mart, Mcdonalds and Kroger are the currently the top 3 employers in our country and its a republican saying minimum wage is fine)  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>so according to this republican, unions are bad, higher minimum wage is bad, and being able to be fired for almost no reason is good...... they really care about the working class up there.......</p>

<p>Kansas Governor Sam Brownback:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Literally went beyond bankrupting his state by making it the economic disaster zone, with the slowest growing wages in the nation </p></li>
<li><p>implemented trickle down economics for the rich and eliminating almost all business taxes....... than hiked up taxes on the <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/after-cutting-taxes-on-the-rich-kansas-will-raise-taxes-on-the-poor-to-pay-for-it-227cb06b7ee5#.n5t9yvojl">poorest people</a> to balance this problem...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Michigan Governor Rick Synder:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>also signed in right-to-work laws, because working class people in unions are apparently a bad thing......(it&#39;s funny how quick people are to vomit republican anti-union nonsense, but all the smartest/highly paid individuals belong to unions, doctors, pilots, professional athletes, even cops and they would NEVER give up their unions for good reasons)</p></li>
<li><p>now he is pushing to strip health care and pensions from municipal <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/11/30/public-empoyee-retiree/94697856/">retirees</a>, so working class people who worked their whole lives for the benefits promised to them may have them stripped because once again money is more important than people to republicans....</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Illinois Governor has refused to sign a real budget for 2 years now, </p>

<p>Bobby Jindal destroyed Louisiana&#39;s economy with trickle down economics also, then when revenue dropped he cut drastically cut education and public assistance spending</p>

<p>maybe you&#39;re talking about free trade deals, because President Clinton the democrat signed it in, that is true but i think it&#39;s funny that no one ever talks about the fact that more republican senators voted for NAFTA  than democrats, and nearly 3x as many democrats voted against it than <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/s395">republicans</a>....... </p>

<p>what about G.W Bush? he was a republican that was in office for 8 years immediately after Clinton, you would think if he really cared about the working class he would of done something about NAFTA? if he cared about the working class why would he push the economic fallacy called &quot;trickle down economics&quot; which is entirely based on the idea of ignoring the needs of the average working person and only focus on helping out the rich, because <em>eventually</em> they&#39;ll have gained so much extra they will start sharing more with those beneath them right out of the kindness of their hearts right?, surprise surprise it never trickled down, instead it helped crash our economy and to add insult to injury he signed TARP on his way out the door?! because apparently not having disdain for <em>&quot;working class white men&quot;</em> means allowing them to lose their homes, while reimbursing the same people and business who took advantage of them in the first place...........</p>

<p>honestly, besides Trump&#39;s campaign promises, what good has the republican party done for the working class in the last 100 years? they literally put money before people and don&#39;t give a shit about anyone not rich enough to eat the same table, but as long as they begin and end their campaign speeches with &quot; I love guns, god, and family&quot; working class people will continue voting against their own best interest.......</p>

<p>It was one of my favorite subs where you could find serious discussions about wars, 911, Religion, The Federal Reserve, etc. (Do you remember Zeitgeist?) </p>

<p>But now it has been completely overtaken by paid shills, alt-right trolls, shit posters and bots. Most of the posts here are distractions from what is going on RIGHT NOW on the world and some are so ridiculous that is hard to tell if they are just shit-posting or posting to delegitimize the users and visitors of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look for small, dedicated communities on reddit that have clear rules and transparent moderation. Try to focus on the content of the posts rather than just who is posting them. Places like T_D are considered to be &quot;safe spaces&quot; because they are not open to dissenting opinion or debate. Calling someone a shill is a debate-ender in the sense that it says: &quot;I don&#39;t care <em>what</em> you&#39;re saying because of who I assume (but cannot prove) you are&quot;, which is not a legitimate answer to the <em>content</em> of any point that someone is trying to make, just an attack on their character.

<p>You bring up healthcare and marriage. I don&#39;t have a solution for healthcare but you sound aware enough to know Obamacare is doomed to implode within a year anyway....no repeal actually necessary. As far as gay marriage, that remains a state level issue... I may have missed whatever Trump said about this, but it&#39;s going to take a lot of inertia, force, money and time for the federal government to invalidate marriages. It&#39;s far more profitable for them to go after states which have legalized marijuana. Anyone who claims they are going to do either however, is simply attracting support without actually appeasing these views (anti drug laws or anti-gay marriage).</p>

<p>The Islamic issue I have not seen borne out. If you have then I&#39;m disappointed that Trump kickstarted this frenzy up again. I know it was fear-mongering to begin with as 9/11 to ISIS are patently false/distorted media/establishment hot buttons, and I was hoping that like his views toward Russia, Trump would have actually done more due diligence before vilifying all Islamic people. Maybe he will eventually wise up... </p>

<p>Nevertheless, while I am nowhere near pleased with his election generally, I still see more truth from him than less thus far. </p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m politically conservative and socially liberal, which tends to place me within libertarian nomenclature, despite the fact that I loathe labels and parties of any kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it the Trump supporters who always bring up &quot;yeah, but the Clintons did x,y, and z!!&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck the Clintons. They both belong in jail. It&#39;s not about the Clintons. </p>

<p>None of the previous comments were discussing any particular candidate, though. They were discussing the alt right. That&#39;s not some sort of code word for &quot;Trump is bad&quot;. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re unaware, there is actually a difference between Trump supporters and the alt right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>White supremacist Richard Spencer coined the term <em>alt right</em> in 2010 to define a movement <strong>centered on white nationalism</strong>, and has been accused of doing so to whitewash the negative American connotations against overt racism, white supremacy, and neo-Nazism. (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <a href="/u/HabitualSmoker5">/u/HabitualSmoker5</a> is right. All alt-righters are racist. I would imagine that all alt-righters are Trump supporters. Which would meant that, while not all Trump supporters are racist, all of the racists are Trump supporters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like saying &quot;not all christians are methodists, but all methodists are christians.&quot; Can you see the distinction?</p>

<p>Your black friend can be a Trump supporter, but I highly doubt he would consider himself &quot;alt right&quot;. If he does, he is vastly misinterpreting the motives of the movement he is supporting.</p>

Most trump supporters are good people, don&#39;t compare them with those alt-right Neo nazis.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m politically neutral, but seek more as opposed to less truth, and as much as I might have to hold my nose while doing it, I&#39;m going to at least listen to Trump before condemning him. </p>

<p>I still am amazed at the number of people with relentless foot-stamping vitriol towards Trump yet can&#39;t point to anything he&#39;s actually done (not something he said...either during the campaign or allegedly 30 years ago) that warrants such a reaction.</p>

<p>And I have the same sentiment basically toward Alex Jones: I cringe at his God-Fearing American Patriot rhetoric, but I nonetheless appreciate he and others on his show who point out the hypocrisy in the MSM and idiots on the Left (or right, which admittedly occurs less frequently).</p>
