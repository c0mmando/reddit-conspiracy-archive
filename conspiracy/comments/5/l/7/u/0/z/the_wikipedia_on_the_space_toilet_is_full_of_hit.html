        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away. The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim. Near the funnel&#39;s rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction. The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about 1-foot (0.30 m) deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste collection bags may be attached and a fan that provides suction. Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers. Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan at the back of the vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag. When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste storage drawer. Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.&quot;</p>

<p>Nice huh? A waste storage drawer???</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_toilet">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_toilet</a></p>

<p>Check it out, that suction thing looks fun, eh guys?</p>

<p>Seriously though,
No mention who cleans it, or if stray particles enter the atmosphere of the space ship.... You know shit happens, though.</p>

<p>The part about the waste collection unit has ZERO citations. I could say it is floating all around them ,and it&#39;s just as credible as how they are collecting it.</p>

<p>I call shenanigans. We have astronauts in space with terrible living conditions where they have to bag their own waste, and also be exposed to God knows how many airborne microscopic pieces they are inhaling into their lungs and floating through and getting on them. They don&#39;t exactly have a shower they can go into everyday to wash themselves properly or the spaceship, which with its millions of gadgets and hoses and bleep blips everywhere must take an eternity....it must be a brutal, hot mess up there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it&#39;s late, having a little fun...ever try to figure out the temperature of space?</p>

<p>This is what they tell kids about it:</p>

<p>&quot;Some parts of space are hot! Gas between stars, as well as the solar wind, both seem to be what we call &quot;empty space,&quot; yet they can be more than a thousand degrees, even millions of degrees.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s also what’s known as the cosmic background temperature, which is minus 455 degrees Fahrenheit. So what would a thermometer in space reveal? Somewhere between those extremes — depending on whether it&#39;s in the sun or the shade.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what’s going on: Most of the gas in space is too thin to warm anything up. Essentially, there are not enough gas particles to &quot;bump&quot; into and transfer heat to an object. So if you were in space, but shielded from the sun, you would radiate away nearly all your heat pretty quickly and cool to the cosmic background temperature. Step (or float) into the sun, and you’d be warmed. Either way you&#39;d need lots of protection!</p>

<p>At the Earth&#39;s distance from the sun, a space thermometer with roughly half its surface is absorbing sunlightwould register 45 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;

<p>Yea, 45 degrees. Makes perfect sense, like everything about space. Weird how they always show things freezing when entering the vacuum of space. I call shenanigans in that, too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rockran, at least you can jump out. This is more like being encased in your shower along with every fart you ever made in the shower. You have a fart fan, but it just comes right back into the shower so it&#39;s like having stale farts over fresh ones over and over. And yes, when you crap into that tiny rice cooker of a toilet you are going to miss, especially because you are eating space food for months on end. Locked in your own miserable  ecosystem of tiny urine and fecal particles floating everywhere and a drawer of death where you store bags of crap. For the love of God.</p>

Remember, you are up there for months, it&#39;s gonna happen, multiply that by how many times you got to piss in the morning and miss, throughout the day, and multiply that by how many people are on the ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a shell. A prop. And what you see footage of, is fake astronauts in a zero g high altitude maneuver. Hence interviews are short and they are always bobbing up and down. </p>

<p>Notice how they are always perfectly groomed? Where is all the hair go when they shave? Add that to the crap floating around. But take a look at the interviews and see for yourself how they are bobbing up and down. And notice the ones with the females how their hair is sprayed into looking like it&#39;s floating upwards. Some of the interviews are also done with them hanging upside down in a Earth gravity. Rockran, you have been had. It&#39;s cool though I was thinking like you once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and all of <em>this</em> in front of expensive equipment... you know, the stuff that&#39;s keeping them floating in orbit and not crashing down to Earth.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all up having a good time, like it&#39;s business as usual!</p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t get started down the rabbit hole how they have figured out C02 recycling on such a grand scale, with plenty of room to spare for science equipment and living quarters, food storage, well it&#39;s a science lab, it&#39;s massive right? Surely they will implement that technology down on Earth so we won&#39;t suffer more climate changes...........</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, What happens when they sneeze? Brush their hair? When eating and you wipe your face and food particles get everwhere, once those particles smear on a napkin and dry, they would enter the air, and be floating around. Every dust , hair, food, bodily fluid and waste, sweat, and liquid particles you can think of would be everywhere without gravity. </p>

<p>every time you go to use the restroom, or use a towel, everything has all these particles that in the vacuum of space would be floating everywhere. Plus there is no gravity so doing things are that much more difficult. There is no safe way to take a crap in a vacuum and contain every fecal particle. It&#39;s obvious it&#39;s all a lie. Just them doing segments on high altitude aircraft. If you look at them sometimes it looks like they are hanging upside down to imitate gravity. It&#39;s the biggest hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it&#39;s late, having a little fun...ever try to figure out the temperature of space?</p>

<p>This is what they tell kids about it:</p>

<p>&quot;Some parts of space are hot! Gas between stars, as well as the solar wind, both seem to be what we call &quot;empty space,&quot; yet they can be more than a thousand degrees, even millions of degrees.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s also what’s known as the cosmic background temperature, which is minus 455 degrees Fahrenheit. So what would a thermometer in space reveal? Somewhere between those extremes — depending on whether it&#39;s in the sun or the shade.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what’s going on: Most of the gas in space is too thin to warm anything up. Essentially, there are not enough gas particles to &quot;bump&quot; into and transfer heat to an object. So if you were in space, but shielded from the sun, you would radiate away nearly all your heat pretty quickly and cool to the cosmic background temperature. Step (or float) into the sun, and you’d be warmed. Either way you&#39;d need lots of protection!</p>

<p>At the Earth&#39;s distance from the sun, a space thermometer with roughly half its surface is absorbing sunlightwould register 45 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;

<p>Yea, 45 degrees. Makes perfect sense, like everything about space. Weird how they always show things freezing when entering the vacuum of space. I call shenanigans in that, too.  </p>
