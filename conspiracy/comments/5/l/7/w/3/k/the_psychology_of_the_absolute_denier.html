       I see this every single day. It never ends and shows the same behavior patterns every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
       An article pops up explaining some political or geopolitical or social situation, and the well informed person who does their best to research goes to explain in usually very thorough terms what may in fact be happening. They take the time and energy and links to explain the scenario, and as many of us know, these scenarios have a deep history, are usually diabolical in many cases, and are tied in with other facets of politics, social control, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The denier on the other hand, does what the denier does. They REACT. They don’t respond. They immediately go to name calling, telling you about your tin foil hat, anything, anything, but face the situation and the possibilities that may surround the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this on Facebook all the time. One thing I noticed is that the people who resort to this type of reaction never have profile pics of themselves, usually have a new account, and just seethe with anger. They stomp, they bitch, they fuss, they insist on the last word. Like any of us really give a fuck about your last word and your tantrums.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why call us crazy or stupid or laugh at us? For trying to improve the way of life for the species? For demanding honest investigation into events? Does it even occur to you that no matter how many names you call us, that you can’t stop the curiosity of people who actually want to learn about the planet they live on? That our intention stems from the pursuit of truth and to help our fellow man?
      </p>
      <p>
       So just keep doing what you’re doing. Stamp your feet. Get pissed off. Call people names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someday, and sooner than you think, because it’s already happening to a degree, the truth will come out. And all the people you laughed at and made fun of will maybe come back to your mind and you’ll maybe go, “Oh, shit, they knew it all along, I could have listened and learned something. Maybe we could have solved this sooner if everyone paid attention” But maybe not. After all, most of you are stubborn as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get why many of you deny. No one wants their reality bubble burst. No one wants to hear that their leaders are corrupt to a point of surrealism and that we’ve basically been lied to our entire lives. It’s a tough pill to swallow. But you can’t fix problems without recognizing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don’t research conspiracy theories to be cool or to be part of a clique or to think they’re smarter than everyone else. I was much happier not knowing any of this shit. None of us want to be right about this shit. But freedom is an interactive process. You have to be involved. That means researching cross referencing, debating, activism, taking a part in the process. You should be lucky there’s people who want to do that. The government won’t do it for you and the mainstream media won’t either. So someone has to take charge. Let it be the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse case scenario, we’re wrong about certain theories or situations. Then THANK GOODNESS! Best case scenario: we all make the world a better place and get alot of these people brought to justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t expect people to believe a conspiracy researcher right off the bat either. You shouldn’t. No one should buy any news at face value.  Deductions take time and thorough research. By denier I don’t mean the person who debates civilly and brings alternate perspectives to the discourse for consideration. I’m all for that. But if all you have to contribute to a conversation is put downs and insults, then YOU’RE THE ONE WITH THE PROBLEM. And more and more people will learn to ignore you. If you need attention that badly, go play in traffic. :)

       Agreed entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a problem that afflicts too many people of all classes, races and political views.
      </p>
      <p>
       People LIKE to be told what to think. And the more authoritative the speaker or writer (or their perceived reputation) the more likely the consumer will attach value to their opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is deadly and has no place in modern discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It opens up the world to pernicious lies that will only come to roost with time and repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
       My field IS PR, News, Broadcast and Media. We are experts at this very act. Usually it was in the effort, traditionally, to sell a product. Now, it is used to sell a viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberals, Conservatives, everyone, is so accustomed to believing their favorite mouthpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we will continue our descent into the fires.

       Exactly. This Machiavellian philosophy of might equals right is super dangerous. It's understandable, though. People grow up thinking authority has the answers. Parents then teachers, then cops, then celebrities, MSM and politicians. But they don't. It's being used as a form of arrested development and thought control.

       Let me ask you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see any possible solution, a reasonable way out of this whirlpool?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought about this often and I just do not see how this is resolved. The solutions I see all involve violence and insurrection, a forced change as the Allies put upon Nazi Germany following WWII. And it could come from either side, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone must, some day, decide that this charade will end. The victors will decide the narrative, but there can be no extended period in which each group believes the others are liars and/or traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems this only can end with blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that there are other ways out of this trap, but it is a trap we created. It may not become deadly until our children or grandchildren are the victims, but I hope we can find some common ground answers before it comes to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am stumped for answers.

       Well the blood is already spilling. And will continue to spill in certain situations. But we just moved into a new world. For the first time, we have peer to peer information. Decentralized information. That in and of itself is the largest threat to the global elite, who have always controlled thought through consensus manipulation. Now that's threatened. You can see them already trying to fight beck by declaring fake news this and fake news that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The change will happen organically. One by one people will wake up. It will reach a critical mass, it will have different types of revolution, some bloody, some civil. But eventually the decentralized philosophy of discourse will become the norm, and centralized information control will go the way of the VCR and DVD player.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as people stay involved, as long as crowd sourced investigation is a factor, as long as people have a desire to search for truth, the paradigm will shift naturally and this old paradigm will die a natural death I think.

       Gather friends to meet in person - call it a bookclub, serve wine &amp; snacks; share a single, in-depth article that merits thought &amp; discussion.  Hell, print a copy of the article with margins allowing you to inject a few inked notes and paper-mail it to some friends on your invite list.  Have them turn phones off / leave phones in car or by the door (and offer an alarm clock if they need to check in regularly like for babysitting or whatever).
      </p>

       Share time &amp; breath (con-spirare!) with friends, practice noticing and understanding body language, break through the stupid cold "wall" of computer monitors that allows us to say trollish things that we wouldn't've said in person.

       <li>
        Keep the dogma simple. Make only 1 or 2 points.
       </li>
       <li>
        Be forthright and powerfully direct. Speak only in the telling or ordering mode.
       </li>
       <li>
        As much as possible, reduce concepts down into stereotypes which are black and white.
       </li>
       <li>
        Speak to people’s emotions and stir them constantly.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use lots of repetition; repeat your points over and over again.
       </li>
       <li>
        Forget literary beauty, scientific reasoning, balance, or novelty.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Focus solely on convincing people and creating zealots.
       </li>
       <li>
        Find slogans which can be used to drive the movement forward.

       The list, apparently, was pulled from Mein Kamph's formula for coercion. If the author of the article I read is to be believed Hitler based much of thoughts on coercion on the writings of Gustave Le Bon a 19th century writer known for his works "Man and Society", "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind", "The Psychology of Politics and Social Defense" and others.

       Indeed. These simple points of propaganda were then amplified by the work of Edward Bernays, whom once finished with the Nazis, came to the USA to lead us from a nation of self reliance and independence into a world of consumerism and codependence.

       There's a great documentary called State of Mind, the Psychology of Control, that breaks it down brilliantly. They even discuss some guy, I forget his name, who lived in the same period as Machiavelli that broke down the psychological warfare the elite used on the people and how to counter it.

       In all my years modding this sub, reading/commenting on Reddit and Digg before that, I've seen all of those same things from
       <em>
        both sides
       </em>
       of every single controversial topic you can imagine. Neither side ever has any right to claim moral superiority over the other side because both sides do it in equal amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who choose to ignore
       <em>
        that fact
       </em>
       are truly the ones with the problem.

       Edit: After further thought, pizzagaters have not stuck to that 1:1 ratio. Believers in pizza=pedophilia have violated our rules against personal attacks on other users at least 10 times as much as the skeptics.

       Oh I agree completely! It's the same psychology overall. In fact I wrote an essay about that two weeks ago. The know-it-all. Everyone knows EVERYTHING! In many cases it's worse. This is why humility is paramount in research.

       That's understandable tho. I'm not condoning it at all, it's understandable. These people are letting their passions supersede reason. Think of the subject matter in and of itself. Obviously they need to tone it down a few notches, in fact it will help their credibility (if pizzagate turns out to be the truth)

       The reaction from PizzaGate is understandable though.. You have people worried about the safety of innocent children potentially being abused, possibly even murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you personally believe PizzaGate is real then it's going to hurt when someone denies that view point because of the implication of children and the frustration behind that..
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my opinion though because I personally have gotten in heated debates with users over PizzaGate and am on my last warning anyway. It's just a heated subject because of the implications.

       It is not logical to assume that people who do not accept the pizza=pedophilia code theory don't worry about the safety of children.

       And I understand that. It's infuriating personally to believe that such a thing could be happening to children and then people just brush it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's understandable because people want "proof" or "evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it ties in with cognitive dissonance which I've been guilty of.

       Anyway sorry that I've resorted to lows with other users before. Conspiracy is my home and I'm one more incident away from being banned from here which I don't want as I'm trying to spread truth and awareness.

       You're so right about the anger. Once they realize they have no discourse they resort to insults. Insults are for the dim witted.

       A well spoken discussion, thank you for this!

       Aren't we all here to learn something, learn hidden truths? No one wants to stay oblivious and left behind, there's no harm in digging through articles and books and maps to check out the world around you.

       The deniers only want to swallow that blue pill and go back to sleep. The fact of the matter is, many things are hidden from humanity and it takes
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       to learn what happened and why.... the entitled people demand results here and now. Well, good luck with that!

       Gather friends to meet in person - call it a bookclub, serve wine &amp; snacks; share a single, in-depth article that merits thought &amp; discussion.  Hell, print a copy of the article with margins allowing you to inject a few inked notes and paper-mail it to some friends on your invite list.  Have them turn phones off / leave phones in car or by the door (and offer an alarm clock if they need to check in regularly like for babysitting or whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
       Share time &amp; breath (con-spirare!) with friends, practice noticing and understanding body language, break through the stupid cold "wall" of computer monitors that allows us to say trollish things that we wouldn't've said in person.
