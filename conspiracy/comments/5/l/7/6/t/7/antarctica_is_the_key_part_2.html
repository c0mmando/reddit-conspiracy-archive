       Senator Richard Russell served 38 years in the Senate, and was its senior, and one of the most influential, senators at the time of his death in 1971. He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1951 to 1969, and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1952.
      </p>
      <p>
       A report, classified Top Secret until 1959, when it was downgraded to Secret. and not released until 1985. detailing his UFO encounter was made available by the Fund for UFO Research and its chairman, Dr. Bruce Maccabee. Several key documents were obtained by the group through the Freedom of Information Act..
      </p>
      <p>
       "The three observers were firmly convinced that they saw a genuine flying disc," says the Air Force Intelligence report, dated 14 October 1955.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes on to say Russell and his two traveling companions spotted the UFOs on 4 October 1955, while traveling by rail across Russia's Transcaucasus region.
      </p>
      <p>
       "One disc ascended almost vertically, at a relatively slow speed, with its outer surface revolving slowly to the right, to an altitude of about 6000 feet, where its speed then increased sharply as it headed north."
      </p>
      <p>
       The second flying disc was seen performing the same actions about one minute later. The take-off area was about 1-2 miles south of the rail line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russell "saw the first flying disc ascend and pass over the train," and went "rushing in to get Mr Efron (Ruben Efron, his interpreter) and Col. Hathaway (Col. E. U. Hathaway, his aide) to see it," the report says. "Col. Hathaway stated that he got to the window with the Senator in time to see the first (UFO), while Mr. Efron said that he got only a short glimpse of the first. However, all three saw the second disc and all agreed that they saw the same round, disc-shaped craft as the first."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Air Force report was written by Lieut. Col. Thomas Ryan, who interviewed Senator Russell's companions in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on 13 October, after they arrived there from Russia shortly after the sighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his report, Col. Ryan called the sightings "an eyewitness account of the ascent and flight of an unconventional craft by three highly reliable United States observers. He added that Col. Hathaway led off his account of the sightings by saying: "I doubt if you’re going to believe this, but we all saw it. Senator Russell was the first to see this flying disc. We've been told for years that there isn't such a thing, but all of us saw it."
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA documents show that the agency later interviewed the three eyewitnesses in the Russell party-and also a fourth person, who had seen the UFOs -whose name was blacked out on the CIA report prior to its declassification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpreter Ruben Efron told the CIA that visibility was excellent. As one UFO approached the train, he said, "the object gave the impression of gliding. No noise was heard and no exhaust was heard, and no exhaust glow or trail was seen by me." After the encounter, Senator Russell told the men with him: "We saw a flying disc. I wanted you boys to see it so that I would have witnesses," according to the CIA documents. And an FBI memo, dated 4 November 1955, also discusses the sighting-and admitted Col. Hathaway's testimony "would support existence of a flying disc".

      <p>
       Remark: SS-E-IV holds the necessary note, that the “Haunebu III”
Is a great work of German technology in development, because of the
situation of materials all work should be focused on building the available Haunebu II.
Together with the light flight gyros “Vril” of the Schumann Group we could surely fulfil the
Demands of the Fuehrer on time.

       These are inter dimensional portals. At the north , you have The Northern Lights, an energetic portal that moves outward.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the south, you have an inward dimensional portal. Agartha is not so much it's inside our hollow earth, or underground. It's in another dimension accessed  by this portal at the south of our Earth. And a few other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are important areas on the surface of our planet. Earth has an energy grid. The poles are not just some arbitrary thing you tune a compass to.

       This is what they are protecting. And why we never see the poles or real pics of the Earth from NASA. And why most of our past is distorted broken artificial fragments.

       They don't want you to know.

       -Byrd went there. But he didn't know he went through a portal and back out. But he entered into the amorphous field of the dimensional grid probably seemlessly. It is quite vast. Doing so does interesting things. Theoretically he could of re entered into a slight parallel of the reality he left. Of course Byrd, or even us would barely know the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a different effect when entering with the body, or with the mind.

      <p>
       The Bermuda triangle is another exit point similar in what it does. And for everyone always saying they want off this planet, that's one option.

       This is a common misconception spread here.  There are plenty of real pictures of Earth from NASA as well as images of the poles.

       First link has very blurry
       <a href="https://imgur.com/cayuHJV">
        stitching
       </a>
       - I'm sent this all the time when I ask about Antarctica and I keep getting the same shit link. It's not good enough to show me something that looks like a child cooked up on ms paint. 
Third link doesn't even have Antarctica.
       <br/>
       Fourth you can't (or at least I can't work out how to) zoom in and get some detail. I want detail. It's not enough to say Antarctica is there but not show in enough detail
       <em>
        what else
       </em>
       is there.
       <br/>
       The second link maybe has the most merit to it, but once again as we zoom in on the south Pole (images 5/6) it gets very very blurry. The fact is there are no high quality images of the poles. At least none easily available to the public. Now I know you can list off a good handful of reasons as to why we don't, but I could also list off a hundred more as to why we should. We've been visiting the poles for at least 100 years. I just don't believe that a century of exploration has accumulated to zero defined pictures of the poles.

       the first one literally has a drawn in border and is covered in clouds, second is clearly a composite of several images and doesnt actually show the surface in detail, third again doesnt show you any clear detail of the surface, fourth doesnt either. I mean I get that you're just trying to post non-NASA images of the continent but if you're posting these links as a "see? they aren't hiding anything"  its kinda useless

       I imagine how it would work all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have a general idea of what you mean. From what I am understanding of these energy portals , which are on a grid, is that they can be influenced. And that many of them are being infused and amplified with negativity. Especially in areas in the middle east. And once the portal receives all these intense negative thought forms and negative emotions they are amplified and enter the grid and have an effect on the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we know this, then it's a safe bet they have figured it out, and this is why certain portals have been a source of perpetual conflict and intense animosity is to keep this grid dysfunctional. So they can work their agenda of oil and debt enslavement. If these areas are healed it would bring a transformation to our world.

       That's tremendous. I immediately thought of the pink slime in Ghost Busters feeding off negativity under the streets of NY. While I agree healing negative emotions and dysfunction would transform our world, I can't imagine it becoming a source of usable energy. OTOH, when I feel good I have positive energy. I feel better, work better, smell and speak better. I also see TPTB engaging in disruptive weapons and continued conflict, so maintaining this negativity seems to be their goal. Got anything I could read up on this topic?

       Oh wow. The Ghostbusters idea is a great connection. Very perceptive of you. You know...I think once we figure this out I bet we will find evidence that has been subconsciously embedded in our art and movies that represent this forgotten knowledge, only we didn't make the connection.

       If you would like more perspective this is what I started working on last night. It has a great introduction from Seth about how the coordinating energy points work,

       You don't need to imagine it, Tesla proved we're surrounded by free electricity.  We're just not harnessing it is the problem.

       This relates to the idea that ancient shamans could walk through portals. To us they are strange rocks we can't figure out.

       That is viracocha, an ancient God in our terms, but in this depiction doesn't it look like he is walking through a doorway? Like you would reach into the rock and separate it outward to make a doorway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the stones of Pumu Punku. For example, Viracocha is right above this doorway

       Yea it's accessible for scientific purposes, but it I think it takes a certain type of awareness to use it. Particularly usually the people researching it are in a type of awe and confusion. Obviously that mindset won't open it.

       We may lose artifacts in these stupid wars but I think what we need to know is all over our world, and the best discoveries are still to come.

       I completely agree with you. I think the stupid wars happen BECAUSE of the artifacts. I think all of the problems in the Middle East aren't about oil or terrorists or any of that shit. It's about the ancient artifacts that need to be destroyed before people discover the truth (whatever it is) about humanity, our history, and our planet.

       How does the physics work of a hollow earth? I'd expect water to flow towards the center of the earth like it does where I live.  I know there are lots of dry tunnels that go very deep into the earth, but your saying the entrance is in the ocean right?

       <em>
        This

       being the entire implication that stems from what you listed aswell as various other material (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAfflNPG6Vk">

       ). The earth is hollow and there are ancient civilisation down there. The North Pole, Antarctica and Argentina are key locations in this conspiracy. Argentina being the easiest access point to Antartica geographically, which fits in with the whole "Hitler fled to Argentina" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sometimes find material on subreddits, but it's mixed in with so much stuff I don't care about. Even then, the good threads are oftentimes a rehash of the same old material. And the old material is good. It's visually compelling (none of that "it's blurry" bullshit) and provides a clear narrative, the one I listed in the paragraph above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'dd love to come into contact with some Argentinians to ask them about their view on the matter. Do they widely concider this bullshit? (or what about the Hitler escaping to Argentina story?) Surely, there must be some redditors currently residing in Argentina who have done the research?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'dd love to read more "hands-on-approach" recent research by locals or people who managed to find to time (and budget) to investigate the matter locally, rather than through a computer screen.

       I love this post! This is one of the coolest conspiracies I've come across personally. I've been digging and digging through all information regarding Antarctica that I can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of us that love a good visual aid in exploring far off lands, I've got some stuff for you -
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you like to see some geographical
       <a href="http://www.pgc.umn.edu/maps/antarctic">
        maps
       </a>
       ... Some are classified and have been locked. (Weird, it's just ice, right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Have fun here with some
       <a href="http://pgc.umn.edu/imagery/satellite">
        landsat imagery
       </a>
       too.

       I have pictures of coal from the Antarctic.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Coal is a non-renewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form. That means what is in the ground now is all there is and we can’t realistically make more.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The energy in coal comes from energy that was stored in giant plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swamp forests, even before the dinosaurs! When these giant plants and ferns died, they formed layers at the bottom of the swamps.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Water and dirt began to pile up on top of the dead plant remains. Over thousands of years pressure and heat would build up on top of the plant remains, undergoing chemical and physical changes and pushing out the oxygen, turning these remains into what we call coal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If there's interest in seeing the coal, I'll upload it.
      </p>

       Lots of neat events going on

        Russian Aircraft, Lisunov Li-2T, Crashed on takeoff on 23rd December 1968. Antarctica
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1959, 10 nations
       <em>
        including
       </em>
       the United States, made Antarctica off-limits to any colonization. A treaty was put in place, which remains intact still. This was Entered into force June 23, 1961,
       <em>
        officially
       </em>
       . Over 50+ nations now have signed off on this treaty. 
Has there ever been a treaty that has lasted as long, between all industrialized nations? What other landmass has no real-estate that is owned by
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       ? Certainly this should make everyone think.

        Operation Highjump, wiki
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Operation Highjump commenced 26 August 1946 and ended in late February 1947. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation Highjump's primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Unlimited funding, 8 months to complete the task... that's quite the undertaking for an exploration mission! That's certainly a fleet of power heading out to that ice!

      </ul>
      <p>
       And a fun fact in closing to get your conspiracy wheels turning -
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        On May 3, 1958
       </em>
       , the United States proposed to the other 11 nations participating in the joint scientific committee that a conference be held, based on the points of agreement that had been reached in informal discussions.....
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        July 29, 1958 NASA was created
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that was certainly an interesting few months, they must have gotten a jolt of something that sparked this interest

       I don't think U-boats could dive to 400 meters. As far as I can find, ww2 era German U-boats had a maximum depth of around 300 meters.

       I am so ridiculously interested with in Antarctica, between the Nazis and the fact thats its a fucking massive continent that is basically off limits and used to be a temperate forest...i mean there is so many potential discoveries, from new species of dinosaurs, to a potential unknown civilization, to the more "out there" theories about inner earth. We should sneak down there somehow lmao

       Absolutely good post. And no one here is shilling or trying to ram their opinions down other's throats. Anyways with that out of the way lol 
So where does outer space fit in to the hollow Earth theory? Would all planets be hollow as well? Is ours special? Maybe artificially created? Is the whole universe a lie to make us feel small and insignificant? I find this theory fascinating and a hell of alot more believable than the flat earth bullshit.
