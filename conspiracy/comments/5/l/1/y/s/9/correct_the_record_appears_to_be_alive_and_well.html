    <div class="md"><p>Yep. If you express an opinion that is not part of T_D accepted reality, you sir are a shill. Never mind that a shill is technically &quot;a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.&quot;</p>

<p>So you having an opinion means you are actually in a close relationship with the opposition. Very cut and dry. You are either with us, or you are a shill. </p>
