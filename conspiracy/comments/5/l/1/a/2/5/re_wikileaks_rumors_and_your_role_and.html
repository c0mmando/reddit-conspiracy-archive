        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The rumor Wikileaks is compromised is seriously damaging to Wikileaks, completely undermines their trust and mission. Also invalidates any new leaks they&#39;ve released. If you think they&#39;re compromised you better be damn sure of it. Because you&#39;re cutting of the biggest artery and lifeline we have at exposing corruption. Words and propaganda are powerful make sure they aren&#39;t being used against you regarding Wikileaks. This includes all Assange rumors and speculation. Be very careful with the power your words hold. </p>

<p>Edit: Sorry should add this. I DON&#39;T know if they have or haven&#39;t been comprised. But I won&#39;t state or belief either position unless I have some evidence to back either one up.  I won&#39;t go around saying Assange is dead and wikileaks is a front unless I know for sure. Because they&#39;re still releasing important leaks and have in he past. And as far as I know their accuracy record still stands to today.</p>

<p>Again, I DON&#39;T know one way or the other, and also DON&#39;T go around screaming they&#39;re compromised </p>

<p>This includes all Assange rumors and speculation</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t talking about people being certain. You&#39;re talking about speculation. The people asking questions are doing so because they speculate that it&#39;s compromised. Also, you are re-framing the situation (something the new Wikileaks mods have been doing since they were added). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ask question but don&#39;t assume you know it&#39;s comprised because it just &quot;feels&quot; like it is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are lumping together anyone speculating about the situation. Not everyone is assuming, and not everyone is doing so because it &quot;feels like it is&quot;. It also &quot;looks&quot; like it is. Getting to the truth won&#39;t happen if you lump people together and accuse them of undermining Wikileaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because you&#39;re cutting of the biggest artery and lifeline we have at exposing corruption.</p>

<p>The people speculating aren&#39;t doing that at all. If someone has infiltrated Wikileaks, then THEY are cutting off a lifeline for exposing corruption.</p>
