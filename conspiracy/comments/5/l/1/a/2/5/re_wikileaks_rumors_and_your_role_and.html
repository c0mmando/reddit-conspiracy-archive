       The rumor Wikileaks is compromised is seriously damaging to Wikileaks, completely undermines their trust and mission. Also invalidates any new leaks they've released. If you think they're compromised you better be damn sure of it. Because you're cutting of the biggest artery and lifeline we have at exposing corruption. Words and propaganda are powerful make sure they aren't being used against you regarding Wikileaks. This includes all Assange rumors and speculation. Be very careful with the power your words hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Sorry should add this. I DON'T know if they have or haven't been comprised. But I won't state or belief either position unless I have some evidence to back either one up.  I won't go around saying Assange is dead and wikileaks is a front unless I know for sure. Because they're still releasing important leaks and have in he past. And as far as I know their accuracy record still stands to today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I DON'T know one way or the other, and also DON'T go around screaming they're compromised

       It could be compromised, it could not be compromised. I don't know one way or another and neither do you. Asking questions is no problem. Saying their absolutely compromised and stay away is not asking questions, and that's what my problem is. We don't know. Ask question but don't assume you know it's comprised because it just "feels" like it is

       You weren't talking about people being certain. You're talking about speculation. The people asking questions are doing so because they speculate that it's compromised. Also, you are re-framing the situation (something the new Wikileaks mods have been doing since they were added).

      <p>
       You are lumping together anyone speculating about the situation. Not everyone is assuming, and not everyone is doing so because it "feels like it is". It also "looks" like it is. Getting to the truth won't happen if you lump people together and accuse them of undermining Wikileaks.

       The people speculating aren't doing that at all. If someone has infiltrated Wikileaks, then THEY are cutting off a lifeline for exposing corruption.

       Look sorry I didn't phrase it well I guess. Just saying speculation is dangerous. Stay objective, reasearch and never trust a source blindly even if they are wikileaks. But believing they're compromised without evidence is the same as saying all leaks since October are disinformation. Believing we don't know one way or the other and researching and following new leaks is the right thing to do

       Speculating isn't the same as claiming they are compromised. There's evidence they are compromised, but since you don't agree with it: there's no evidence. You're speculating about people's speculation. You are literally spitting out word for word the shit the mods were spewing.

       I can't tell you how many times I've read variations of that, and your last sentence basically repeats it. Don't look here, nothing to see here, go look over there. Does that not seem fishy to you? Does that not warrant further speculation?

       I don't know. Not concern trolling none of us know the reason why. None of us can jump to 100% proof they're compromised. Circumstantial evidence is circumstantial.

       Huh you talking to me? Anyone doubting the argument that they're comprised is concern trolling? And anyone not doubting they're compromised is righteous and noble? I guess you're two steps ahead of me. Not sure how saying I have no idea am either way is concern trolling. Saying they're compromised without any evidence besides some personal bias is no bueno amigo m. That's my point

       Not lecturing, I'm not defending one way or another just mentioning that speculation can be people thinking they've pulled to wool away from their eyes when they're actually pulling some fresh wool  over them. I don't know why Assange won't come out to the balcony and I won't speculate what his reason his. I don't know. I also don't know what that means as far as being compromised.

       I think he's dead and Kerry played a huge part in it. The deaths surrounding the rest of the wiki crew don't paint a pretty picture either. I don't know if they're compromised but things aren't normal at the embassy.

       Sure if you believe they're compromised. If you believe they're not comprised than business as normal for you

       To me the fact that historically Wikileaks claims a 100% accurate track record means I can stay objective and take each new leak seriously , not blindly believe it and not immediately discount as disinfo bullshit either. Which is what I try my best to stick to. But you can do what you want.

       Preaching that they're compromised or not compromised is dangerous and helps some group or individual out there somewhere with their propoganda campaign.

       Preaching that there's nothing to see here and that speculation is dangerous also helps out with someone out there's propaganda campaign. I just outlined it to you, it's from the Wikileaks mods and you are following it to a T. Now why would they all decide to push a specific (don't ask questions, focus on the leaks) agenda? Well you can't ask questions or speculate according to your posts.

       is dangerous. If they are compromised, then the people that compromised them are the ones cutting off that artery. Not the people trying to get to the bottom of this. Saying the rumors and speuclation are damaging Wikileaks is dangerous. It could be a third party that is damaging Wikileaks, and reddit users are the ones trying to save it. You're accusing people of being damaging, while pretending to be neutral. You're conflating multiple issues into one re-framed narrative.

       I see your point. And to he honest I'm basing that off their 100% accurate past. Which in itself is biased.

       So If I say don't believe for or against either theory, stay objective, look into new and old leak verify all  that you can and consider all angles. And please don't assume Wikileaks is or is not compromised. Just try to find facts and corruption
