       Time to put my time where my mouth is. I live in a coastal city of about 300,000 residents. Predominantly working poor black people and middle class whites. How do I go about protesting against HRC in my city? I'm young, fit, well spoken Caucasian male.

       Doesn't matter if its peaceful.. They have so many fucking snakes that it would NEVER stay peaceful, and then military grade sonic weapons etc etc would start hitting the streets and then we are fucked.. Boots on the ground is not the right answer.

       It can stay peaceful if the demonstrators are instructed to remain peaceful and to outwardly call out and expose for everyone to see and stay away from anyone who attempts to be an agent provocateur.  Ass wipes would then get exposed and the rest of the group won't fall into their bullshit.

       And
       <em>

       exactly would those military grade sonic weapons be operated by?
      </p>
      <p>
       People in the military right?  A good portion of the military is ALREADY against TPTB and on the side of the citizenry.  If they see the citizenry being intelligent and NOT rioting, they are a lot less likely to do what you're saying - especially if they're already on the fence as many have already shown themselves to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boots on the ground is a powerful answer - especially in conjunction with cooperative action on other fronts like strikes coupled with communal cooperatives.

       Not even really protesting AGAINST her.  Just get a group of people to hand out Podesta emails. Non confrontational. Just like, "Hey, this is happening. Take it for what it's worth." No vitriole or emotionally charged speeches. Just objective information diffusion.

       I would take it. You could have different levels of information and the individual could choose to take as much or as little as they like, starting with a call to confirm all the votes especially the electronic ones, move on to pay to play and then Saudi terrorist ties and on and on and on.

       I'm not concerned about trump. I've read more about HRC and her pay to play scheme. I'll prob get banned for saying this, but I think Trump may usher in an era of neo-fascism. All wars are class wars.

       Trump is the global elite? Why do you say that? Because he has lots of money and does what he can to be successful in business?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes not running guns to terrorists all over the world.
       <br/>
       Hes not selling drugs on streets of america to fund black ops.
       <br/>
       Hes not hell bent on destabilizing the world

       Or overthrowing heads of state to install US selected Puppets

       And he didnt ride the epstein jet over 15 times

       Of course it is.  Are any of his drivers rich?  Caring about people isn't something you do when it's an important election and everybody is looking.  It's something you do all the time, in the way you live your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the guy wants to make big money, by all means, go for it.  But the little people who work for him are struggling just like all the other doormen, hotel maids, and construction workers do, because he pays them the market rate, and not a penny more, while he builds his houses, literally, of gold.

       He's better than Clinton, but he doesn't care about the people.  He needs you to believe that just like HRC does.  It's disappointing, I get it.  Just wait and see how you feel when the election is stolen from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is fair and these people don't care about you.  I'm sorry; I know it's hard to hear and believe.

       We kill the establishment if that happens. It’s not even in question; we have proof from their own mouths, and they will be killed. No problem.
