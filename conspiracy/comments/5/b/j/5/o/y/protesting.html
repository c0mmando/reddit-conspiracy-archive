    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It can stay peaceful if the demonstrators are instructed to remain peaceful and to outwardly call out and expose for everyone to see and stay away from anyone who attempts to be an agent provocateur.  Ass wipes would then get exposed and the rest of the group won&#39;t fall into their bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then military grade sonic weapons etc etc would start hitting the streets and then we are fucked</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <em>who</em> exactly would those military grade sonic weapons be operated by?</p>

<p>People in the military right?  A good portion of the military is ALREADY against TPTB and on the side of the citizenry.  If they see the citizenry being intelligent and NOT rioting, they are a lot less likely to do what you&#39;re saying - especially if they&#39;re already on the fence as many have already shown themselves to be.</p>

<p>Boots on the ground is a powerful answer - especially in conjunction with cooperative action on other fronts like strikes coupled with communal cooperatives.</p>

<p>Hes not running guns to terrorists all over the world.<br/>
Hes not selling drugs on streets of america to fund black ops.<br/>
Hes not hell bent on destabilizing the world<br/>
Or overthrowing heads of state to install US selected Puppets<br/>
And he didnt ride the epstein jet over 15 times<br/>
Nor does he laugh about being responsible for murder<br/>
Or brag about getting criminals off the hook  </p>

<p>Then im part of the global fucking elite thats trying to dominate the planet??????  </p>

<p>Im assuming i got downvotes for rudeness - which was probably uncalled for - but really there is no argument that hes part of the criminal cabal that the clinton and bush crime families are in.  </p>

<p>Paying his workers as little as he can doesnt <em>quite</em> compare with the laundry list of crimes i previously mentioned.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is.  Are any of his drivers rich?  Caring about people isn&#39;t something you do when it&#39;s an important election and everybody is looking.  It&#39;s something you do all the time, in the way you live your life.  </p>

<p>If the guy wants to make big money, by all means, go for it.  But the little people who work for him are struggling just like all the other doormen, hotel maids, and construction workers do, because he pays them the market rate, and not a penny more, while he builds his houses, literally, of gold.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s better than Clinton, but he doesn&#39;t care about the people.  He needs you to believe that just like HRC does.  It&#39;s disappointing, I get it.  Just wait and see how you feel when the election is stolen from him.</p>

<p>None of this is fair and these people don&#39;t care about you.  I&#39;m sorry; I know it&#39;s hard to hear and believe.  </p>

<p>You really want to get the browser extension <strong><a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a></strong>. It gives you <a href="https://i.sli.mg/0zMJAW.png">handy buttons for the formatting tools</a> so that you never have to remember the syntax. Never mind a character count and live preview of how your post will appear! Even if you turn everything else it offers off (and I do), it’s worth it just for that.</p>

<p>And for decades, Trump’s employees have lauded him for the way he treats them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s better than Clinton, but he doesn&#39;t care about the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read his policies. If he enacts even half of them, that’s proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wait and see how you feel when the election is stolen from him.</p>

<p>We kill the establishment if that happens. It’s not even in question; we have proof from their own mouths, and they will be killed. No problem.</p>
