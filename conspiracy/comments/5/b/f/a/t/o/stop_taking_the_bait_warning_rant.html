        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This went from legitimately having a case on HRC for treason to calling out hundreds of people on pedophilia and using coded messages to do transactions with human beings.. </p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>

<p>This is what discredits us. If there&#39;s some illicit shit going on behind the scenes do you really think every single fucking email holds a clue to something greater? Fucking took &#39;FBIAnon&#39;s&#39; bait hook, line, and sinker. Congrats fellow keyboard warriors, we&#39;re totally solving some Scooby Doo shit aren&#39;t we? Hit the bitch on treason where there is proof. Demand that from your elected officials and law enforcement and if there is more there, let them figure it out while we figure out what the fuck we&#39;re going to do to in regards to our country.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a hostage situation and everyone is dumbfounded when asked &#39;well, what are your demands?&#39; We&#39;re all looking around like &quot;well, no corruption and Hillary is corrupt!&quot; and then someone else chimes in &quot;and racist&quot; and someone else &quot;and a satanist&quot; and then someone else... what do YOU want from this situation? If you believe things will improve with Donald fucking Trump then do what you can to get his ass in office. If you think this country will get better with HRC and every person she&#39;s ever communicated with locked away in a prison somewhere, make that shit happen too. </p>

<p>I wonder what it was like hundreds of years ago when someone you asked to represent YOU and your family came through on their promises. If I were part of the elite, I&#39;d find this shit entertaining as fuck. A bunch of jesters making the king laugh. Following every false hope they can because it&#39;s easy to. Painting the picture however they can spin it to fit their own narrative. </p>

<p>Occupy Wall St started to gain traction and got shut down. Why&#39;d you guys give up? Black Lives Matter started to gain traction and some random extremist kills a bunch of innocent people, and now I haven&#39;t heard shit on the matter? WHY?! Props to anyone that is actually out on the street trying to make a difference, this internet bullshit isn&#39;t changing a damn thing.</p>

<p>If this offends you, good. If this makes me a hypocrite, I welcome the criticism. I&#39;m tired of reading through every thread in regards to this election wondering what light you&#39;re seeing at the end of the tunnel that I&#39;m not. Every four years 2 extremely wealthy people answer the same questions the same exact way and preach the same damn message, and we eat it up. </p>

<p>They will keep us divided forever if we let them. There&#39;s no fear at the top because a divided populace cannot prevail. They&#39;ll keep us fighting one another while we&#39;re all going through the same bullshit. Keep that in mind. I don&#39;t trust either one of my options Tuesday to make it easier to put food in my fridge or clothes on my back.</p>

<p>First of all, you have a problem with history, maybe you&#39;re young or maybe you are ignorant.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War">Over 10 Million of us protested the Iraq War</a>  and guess what still happened?  It wasn&#39;t even televised.  Maybe a story or two, briefly, here and there.</li>
<li>That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t participate in Occupy, I only took blankets to people in Occupy Denver because it began snowing and I thought people might die.</li>
<li>Occupy failed</li>
<li>Million man march failed</li>
<li>Tea party failed</li>
<li>Oathkeepers failed</li>
<li>World bank protesters failed</li>
<li>Eco movements failed</li>
<li>Pipeline movements are failing as we speak</li>
<li>I&#39;ve seen the antiwar movements, protest movements, a pregnant Chinese girl getting hit in the stomach with a nightstick, people pepper sprayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Physical Protest is over</em></strong></p>

<p>You want to know what they think of protesters?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ludlow Massacre : Colorado National Guard killed two dozen protesting unionized coal miners on behalf of Rockefellers [O]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re trying to incite people to go out into the street and in my book that&#39;s classic provocateurism, if you aren&#39;t just ignorant of how ineffective protest is.  So I question your motives, and if you aren&#39;t a shill, we&#39;ll chalk it up to lessons learned.   You can debate me on this, I won&#39;t debate you though.  My opinion on this is solid, I have 20 yrs of data to inform me that the media is 100% controlled, and if you don&#39;t damage infrastructure or cause a bunch of people to die, they&#39;ll just ignore you while locking you up or spraying you, maybe even killing you.  Is that worth it? It&#39;s not.  </p>

<p>So what do you do?  You protest in a different way.  You fight a psychological guerilla war.</p>

<p>We are doing what we are supposed to be doing, so please CAN it on this whole infantile, &quot;if you aren&#39;t out there doing something then you&#39;re just eating FUD and taking bait and not doing anything&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s just bullshit, bro.  No other way to put it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s several things we can and <em>are</em> doing.  </p>

<ol>
<li>) Go through podesta emails, find something real.  Get leads, research people make connections.  Keep track of them in something like the webbrain.com.  An example is like how I used podesta emails to <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/1D8665FA-9D42-F115-3917-12E0429E1ED0">map out the newswhores</a> --it&#39;s sufficiently informative with the info it has now</li>
<li>) Raise awareness</li>
<li>) Inform, educate others</li>
<li>) Visualize Hillary and others in Jail.  Manifest that shit.</li>
<li>) Go thru FBI emails</li>
<li>) Keep digging</li>
<li>) Just yesterday I found a key number 33,000 and it&#39;s almost 33 different uses other than &#39;number of emails&#39; or &#39;number of gun deaths&#39;...I did this in just 2 hrs or so.  I wrote about it, and it has a certain &#39;wow&#39; factor, revealing this whole group as acting like a bunch of fucking spies</li>
<li>) Produce your own interesting media to distill this information into something interesting and engaging.  You will not only make money if you monetize, you&#39;ll also inform...and you&#39;ll be part of the alt.media and open source intelligence movement.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Oathkeepers failed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think they&#39;ve been tested yet? I don&#39;t think they have. The only reason for them to mobilize will be all-out uprising. So far, all the other movements you&#39;ve listed have been squashed in a manner which would seemingly keep the oath keepers on standby. </p>

<p>Or am I being too Pollyanna?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering whether the whole thing is just to make sure that the winning candidate is not trusted by a large chunk of the electorate. A way to make sure that no matter who wins, half the country will not recognize them as president.<br/>
This is just a theory, but what if the fringe economists are correct and there is a massive financial crash coming down the line. One that makes 2008 look like a picnic.<br/>
There would be massive civil disturbance, riots even. They would have to turn the army and police on the american population itself. For that you happen you need the laws, infrastructure and plans in place beforehand.<br/>
After the election, there may be an uptick in &quot;homegrown terrorism&quot; which will need to be &quot;tackled&quot; and legislated for in order to &quot;protect&quot; the population. If Trump wins, will it be left wing &quot;terrorists&quot;. If Clinton wins, will it be right wing.<br/>
They are getting people foaming at the mouth at the moment. This must be one of the most divisive election in modern history. Both sides hate each other. Not just dislike or maybe distrust - actual full blown hatred of the other side. No matter who is elected on Tuesday, what do you think happens to all that hate, does it disappear? Fade away? I am not sure it can be contained to easily at this stage.<br/>
Maybe that is what they want.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lmao. I&#39;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just skimmed the top of some of this PizzaGate stuff, rather than assume you&#39;re an actual paid shill. Either way, while there is definitely speculation and some links definitely do require creative interpretation, if you look, some of these food references in these emails are absolutely code, without a doubt. Not only that, but you can clearly rule out drug references and adult prostitute references, and the child sex references fit perfectly just by doing simple substitution. And finally, the link to child sex is made explicit by other, background data that associates it plainly to child abduction or known pedophiles. PizzaGate is real.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you for having an issue with the ambiguity of some of the information coming out, or the poor signal to noise ratio. These are real issues. But this is a completely different subject than the truth content and the significance of these events as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While waiting for a hero is foolish, I&#39;m with 911bodysnatchers322 in that there is absolutely no reason to go out and get killed or permanently detained before there is a sufficient plan in place with enough participants to do irreparable damage to that which we are fighting against. Also the more lists you wind up on, the more useless you are. What will eventually be able to make a difference is a mass uprising by and uncontrollable quantity of people across the entire country simultaneously. We are not there yet, we have a long way to go, a lot of red pills to administer and a lot to learn before we are there. I&#39;m saying that we need to find hard data, irrefutable evidence to show believers in the system that they are being manipulated and lied to, despite how obvious this may be to us, it is not seen by many very intelligent people I know, partially because they haven&#39;t been affected enough by the corruption to bother looking and partially because they rely on time tested media sources, places that have been corrupted or scared into ignoring the truth. </p>

<p>BLM wasn&#39;t a good idea in the first place, all they did was cause chaos and be divisive. If they had spread a message that would bring people together so that people of all races could protest the police violence together, that would&#39;ve been great. However, the leaders of BLM have met with Obama at the Whitehouse and have been funded 50 million+ by George Soros; so they&#39;re part of the establishment agenda. Occupy was simply obnoxious, yes it got attention, for being obnoxious, it never had a chance of changing anything. It may have brought awareness, but not even really to the issues that really matter like government corruption. We already knew corporations and big banks are super fucking corrupt, sorry but that wasn&#39;t new news. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal should be a military coup supported by the population of the USA. You have to remember that the military is not the government, the government theoretically oversees the military, but we will need them on our side if we want to win. Obviously we are not even close to the point where that will happen so we need keep informing people of government corruption and hopefully spread this message to the younger generations so they grow up knowing the truth, it is much harder to sway adults who have bills to pay and families to protect. The adults will ultimately want to decline participation in order to protect their families and keep a roof over their heads. The youth (16-28ish) don&#39;t have these responsibilities and make up a large portion of our armed forces. So when the time comes, that is the group we need to be able to rely on to have our backs. Running into the streets now will get us killed like everyone else who defies Hilary. Your life is not worth potentially making a scene and being in the local news for 30 seconds, think what you can do to help inform the youth of the truth, that is the best thing I can think of right now. Since the FBI nor the NYPD is going to bail us out right now, I mean congress will try to do something, but will almost surely fail. Let&#39;s not get killed, we have probably 10-15 maybe 20 years before it is 100% too late to do anything at all. In the meantime, let&#39;s spread our knowledge, do some research and most importantly not get killed until the real revolution begins. I&#39;d be willing to die for a revolution that had a 35%+ chance of success, no less, and you shouldn&#39;t want to throw your life away for anything less either, and that means not encouraging others to do so either. Please do yourself and others that favor.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us are old enough to remember the last time people got close to exposing them, and the complicit media engineered the Satanic Panic to discredit the facts about the elite&#39;s perversions. The public were more than happy to believe them over anything too uncomfortable and world shaking.<br/>
There&#39;s enough provable corruption already to take them down if the public can be brought on-side and shown the truth.  </p>

For clarification, I&#39;m not saying the idea of pedophilia doesn&#39;t exist/isn&#39;t rampant among the elite. I&#39;m calling for action towards what has already been proven during this campaign and asking people here to keep that their foremost priority before delving off into a land that can easily discredit all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...Although the Occult shit SHOULD NEVER be underestimated because the Illuminati ARE submerged in Occult Degenerate practices, the rest are right. </p>

<p>Be noted that the Illuminati ARE submerged in degenrate occult practices. The rich in Czarist Russia frequently participate in mass orgies. Mao Zhedong consults the Dalai Lama. Occult symbols like the Eye of Horus are everywhere. The pentacle is represented as an American symbol. The 6 pointed star is on the Israeli flag for everyone to see and it is a satanic symbol, NOT an abrahamic symbol.</p>

<p>There are much more bigger conspiracies out there than a WWE match keeping the truthers busy. Namely, what i am seeing right now is a blitz invasion by Russia and China that ends within weeks ending up in the defeat and disaster of the western civilization and the establishment of the NWO using Marxism as a core and capitalism as a backbone. Everything else is in between.</p>

<p>tl;dr, Do not underestimate Occult relations with the Illuminati, and do remember that the current presidental election is a WWE stage and MUCH bigger conspiracies are out there waiting to destroy western civilization.</p>

<p>The alleged pedo code has gotten out of hand in this sub. People are making assumptions and charging it as fact which will always go a long way to discredit someone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a thread floating around from the past 2 days which goes into  great detail on why the case is highly circumstantial. It was either from <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> or <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> (I&#39;m searching for it now).</p>

<p>It basically highlights all of the actual statutes that would/could apply here and makes a strong case for the RICO angle as being the only one with any <em>bite</em>.</p>

<p>The plan from Wikileaks seems to be dependent on attempting to thwart a pardon from Obama, either for himself..or Hillary. Regardless, impeachment after she&#39;s elected is still possible, but would require <em>some</em> Democrat support. That&#39;s unlikely as well.</p>

<p>Minus something incredibly damaging from Comey in the near future, she&#39;ll be our next POTUS. She and her people have largely sidestepped this thing already. So, that being said..I&#39;ll entertain ANYTHING that may bring these people down for good, no matter how unbelievable. At that level of power, I think they are capable of just about anything.</p>
