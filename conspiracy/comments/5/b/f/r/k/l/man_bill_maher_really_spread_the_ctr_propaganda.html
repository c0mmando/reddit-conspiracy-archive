       It was disgusting. His entire monologue was DNC talking points. "Russia is trying to influence the election", "Russia is faking documents", ",Russia has compromised the FBI", "why is the FBI not looking into Trump", "Trump pays no taxes", etc
      </p>
      <p>
       No different than the CTR bots and trolls, same exact talking points used the exact same way. I mean it's obvious all of these hosts push agendas, but this was just overly blatant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't help that he also had Hopebama on to speak about his proposed Ministry of Truth. The pre-conditioning for this fuckery is real

       He actually dialed back a bunch of major themes of his on the last show.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said "I was wrong for criticizing Bush, Romney, McCain etc". (so now lying WMDs, torture programs, blocking legislation and all the progressive messages he has harped on don't matter?) He was basically graveling to his audience to convince them that trump is the anti-christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was pretty crazy to see him go back on the years of arguments he has been making. He seemed desperate. And it was not persuasive.

       I remember when he switched his support to Bernie during the primaries, seemingly out of the blue. Bill offered him 1 mil, of course he turned it down.
      </p>

       Given that several reporters in the media pretended to support Bernie, I can't help but wonder if he was among them...

       I used to watch his show, but picked up on his Shilling right around the DNC convention when he called Bernie's Supporters "Bernie Bros."
      </p>

       I was completely done when he said "I read the leaked emails, I didn't see the DNC biased to Bernie" when  interviewing Assange.

       The stupid people eating it up and acting the way fans of a sports team do after winning a championship is what pisses me off most. They have no sense of values, truth or decency. They flock to whatever mainstream says is popular and acceptable. And forget having a meaningful conversation with them.

       Its what they know/understand. Vast majority still think that your major sporting events are 100% legitimate events instead of the glorified sports entertainment they are. Extremely difficult pill to swallow, especially if you're a life long sports fan who put all your energy into it. Turns out people aren't interesting in breaking the illusion and would rather violently lash out then face reality.  Even considering that NFL/NBA/NFL/FIFA are illegitimate organizations closer to circus shows then competitive events is enough to brand you as a heretic.  But this is exactly why America can do a Clinton v Trump election and people buy it like its legitimate. They don't know legitimacy at all, its all a glorified Truman show.

       If you're one of the types who get offended by what I've written (speaking generally here, not directly to you) really take a look at underground gambling. Only reason its illegal is that if it was legal it would require league oversight to fixed games. You can still gamble fairly easily, but its very shady. Tennis alone is filled with people fixing their own games because its the only way to make money off playing tennis if you're not in the top 20.

       I personally watched most of the playoffs for one. Even sports analysts have pointed out refereeing discrepancies which have been among the worst i've ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note all the "historic" things that have happened all simultaneously this year: 73-9 (openly aided by the refs), Cavs Finals comeback (aided by the refs), Leicester City winning the EPL at 5000/1 odds, Cubs winning the World Series. Is it a coincidence?

       The strikezones in multiple games were objectively favorable to the Cubs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Now that i'm back off mobile, for example game 3 Hendricks vs. Tomlin the commentators ran a strike-zone analysis and found 16 favorable calls to the Cubs and none to the Indians. The Cubs however were shit and the Indians won 1-0.

       I see this on the internet and on tv a lot, (and maybe I just live in a place without 'stupid people') but irl, I don't know anyone who is eating it up. In fact everyone seems to see right through it. I can't help but think its just propaganda meant to make everyone feel like they're the only one who sees it.

       Hah. Figures that when I'd finally decide to make an account and start posting it would be around election time so I'd get lumped in CTR shills and such. I just wish I would meet more open minded people in person that don't disregard everything that the MSM presents as tin foil hat theories.

       This sub is legion. I actually think it's often times underestimated :)  now we just  have to hope we're not TOO effective lol, next thing you know we'll be silently disappearing in the night, or start committing suicide with really suspicious circumstances..

       Not him, but I do see people lap it up. It's quite sick. They're a minority though. I live in a top-20 urban area, and most people aren't totally brainwashed by this CNN/Maher horseshit.

       This election's ruined so many of the media I used to enjoy: John Oliver, Diane Rehm, Bill Maher (who, by the way, donated $1 mil to a Clinton PAC and lied about it)... that chart showing how the 50+ media companies have now become 6 (ish) through corporate mergers is as relevant now as ever.

       I doubt he smokes that much.  I bet he does cocaine though.  I bet the whole mr pot trip is largely marketing ploy to relate to younger audience.  I say this because the day after the MSM news announced Bernie proposed a bill to federally decriminalize pot, Maher had nothing at all to say about this very big news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, his show is live, so there would be no way he could miss this info.  He straightup ignored it.  So his endorsement of Hillary trumps his endorsement for pot, which means he's a pot hangout or a shill.... maybe both
      </p>
      <p>
       OR maybe he knew the game was rigged for Hillary so there wasn't a chance bernies shit would go thru

       There is a ton of prep work going into discrediting the FBI and emails this past few days. I get the feeling the DNC is really fearing something coming around the corner. It may happen before or after the election, but they are really trying to prepare the public for something they want to spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last week NBC had a story about "cyber hacking" and fake data dumps they expect to see coming. NBC is about as deep into bed with the DNC as CNN is, so I think NBC may have overplayed the strategy with that one.

       Bottom line of this election is you can't be informed on the leaks and feel good about supporting Clinton, so that means people who do are either ignorant and/or paid off.

       Serious question though, was he always this bad, or has he gotten worse. Maybe I am just more awake now, but I seem to recall really liking most of his points up until a few years ago. I hope he has just gotten worse, whatcha think?

       I think a combination of him getting worse, but also you becoming more awake. Me personally I didn't realize how brainwashed I was by "liberal media" until I saw the treatment Bernie got, and realized they used the same tricks on him they've done forever, but I ignored because I viewed them as my "default" representatives. Now seeing a criminal investigation written-off as nothing because "sexism" when my candidate of choice is Jill Stein made me realize how the "Isms" are weaponized and used to discredit, something I've done to many conservatives in the past but I felt I was in the right in doing.

       I think that once he gave that million dollars to Obama against  Romney he became a hardcore Democrat.   He rarely criticizes them anymore.  He always criticized the Republicans more (probably because they deserved it) but now he is a straight up partisan hack.

       The thing that bothered me the most was he recognized the counter coup against Clinton which means he follows the conspiracies. However, he then doesn't mention anything from Wikileaks, doesn't ask the President about Wikileaks, and starts spewing Russian propaganda nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I realize Bill hates Trump personally because Trump sued him, and would do anything to get anyone but Trump elected, he knows better then to spread propaganda he knows isn't true.

       This 100%. Him accusing the FBI of setting a coup for Trump while simultaneously ignoring Wikileaks and legitimate proof of a coup for Hillary just smelled of psyops. Also his implications that believing anything else is having no grip of reality...as he spews repackaged McCharthyisms

       He has been doing it since the campaign began.  He is dismissive of anything Trump and admonishes anything remotely in Trump's orbit and it's juvenile and obnoxious.  The past year has been completely about people who are recreationally offended and moving goal posts out constantly for Hillary.  Good riddance 2016 in January.

       I always hated him. He has always mixed a few "reasonable ideas" in with absolute agenda driven party lines. He's a sack of shit. My ex used to watch him all the time, I would go outside on the porch and smoke for an entire hour just so I wouldn't have to hear his bullshit.

       Almost every single tv personality is just a super rich low skilled actor. They are paid to read the teleprompter and do what their producer in their earpiece tells them to do. It's all a show and heavily influenced by transnational corporations. Best thing I recommend is  read the Wikipedia entry on all tv new pundits or guests. They almost always have a very high level corporate past and rarely anything to do with real journalism.
