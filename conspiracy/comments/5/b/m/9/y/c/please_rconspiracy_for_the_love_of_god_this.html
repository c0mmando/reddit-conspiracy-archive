       Not even, it's how you decide if you should start to investigate or not. If the person has no alibi they might have been there, if they have a good one they definitely weren't there.

       I think the other person who answered is probably right, but if it's from Podesta to Herb Chandler, how would that prove Podesta was out of the country? It would prove Chandler was leaving on a trip.

       If there is more to this, I honestly hope you guys find out. But this isn't evidence, in fact the only evidence is the admittedly uncanny resemblance to the sketches.

       I don't get it, the email is from Podesta's email, written by an Elizabeth, to Mr and Mrs Sandler, telling them to have a good trip? Who are the Sandlers? Doesn't that imply they're the one on the trip?

       There's two separate emails.

      <p>
       The top is addressed to Sandler from Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom is saying "Have a safe trip" to Podesta, from Elizabeth.

       No I disagree, Elizabeth is using Podesta's email to message the Sandlers, much like P.A.'s often do. I cannot imagine Podesta calling the Sandlers Mr &amp; Mrs. That said Podesta may have been away thus getting Elizabeth to look after his account for him.

       Correct. CTR possibly inherited a commercial version of the Military's social media Sockpuppet technology, which allows one analyst to present multiple online personas. These cognitive infiltrators seek to shape minds by becoming mods on forums, by shilling or by trolling.

       It was originally deployed overseas, but I imagine it's being deployed domestically as part of a modern COINTELPRO operation.

       I also got banned for this. I talked to other people who were banned too. I'm almost certain that the subreddit has been infiltrated. After a year of the most sensible modding you could have (imo) it suddenly goes batshit insane at the same time that CTR seemed to have disappeared, pushing things that make Trump supporters look nuts

       Exactly. The pedophile ring isn't going anywhere. Why not focus on the election for the next 36 hours and resume the pedophile research on Wednesday? The election is a more immediate priority right now.

       Correct. The principle of a Limited Hangout operation is to use less heinous crimes as bait to distract from more heinous crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's nothing more heinous than a cabal of child raping cannibals running the country.
      </p>

       If someone is telling you not to look into something, perhaps you should keep digging instead.

       Yes but the post was about Madeleine McCann and not about the broader case against him. The point is if we give the Madeleine accusation any traction it can be used against us to make us look stupid and dismiss the broader case against him.

       lolwut?  I don't even know how to answer your question because it's so dumb.  Paid professionals draw up these sketches based on witness testimony and they are used to corroborate their statements with any potential suspects.   Are they useful?  Well, it's as useful as witness testimony is.

       The thing that makes an infograph "good" are the following criteria;

       easy of use/consumption - hmmm, an awkwardly sized giant picture file kinda fails thist
      </p>
      <p>
       efficient and informative layout of information presented - this fails that test as well, since it's just a giant glob of text

      <p>
       accurate information presented - failed again, friend.
      </p>

       The part about the pool parties depicted in the video stopped me cold. There is an E-mail about a pool party; very cryptic. The infographic is good; I'm going to check it out later and decide if it has merit or if it's a six degrees of Bacon type of link.

       See, this is where it gets tricky. Because Tony should be able to provide his own verifiable whereabouts at that time, or whoever wants to represent him can come out and lead people to the information they need to exhonorate (spelling?) him. The claim, "Tony Podesta was in Portugal at the time of Maddy's kidnapping," is not so outrageous that it requires extraordinary proof. It merely requires that nobody can prove he was anywhere else. We live on a finite globe in singular bodies in the electronic age. If Tony Podesta was anywhere else on Earth, then he was not in Portugal. You go find the proof.

       The onus is on the one making the accusation to prove their claim. The podesta brothers need to do nothing. You need to link them to Portugal if you think they committed the crime.

       yeah thats what I dont get, why would these two dudes be the ones kidnapping a child. and I mean, its great footwork but them looking like the sketches in no way indicates them as the prime suspects. its suspicious, yes, but it isnt some breakthrough evidence that is going to lead to arrests and indictments.

        Maybe they didn't go there to kidnap. Maybe they went there to fuck some kids who were drugged by their parents. Maybe they only left with one of the kids after she died from an OD and they had to dispose of the body.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They claim that the DNA could be linked to Madeleine's siblings, two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie. But the respected Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha reported yesterday: "The definitive result of the tests leave no doubts for the Policia Judiciaria. "The blood found in the McCanns' car is that of Madeleine as well as those samples detected in the flat."
       </p>
       <p>
        Portuguese police believe Madeleine died in an accident and that Kate and Gerry conspired with their friends to dispose of the body.

       The Pedo Brothers were seen with Maddy they were Not seen actually stealing her from the hotel room. The sketches of them were from a witness who saw John carrying Maddy and Tony was with John. The facial images are identical it's a perfect match. They were in Portugal they bought Maddy for probably five grand in cash they took her to a secret room they raped  her then they sold her for double what they paid for her then flew back to D.C.

       I'm sure if they were in Portugal someone will report it. What I find amazing is the proof HRC knew of Saudi and Qatar's funding of ISIS. And proof TCF received millions from them.  Throw in the Spring sale of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia, pushed by Obama and with overwhelming bipartisan approval and we're got a Cluster F%&amp;*!. Then add the 10-year munitions contract with Saudi Arabia - which private defense corps get THAT $ and who's on the Boards? - and the 27 pages that reveal Saudi's financing of 9/11. The past 26 years we have been subjected to the results of the plan for private military industrial complex to continue to profit without the cold war. Desert Storm, Project for a New American Century, first WTC false flag, 1998 Iraq Freedom Act, 9/11, the Homeland Security Act, expansion of defense contracts, the surge, expansion of defense contracts, secret expansion of the NSA, Arab Spring, prosecution of whistle blowers, NGOs and subsidiaries, Lebanon, Syria, more defense contracts, secret drones with one-person authorization, Yemen and night raids by private mercenaries. All of this created and nurtured by both Parties playing the 2-Party deception. Meanwhile our income tax pays the interest on the cash The Fed tallies that is transferred to all of these companies and their investors. Check out

       Podesta wiped his e-mails right after the first stories about her disappearance starting getting out. The first wikileaks podesta email is from directly after, saying "have a nice trip.". I know it's not much, but it's enough for me not to dismiss it, so long as we're tasked with doing both the judicial and investigative branches' jobs now.

       I'll actually apologize for that flippant comment. I had done one earlier that was more thought out and sounded more sensible. This was just a drive by comment.
I will say it's up to the mods to decide how they want the frontpage to /conspiracy to look. For a person like me that gives conspiracy sites a low level of credibility I see how the top topics are all the pedo, pizza, mugshot stuff and wonder how serious the sub really is.
      </p>

       Thee has been some great stuff posted in the last month and it looked like /conspiracy was gaining some credibility with a much wider audience.

       It still is, nobody is going to believe every single post here and plenty of users call out what they perceive to be distractions.

       We prefer to let the users sort what they want the sub to be if they stay within the rules. We're not curators and 'deciding what the sub should look like' is everything that's wrong with the majority of major subs

       I understand that and I do applaud the decision to let the sub run it's own way. Seeing the same topic show up so many times and all going to the front was making me wonder if subversion was at play.

       In my own way I do want to influence people stuck inside the main stream bias. Using this sub as a source in the last month or so has been invaluable.

       I saw this shit play out and I called it then what I call it now, the perfect time to plant evidence against mass public investigations like the one we're all undergoing right now. Its a modern form of coining the phrase "conspiracy theorist".
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence agencies saw Reddit and 4chan as a significant threat and planted this false suspect and got enough people riled up and talking about it that it got legs and kept going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, any time this form of public investigation occurs, people can point and say, "remember the amazing reddit detectives of the boston bombing?" as a way of immediately trying to shut down the discussion.

       I can't remember the source or where I read it, so take this fact as you want, but I once read an article about sketches and how they never actually look like what the perpetrator looks like...

       Right, ultimately the one person line... What is the logic here? As if that were in dispute? So why eliminate all the other suspects except for one possible suspect? Based on the information that a couple, easily manipulated into going with the narrative, saw 1 guy but had totally different impressions of him? I want to curl up again and say, none of this is real too, but let's just accept it, deal with it (make it go away), and move on instead.

       What exactly tells you this is bullshit when evidence is strongly indicating that pedophilia is rampant within these groups? Actually, i feel the opposite is true. Every time a new bit of damning evidence appears linking these people to pedophilia i see a rush of posts about not being distracted by it. THAT is the distraction.

       Truth. There is nothing we can do about the 650,000 but we can dig into the latest wikileaks just fine. Everytime we have there is another possible clue to this big secret. It's not that we aren't looking at the other stuff like CNN/Wolf but there is just so much smoke to this dark secret, there has to be something behind it. Even if it's no where near as crazy as we've been thinking, it's still possibly the biggest political scandal ever if it involves pedos in government.

       The Wiener laptop was an engineered bust to cover up for everything else leaking out. It was to spam mainstream media so they wouldn't talk about Wikileaks for the last few weeks of the election. You think these technically inept morons outsmarted the intelligence agencies the whole time? You don't think intel knew about Wiener's little obsession, and Huma's co-opting Hillary long before the laptop fiasco? That is precisely
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       the laptop fiasco happened, because they had these people by the balls and they found/planted the distraction (laptop) at an opportune moment, to cover up worse crimes which are probably being exposed by Wikileaks. Let's find out what those worse crimes might be!
      </p>
      <p>
       Huma/Wiener is just one of MANY stories we should be discussing. Telling people to focus on A instead of B is distraction. They can focus on both if they are capable, or choose the one they enjoy more. There's enough to go around, and practically anything is permissible here. If the theory is terrible then people will knock it down.

       This indeed. They win this round, and we can conclude that Wikileaks was grossly inefficient in how they have handled all of this (by design or by their own limitations).

       A Satanic pedophile ring will wake up the general public much faster than exposing Huma Abedin, but all will come out soon enough.  It's not going away, even post election.  Between now and January is going to be nuts

       True Satanism is taking power by one's own will, with no guilt and no morality. In this case that's a vital attribute of the accused. Non-satanic pedos dont have the amorality or hive mind necessary to execute their desires without acknowledging they are ruining a humans entire life. Sure, pedos have support groups on the internet, just like every other mental/sexual disorder, but no ritualistic meetings like the Satanists have been doing for centuries. Satanists, egoistic as they are, can certainly organize well, and acquire great power over others, although their infighting is explosive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about funny pop-satanism as seen in HBO's Silicon Valley. I mean Real Satanism, the kind that lets war mongers sleep at night and continue raping humanity with a smile on their face. The kind you don't get to participate in unless you swear your soul to it. My satanist acquaintences just like the shirts and scaring grandmas, but our parent's Satanist friends run industries and justify DAPL type shit for their own gain.

       That's not what modern day satanism is, though. What you are describing is a classic cult (doesn't have to be satanism), or even a religion (a lot of bad people can sleep at night because of their belief). What I'm trying to say is that there is no lead whatsoever that shows us that these fellows are satanists. It could be any other dumb cult or religion that exists in the world. Heck, they could be part of a Christian cult, or no cult at all.

       You're talking about Satanists taking over and setting up other religions into personal cults. I study spirituality, all the egoistic culty stuff is Satanism with different books. All the supplicant nonsense is Satanists taking the reigns, demanding idolatry and money. Nowehere do the prophets tell folks to start murderous cults, unless Satanists rewrote the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not talking about modern satanism, which is no more extreme than being a goth, hipster, or nerd.

       Well, I guess I can see where you are coming from. But, for me, the Catholic church resembles a cult (basically all religions have some cultist similarities). That's another story though. In the case of the Podesta brothers, I don't believe that the reasons why they are doing the stuff they are (allegedly) doing is of spiritual origin. They are just sick bastards with a lot of power, kinda like the Clintons, Bushes, etc.

       I'm pretty sure that's still at the forefront of all of our minds. The recent connections made between comet ping pong and Podesta are at the very least worth looking into. I don't think any information should be disregarded at this point. Everyone doesn't need to post about the emails.

       Prove what? There's a picture on Comet Ping Pong's instagram of a young girl laughing with her arms TAPED to the table. That girl looks younger than Madeleine McCann did when she disappeared 7 years before that pic was even posted. They also don't even look that much alike. As for Podesta being in Portugal at the time, there is zero evidence of that. Just saying it because you want to believe it doesn't make it true. Same for him deleting his emails the day the story broke. It's just all complete nonsense, and you look really stupid for believing it.

       No, not all public figures.  Just the ones who are required to.  There is a law that says the records created by government officials are part of the public record.  I want to see those emails that are public records.

       The FBI has not even released the previous 33,000 emails to Congress, and Congress give them a subpoena.  The public also has a right to view them.

       Those 650,000 emails were from Huma's private account.  I don't think they are subject to FOIA.  Neither were Podestas, in fact he wasn't even a government employee.  Huma's emails were subpoena'd as evidence and also are not subject to FOIA.  The 33000 were Clinton's private emails.  Even government employees using a .gov email address are allowed to permanently delete private emails.

       Well, any emails that are related to government business belong to the public record, and we have a right to see them.  I think we both agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I do not trust the FBI to really tell us which emails are government related and which are not.  I think they are hiding much information, and Congress does, too.  The whole system is broke, in my opinion.

       It's all shady. Your post is also suspect. This is the Internet. We have infinite amounts of people with plenty of time to research whatever they want. Asking people to not look into something is just ludicrous.

      <p>
       How did you expect your post to be received when all it is attempting to do is draw attention AWAY from a specific topic during a time when we all have to be on edge about CTR doing that exact thing?

       People look like each other all the time. Did everybody forget the Boston bomber? It isn't "evidence" of anything. Aren't these drawings supposed to be the same suspect? The one doesn't even fucking look like Tony imo, they have different noses.

       Maddie probably died in the apartment that the McCanns were staying in. Cadaver dogs picked up blood and the presence of a corpse at the apartment and at the McCann's hire car.

       Please continue to work the e-mails angle as well. I, for one, think that is a severe limited hangout, but if that's what gets traction with people it's all good. The pedophile thing is real and it appears to be building steam.

       A couple from Ireland on holiday in Portugal spotted the suspect. Both the husband and the wife worked with police to create independent e-fits of the suspect, that is, they both said they saw

        ONE

       When I first saw this connection being made, I thought people were legitimately joking. I agree that the Podestas are fishy people, but it doesn't mean you have to throw critical thinking to the wind.

       The implication here is that the Huma Abedin thing isn't itself a media plant distraction from some bigger story.  Wikileaks has been effectively nullified as a force for good by being buried in run of the mill political corruption.

      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Rule of Thumb: The mainstream media is not your ally, so any story they cover is probably a dead end.
Fact: The email scandal has been covered extensively by the mainstream media.
Conclusion: The email scandal is probably a dead end.  Clinton probably is no more corrupt than anyone else in DC
Research Directive: What avenues of though or events have been ignored in the media recently?

       We need to take the opposite approach! They want us to stop but were on to something. I recently posted to this sub about something I thought I was REACHING BIG TIME. It was a small joke bill maher made about Hillary having jon benet ramsey in her basement. Something that would normally be dismissed as a lame joke. But with the recent podesta leaks, I though it was strange so I did a little research and found some connections between the 2. Like I said, I thought I was reaching heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted to this sub and what do you know...
      </p>
      <p>
       That YouTube vid was deleted! Along with many other podesta/child sex related content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had maybe the furthest connection to make and they still deleted the video. That should speak volumes to what were on to!

       Where is the torture chamber? Is it located in one of the buildings that are apparently all pro-Clinton supporters? Has someone figured out if Hillary, Bill, or any of the connected people with the supposed child sex ring actually own one or 2 of the buildings there? Did they check? I bet you the torture chamber is within the area.

        still a distraction

      <p>
       NYPD says FBI HAS TAKEN ALL WEINER 650K evidence to DC. FBI tells NYPD to drop case - repeat DALLAS NOV 22 1963 - OBAMA-HILLARY COUP ALERT

      <p>
       Shortly after are reports of the threat of the investigations pushing past 2020.

       The pedo ring thing, especially impending arrests were to stop or unmotivate people from looking into or speculating on the obvious. Abedin and/or her husband had thousands of state department/government emails on an unsecure home computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Abedin and others will be the pound of flesh. They might even testify or go on the record as to what Hillary did or knew but they will be the ones going to trial or jail-not Hillary.

       It is so moronic that it is easier to imagine it being deliberately that way. The photofits of the two men who are claimed to look like the Podesta brothers...those are in fact different photofits of
       <em>
        the same man

       , provided by two different members of an Irish family who saw a single man carrying a girl away down on the night Madeleine disappeared.

       Maybe we're onto something with the pedo-files, satanic cult, comet pingpong, the MAdline McCann story, etc. but we need to table it for the future. It seems like people are starting to grasp at straws to stretch and connect these dots. We have to find something solid, something cocnrete, there ahs to be something else out there we're missing or simply hasn't been released. Keep digging, we need hard evidence of the clinton foundation wrongdoings.

       it might not be/prob isn't. Who knows, all I'm saying is that everyone's going off in that direction like it's the answer when it might not be. We are either missing a piece or are glossing over a piece that we thought related in one way but relates in another.

       That's what I'm getting at. Like were we guided purposefully to the satanic cult leak beacuse even though true, just out there enough for people to dismiss it as "oh look at those tinfoil wearing nutjobs". Even though I'm happy it came to light, it seems like everyone took that bait and ran with it like it was the smoking gun.

       It's coming from Donald Trump. His team includes the national enquirer. NYPD, the intelligence community and yes, Russia. He's been on epstien plane once. And apparently didn't like what he saw up there. He's using this to gain power and drain the swamp this is the real deal, he's trying to do the right thing.

       You're absolutely right, OP. Look at the comments in this thread. It's all shill astroturfing. some of them seem to have forgotten they're posting on Reddit and not /pol/.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're completely overrun right now and it's truly disgusting.

       I'm not a shill but I still promote this story's coverage.

       Pedo rings--including in DC and in elite circles--are an established thing. They exist. They're in FBI archives.
      </p>
      <p>
       People would have said that the pedophilia ring in the UK involving the upper echelons of Thatcher's govt would be too "out there"... but that's what happened with Jimmy Saville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our consciousness likes to dismiss these things, because we don't want to come to terms with the fact that such evil exists. But it does. And in less than 3 days, places like Reddit and 4Chan have uncovered devastating threads tying into real depravity. Have you seen the Instagram photos of the Comet pizza owner? Can you honestly not tell me that those photos mean nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that you don't want to get involved in this type of investigation. It's definitely not for the faint of heart. I'm personally opting out of it because I couldn't stomach the psychological toll I know it would take on my psyche. But I respect those who are doing this work and tying these pieces together so that maybe the child victims can see some justice. That can only happen if we as a society are willing to acknowledge its existence... and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       can only happen if there are people willing to expose it.

       it's kinda funny in a way, i mean the things people saying about how disgusting and evil everything they're seeing are mostly from a website that created
       <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/089/205/f25.jpg">
        this

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       that picture of a little girl with her hands taped up is just a little girl with her hands taped up, it's funny because she'd not going to be naughty or create mess or do any of the other things kid do - it's a harmless joke any parent or proprietor of an establishment that frequently has children in might make -- but not to pol, everything is satanic child-sex abuse in their minds, did you see the one where the guy was saying about how unlikely it is that 'pasta with walnut sauce' refers to actual pasta with walnut sauce because who eats things like that? it's easier for them to imagine that a someone's a satanic child-abuser than they have a healthy lunch... these people are deranged!

       This indeed. They win this round, and we can conclude that Wikileaks was grossly inefficient in how they have handled all of this (by design or by their own limitations).
