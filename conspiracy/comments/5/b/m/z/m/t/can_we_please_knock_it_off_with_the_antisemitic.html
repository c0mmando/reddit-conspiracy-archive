       I am a lurker here and have been enjoying this sub during the election, but all of the anti-Semitic posts are inappropriate, offensive and really getting out of hand. Can the mods do something about it and ban people making such comments? It's no different than saying the n word. If you want to be hateful, please take it to 4Chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I accidentally wrote tweets instead of posts, but I don't think I can edit the title. You still get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: As an example, here's one with an anti-Semetic headline: "Gematria - The tool to see through Jewish media propaganda &amp; Hillary Clinton email headlines"
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bgxo8/gematria_the_tool_to_see_through_jewish_media/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bgxo8/gematria_the_tool_to_see_through_jewish_media/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I wanted to make it clear that this has nothing to do with criticizing Israel (which is completely valid) or someone who happens to be Jewish. My problem is with people who use Jew/Jewish as an insult or generalize all Jewish people with a negative statement.

       I noticed that you are defending only one group. That makes you just as guilty as those you wish to discriminate against.   Maybe if you would be more concerned about all of your brothers and sisters instead of only those important to you (or employ you),  you would actually do some good.  Instead, you are dividing people and making yourself a victim.

       Nope, that is not true at all and is quite a statement to make without even knowing me. The few times I have read something on 4chan I have been completely disgusted by the racism against all groups there, especially toward AA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I haven't seen slurs or racism toward other groups in this sub, just toward Jewish people, and that's why I wanted to speak up.

       I know what you are.   The Vatican is a pedophile cult.  The Muslims are being portrayed as ISIS terrorists.  The Jews have a Nazi fascist leader exterminating the Palestinians.   See how fair I can be?  All religions are equally insane.

       Nope, Israel deserves a ton of criticism for its policies, and even if it didn't that is not anti-Semetic. I'm talking about racial slurs, using Jew or Jewish as an insult and generalizing all Jewish people with a negative comment.

       Yeah generalizations are never fun and never true.  I think a more accurate description of the people we hatewould probably be the "zionists" who are less jewish and more chaos magicians (not that judaism doesnt include witchraft or anything ie. see kabbalaism).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad part of this fact is that the word zionist and saying israel is committing apartheid on palestine ARE considered as antisemitic and taken down across the internet.  Thus that is why i made my rhetorical post which im sure you are aware of the true intentions of the post based on your very down to earth response.

       I'm 100% against any form of racism including anti-semitism. That being said the term gets thrown around waaaay to much.Case in point, the Trump ad talking about the rich elite controlling things showed the head of the federal reserve and Goldman Sachs. They happen to be jewish so the media said "Omg, it is because they are Jewish! Anti-semite!" No they just happen to be the top of these organizations. It's like if someone told you they don't like basketball and you immediately respond with, "Why, because Lebron is black?!"

       That's not my point at all. No group is immune to criticism. Banks and media are at the top of the evil list, and I know many people involved in those industries happen to be Jewish. However, pointing out someone is Jewish is different than using it as an insult.

       Shut up, we here understand that free speech means ugly speech that may hurt your little sensitive ears, and we are adults can read an ugly word without having to complain to the "authority" about banning people and certain words. If you cannot handle yourself like an adult, by all means get off this sub, but if you are an adult and do not need to wine to the teacher to force everyone else abide by rules to make you feel more comfortable. Racial slurs keeping you up at night sweetheart? Put a tampon in it, mods should do what their suppose to, which is suppress nothing.

       Please give examples because ive seen and got irritated by truly antijewish threads/comments.  However, the majority of threads i see are just stating facts.  Like Milo Yiannapoulis (sp?) says (and hes a white, gay, jewish, self described provocateur)  'just because people state facts about jewish people that doesnt make them racist.  Jews do run hollywood, newspapers, news outlets, and banks.  They are facts not racist comments. ..what you do with that knowledge determines your racism'. Milo rocks.

       I agree. Stating facts is not a problem. It is when people use Jew or Jewish as an insult or generalize all Jewish people with a negative statement that is inappropriate. I just posted an example and will post more when I find them.

       Wow, you guys really are nasty. Are you OK with using the n word too? The point of moderation is to keep things civil and prevent the forum being overrun by racism like 4chan, which is where you should go if you want 100% uncensored speech. And no, criticism of Israel, which is much deserved, is not anti-Semetic. Criticizing beliefs or practices is not anti-Semetic. Even criticizing Zionism, which is a very, very, very small percentage of Jewish people, is not anti-Semetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, drawing attention to the fact that someone is Jewish and using it as an insult is anti-Semetic (e.g. that "Jew politician"). Grouping all Jewish people together and saying the Jews are trying to take over this and that, is anti-Semetic. I've seen a ton of posts/comments of this nature lately here and I don't get it as I don't see any other racist comments against other groups here, so I assume those are getting moderated. How is that different than "the blacks are (some negative, generalized, statement)"? I just saw one a few minutes ago and someone else commented on how they are tired of the anti-Semitism here, so I am not the only one. Unfortunately, I can't find the post. I will share examples if I can find them.

       Thank you, I've felt this for some time. Interestingly, there's virtually no Islamophobia, but there are constant anti-semitic remarks. Can't look for examples right now but I've noticed statements like 'the Jew Soros' and claims that there's a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt that there are Zionists - both Jewish and Christian - who should be called out. But these constant references to evil Jewish conspiracies should stop. If similar remarks were made about AAs, they would I'm sure be shut down.

       This is really the first time in a long time that I've seen anything like this. Generally in the U.S., Jews are not victimized. But in this sub and on 4chan and elsewhere, I see a lot of anti-semitism and I'm wondering if we'll now see this increasingly, as our economy tanks and people are looking around for scapegoats.

       I am concerned about this as well. It's a shame because I think it is ruining what is otherwise an enjoyable sub. I think people have forgotten what happened during the Holocaust and how quickly things can go downhill when we scapegoat certain groups of people.

       I grew up in a country where there is much more anti-semitism than there is in the U.S. When I came here, I was amazed how different things were. But I lost family in the Holocaust and I'm always aware that things can turn very quickly. To my horror, I'm seeing it happen right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure that people have forgotten the Holocaust. Racists don't really care one way or another; some may even think the Holocaust was a good idea. We're seeing a lot of racism right now and some of it is clearly directed at the Jews. (But most of it isn't.) Friends of mine have also remarked on this. These are sad times.

       Sadly, some people don't knew what zionism means.  Furthermore, the zionist agenda has become the face of Judaism for non Jews.

      <p>
       Your time would be better spent perhaps by educating people to this very important distinction.

       Would you also have them ban people that make:

       Of course it's different. What would be no different is if someone used the k word. From my understanding the k word is banned here just like the n word.

       Nope, that is not true at all and is quite a statement to make without even knowing me. The few times I have read something on 4chan I have been completely disgusted by the racism against all groups there, especially toward AA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I haven't seen slurs or racism toward other groups in this sub, just toward Jewish people, and that's why I wanted to speak up.

       Yeah generalizations are never fun and never true.  I think a more accurate description of the people we hatewould probably be the "zionists" who are less jewish and more chaos magicians (not that judaism doesnt include witchraft or anything ie. see kabbalaism).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad part of this fact is that the word zionist and saying israel is committing apartheid on palestine ARE considered as antisemitic and taken down across the internet.  Thus that is why i made my rhetorical post which im sure you are aware of the true intentions of the post based on your very down to earth response.
