<p>I accidentally wrote tweets instead of posts, but I don&#39;t think I can edit the title. You still get the idea.</p>

<p>EDIT: As an example, here&#39;s one with an anti-Semetic headline: &quot;Gematria - The tool to see through Jewish media propaganda &amp; Hillary Clinton email headlines&quot; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bgxo8/gematria_the_tool_to_see_through_jewish_media/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bgxo8/gematria_the_tool_to_see_through_jewish_media/</a></p>

<p>Also, I wanted to make it clear that this has nothing to do with criticizing Israel (which is completely valid) or someone who happens to be Jewish. My problem is with people who use Jew/Jewish as an insult or generalize all Jewish people with a negative statement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah generalizations are never fun and never true.  I think a more accurate description of the people we hatewould probably be the &quot;zionists&quot; who are less jewish and more chaos magicians (not that judaism doesnt include witchraft or anything ie. see kabbalaism).</p>

<p>The sad part of this fact is that the word zionist and saying israel is committing apartheid on palestine ARE considered as antisemitic and taken down across the internet.  Thus that is why i made my rhetorical post which im sure you are aware of the true intentions of the post based on your very down to earth response.  </p>

That being said the term gets thrown around waaaay to much.Case in point, the Trump ad talking about the rich elite controlling things showed the head of the federal reserve and Goldman Sachs. They happen to be jewish so the media said &quot;Omg, it is because they are Jewish! Anti-semite!&quot; No they just happen to be the top of these organizations.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you guys really are nasty. Are you OK with using the n word too? The point of moderation is to keep things civil and prevent the forum being overrun by racism like 4chan, which is where you should go if you want 100% uncensored speech. And no, criticism of Israel, which is much deserved, is not anti-Semetic. Criticizing beliefs or practices is not anti-Semetic. Even criticizing Zionism, which is a very, very, very small percentage of Jewish people, is not anti-Semetic. </p>

<p>However, drawing attention to the fact that someone is Jewish and using it as an insult is anti-Semetic (e.g. that &quot;Jew politician&quot;). Grouping all Jewish people together and saying the Jews are trying to take over this and that, is anti-Semetic. I&#39;ve seen a ton of posts/comments of this nature lately here and I don&#39;t get it as I don&#39;t see any other racist comments against other groups here, so I assume those are getting moderated. How is that different than &quot;the blacks are (some negative, generalized, statement)&quot;? I just saw one a few minutes ago and someone else commented on how they are tired of the anti-Semitism here, so I am not the only one. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find the post. I will share examples if I can find them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I&#39;ve felt this for some time. Interestingly, there&#39;s virtually no Islamophobia, but there are constant anti-semitic remarks. Can&#39;t look for examples right now but I&#39;ve noticed statements like &#39;the Jew Soros&#39; and claims that there&#39;s a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. </p>

<p>No doubt that there are Zionists - both Jewish and Christian - who should be called out. But these constant references to evil Jewish conspiracies should stop. If similar remarks were made about AAs, they would I&#39;m sure be shut down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. You seem to be the only one here who agrees with me. I haven&#39;t seen any racist comments here toward AAs, Hispanics, etc. so I assume they&#39;re getting moderated. But for some reason it&#39;s OK to use Jew as an insult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really the first time in a long time that I&#39;ve seen anything like this. Generally in the U.S., Jews are not victimized. But in this sub and on 4chan and elsewhere, I see a lot of anti-semitism and I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;ll now see this increasingly, as our economy tanks and people are looking around for scapegoats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am concerned about this as well. It&#39;s a shame because I think it is ruining what is otherwise an enjoyable sub. I think people have forgotten what happened during the Holocaust and how quickly things can go downhill when we scapegoat certain groups of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in a country where there is much more anti-semitism than there is in the U.S. When I came here, I was amazed how different things were. But I lost family in the Holocaust and I&#39;m always aware that things can turn very quickly. To my horror, I&#39;m seeing it happen right now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that people have forgotten the Holocaust. Racists don&#39;t really care one way or another; some may even think the Holocaust was a good idea. We&#39;re seeing a lot of racism right now and some of it is clearly directed at the Jews. (But most of it isn&#39;t.) Friends of mine have also remarked on this. These are sad times.</p>

<p>Would you also have them ban people that make:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>anti-Christian posts?</p></li>
<li><p>anti-Atheism posts?</p></li>
<li><p>anti-Muslim posts?</p></li>
<li><p>anti-Buddhist posts?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or is it just Jews that you don&#39;t want criticized?</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s different. What would be no different is if someone used the k word. From my understanding the k word is banned here just like the n word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah generalizations are never fun and never true.  I think a more accurate description of the people we hatewould probably be the &quot;zionists&quot; who are less jewish and more chaos magicians (not that judaism doesnt include witchraft or anything ie. see kabbalaism).</p>

<p>The sad part of this fact is that the word zionist and saying israel is committing apartheid on palestine ARE considered as antisemitic and taken down across the internet.  Thus that is why i made my rhetorical post which im sure you are aware of the true intentions of the post based on your very down to earth response.  </p>
