       Here's my conspiracy; this line of reasoning is being promoted by CTR to make you all look like a bunch of goofy fuckers right before election day.  It reduces anti-Clinton voters' credibility when we say "she's bad, here's why."  There is a treasure trove of underbelly conspiracy shit in these emails, and you people latch onto this?  Insane.

       They were on vacation, they deleted all their emails from while away on vacation, we know they do have a place in Portugal.  More evidence will soon come out showing they were there at the time no doubt, everyone's searching around now

       At this point though, there is literally nothing to link the Podestas to the McCann abduction, apart from a resemblance to a police fotofit - at a location thousands of miles from where the Pedo brothers live. We've got to have something more substantial than this to justify these front page posts.

       Still front page because people are getting informed on the story/theory. If people are so lazy as to not go to the comments it's their fault for being a sheep. Also, lots of times a conspiracy theory is busted here and is on front page doesn't make people here look any worse. We are here to prove, disprove and discuss these theories.

       We have way too many things linking The Clinton Foundation to be involved with child abductions and pedophilia. Investigating the Podesta/Maddy theory has only dug up more dirt on people surrounding the Clintons. This should absolutely not be ignored.

       Here is my line of reasoning. Your post is to deflect from the pedo investigation by labeling it as goofy. This passive aggressive attempt to dissuade others from digging further into researching the subject lends more energy to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of complaining start posting more evidence of what you are researching and have found because your post on the front page makes CT look like a bunch of fools actually. Which includes you.

       There is zero probability that the Podesta brothers resort to first-hand kidnapping.  They can afford handlers to do that dirty work for them.  Not only that, but to link them to a high profile case such as Madeleine McCann with police sketches is laughable and desperate.  It doesn't make any sense.
      </p>

       I'm not saying that pizza and Epstein is bogus.  I'm saying Madeleine McCann has nothing to do with Podesta and there are more important things to be promoting.

       A sketch that is a dead ringer for them in a child abduction case. What are the odds of that? It took me back at first. Maybe Cognitive dissonance?

      <p>
       But I don't claim to know what the Podestas are capable of. From what's starting to surface can we be so sure this is beyond what they do? His brother has an even creepier presence than him almost.

       The sketch is of one man, first at the time of the kidnapping and the second age progressed. It's not two different suspects. This McCann story is causing all the truthful conspiracies to get swept away with the absurdity.

       Sad I had to get this deep into the comments to learn this. That alone has flipped me into believing its more of a PsyOP and distraction. The whole thing falls apart when you can no longer go "What are the odds that Brothers match the two artistic renderings exactly? .  When it's only one, we should be demanding some more evidence other than that to prove a given theory.

        Maybe they didn't go there to kidnap. Maybe they went there to fuck some kids who were drugged by their parents. Maybe they only left with one of the kids after she died from an OD and they had to dispose of the body.

       While I generally agree with you,  I feel it's transposing too much of what we sane rational people would do in these situations. Well the fact is most of these people are raging psychopath who are anything but rational. With that said, is it really that much more of a stretch to think that an individual who is obviously highly into pedophilia and goes to Great Lengths to surround themselves with it, would not get off in their own sick way and enjoy the thrill of doing the kidnappings themselves? Of course our first thought is they have entirely too much money and power to get their hands dirty themselves, but who knows that could be part of the thrill for them for all we know. Reason and rational have long been lost on these people... And to understand and figure them out, we have to put ourselves in their mind. Not put their mind in ours and run it through our world views.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the above scenario is probably unlikely, but to write it off completely is irresponsible to your own research and Knowledge.

       Just as people were getting close they completely derailed the train and everyone started rambling about pizza and hot dogs.  It was quite brilliant, it just goes to show how utterly uneducated most people are.  Hillary took on the internet and won.

       Seriously, anyone who says otherwise obviously hasn't done their research. It's extremely sketchy. You obviously obviously haven't done your research. It's extremely sketchy. Heck, one frequenter of that Comet pizza place has literal pictures of a penis shooting out pizza, among many other blatantly sexual things on their Instagram such as a picture of fully nude men with pizzas covering their crotches. I think the fact that they keep associating pizza with sexual things is proof enough that they're not merely talking about pizza. There

       As awful as she is, this is pretty much why I think she'll be an effective president.  She and her cronies run a solid political machine.  They got everyone to think twice about running, and even endorse her early on. This despite her being pretty much the most hated woman on the planet.

       Doesn't seem like it worked then. In fact, it looks like the opposite happened, giving Trump a pretty rapid boost the last two or three days.

       I mean, not that any of the polls carry any reliable meaning anymore, but to suggest CTR promoted the spirit cooking thing seems pretty backwards to me.

       what boost though? the MSM didn't touch it, and it's not a crime so it's a dead end in terms of getting Clinton or her staff indicted. It makes people who talk about it look like crazies when they say "Clinton linked to satanic rituals!". I don't know of anyone's mind who was changed on who to vote for because of that meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only news making the MSM over the weekend was "Clinton cleared in 2nd FBI investigation", which only helps her going into the vote. Of course, that in itself is obvious corruption as there's no way they went through 650k emails in a week, it feels like the fix is in.

       I definitely agree on this.

      <p>
       And to be fair, I'm not trying to claim any particular predictions or analyses over others as I believe it to be impossible to know truth from fiction with any degree of certainty at this point. But in terms of this boost I mentioned, I was referring to an overall impression I got from obsessively observing the_donald over the last few days, where #SpiritCooking was treated as the most effective "red pill", particularly among minority voters. They also cited a few polls, I think primarily the LA Times one, which had a pronounced uptick for Trump after the Spirit Cooking revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I realise that subreddit alone is a very narrow viewpoint, and as a European I am not as immersed in the mainstream culture as US citizens would be, but I still maintain the impression that CTR was not by any means promoting this particular story.

       URGENT. PLEASE EVERYONE WE ALL NEED TO GET ALONG. We are very good at analysis, however, over analysis is very bad. We need to recognize that this is stemming from all of our paranoia (both individual and collective) and try our best to deescalate our emotions. REMEMBER WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT PSYOPS Paranoia is an extremely potent crowd control device and CTR is very much aware of this. DOWNVOTE AND MOVE ON.

       If anything though, it's to distract from something bigger.  While the autists are busy looking for clues like "Fly safe" (seriously, wtf is that? you think that's code? jesus christ!) there's very likely to be something relevant that they miss.

        Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance.

       I came in here last night and there were multiple posts of the same police sketch all saying the same things. That is counterproductive. Those emails dropped last night and you would never have known it with the amount of crappy duplicate posts there were on the front page of this sub.

       My suggestion is people keep searching that line of research so to speak, but mainly focus on the immediately proveable conspiracies like you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that the timing of these particular leaks is fishy. No need for name calling though, I think we all want the same thing here and that's truth and justice. Divided we fall and all that.
