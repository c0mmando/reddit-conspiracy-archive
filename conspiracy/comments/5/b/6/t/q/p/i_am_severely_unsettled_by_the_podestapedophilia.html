       I've been glued to this subreddit and pol the last 2 days. My mind is a whirl and I am physically ill about all this. To see concrete evidence of such an abhorrent conspiracy is probably the worst thing I came across (used to be the North Korean modern concentration camps but even that is from unreliable provenance and tinged with Western propaganda.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst thing is that I can't even discuss this with my friends and family without sounding cuckoo. The way the mainstream media is so blatantly ignoring this (because they're in on it) makes me feel like I'm in an alternate universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just need some confirmation that I'm not going crazy.

       No,  you are not crazy.    The Podesta thing needs more investigation.    But it looks like people want to think the Catholic sex abuse scandal was unique and want to bury all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  I am surprised this is "new" to you.   Most people have had plenty of time to either bury it or assimilate it.   Its not easy to assimilate the denial though.

       So what? Sound cuckoo. It's important to discuss this with as many as possible. If you get a funny look, show them the evidence. There's no shortage of that at this point. I've turned a lot of people's opinions by not being afraid to sounds nuts, but I always show people the proof. This is what we are all obligated to do at this moment.

       Yeah! Tell them about how you know performance art is actually satanism, and that people talking about food are actually using pedophile code words from their work e-mail addresses! Then show them the HARD PROOF of these facts (what is that again?). They won't think you're crazy at all!

       I'm not saying put on your foil hat and start connecting dots as a lot of us tend to do, as I have the tendency to do. Stick to the facts. There is plenty of CONCRETE evidence of election fraud, unlawful contact with donors, and a lot of other messed up stuff without even mentioning all we think she's been doing. Hell, show them the context of the terms "pizza" and "pasta" and ask them if they think he's talking about Italian food.

       I saw the context of 'pizza' and 'pasta'.

       The dude is talking about pizza and pasta. Maybe out of context it COULD be construed as nefarious, but in context it's completely benign.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just talked about sticking to facts of corruption (I agree!), and in the very next sentence recommended showing people this benign communication, as if it's OBVIOUSLY sinister and anyone can see that. No, it's not. There's enough real shit to get up in arms about....take your own advice and stick to the facts.

       Okay, I do have to agree with the fact that it isn't concrete evidence, and these all may be innocent comments about food.  I do feel that some of the things said do warrant a discussion, even if they are innocent. For example: "Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours?" Either he had a map to Little Caesar's on a snot rag or something's up.

       Welcome to the real world taco fan. Just be glad you figured stuff out. Each person sees the light at their own timing. You cannot force it. Know that the rabbit hole runs deep and there is a ton of misinformation. You learn to sort through the BS real quick and just move on. I figure every person posting on here works for the Department of Defense.

       That's okay. It won't affect the outcome. Unlike most conspiracies, we might have a chance to boil this one down...or not. I don't think they'll let him win, but if he does, I expect the most wild ride until they JFK him.

       there are hundreds of pages by now about this over there. It is pretty interesting, and a bit compelling, but in reality it is based on a few emails that mention food. I can't get too excited about it (yet). Here is a thread you can check out

       would it stand up in court as the prime evidence? No. They are talking about food until some other evidence is found. I have written more than one email to family and friends mentioning eating pizza.

       Past cases using similar descriptors might. I'm not aware of any though because I don't spend a lot of time paying attention to pedophile cases like certain politicians do.

       The Epstein connection which there are lots of links to all over but a picture popped up of Bill with a ~15yo looking girl on board the plane this morning and started trending and now I can't find it. Looking all over.. I wanted to try finding out who she was.  Anyone grab it?

       Well, you would have thought that the South Korean government being run by a cult was a joke, and yet it appears to be true. You know that Weiner and Huma are in for some serious shit, with ties to pedophilia. We heard that there is a "shadow government", and then you wonder once more: wtf was that speech Comey gave about recommending no charges? We know that podesta is a nutjob and shows great interest in cults, but that is it. The rest is speculative. If you send tens of thousands of emails over years, some of them will be about pizza parties. When he gets busted and they find evidence, then we can go nuts over it, for now there's not enough evidence, just some weird connections.

       Okay, I do have to agree with the fact that it isn't concrete evidence, and these all may be innocent comments about food.  I do feel that some of the things said do warrant a discussion, even if they are innocent. For example: "Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours?" Either he had a map to Little Caesar's on a snot rag or something's up.
