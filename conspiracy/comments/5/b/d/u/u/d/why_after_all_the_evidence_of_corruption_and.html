       Every branch of government is infiltrated. No heroes are coming to save us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody wants to get this party started because everyone is afraid of dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       So everyone lays in wait for someone else to get the party started.

       I honestly believe if a video surfaced that showed Hillary and Donald having sex with a goat, and three Haitian kids under a bleeding statue of Satan himself, the vast majority of supporters would simply not believe it, or would assume it was a made-up hit piece.

       Because of exactly what you said, we have
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       , but we have nothing concrete. I believe most Americans are scared and nobody wants to be the first guy to pop off the revolution in fear that it will be in vain and everyone will still sit on their ass saying "holy shit, look what happened to that guy".
      </p>
      <p>
       If actual undeniable proof came out that our politicians were harming children, I do believe that really would cause people to create a movement. If we wanna be honest here, people in this country have already tried to start a revolution, and they were killed. And we all sat back and thought "holy shit, those people are crazy"

       You only think they're crazy when they're dead.  But if they're successful, all of a sudden they're the heroes you always wanted and longed to be, remembered forever.

       People don't know what to do. They have no channels to make this magical peaceful revolution take place. No big media voice, no limitless funds, just brains and words that are getting drowned out by the scream of the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely true that no big heroes are coming to save us but if they did, would you trust them anyway? We might be fools to be trusting anyone who had all the power we don't and never have done a damn thing about it.
