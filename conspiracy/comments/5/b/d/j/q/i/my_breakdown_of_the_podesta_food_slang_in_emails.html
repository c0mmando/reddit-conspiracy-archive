       So I'm going to go thru some of the emails and offer potential interpretations that make quite a bit of sense and offer proof of the fact that, most, if not all of this is popularly used slang terms.

       Grandchildren and Children - I can only assume on this one, but I am thinking underage children.

       Sauce- Could refer to alcohol.

        "Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one, if I am right, is actually pretty clever. Most of my interpretation I cannot back up, but there is one in particular that is very important and that is PIZZA. I strongly believe Pizza is referring to a Private Server.
       <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pizza%20Slice">
        "Pizza Slice"
       </a>
       is a pretty well used term on the internet to refer to Private Server (PS).
      </p>
      <p>
       So my translation on this one would be. The FBI, or attorneys (Realtor) found an e-mail (handkerchief) that might tie back to (map) our private server (pizza). - (The rest I read as a warning of a potential investigation and to maintain plausible deniability and not speak about it.)

       Interestingly, Walnut is, apparently, a

       (for lack of a more PC term).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly, this one I really think might be about food, since in the rest of the

        email chain
       </a>

      <p>
       Ice-Cream - I really think this one is referring to underage children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sidenote- It's completely possible, and Occam's Razor would suggest, that I am totally wrong and they are actually talking about food and a lost handkerchief found by a visiting realtor while staying in the Field House.

       Why are you against the drug angle? As far as criminal charges go, the more the better. 
And OP is still including the kid diddling angle.

       Yeah if you look at this  andredawson's comment history I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were the ones that were in fact CTR. I've been seeing a lot of purposely inflammatory accusations and statements being made, and 9 times out of 10 their history will show nothing but that. It's in order to discredit any sort of critical discussion. Notice how (at the time of this comment) this has the most upvotes but really offers no argument at all. There is a lot of manipulation going on across the board and r/politics is definitely leaking.

       I could entertain some of these, but for instance Pasta and Cheese. That would translate as "Would I play dominos better with girls or child porn?" which doesn't really make sense contextually, I also don't necessarily believe these are all sexually related terms, although some I think are.
