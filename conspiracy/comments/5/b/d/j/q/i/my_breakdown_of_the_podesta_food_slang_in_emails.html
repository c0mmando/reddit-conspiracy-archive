        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;m going to go thru some of the emails and offer potential interpretations that make quite a bit of sense and offer proof of the fact that, most, if not all of this is popularly used slang terms. </p>

<ol>
<li>&amp; 2</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>

<p>&quot;Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheese- is a slang term for heroin or opiates. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_(recreational_drug)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_(recreational_drug)</a></p>

<p>Pasta- is a South American term for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_paste">Cocaine or Cocaine Paste.</a></p>

<p>Domino- is slang for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dominos&amp;defid=3267095">vagina or pussy.</a></p>

<p>Grandchildren and Children - I can only assume on this one, but I am thinking underage children. </p>

<p>Sauce- Could refer to alcohol.</p>

<p>Tranlated - &quot;Do you think I&#39;d fuck better on coke or dope?&quot;</p>

<p>3.My Personal Favorite</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one, if I am right, is actually pretty clever. Most of my interpretation I cannot back up, but there is one in particular that is very important and that is PIZZA. I strongly believe Pizza is referring to a Private Server. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pizza%20Slice">&quot;Pizza Slice&quot;</a> is a pretty well used term on the internet to refer to Private Server (PS). </p>

<p>So my translation on this one would be. The FBI, or attorneys (Realtor) found an e-mail (handkerchief) that might tie back to (map) our private server (pizza). - (The rest I read as a warning of a potential investigation and to maintain plausible deniability and not speak about it.)</p>

<p>4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m coming to town the week after next and will bring some walnuts!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Walnut is, apparently, a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Walnut">term used for an underage girls &#39;undeveloped private parts&#39;</a> (for lack of a more PC term). </p>

<p>Admittedly, this one I really think might be about food, since in the rest of the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43113">email chain</a> they go on to talk about a <a href="https://gabebertaccini.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/walnut-ligurian-sauce/">Ligurian walnut pasta sauce</a>. But it is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Steyer">Jim Steyer</a> the &#39;Child Advocate&#39; so who the hell knows. </p>

<p>5.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I consider ice cream, its purchase, and its consumption a rather serious business. We can’t just willy-nilly toss it out and about in casual references, especially linked with the word “free”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ice-Cream - I really think this one is referring to underage children.</p>

<p>Sidenote- It&#39;s completely possible, and Occam&#39;s Razor would suggest, that I am totally wrong and they are actually talking about food and a lost handkerchief found by a visiting realtor while staying in the Field House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah if you look at this  andredawson&#39;s comment history I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if they were the ones that were in fact CTR. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of purposely inflammatory accusations and statements being made, and 9 times out of 10 their history will show nothing but that. It&#39;s in order to discredit any sort of critical discussion. Notice how (at the time of this comment) this has the most upvotes but really offers no argument at all. There is a lot of manipulation going on across the board and r/politics is definitely leaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could entertain some of these, but for instance Pasta and Cheese. That would translate as &quot;Would I play dominos better with girls or child porn?&quot; which doesn&#39;t really make sense contextually, I also don&#39;t necessarily believe these are all sexually related terms, although some I think are. </p>
