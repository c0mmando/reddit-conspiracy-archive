       It's very common for bots to comment on new posts, usually with some kind of advertisement totally unrelated the actual post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume there is a way for the makers to know when a bot has been banned, which would be easily circumvented with a new name. So they simply shadow ban them, which means they keep posting but aren't seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it's been explained to me anyway. You'll see them pop up within seconds in /news posts especially. Some even make their own posts.

       Has anyone got any real confirmation Assange is even alive? Now he is calling for revolution? Isn't it a bit curious that everyone is going along with this counter-narrative? Nobody has a clue how to fight effectively, in the 3rd Gen of war. How are they going to fight in 5GW? Seems like a waste of time, trying to rally peasants...

       It just all seems so manufactured- the media and now also the counter media.
Both sides are being funneled off a cliff. It's time people realize, being part of either crowd (either extreme) will only cause great pain (especially if it comes to global 5GW open war).

       Yes, I agree. This is the perfect time to stirr the pot that 'tad' extra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that all the info is out there - people are easier to push for change. I'd say they are willingly pushing for another revolution - and Anonymous is a part of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, many "head-less chicken" (sorry, it's just a figure of speech, but also true) are following the new information like flies toward a lamp, it's pretty incredible to witness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange has been carrying this dynamite for quite a while. It's more important than ever to keep a cool head, because now it's all out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       After witnessing the develpoment for the past few weeks, I'd say many activists simply are too confused to do anything rational, and that is exactly what we've been seeing at a few rallies and demostrations. People still reacting instead of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       A revolution is - just another turn of the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       'round and 'round it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully the new narrative won't stick too deep, I've been carrying my load for a few years, but am not interested in bloodshed - I hold a finger on evolution instead of a revolution.

       Very nice response, and I am unsure why I didn't see it before. I too, have been sitting on my hands, and for over 13 years.
The culmination of my experience has taught me, that if things were possible, they would be happening. If anyone is living freely in this world, it is the rich, but one could argue that even they are slaves to their fear of losing what they have.
I believe that to retain power, is the fault of being unable to use it effectively. By that it is evidenced, that the amassment of power existing, indicates a lack of effective use. In other words, no human lives freely, because a way does not exist for them to do so, independant of everyone else. Or does such a way exist?
I am studying nanotechnology, and have the hope of inventing methods for personal freedom. I cannot say, what those methods may be at this time, but I require them to be in the form of a comprehensive and complete, human life support and augmentation system.
Such a system would involve the use of technology capable of 3d printing nano, micro and macro-structures, of a variety of properties, in a timely fashion, on an appropriate scale. Workbench nanofactories are an essential component of my plan.
Perhaps once the method has been forged, for us to free ourselves from each other, there won't have to be war. Or perhaps, the war will become final, that has existed between rival factions, throughout all time.
Who's side are you on? Do you even know?
Time to find out. Who will live, and who will die...
