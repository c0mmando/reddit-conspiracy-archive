       At the time, I listened to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now and thought highly of her style of investigative journalism.  After hearing her interrupt and cut off 3 different interviews that had just uttered Ron Paul's name, I haven't listened to her since.

       Yeah, I switched over from npr to a local radio station that plays DN! that
       <em>
        seemed

       less biased, but same thing happened. It sucks because I do still sometimes enjoy Democracy Now! Especially when they gave Jill a chance to respond to the debate questions, but aside from that they aren't much different than npr in their tendency to bash Trump every chance they get.

       It's insane that there is absolutely no source of non biased, neutral reporting. Every news source feels a need to editorialize and tell you what you should think about any given topic.

       Paul, who himself was the Libertarian nominee in 1988 and ran as a Republican primary candidate on several subsequent occasions, said he actually prefers Green Party nominee Jill Stein on important issues like civil liberties and foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       “She’s probably the best on foreign policy at the moment,” Paul said, stressing that he hasn’t endorsed anyone for president yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       “On Gary Johnson,” Paul explained, “he does not come across with a crisp libertarian message.”

       As an outsider to your election she's the only one with the guts to say things that I'd like to hear from a candidate, insane is trusting in vested interests that have a track record of fucking you all over for cash. Trump may be an outsider but his party and advisors certainly aren't.

       As a Ron Paul supporter from the 2008/12 campaigns, I'd vote for Jill Stein (I'm not voting though). And no way is Jill "insane" - 'least not compared to Clinton and Trump (well, and maybe Johnson). Heck, even Ron said that Stein has the best foreign policy out of the 4. Oh, well... as they say in South Park, "Giant Douche vs Turd Sandwich"!

       This quote tells me a lot:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There were concerns among physicians about what the vaccination schedule meant, the toxic substances like mercury which used to be rampant in vaccines. There were real questions that needed to be addressed. I think some of them at least have been addressed. I don’t know if all of them have been addressed."
      </p>
      <p>
       She said this to the Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem isn't whether or not vaccines are safe, it's that she is claiming here that she doesn't know if they are or aren't, but there are "real questions" that need to be addressed. Of course, she doesn't actually have any real questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she need to speak like this, then why would I assume she has any real convictions and isn't just pandering?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancel all student loans, shut down all nuclear power, ... these are basically crazy pandering statements and have no place in reality.
