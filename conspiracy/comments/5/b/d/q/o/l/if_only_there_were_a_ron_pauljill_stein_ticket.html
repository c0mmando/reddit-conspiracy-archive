    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I switched over from npr to a local radio station that plays DN! that <em>seemed</em> less biased, but same thing happened. It sucks because I do still sometimes enjoy Democracy Now! Especially when they gave Jill a chance to respond to the debate questions, but aside from that they aren&#39;t much different than npr in their tendency to bash Trump every chance they get. </p>

<p>It&#39;s insane that there is absolutely no source of non biased, neutral reporting. Every news source feels a need to editorialize and tell you what you should think about any given topic. </p>

<p>Paul, who himself was the Libertarian nominee in 1988 and ran as a Republican primary candidate on several subsequent occasions, said he actually prefers Green Party nominee Jill Stein on important issues like civil liberties and foreign policy.</p>

<p>“She’s probably the best on foreign policy at the moment,” Paul said, stressing that he hasn’t endorsed anyone for president yet.</p>

<p>“On Gary Johnson,” Paul explained, “he does not come across with a crisp libertarian message.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This quote tells me a lot:</p>

<p>&quot;There were concerns among physicians about what the vaccination schedule meant, the toxic substances like mercury which used to be rampant in vaccines. There were real questions that needed to be addressed. I think some of them at least have been addressed. I don’t know if all of them have been addressed.&quot;</p>

<p>She said this to the Washington Post.</p>

<p>My problem isn&#39;t whether or not vaccines are safe, it&#39;s that she is claiming here that she doesn&#39;t know if they are or aren&#39;t, but there are &quot;real questions&quot; that need to be addressed. Of course, she doesn&#39;t actually have any real questions.</p>

<p>If she need to speak like this, then why would I assume she has any real convictions and isn&#39;t just pandering?</p>

<p>Cancel all student loans, shut down all nuclear power, ... these are basically crazy pandering statements and have no place in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of us know scientifically if vaccines are or are not safe. There has been literally no study that includes persons not vaccinated as the control. </p>

<p>So, she is very much correct when she says she (and we) simply do not know. Jill really wants true scientific method to be used when testing a vaccine. That&#39;s actually one of the things she is fighting for. And she does bring up these &quot;real questions&quot;. She is not pandering, but actually fighting for proper vaccine testing. </p>
