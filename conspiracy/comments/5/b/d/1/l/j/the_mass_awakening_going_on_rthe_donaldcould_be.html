       Not sure how many people here also browse/post over at r/the_donald...but something really incredible is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't know, that subreddit is basically the epicenter for the wiki leaks research. Not just on Reddit, but basically the entirety of the internet. They are doing the bulk of research and summarization with a little help from 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well let me tell you, the last 3 days or so have been interesting to say the least. Between the "SpiritCooking"(satanic rituals and Satan worship) and "Pizza and hot dogs" conjoined with the pedo island/Lolita express references sprinkled throughout, they are realizing this shit is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us on r/conspiracy a long time, this is nothing new to us. The documentation to PROVE the conspiracy came to fruition locality split, and in a super easily digestible form, but as we all know,...we've been making these allegations for ages begging people to just humor us and LOOK at the proof. What is notable about all this is:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Most users on the Donald are your average person. Most have never set foot in our sub. With all the wiki leak revelations from the primary being rigged against Bernie, to the pedo and satanic shit, the hardcore users over there are going through an enlightenment.
       </li>
       <li>
        The power and sway that the Donald and its users as a whole has with the media at this point, is a force to be reckoned with. Like most of us, all it takes is one crazy ass conspiracy where you get convinced it's real and before long, you start entertaining things like 9/11 or chemtrails and it becomes infinitely more likely for them to hear out the arguments and evidence. If they continue down the rabbit hole, it could be HUGE for us, fuck even huge for all of humanity.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I have been reluctant over there to post and connect dots for them and how it all is enmeshed with the rest of the major conspiracies. But I/we should. Or at the least, be patient and easy with them if they start coming over and exploring more. I feel we are on the cusp of something huge for our community. Alot is starting to come out into the light friends, and we need help in any way we can. Whether its offering info, or lending a hand with noobz... let's embrace them guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off topic but not really: r/the_donald IS the Donald trump sub... But at this point (most users over there would agree), its become the last place on Reddit besides here to be uncensored. Me - like alot of people, go there for the uncensored news and not necessarily because we support Donald Trump. The upper hand they have on us here is their user base is HUGE and the most active on Reddit. Their are so many of them, that the shills aren't able to download the truth into oblivion. So if you have never stopped over there, give it a look. It is the exact opposite of what the media portrays. They accept everyone, they believe in right and wrong like we do, and it just so happens they are having a mass awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk what the point of this post was guys. I guess it's because this is a GOLDEN opportunity, and I wasn't sure how aware this sub is of all this. Thanks for reading this novel if you made it this far.

       Now, go watch old Ron Paul videos from 2007 and 2012 campaigns and prepare to have your mind blown.. it's time trump people and the people here come together.. we all at least hate the Establishment.

       He's extremely principled and consistent and has been working relentlessly to spread the idea of individual liberty. In 2007, there was a huge movement around him where we did things like hang huge signs from overpasses that said 'Who is Ron Paul?' The media sure as hell didn't pay the movement any attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2007, he won almost all of the Republican state straw polls.. and the media barely ever mentioned his name. Whenever he would get 2nd or 3rd in the polls, they would skip right over his name like it wasn't there.
      </p>

       Here's a couple Ron Paul videos I like:

       Yeah I remember it. And what's sad is that the only reason they couldn't do this to Trump is that Trump went out there really heavy from his opening speech. And they felt they could laugh him off the ballot. If you remember those first few months was nothing but "Trump is a clown he will drop out". In retrospect they probably wish they had taken him seriously an tried to give him the Ron Paul treatment.

       And Dana Bash said live on air "we don't want him to do well" or something like that concerning Ron Paul. Most of my hatred of tv talking heads came from their open distain of Paul. Went to a rally and it was crazy how much energy was in that gym.

       Trump fits no where here. Just because his supporters are ravaging the emails to find something to benefit trump doesn't mean they are truth seekers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is by far the worst presidential candidate in America. Hillary isn't much better but Trump appeals to the most common stupid denominator. He shouts words and repeats them with no logic or sustenance behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please do not associate this sub with Trump, or any political party or figure for that matter.

       I'll join forces the day they realize Trump is astroturf for the same forces that control Clinton. They have no fucking clue how deep it all goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to come to the profound realization that Clinton, actually, is a show pony. They say in politics the lightest shit floats to the top. She's business as usual. Her function is a point of isolation. Or in other words - a potential fall person. She is an appendage that, if cut off, the rest of the organism can live on perfectly fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: posts like this reek of something strange. I'm sure these people are the same ones that shift the goal posts about ANYTHING negatively analyzing Trump. It seems like subversion - when you consider Trump is objectively just an establishment wanter - a big government supporter.

       He wants to renew the Patriot Act (this means he believes in indefinite detainment of American Citizens without trial), he wants to expand the NSA, wants to infringe on the Second Amendment without trial, and loves Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same as Clinton. A protectionist pro-American person would not compromise and would not even be for any ONE of those policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul wasn't and look how they treated him. He would win all of the straw polls and yet not even have his name on television. This is how they treat people who actually threaten the status quo. Trump is so clearly controlled opposition because he is given equal air-time - and not to mention participated in the de facto scripted debates.

       I'm talking about how millions of people are starting to discover that something is

       wrong. They know they've been duped and they're looking for the truth.

       I don't "support" Trump. (I think he's controlled opposition, and his purpose is mainly to cause chaos and division, and ultimately to give the MIC and the banksters bigger profits.) But after checking out that sub with an open mind, I've come to the conclusion that it's a good place, and that people there are actually willing to learn.

       Check out trumps speeches lately.. I'm convinced he's become the real deal. The emails show the HRC team pushed trump forward.. but there is no way he's playing by the script any more.. he's out to crush the Establishment.

      <p>
       I was redpilled in 2007 and voted Ron Paul in the primaries.. voted 3rd party for the general in 08 and 12.. and now I'm seeing a lot of the Ron Paul people reluctant to support trump... despite trump sounding more and more like Ron Paul every day.

       This election is easy for me because it's Trump or Hillary. Anything but Hillary is my stance. But if Paul were running it would be nothing but Paul for me. Paul has been the one guy I've wanted to see as president for the majority of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was woken up to politics with the (Bill) Clinton administration. I was a fairly new teenager at the time. Of course I'd always heard about the Kennedy assassination, and references to "Watergate" and some weird reference to "Deepthroat."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bill Clinton incident is what got me to start researching these things. Although I've always had a natural contempt and mistrust for authority in general, and government specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after starting to research I learned what Watergate was, watched the Zapruder film, learned about the CIA and FBI. Then I learned about some of the fringe stuff like MKUltra, hints about Northwoods... and then I discovered Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has been my guy ever since. I discovered how he was active during the Gulf War and what his stances were and general opinions and he was the only motherfucker talking fresh common sense. There wasn't much political speak about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally when 9/11 happened, I didn't believe it for a minute. I was home that morning, had just woken up and began flipping channels and saw a news channel talking about a smoking WTC building, claiming a plane flew into it. Then, as we were watching another plane flew into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That moment, I realized, all the corruption, all the conspiracies... they were real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I discovered Alex Jones. That's where I learned about Bohemian Grove and the Bilderberg group. I knew what the CFR was in name, but I didn't realize the depth of its influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had kind of forgotten about Ron Paul. It was kind of a shock to me to watch how political speak had sort of evolved, and then he returned to my radar with the same no-bullshit, common sense, calm and consistent demeanor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it really fucking disturbs me that my dumb nation has essentially ignored him for 30+ years that I know of.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was our guy. We fucked up. Ron Paul also gets "credit" or "condemnation" (depending on whether you're smart or a leftist) for basically energizing the "tea party" movement. In some circles it's dubbed as common sense (which I agree with). In other circles it's called racist and fear mongering and they associate it with gun toting rednecks. But I'm sure this is out of ignorance or learned helplessness.

       Yeah, it's been a real treat (sarcasm). I feel like I belong to a very small group of people. My experience has been a series of timely impressions. I mean, I began the process of waking up and then it was one thing after another.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I started looking into Bill Clinton, I was going through the OKC bombings research and then Columbine happened. Then the big one, 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back then the web was entirely different, too. Most of my leads came from mirc chats. Google wasn't even around in my internet beginning, and when I was deep in to research it was a lot of waiting for the right people to come around and give tips about what to find and how to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been interesting to watch how politicians have used speech and movements to change the very social fabric. It feels like I was born into one world and have moved to a different world of mass, open government surveillance and patriot acts and what really disturbs me is that there is a new generation out there, almost driving cars, who've never lived in a country that hasn't been in war for a minute.

       These people don't even have an inkling of what the U.S. was like before 9/11. And it was very different. It's scary to me to think that a lot of the people alive would be scared of the relative freedoms we had then. And there's no possibility they can gain that perspective. It's lost. Gone. Forever.

       This is what disturbs me about liberalism and this safe space, PC, SJW snowflake generation thing going on. Because, once you concede ground you never get it back.

       There's an old picture of Kennedy giving a speech in a town square where people are just milling around, carrying guns out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure those people feel the same prior to me and the world I grew up in.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is for sure, the combination of society and government feed of each other to incrementally constrict our rights, freedom, and capacity for expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you've grown in this specific ecosystem, you can see a clear design in it all. (EDIT: *IF you're awake).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: I would just like to add here that through all the research I've done, I still actually
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       very little, and I'm sure the depths and breadth of the corruption would, if not surprise, impress me.

       Once you encounter the media putting on a show as 'news', you cannot help but make that realization for so many other things. It hit me hard in 2007 when I was just starting to support Ron Paul and I watched a bunch of his speeches on Youtube - he was awesome. Then I watched media clips about him and they took pieces of it and twisted it around.. and name-called and used errors in reasoning against Ron Paul. When I went to the Florida Republican straw poll and it was a huge crowd of Ron Paul supporters and just a few for the others, and I saw CNN spending all their time on the Romney 'crowd' of only 15-20 people, it changed the way I thought about everything.

       Yup yup, I went to the Oregon straw poll in Portland. RP supporters there outnumbered all the others, combined, and then double that. They told us there were too many of us so they got a big room to put us in to 'wait until the straw poll', then they went back downstairs and started doing the straw poll without us. Some of us got auspicious, went to take a look, and then ran up to tell us to get down there. When we stormed the room the 'hand in the cookie jar' look on their faces as they stuttered and tried to make excuses was priceless and that's when I was redpilled as well. Well, actually, I was first redpilled in around 2003 but that's another story, and I got redpilled again even more in 2007 with RP. Lot of great people in that crowd, we were disaffected republicans, libertarians, a lot of people who's never voted or were independent, anarchists, all sorts. We were all talking about the fed, the banks, stopping the wars... They spun and lied about us and turned us into 'the tea party' which was then promptly co-opted by a bunch of party hack fakes.

       Hate to break it to you, but
       <em>
        The Matrix
       </em>
       was about doing LSD/DMT. It's about a mans decent into the psychedelic realm, and the true nature of reality. How can you truly see the real without a change in how you perceive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like Alice in Wonderland, it's about someone who is sure of themselves and their environment being thrust into a new world, and their place in it. Things are not quite as they appear... It's a story as old as time.

       I think he has have massive development on his story arch. Kinda like Tony Stark, when from a guy just full of hot air and some success to someone who truly believes in their cause. I don't really agree with his cause but he does inspire some respect in the sense that he now feels authentic.

       That's a pretty good start for a President in my opinion. Wether or not he actually believes it and plans to do something about it is the question. However, already knowing Clinton, there remains but a single logical choice.

       You know what just fucking kills me about the Patriot Act and just epitomizes how brain dead us Americans are now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the 9/11 psyop was so effective and for so long, that I think it was more successful than even the psychotic evil diabolical planners had in their fucking wildest dreams lol. This bill which is the absolute furthest thing away from something that could be called a patriot that you can humanly imagined, had been written and put away in the desk somewhere for years I believe just waiting to roll it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think right after the event they were all probably nervous since it was plain as day to anyone with a brain that some type of help whether explosives or free energy or nuclear bombs I don't care take your pick was used. It is scientifically impossible for the towers to collapse anywhere close to scenario like what the official report said, and that one simple that alone should have been enough for a well-informed and educated society to grasp immediately, that 19 hijackers with a leader in the mountains of Afghanistan we're able to not only fly around our airspace for an hour and a half, hit all these targets, and were able to setup some type of demolition in two 110 story skyscrapers in NYC.... I mean Jesus Christ even back then we still had the largest and most powerful military by multiples to the closest second. It is reasonable to assume it HAD to have had SOME type of internal help. IT HAD TO OF. Once the bush admin was caught in a lie of that size, how can anything ever be believed ever again when it comes to what were being told?
      </p>
      <p>
       YET...
      </p>
      <p>
       They rammed through right in front of everyone -no fast track no overnight or do it on a holiday bs games - was proudly shown live all over the TV as some proud moment in law or our liberty or some fucking bullshit. They put through the most unpatriotic Bill to take away multiple constitutional rights and forever alter the Spectre of relationship between US government and citizens of the world including the US own people... they do this by simply calling it...THE PATRIOT ACT. You have to remember also at that time to even dare hint that 911 was anything other than word for word the official story meant that you were unpatriotic and even your fucking parents would tell you you should leave the country if you don't like it. All they had to do was call it the Patriot Act and for anyone to even question it would immediately label you a social pariah.
      </p>

       I know that was long-winded as fuck LOL, but really... that fact in and of itself that we as a nation could collectively fall for that is prove it and of ITSELF our society is sick. How can we or anyone of ANY given country be proud of our nation and proud to be a citizen, if it is accepted behavior by the public to let these assholes roll out a bill with a million and one illegal aspects to it, because the arbitrary propagandized name put on it means you cannot question it. I'm embarrassed as an American of that story. It's fucking pathetic.

       And that is why I will never trust Hannity.  He was a huge Bush/patriot act shill, attacking and discrediting the very people he supposedly supports now.  I'm fairly certain his allegiances this election were purely profit motivated.  He saw he could be the one talking head on Trumps side and capitalized on the opportunity.

       As for the Patriot Act and the NSA, that is something very difficult to abandon at this rate. One of Trump's major talking points is stopping terrorism and the spread of ISIS in the US. Naturally, with his stance on closed borders and immigrant vetting he is most likely going to be pro NSA and pro Patriot Act. I mean the two kind of go hand in hand. If you want to make sure everybody entering is legal and not a jihadist then yea, im sure some surveillance will need to be conducted. This is not to mention his increased border security, which will need some type of government surveillance to operate. As for Israel, I have yet to see a politician who has been openly against Israel and get very far. Am I pro Israel, not a chance, but for a person running for president to be anti Israel it would spell an end to their campaign. And as for the 2nd Amendment, based off of  what is on his website and everything he has stated, he states he is pro gun and is in favor of constitutional carry, so im not sure where you are getting that from?

       In the debates he literally agreed with Hillary about the practice of: if you are on a no-fly list (which you get placed without trial and against your will), you shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun. This is infringement of your Second Amendment without trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you have both justified tyranny AND selectively remembered policy. You are the optimal catch in the net of the two party mental prison.

       What kills me about this whole no fly list and not being able to buy a gun garbage is that nobody talks about what the criteria is to get on the no-fly list.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is so general that anyone can be put on that list and there is no due process in a court of law a person can take to get off of it or even find out why they are on it. Once you get a grasp on the fact that at the absolute LEAST, the most important components of the government have been hijacked and our system no longer functions as it was intended. It is rotten to the Core and in all honesty it is completely shot to hell, how can you rationalize that we should give this government body the power to run a list like that? Are people fucking insane?
      </p>
      <p>
       So knowing this, why would you ever give this entity the power to put people on a list like the one I just described? Any reasonable person gets what I'm saying. Of course it sounds good and politically correct when you say it fast on CNN that we're just trying to keep guns off of known terrorist, but people need to start waking the fuck up and realize that anyone who has an ideology other than the government is a terrorist. So no, I don't think I would say that being on this bullshit no fly list is an automatic dismissal for buying weapons. And once you hear this argument explain correctly, people realize that I am not a baby hating jerk who doesn't care about the children. In all reality, I do care about the fucking children and I'm trying to do my best to help create a world where young kids get to even live long enough in to see adulthood. Thats not an exaggeration. Our planet is dying, the collective human soul is dying on a lot of levels, and it is not fear mongering to say that we are on the cusp of multiple catastrophes and that she was going to drop one where the other in our lifetimes. Some of this ship can be stopped and some of it can't, but God damn it I'm going to at least try for the stuff that I can. One of the main things that separates our country, and gives our citizenry a Fighting Chance of defeating this evil cabal, is the fact that there are so many guns in the hands of citizens. I don't think many small town people who don't look outside their City realize that guns being as commonplace as they are in our country is a complete Rarity. We are about to lose it all and at the very least, we are not as powerless as many of the other world populations. That is maybe the latest remaining trump card we hold. U really wanna give it up to feel "safe" from the boogey man? It is statistically that you will be struck by lightning than ever get hurt by a terrorist attack.

       Agreed. Even with considering that we have had an election that has been so fucking over the top,  that none of us would have believed it if a time traveler telling us the future 1-2 years ago. People thought house of cards was unrealistic when you think back not that long ago lol...
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this insane social/political climate, the things trump have said as far as outing fellow rich and elite people and having no boundaries as far as these leaks go, I don't think even the nuttiest NWO card carrying member would ever think this type of damage to the entire establishment is somehow justified or a good idea. Sure the elites are always sloppy with the loose ends of their grand feature presentations like 9/11, Sandy Hook, some of these HAARP created "natural disasters" (Haiti, Fukushima?, Katrina? Look it up) we have every few years, but smaller more contained PsyOPs tend to go pretty well, especially if competent black Intel is involved.

       I did, holy shit that was amazing. I think that whole audience was full of Masons amongst others dark figures. The guys you see constantly at his right and left are in a permanent state of nervosity and anxiety. You could see the terror and discontentment in their eyes and face.

       That really was a great video man. See this is why I requested this from you people, I would never run into that video hadn't I asked because there are hundreds of Trump speeches on youtube.
This one was really amazing, the things he said and the tension in that room is something that I've never seen in any other Trump speeches. I would be delighted if you had more of these type of videos.

       Trump's policies are horrendous. Oh, his policies... It's painful how much I disagree with the man:
      </p>
      <p>
       --His energy policy will continue the use of coal and fracking, two very dirty sources (and his website makes no mention of green or alt fuel sources). And this is terrifying: "Eliminate our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. We will also scrap the EPA’s so-called Clean Power Plan which the government estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year."
      </p>
      <p>
       --He called for Snowden to be executed. And I have no idea what his "cybersecurity" force would mean for individual privacy rights. As far as I can tell he does not support net neutrality, but when I've looked up quotes related to the matter I can see how these statements could be spun against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       --He talks a lot of "school choice" which really means increased privatization of public schools and the proliferation of charter schools. I don't support this at all. I believe we should be increasing federal funding and eliminating performance-based funding, and the common core model.
      </p>
      <p>
       And his policies are so vague that I don't even know what he actually intends to do. For example, "cancel immediately all illegal and overreaching executive orders." Like which ones, exactly...? And, "Decrease the size of our already bloated government after a thorough agency review." Decrease how? "Reform the entire regulatory code to ensure that we keep jobs and wealth in America." Uhhh, which parts?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I might be tempted is to give Clinton the middle finger (and with it, everything wrong about US politics).

       No. And as awful as it may sound I genuinely don't see the point, given my political leanings. I don't agree with Trump's policies, but I despise Clinton and would have to be held at gunpoint to vote for her.

       I'm looking at third party, maybe. But voting is also an act that I somehow buy into present day politics when I'm so thoroughly disgusted with all of it.

       Pace and Lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump “paces” the public – meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump look scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency.

       Question: Would like to see Hillary walking in shackles, in an orange jumpsuit surrounded by a media circus being led into a penitentiary only to make a daring escape in a mysterious black escalade on live TV and becoming a fugitive?

       Agreed. He has been vague on many issues, even though he has made some very good points.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has always been a player holding his cards close to the chest - which is nescessary to succeed in the way he has, but has proven to not always be a positive thing in the old circles of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he has made many people aware in this campaign non the less.

       I don't know how you were feeling but if you are feeling depressed and hopeless, do not feel alone. Anyone who is awake to the truth of the world and I mean the entire truth cannot be crushed by the weight of the burden of knowledge if your a good soul. Being a good person and knowing you have to live in this type of world, which will sometime make you want to go back to being ignorant.

       Actually I felt that way too.  But I'm wondering if he was a plant all along or if it was just the people running his campaign at first.  I'd really like to know how the timeline of MSM and HRC attacks against him (not the stuff he has said on the election trail) and when he started cleaning house with his campaign staff line up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I read the emails about the Clinton camp strategies of pushing the GOP into supporting the most fringe candidate, (and realizing out of all the actual possible nominees Trump was the only one really like that) that Donald didn't destroy Hillary over the FBI investigation at first or really attack her much at all like he did the people in the GOP he ran against, and the one email (
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46441">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46441
       </a>
       ) Leslie Dach asked what he can do to help.  Podesta then fwd the email to Palmieri saying
 "I have been thinking about him for Trump role too. I think he's heavier than Miner. PS I have not broached this with him wanted to get your take first." sounds a bit off to me.  Are they suggestion sending him to Trump or maybe against Trump?  Also just look at how he has pulled himself away from all of his most extreme views as well since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he was a plant the whole time and once enough emails and scandals about Hillary came out redpilled himself.  Maybe just his campaign staff was compromised and he found out and changed up leadership because of it.  I think that could explain why all of a sudden attacks went from what he is saying and doing now into attacks about everything in his past.

       I'll disagree with Trump being a puppet. I do believe he is a genuine outsider (at least from the political class) but due to business interests has a fairly good idea of how to work the system and who the players are.
Hillary probably did try to secretly promote him as the republican candidate thinking he would implode from his own "Trumpness" but didn't gauge how much America was tired of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment is scared of him because he has said some things that truly scare the oligarchy..."term limits", "fair tax", "government that works for the people", and "smaller gov't".
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was not my first choice and I only like him being a candidate because he talked about things the establishment tries to avoid. He forced the rest of the candidates to answer the things on our mind this exposing them for the RINO's they really are. When he got the nomination I had to really think about Trump as president and came to the conclusion. What if he could pull off one of the many things on my wish list?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not Hillary, he has the best chance of beating Hillary. Who knows, we might get term limits or a federal hiring freeze and in 4 years a stage will be set for another outsider or maybe even a true 3rd party. We won't be able to spike the ball this election but let's make sure we get the first down.

       I used to lurk here years ago when the Ghaddafi thing was happening real time. I came back from the donald sub and the fact that you guys have known half this shit for so long makes me sick. I've had trouble sleeping for days now. I feel like after this election, the chans and TD are going to be, if not already, be public enemy number one. The fact that so much power is coming from such a place has to put a huge target on it. It's amazing to watch something form on the ocho, get posted on the donald, and then just become this huge juggernaut in the space of a few hours. The internet is an amazing thing when it's used like this, which is why I'll lament its impending end.
      </p>
      <p>
       E: it was fun being on TD when it was shitposting and funny memes about guac merchants in the primaries. The mod drama was fucking annoying for a while when the sub got split in two, then it just became this huge...thing. I'm happy to be a part of it. I hope it doesn't make TPTB watch me too closely. Being a lowly peasant has it's advantages.

       What r/the_donald has stumbled upon is tiddly winks compared to most other major conspiracies that is run of the mill for our group and accepted as fact. We have done over years what the Donald is able to do in days on different subjects. All the proof is there for those who look.  What makes what is going on over there so special, is it is supported by CONCRETE evidence that literally no one can explain away, but most importantly, is SIMPLE. Can be proven to just about anyone if they genuinely indulge you for 20 minutes. JFK, 9/11, ETC. are all but proven at this point and not even in debate anymore among us. There is 50x as much as evidence for those when compared to spirit cooking and would be proven fact in any court of law, but are so large, overarching, and complex, that it takes commitment to understand and undo the lifelong brainwashing, and each step of truth in the big subjects opens up more conspiracies you never even heard about...that end up true too and even more bizarre, but REQUIRED to understand before you can grasp something like JFK or 9/11. It's very consuming and requires hours upon hours of reading to really get it, but your sub has proven at least to me, is that everyone is open minded, BUT also puts in the legwork to connect the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is this. Not only is the elites satanic worship and pedo lust real, but a GREAT many of the other major conspiracies end up where Satan worshipping was until 2 days ago. When you grasp the scope, and the LENGTH of time the NWO's plan has been in motion will rock your world. But until you are able to really get to the point of research where you just can't explain away some reason why your wrong about it...it will all fall into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/the_donald has been exposed and proven to on a LARGE scale that pivotal first tin foil conspiracy that turned out to be true. No matter what anyone says, some of the smartest people on Reddit are active on that sub. If they let the chips fall where they may and continue digging, I just think it could be a HUGE turning point in general.

       Yeah I'm one of those people from over on the donald and well tldr.  I've always been fascinated by history and finding out the truth of things as well as the reasoning/motives behind them and the whole spirit cooking/pedo thing that you guys are saying is the tip of the iceberg has really piqued my interest.

       Take your time with that. It is A LOT of information to digest. I really mean that. It's the whole shebang, the entire plot and all the actors, from the masons, to the jesuits, to the zionists, etc. It ties them all together with quotes from their own works.

       But in order to give you a clear picture of what is going on, Cooper didn't skip on any details, so it's a 40+ part series. The page i linked there contains the first 10 parts, at the bottom of the page you'll find the link for the next 10 and so on.

       Osama bin Laden as the man who the government will blame on the coming next big terrorist attack on june 28 2001. He explains why Osama will take the blame and how the state and the media are preparing the public to take the bait. You can look that up on youtube "bill cooper predicts 9/11". He was a true american patriot and he devoted his life to bringing out the truth.

       Again thank you.  It definitely helps to have somewhere to start with all this.  I really hope that a lot of the people from the donald also come over here.  They have an insane amount of skill at covering a lot of things quickly and putting 2 and 2 together so to speak.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  I'm not sure what you guys will think of this but just scroll through the comments section.

       I've been on the donald since it had ~5000 total subscribers. It was a perfect storm. It started out with just memes and trump euphoria. Then the Orlando massacre and the Nice terrorist attacks happened and it was the only place on reddit where information was actually available. That made people go there even if they were not Trump supporters. It built up their credibility. And then the wikileaks started and it because the central point of the entire internet investigation, even MSM having to discuss their findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real "mass-mind engine" that powers it in it's research is the number one most hated place by liberals on the open web - 4chan.org/pol/ . But the media can't draw attention to it no matter what because you can't have millions of people suddenly interested in it. Because out every 100 people that go over there just to laugh at the crazies, I'd say at least 10 of them will switch sides, and more then half will start to question the narrative anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the donald has done what /pol/ could have never accomplished on their own, due to their reputation (and extreme autism) - brought the truth right to the eyes of the masses. And once you learn of these things, there is really no going back. You can't know that the establishment is run basically by pedo-satanists and dismiss that. Maybe you can tell yourself for a while you don't want to become "one of those crazy conspiracy theorists" , but then you'll stumble across another piece of the puzzle and you'll see how it fits with the rest. And then another piece of the puzzle. And then another campaign by the media where it's nothing but pure lies and deceit. You can't hide your head in the sand no matter how hard you try.

       Well, it will be if the ball keeps rolling in this direction, or at least in some way of the way I described above. We all dream of having a lot more of us so that we could scream the truth so loudly we could not be silenced. It's usually that, just a dream. We have a completely genuine shot at that here. I didn't want it to pass us by without saying something. Worst that could happen is you all looked at me like I was nuts LOL, but we all know that's par for the course in this line of business so it was worth the risk to me 😉

       I agree that they are awakening but they are also too wrapped up to critique their own candidate or anyone supporting trump. The reason I enjoy this sub is because everybody is fair game on both sides of the aisle to expose. The thing about Trumps followers that saddens me is that whatever he does is the right thing.

       I understand what you're saying, but the truth of the matter is everybody else involved in this election is corrupt to the core. I mean if people were coming in here cheering on the bad guys we would kick them out also. Try to see it that way and it makes more sense. The operation they have going on over there is accomplishing something that all six major media networks have not been able to do combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case people don't know, they ARE the media for this whole wikileaks event. They have been working non-stop 2 bring nuggets of truth to life and within a day or two it is on Fox News and then beyond. I'm not exaggerating when I say they are the ones doing the work. It's awesome to watch.

       You know, if we find out that Trump is doing occult rituals, or he is involved in pedo ring cover up, or that he is corrupt, it will be a big thing. We really hate corruption there. There is just almost no serious dirt on him. There is Trump University, and the fact that before he ran he was part of the club, and bribed politicians to get things done... and that's about it.

       That's what I gathered too. Good people who are principled. If the same crisis struck Trump I 100% believe the reaction would be the exact polar opposite response. Instead of Clinton supporter denial, I think his core would turn on him. His core as in intelligent people just like with any group, not the redneck painted media image of a trump supporter.

       Trump isn't the time traveler. That is a normie mistake. Pence is the time traveler and has brought the information back in time with him.

       I agree, I am mostly a lurker. I don't post much because I don't know much. But I read this shit all day, and I have been checking The_Donald more and more because they have the most comprehensive and intense searches through the WikiLeak emails that I can find. Someone needs to help people like me undestand what's going on and make the connections I missed due to willful, blissful ignorance.

       I think we need more tech literate data visualisers and nerds to help organise the info.
       <a href="https://clinton.media.mit.edu/">
        MIT released a tool that visually illustrated the network
       </a>
       of Clinton's emails, that sort of thing can be very handy.   If that tool itself would pull in biographical wiki data on each persons organisational links etc it would be even better, as a hard part of the work is contextualising the individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing I still haven't seen that I think is missing and desparately needed is automated reconstruction of the emails into threads to make entire conversations easier to follow and refer to.

       This is exactly what happened to me.  This election has been a major red pill.  For me, the most eye opening thing has been the media coverage.  This is my first election I'm old enough to vote in, so I don't know if the media bias has always been this evident, but it really seems like they've visibly gone from "bias" to "coverup".  People's trust in the media is at an all time low.  I know there has always been corruption and bias in the media but I wonder if they fucked up this time and made it too obvious?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen some people on here suggest Trump is controlled opposition.  But how can that benefit tptb?  Can't you have some other Republican oppose Clinton that won't be trying to redpill people left and right with talk of Soros and globalism and wikileaks?  And if it's controlled opposition, the media probably shouldn't need to try quite so hard to fight him.  It seems like the excessively anti-Trump coverage has harmed the media's reputation, and if people don't trust the media anymore how can it be used to effectively lie to the masses?

       I've been on the fence with the whole trump plant thing for a long time. But with all we know now, this one doesn't need over thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       No plant would be allowed to go as far and as deep as he has in public about all these revelations that damage the entire WORLD establishment. Those awakened folk have studied and learned about real plants and their corresponding plots all throughout history. At first, ya I thought it may be a AAA PsyOP. But these are people belong to the same  kabal that ran the SandyHoax failure. They aren't "tight" and together enough to pull this kinda shit off. I mean at least they never have in the past, and with the whole thing on thin ice the past few years...this is beyond their scope. Just my 2 cents.

       Exactly. I thought that at first but their rabid hatred and spin is proof enough, as well as all he's saying. No way in hell they want this happenning, and he's brutalizing Hillary. Some of the coup/counter-coup stuff..... But if it is a counter-coup, fine. Still better than Hillary. She's a fucking nightmare.

       Check out my post from a month ago. I also have noticed this, and I think wether or not Donald is for real or a plant
(I like to stay positive and think he is the real deal, but time will tell)
What's important is the mass awakening, the topics that are being talked about, and the corruption that is surfacing, also that many are now seeing exactly how mainstream programs are just that.. Programming. 
I wish we had more time, but I think it's important to help this momentum grow, mass awakening is more important that who is president.
One thing I'm sure if, Hillary is corrupt, a liar, and will drag us into nuclear war for her benefit and that of her handlers. Go out and vote Trump, the people this movement has woke will not lie down and get fucked by him if he turns out to be a puppet like Obama.

       I fear for the future of reddit. Either after the election, CTR and the reddit censorship will go away and reddit will slowly return to normal, or something worse will happen. I fear that it won't go away, and that there will be a consistent and growing effort to censor the internet and control the dialogue on every medium possible.

       No need to be sorry, sooooo many of us out in the world feel EXACTLY the same as you. But saying so among normies out in the world makes us look like fucking crackpots cause they don't get it. We were all like that at one point, so I really do try to be patient. Very few people were raised in truth with minimal exposure to mass brainwashing.

       That group of people needs to be using their time wisely after their main purpose is gone. They are great at researching and connecting dots. And since they have just been exposed to the truth right at the end stage it would be great if they continue down this path to see the bigger conspiracy.

       I think Wikileaks has only released a fraction of what they have at this point.   And the_donald and /pol are sending out FOIA requests left right and centre.   They will take months probably to process, and basically, I expect this drip feed of leaks to continue for months or years.

       And don't forget, the dead man switch files. I am sure there are things in that, that are never meant to see the light of day and only be used for their stated purpose as a Deadman switch.

      <p>
       Here's a conspiracy shower thought. I've noticed some people like to download those 80 gigabyte encrypted to the Moon and back dead switches and keep them like almost a collection. It's common knowledge that Quantum Computing will destroy any and all encryption we currently have with little to no effort. In a decade or two when Quantum Computing is in households...I wonder just how many of those dead switches will yield completely unexpected and unplanned for Bombshells in some future time. Just a thought.

       I wonder how many of those mega releases with a password from high profile leakers had the thought process we just discussed cross their mind. It seems like such an obvious fact but I doubt that it is something someone in the position to obtain damaging blackmail material on the most powerful people on earth, and then create and distribute one of the key protected zips thinking everyone now has it and it can forever sit as a silent land mine. Do you think people who are trying to stay alive when targeted by the elite is thinking of the eventual quantum revolution? Eh, the planet will most likely be destroyed or all life on it in any other number of ways first lol.

       And most importantly we've gained a large number of information spreaders, from very diverse backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most important bit, i think. That these people are the kind that engage with others and, once they believe in something, they go out and fight for it. And they used to be "normies", so others like them won't be able to dismiss them like they did to us for such a long time.

       I don't think the point of this post is to defend Donald. The fact of the matter is, in their fervor to take down Hillary, they're putting in the man power to sift through the endless amounts of emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no mystery that Trump is a complete scumbag himself. But I think Hilary's time to answer for the atrocities she's committed has come. They're helping for whatever reason. One scumbag at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump had been accused by one of Epsteins' underage sex slaves as well, and his time will come. But for now, we have Hillary cornered and we need to do what we can to ensure she is brought to justice.

       Trump made sure his team didnt do opposition research on him. He WANTS scandals and smears, all it does is embolden him and make him stronger. Even if Trump loses the election, it's win for him as he is looking to start a TV network. Something alittle more to the right of Fox news and maybe a bit more professional than InfoWars

       Your completely wrong. This was the entire point of my post, they get it. They believe it and they know it's a fact now. I can't even tell you how many times in the past couple days there are people posting over there in the morning talking about how they did not get sleep and they are sick to their stomach. They are getting it. This is my whole point. They are going through what we all went through the first few days after awakening when it hits you that ya, this shit is real and basically everything they thought they knew was a lie. We all we through that. It has nothing to do with the candidate himself.

       I am not defending their support for Donald Trump or not, but what I will say is yes most of them do support him.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, and it's a HUGE but, they support a more realistic image of the man and not the MSM painted version that we have all been taught to hate. I mean shit, if he was what the MSM says, I doubt most of the intelligent people would be donating there time. As pretty much the official representative of conspiracy on read it, I do not think nearly enough people here are open-minded to a lot of things including him which is very hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get pissed when people do not see the truth in front of their eyes and will not even spend 5 minutes to try and see otherwise. I have noticed that Donald Trump for better or worse is in that category. And to top it all off, the fucking campaign should be never Hillary not never Trump. Looking at it through just those basic Optics, he is the only other choice of resistance 2 Hillary Clinton and say what you want about Trump, say ALL the rape allegations are true (which they have proven not to be if you take the time to research), he is still an angel compared to that crooked cunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel that even if you cannot get on board with Donald Trump, you cannot even consider yourself "awake" if you somehow think Hillary Clinton is the better option. That woman is so cold vile and evil that, like I said, the campaign should have been #neverhillary seriously.

       Epstein pleaded the 5th about many people he had ties too.

       Epstein is a billionaire and was up to things besides cp, things other businessmen like Trump would be interested in (like real estate).

       I need to find the source but I recall that Trump went to one of Epstein's parties, left early, and banned Epstein from all of his properties.

       I actually subbed to r/conspiracy as I saw things were getting sketchy with Hillary about 4-5 months ago. It's always interesting watching my front page. r/the_donald typically dominates it but whatever is posted there I see a follow up on here confirming/denying/or connecting dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Safe to say after the last week I'm officially "Woke af". I can't go throughout the day without thinking about the corruption and I'm certain there are millions others like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If r/the_donald can grasp some of the plausible conspiracies we talk about over here, there really isn't any force that could stop the "weaponized autism" that is tearing down the curtains around Hillary.

       That's awesome good luck to you and welcome to reality. It fucking blows but it beats living in a fake fantasy that doesn't really exist. Correct the record has brought Paige seals on a military level to the mainstream, but believe me when I say that kind of shit being done by way more powerful entities has been happening to this sub and anywhere else on the internet for YEARS at this point. Regulars at this sub are so used to it that it's just accepted its going to happen... but for years most, people outside of this group  believed that it was another in the long list of things we were paranoid and tin foil hat mentally ill about. Still pisses me off that most people still think it just started and we were imagining it before now but whatever fuck them.

       Never forget your new-found judgment that does not rely on what CNN says is fact. We all know everybody likes to carry themselves and protect themselves that they are free thinkers, when in reality most people do need the masses approval in deciding what is fact, and what is reality to them, on even just a subconscious level. Deciding to consciously and therefore eventually subconsciously decide to judge all information and  give your GUT the final say instead of the mass consensus, will become the most powerful concept to ever cross your life. It's a wild ride but you now can see clearly.

       Yeah I've always been kind of aware that this stuff has been happening, I just never really cared until I realized how much it could affect me. This election is huge and will predict geopolitics for the next 40 years. If Hillary wins, we lose our liberties, freedoms, and basic civil rights. If Trump wins we will see a political reform (hopefully) that will also allow the rest of the world to follow suit. The UK attempting to separate from the UN is massive, and if Trump wins the people will have the backing of the US to successfully split. We are seeing protests just today in the streets of Germany to kick Merkel out of office. We are on the edge of a massive world political reform for the good.

       As for the news, I have NEVER watched the news or read newspapers for anything other than sports. I can't stand how negative everything is, always glorifying deaths and murders, slime bags, and corrupt CEOs. I only hope we can get rid of this crap in the future. It starts with the parent companies like ATT Comcast Verizon. They control EVERYTHING we see, internet, TV, billboards, magazines... It's absolutely insane.

       Your sub gains enormous credibility for not being CTR controlled. Likely due to your name. Of course they want the truth to be associated with conspiracy. Anyways, I came here to share a theory
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a theory about the "hanky with a pizza related map"
      </p>
      <p>
       the email basically said "hey i found a black and white hanky with a pizza related map. it may be yours, do you want it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they mention "hanky" to invoke the hankercheif code. Black and white means BDSM with a virgin (possibly a minor).
      </p>
      <p>
       MAP is an acronym for Minor Attracted Person. Pedophile. (Google it)
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza related means interested in girls. (according to the pizza/hot dog code)
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it all together -
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have a back and white hanky with a pizza related map, do you want it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       MEANS
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have a person who wants to do BDSM with a little girl, can you help?"

       I was banned (on a different account) seemingly in response to me saying that, while I was planning not to vote at all, CTR's efforts were making me strongly consider voting for Trump.  I said absolutely nothing negative about Trump, as I know they don't like that, and yet I was banned seemingly just because I was only mildly pro-Trump rather than crazy insane pro-Trump.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       wants to participate in.  Here, one might believe that Clinton is a criminal, but they're still allowed to question whether any particular anti-Clinton news is true.  In

       Donald support is pretty heavily censored or drowned out across not only reddit but the entire internet. The_Donald is one of the last bastions for Trump supporters. Unfortunately, this means that they can be pretty ban-happy if they even suspect you are a shill, CTR, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of The_Donald is not Trump critique. It is Trump praise.

       Yeah. It's a constant battle over there to keep CTR under control, and as it's the last bastion, they have to be a little aggressive in banning/moderating to keep control. It's unfortunate, but I think it's mostly CTRs fault. I'm relatively new, so I may be wrong, but I've been over there a ton since I got on and that definitely seems to be the situation.

       Yeah the Spirit dinner video super red pilled many into Satanist / occult stuff the one two punch with the pedo ring info sent many the_donald subs over the edge into the abyss. The average person wouldn't even believe it if you showed them what the Clinton's are up to. If she wins there are going to be tons of people spreading info on the clintons that hopefully the public as a whole wakes up. There are so many crimes hard to even guess which one will stick first.

       They went trophy hunting. That is a well-known fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trophy hunting being immoral/wrong is opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you posted about his sons trophy hunting from the position of it being horrible and cruel and awful. Apart from The_Donald generally being unwelcome of anything negative against Trump or his family (for understandable reasons), it's also something that has nothing to do with the elections and probably a decent amount of people on that sub partake in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably tagged you as someone trying to use the board to protest his sons' hunting practices in an attempt to discredit Don and didn't want anything to do with you.

       Nope. Wrong. All I did was say they were trophy hunters. Period. I gave no opinion of their character whatsoever. I wish I could remember what the topic was. Maybe I was commenting about this being the reason why Hillary complimented his sons. So much for free speech. It should still be a topic worthy of mature discussion.

       Saying they are trophy hunters and that is why Hillary complimented them is definitely a comment on their character. Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that is totally how I would have read it.

      <p>
       Here's Trump's sons. They trophy hunt. Maybe that's why Hillary (who is a murderer) complimented them. Looks like an opinion of their character to me.

       Not going to go over well. If you want to talk about trophy hunting, I am sure there are plenty of subreddits that would be glad to discuss it with you.

       I guess you're right. I despise trophy hunters. Anyone that keeps reminders and/or corpses of their hunt, are not right in the head. Every single serial killer ever kept trophies. It's the best way to remember how you felt while stalking and during the kill. I don't like people who enjoy snuffing out the life of an innocent creature that meant you no harm whatsoever. You just wanted to see it's head on your wall and brag to all your fellow non-empaths. By the way, I voted for Jill Stein. IF the election isn't completely rigged and she gets at least 5% of the total votes, I'll be looking forward to the Green party participating in the debates in 4 years. Good day to you!

       Unfortunately, I doubt that the rigged elections will give Jill the attention she has likely earned. Hopefully we will see a break from the two-party system soon.

       Have a good day. If the elections are a total fraud and Hillary is handed the presidency, maybe we'll take to the streets together.

       I think they only say that you have to be pro-Trump.  However, what you've said, that one has to agree or GTFO, is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may be pro-Trump, but if someone posts a Wikileaks email and claims it proves some anti-Clinton claim, but in reality the email doesn't support that claim at all, you'll be banned for sympathizing with the enemy if you point that out.  It doesn't matter that you hate Clinton and love Trump, and it doesn't matter that you'd just like to see genuine anti-Clinton news not be drowned out by bogus anti-Clinton news.  You have to either agree with literally everything that is posted there or you have to keep your mouth shut and let them circle jerk.

       They had a crazy regime change/upheaval so might have been during that time.

       I have noticed that it's not like they ban someone for saying anything Pro Clinton, it is just the fact that they don't deal in bullshit, and strive for what seems to be truth, and upholding their reputation as spouting facts and not garbage. They just do not tolerate stupid naive Fanboy comments. That's how I take it anyways.

       Lol me too. Their weaponised autism or whatever they call it in jest, is pretty impressive. For the sake of this argument, take out Trump and even the fact this is a presidential election. If you look at that Subs most active members as just a group of people, their internet sleuthing skills are not only fairly impressive...but the INSANELY quick speed that they have been processing this information and sending it out in a nicely packaged, easy to understand, solid message and/or meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       This loose group here has naturally and organically formed (not assembled and paid like CTR) based on self motivation, are able to communicate and delegate literally the sifting, sorting, and searching literally thousands of emails every 24 hours, then does a shit ton of back research in real time in official highly streamlined specific posts, then "connect's dots" that require somewhat of a vast knowledge base of many complex subjects, letting others know they are coming and going and handing off all kinds of shit,  work and feel duty to loosely organized shifts, and SOMEHOW at the end of the day... they have it boiled down to a concrete factual summation of the day's findings that even any brainless wonder can understand it AND to top it the fuck off... not only put the information out there on a global scale, but has a huge impact to the point that the media gets every single leak-related story or "break" in the news from this group of people. It has been happening that way all month, it's almost like clockwork. Definitely not just a couple lucky breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       A group who can do all of that and for absolutely no money and strictly online no less, is extremely powerful. They are freshly redpilled, and if you can get over whatever notion you have of who their candidate is, their group has morphed into a Powerhouse for justice and the truth. I am not even claiming it was done on purpose,  to the contrary it seemed quite organic and the rabbit hole led this group to shit that insta redpilled and physically affected alot of people, sending them on the journey for truth that we all have been through or, in the process. I really highly doubt  those people set out to end up with end goals that mirror our black sheep sub...called r/conspiracy. Reading peoples posts about the physical/mental anguish... The horrific shit they had to read and look up, to get it out to the world these past couple days..Idk I couldn't stomach it and it's obvious that a mass awakening is going down due to the inertia of their original cause, and a surprise crack speed awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think my point is that they have naturally been led to a "Y" in the road, that meets up with us and our same goals when it comes to the truth and all of the conspiracies and bullshit that go along with the elite and the NWO. In a few days this hell-hole election will be over, and it is also obvious that this group is not going to stop the search for truth after Nov 8. We know better than anyone that at the end of the day we are all brothers and sisters on this planet and should not allow their hate-filled rhetoric to divide us. We all know we are blasted constantly with that shit. We should practice some Unity with our fellow man and get behind a common goal even if we do not agree on how we got to this point. I say, who fucking cares? This is literally life or death we are talking about and we all know there are thousands of us good people in the world  to every 1 of the truly diabolical conspiratorial elite. The NWO/Illuminati whatever have gotten this far ONLY because nobody believes or knows the truth.  That simple folks.  We have a golden opportunity to really set some inertia in changing that. Let's not let the world down.

       I agree with you as far as there is no right choice here. But it's not because it's them two people specifically Anyone who has researched a decent bit and is "awakened", knows it is two sides of the same coin. It is now, it will continue to be unless something changes, and to newly awakened folks, it has been going on DECADES. Us electing the President or any other "democratic" high power position is nothing but a bread and circus to have us all get together and let the people who actually run the world put on an interactive(but ILTIMATELY rigged) exercise so we end up feeling we have some type of say in how our country is run. And for most dumb asses it satiates any civic duty they have for another 4 years and can go back to Kim Kardassians dumb antics. Even if the presidency was not corrupted and completely legitimate, he isn't a king. We have 100s/1000s of people on all levels from Congress to any of the bazillion agencies we got with white AND black budgets in this country unparalleled anywhere else on earth who also have a hand in steering humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's come back to reality and realize we have absolutely nothing close to what you could call a democracy, the government is corrupted/puppeted/bought etc. for ANY high level position that matters at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is the rubber stamp we get put on top of the ship by we have to eat. But that's all he is is a mascot selling us a pile of shit. The presidency has no real power in our current day and age.

       Thank you! I used to be a browser in this sub for a while. I felt lost by how many running theories there were...then #SpiritCooking happened and boom. Now I don't know what My government is, wants, or stands for.
      </p>

       I know that Spirit Cooking is only a Tip of an iceberg as its in a whole strange category of "performance art," but now I am curious to see what other "conspiracy theories" are true.

       While I have been tempted to drop little truth bombs when appropriate about shit like 9/11 over there, but have so far refrained. No one becomes awaken unless they decide to really open everything up and do a lot of learning. Unfortunately, the public has been conditioned to turn the fuck off instantly as soon as any of these hot-button conspiracies come up. Why bother even trying to push the issue when by the looks of it they are going to arrive at all that shit regardless if r/the_donald remains on the same trajectory, unless certain agencies get privy and start really throwing shit at that sub to disrupt and muddy it all the fuck up just like they have done to ours. Our dear Aaron was a dreamer, in this site can at times produce magic moments, and magic movements when not deliberately sabotaged or fucked with. Unfortunately, you don't see that much nowadays anywhere in cyber world, which is why I think this whole Saga was noteworthy to me.

       Yeah...  good points.  I wonder if they'll shut down the Donald subreddit like they did with the SandersForPresident subreddit after the primary was over.  Will be interesting to see.  I'm guessing they'll shut it down if Clinton wins just like they did with the Bernie one.  I hope the opposite happens though!

       No doubt, what has been happening recently in that sub is leading up to a huge awakening of the masses. But at the same time, this is the same sub that was basically just circlejerking "fuck Islam", "deport islam", "fuck Muslims" etc over and over again since its creation...

       Eh, different crowd now. I haven't seen any of that and have been all over it for a month now. Yes there is some aggressive people on there, but every sub has that. We just can't stand how much is coming up about the Clintons and the media isn't even covering it. Eyes have been opened.

       I was skeptical of 9/11 after I got out of high school. I was in 3rd grade when it happened, my teacher's husband was an airliner pilot and she had the radio on when it all went down.

       Pro-tip. Alex Jones is basically the pressed, gold plated mold for a textbook example of a disinformation agent. Some will argue that he has been controlled opposition from day one 20 years ago, While others like myself believe that he was subverted somewhere along the way after he began. A plant or controlled opposition would never have been allowed to take cameras into the Bohemian Club and air the entire cream of care ritual (or whatever the fuck it is) to the entire world almost everyone agrees that you get 70 / 80% truth mixed with 20% bullshit that is concocted just right to keep us all confused and searching for ever. To this very day Alex Jones is the only reporter to have ever made it in and came back out with audio or video proof of the bohemian club.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you were being like what I'm about to say, but I hope to God all of these new awakened folk don't think they can just go switch on the Alex Jones Show everyday and get caught up on reality. That would probably actually put an individual's enlightenment even further behind and give more brainwashing to be undone in the future!

       I can completely understand where someone could be annoyed to no end with that stuff. Its a respectable position especially since you seem to be one of the few adults in the world left who can say they don't like something without shit talking whatever it is and acting like people who do enjoy it are fucking weirdos or something lmao.

       I only visit the_donald and conspiracy, im a refugee from s4p and rpolitics. They are really open minded people that cares about America before anything else. Dont expect this sub and the_donald to be 100% factual but at least they are trying hard to spread the truth, where as other subs and the MSM are totally corrupted and spreading misinformations on purpose.

       I've been on there about a month now, all the time. I see people being super supportive of LGBT. There are plenty of guys on there talking about how much they support trump, how it's re only place thuce found where they feel at home, etc. We all know the MSM lies. They've painted a very inaccurate picture of trump. Not saying he's perfect at all, but pretty much all the most extreme things they say are bunk. And the community for the most part is better than he is. People run the gamut from total trump fans to pragmatic trump supporters and everywhere in-between. Take a stroll, I think you'll be surprised. They also know how to have fun which is a real relief in this crap election.

       I've definitely seen a lot of tasteless jokes about minorities in the comments there, as well as people proudly using rainbow flair. Ultimately they don't really represent trump but the comments are just an embarrassing cess pool. It is dystopic, the way people just mindlessly cheer eachother and spout nonsense

      <p>
       When at home, at people's houses, on TV (she said that specifically), it is the real deal evil nasty weirdo shit of worshipping Moloch and shit on the dark side, and not just an expression of art. So how about YOU don't try and make people think lies and disinformation shit. I don't think I got the entire thing could be overblown somewhat comma but to try and dress it up the way you are is just downright deceitful.

       So you're telling me you wouldn't want to get high as fuck and have a good spirit cooking session? For real though the hermetic traditions of the world are a connection that goes straight back to the oldest mystery religions which themselves are iterations of shamanism which goes back to the days when man and beast were indistinguishable. If there is power in her rituals then what she is tapping into most certainly cannot be exclusively bad unless you believe jesus died on the cross for your sins and black metal is Satan worship. Maybe what really needs to happen is that the public needs to wake up to the power in gnosticism and use it to fight back.

       Well to me I feel like if voodoo or ritualistic magic is real and it's only able to do evil then there is something irreconcilable going on in the universe. I'm not saying I'd be slaughtering babies but if there is a level on which supernatural things can be induced by humans it must be at least as nuanced as human experience. It's like a psychedelic, if you only think of people frying on acid in their van and dropping out of society  (not that that in and of itself is bad) then you have a very narrow view of what a psychedelic user is, and what psychedelics are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I think if it's real it certainly predates Abrahamic religions and therefore cannot be properly understood within the bounds of the concept of Satan that the abrahamic religions created, let alone the recent boogie man he has become since the rise of the holy Roman empire.

       They are no friends of free speech - they might not censor you for some things but they'll censor you for others. Try criticizing the police there. They detest the corruptness of politicians and "the system" and then lick the boots of the very people who enforce the corruptness and protect the system. It's the same cognitive dissonance that the rest of the right has.

       I've been on the donald since it had ~5000 total subscribers. It was a perfect storm. It started out with just memes and trump euphoria. Then the Orlando massacre and the Nice terrorist attacks happened and it was the only place on reddit where information was actually available. That made people go there even if they were not Trump supporters. It built up their credibility. And then the wikileaks started and it because the central point of the entire internet investigation, even MSM having to discuss their findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real "mass-mind engine" that powers it in it's research is the number one most hated place by liberals on the open web - 4chan.org/pol/ . But the media can't draw attention to it no matter what because you can't have millions of people suddenly interested in it. Because out every 100 people that go over there just to laugh at the crazies, I'd say at least 10 of them will switch sides, and more then half will start to question the narrative anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the donald has done what /pol/ could have never accomplished on their own, due to their reputation (and extreme autism) - brought the truth right to the eyes of the masses. And once you learn of these things, there is really no going back. You can't know that the establishment is run basically by pedo-satanists and dismiss that. Maybe you can tell yourself for a while you don't want to become "one of those crazy conspiracy theorists" , but then you'll stumble across another piece of the puzzle and you'll see how it fits with the rest. And then another piece of the puzzle. And then another campaign by the media where it's nothing but pure lies and deceit. You can't hide your head in the sand no matter how hard you try.

       Maybe I'm just a crotchety asshole but still, each to their own right? It just annoys me what can I say? But like I said your message and the point of your post is a valid one, I respect that sub for staying true to its values and not conforming like other subs we could mention.
