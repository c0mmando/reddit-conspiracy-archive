       Look on Trump's face, you fucking idiots.  This is not a publicity stunt.  It's a psyop from the Clinton campaign to discredit Trump.

       Okay. Let me make this very clear. My entire post has nothing to do with Hillary. It is not Trump vs Hillary. I am not a Hillary supporter.

      <p>
       I am judging Trump in a vacuum. Hillary does not exist. I am glad you agree that we have two presidential elects who don't give a shit about Nevada.

       Sorry, this place is infested with Trump supporter dupes and babies. They literally can't handle any criticism of him and will call you a Clinton shill for daring to criticizing the Great Leader in any way.

       Plausible. Law enforcement said he was lifting up a sign and someone yelled "gun!"
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't get is why the crowd was attacking the camera guy and trying to cover his camera so that he couldn't capture what was going on (someone eventually started hitting the camera guy). I thought the beef was that the media
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       cover what goes on at the rallies, but here we have a camera person being actively attacked and kept from recording. Wonder if that's just the attendees being thuggish dumbasses or if this plays into your theory - that someone attacking him was trying to ensure he couldn't record the guy probably saying, "Hey, man, just trying to hold up a sign!"

       Number one on r/all right now. Also it was even covered on MSNBC live. The most Hillary infested network on a level even worse than CNN was talking about it. Maybe if this happened to a minor presidential candidate like Johnson it wouldn't be covered, but this is huge news.

       Libertarians have never fought for racists or true conservatives. I never asked for an endorsement, nor, for that matter, do I desire one. I fight to be heard. Libertarians offer platforms only to other Libertarians and progressives with whom they sympathize. Any platform they offer to those who are conservative, traditionalist, or fascists is grudging at best–tacitly condemned and stifled at worst. They offer endorsement to progressives, whether demand by them or not. Libertarians as a group have already chosen their side–they merely pretend not to have by promoting false equivalencies and pretending to stand for the rights of everyone. “Everyone’s right to express themselves is equal,” they say. But just like the progressives with whom they sympathize, some are more equal than others. They have favored sons. That is hardly a sin, but when their entire stance is the refusal to favor any son, it is a hypocrisy. And they refuse to acknowledge or admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians say this is not a particular problem. But it is. It is a very deep and concerning problem, because we fight enemies who will use our freedoms and rights as weapons against us. Agitators will come to meetings and shout us down, crying “free speech!” when they are ejected. Our enemies will form mobs to cause havoc and destruction when we assemble to discuss issues or share information, and cry “freedom to assemble!” when they are dispersed. Our opponents will slander us in the press with blatant distortions and outright lies, and when challenged or called out will hide behind freedom of the press. Mosley encountered this very problem when he attempted to stop Churchill from starting the Second World War. Trump is encountering this problem now. Hitler ran into it before both of them. The reason the Brownshirts, the Blackshirts, and now the Lion’s Guard were formed is that Communist agitators are masters of using the rights and freedoms of a nation to get their way. They will cut you with a knife, proclaim it their right to do so, and cry foul when you push them away or strike back with your fist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why libertarian hypocrisy cannot be borne. Communists, Socialists, Bolsheviks, and Jews will forever and always use our freedoms and rights against us as poisoned daggers. The only way to stop it is employ similar, if tempered, tactics. Even elder libertarians admit this. They themselves claim that a true libertarian society can only come about if all communists, hippies, marxist sympathizers, and welfare leeches are expelled and cast away. But to the matter of how this is to be done, they speak not one word. They see the problem, but much like the handwringing progressives of Europe who see the invaders as a problem but say it is impossible to deport them back they offer not even the faintest hint of a solution. No. There is a solution. There is a solution to getting rid of cultural marxism, just as there is a solution to sending the refugees back. But like the progressives with whom they sympathize, libertarians pretend that what is standing plain before them is not there. If they do see it, they deny it and refuse it, saying there must be some other way–that the situation can be solved without violence or compromising their libertarian mores and morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are wrong. This will never be solved peacefully. The enemy will not permit it. They are dyed in the wool fanatics that believe they are saving the world from itself and will die for what they believe, running the streets red with blood. If you are not prepared to do the same even to stop them, let alone to begin reversing the tide of what they have done, it is tantamount to conceding defeat right now. There are no lengths to which a rabid dog will not go to bite a man. It must be put down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the European talking heads refuse to admit is that the invaders could easily be rebuffed. They came here under their own power. They can leave under their own power. If Europeans started executing every Muslim they see, the problem would sort itself out in under a year. They would self-deport back to where they came from if they were made to fear what lies before them more than what they fled. The same solution exists for cultural marxism and all the various flavors of socialist, communist, quisling, and opportunists that push it. To fight them legitimately within the confines of the rules is to propose the raising up of an entire nation within a nation–to have a second America preaching the truth to counter their lies, a second media machine, a second governmental process, a second source of mass information. This is categorically impossible to accomplish, and even if it weren’t, the powers that be would not permit it. The leviathan of the state would not stand idly by while you erect a behemoth in front of it to fight it. Libertarians admit that the threat must be removed but choose to ignore that it will never go willingly and will fight to the death to fulfill its purpose and nature. Force is the one and only solution. But to do so is foul, disgusting, altogether too barbaric, downright fascist, and, worst of all, that most wicked of libertarian sins–authoritarian. So the libertarian will never do so. He will plead the Fifth on the matter even as they are lowering him into his own grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, even if they had fought for my right to free speech, that means next to nothing. Am I to overlook a man stabbing me in the back with a knife because he once passed me the salt or held open a door for me?
      </p>
      <p>
       The forces arrayed against us will use the rights we value to kill us and everything we hold dear. You have seen it already in the Chicago riots. Under the guise of “freedoms” like the right to assembly and the right to free speech, the actual rights of free speech and freedom to assemble will be unmade through naked terrorism disguised as the will of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only positions libertarians may ever take are to either stand completely aside and permit those who are willing to do what must be done, to join us and fight back, or to stand by their principles as hypocritically as they do now, but show them towards us instead. These are the only viable positions for them to take. The libertarian masses choose none of these. Thus, they are part of the problem, not the solution. And these are just the issues with libertarianism that appear when confronted with the issue of cultural marxism. They go far deeper than this. Libertarianism is the promotion of the individual over all other concerns, and as such libertarianism is the suicide of culture and nation both. Libertarianism will not enforce the changes that are necessary to fix this country, or indeed any country, because any such concentration of power would be condemned for its own sake merely for existing. They promote free trade, which breaks the back of any economy that utilizes it–and always will–for free trade is only viable if all trade partners engage in it, and they never will. Thus, it is a policy of being taken advantage of and will always ultimately lead to jobs and labor being outsourced to foreign bidders and wealth flowing out of the nation and into the pockets of international corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim that progressiveness is only a problem when it is pushed on people by their government. What they fail to realize is that the government will always be biased towards a political ideology, and not only that, it should be. McCarthy’s bias for American traditionalism and against communism is what protected America from it, and but for the Grace of God that he could have gotten all of them instead of merely most, we would not have many of the problems that we do today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government will always force upon the people the ideals of those who hold office. Thus, the government will always be vulnerable to subversion by intrusive and malicious alien elements. It is not a self-correcting system. It must be corrected. Socialism did not form in a vacuum. Just like how women have been granted equal rights many times before in the history of human civilization, it is a symptom of a greater scourge of the entropy of civilization and the decay of society. Sexual liberation, female rights, and socialist policies will always be the harbingers of the end for a society. To try and embrace the poison like libertarians do–to insist that the volatile and poisonous progressive culture can be preserved and is even somehow inherently good–betrays their naked ignorance and naïveté on the subject. It is progressive culture that is causing these problems. It is liberalism that has brought us to this point, it is egalitarianism that has allowed this to come to pass, and it is individualism that permitted this to foment. To preserve modern culture but insist on conservative law and fiscal policy is to replace a rotten fruit with a fresh one, but scoop out the festering heart of the rotten and transplant it into the healthy. It is painting over rust instead of scrubbing it out. The culture dictates everything, because it controls the wills and wants of the people. This is why cultural marxism has been so effective. A nation is held aloft from the very bottommost rung, and that bottom rung is the family–the smallest microcosm of civilization. A family is a group of related people who share space, genetics, and ideas. A group of families is a locality, a group of localities is a city or region, a group of cities or regions is a state, and a state either stands on its own. or itself comprises a group of states that form a nation. Thus, all of civilization is supported by the family.

       This is why the single most successful communist psyop ever played was the feminist one–i.e. the one that attacked the family unit itself. This is no accident. This was by design. This was a poison dart crafted specifically to bring the Western world to its knees and ultimately destroy it, and it is a poison that has outlived the assassins that cast it and will be the death of us yet if we cannot stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To refuse to take a stand against the degeneration of society and culture–to try to “stay above it”–is to be complicit with its blatant and overt destruction. The man who stands by and watches as the gates are lifted and the barbarians are let loose upon the city is complicit in the act of the gateraiser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians would stuff their ears with cotton and gibber of cycles of left and right, completely ignoring that even the right wing of today would be viewed as buffoons, imbeciles, and utter madmen by the conservatives of as little as a hundred years ago. A libertarian is someone who sees the spinning wheel of the left vs. right dichotomy and says, “This is a natural cycle of the rotation of ideas,” blind to the cart to which the wheel is attached which is rolling down a hill and off of a cliff. They say to a man who would halt the spinning wheel, “You have no right to do that; the spinning of the wheel is natural,” and to a man who would dare to reverse it, they would hurl their most dire insults, of “authoritarian” and “fascist,” never minding that the progressive ideology is the most authoritarian of all. They cite the Founding Fathers of America as their inspiration. The Founding Fathers were unashamedly fascist. They were fascist before such a term even existed. They were, it could be argued, the original pioneers of the concept in modern times, as they espoused the erasing of prior identity to be subsumed into the newly created joint effort and identity of all. The ideals they represented were the ideals Classical Rome, which they had long studied and admired. They opposed only the coronation of an Emperor out of the whole of Roman works, and only then on principle alone. Much like Thomas Aquinas, not one of them considered Africans “human” when they spoke of “universal human rights.” They never imagined that Europeans and Anglo-Saxons would ever become a minority in their own country. They never believed Christendom would be dismantled with the very rules they put in place to protect it. They fled Britain precisely to escape the tyranny of a centralized private bank, and they felt that such a thing as a love of ones own people and a desire to protect and further the cause of your nation and your blood was so absurdly obvious and so deeply fundamental that it did not even deserve a comment. When they spoke of the brotherhood of man, it was of embracing a man from a city over as a friend, not inviting into your home a swarthy savage from an alien continent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they did ever suspect that such things might take place, they counted on the intelligence and perception of the Americans alive in such times to strike back against it. Libertarians refuse to do so. They fail the Founding Fathers in ways that even an out-and-out, dyed in the wool Nazi does not. At least the Nazi would stand for America, the nation, first, and themselves second. At least they would be willing to fight back. At least they would be intelligent enough to understand that one should not be bound by any law meant for civilized society when uncivil men subvert such rules into daggers and razors to be brandished with malicious intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       To hide behind feigned neutrality to avoid having to make a stand as any real patriot–as any real man–should, makes you more detestable than the most blatant traitor. You are worse than a traitor. You are a shamer of the righteous, finger wagging the resistance, tut tutting those with the heart to fight back, and talking down as though to a fool the assemblage of patriots who refuse to see a nation subverted and degenerated before their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naked treachery is preferable to the smug and lukewarm condescension of the just. Even Satan himself stood for something in the face of the Almighty God. Libertarians cannot even manage that.

       He's absolutely not - have you done any research into the man or heard him talk at any point before 2015? A 50s Republican. Jesus christ, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You are high, son.

       He's an agent of the Clintons, was and still is. He fucking destroyed the Republican party - he cares not a shit for them and actually encouraged
       <em>
        Republicans to vote Democrat
       </em>
       to punish "disloyals." He pulled all money from downticket and has strangled the money flow so that Republicans aren't sure bets to be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fall for the Clintons' bullshit scams if you want to fall for the Clintons' bullshit scams, I guess, but don't claim supporting Trump does a damn thing for Republicans or the Conservative cause. He's their best boy now and always.

       Libertarians have never fought for racists or true conservatives. I never asked for an endorsement, nor, for that matter, do I desire one. I fight to be heard. Libertarians offer platforms only to other Libertarians and progressives with whom they sympathize. Any platform they offer to those who are conservative, traditionalist, or fascists is grudging at best–tacitly condemned and stifled at worst. They offer endorsement to progressives, whether demand by them or not. Libertarians as a group have already chosen their side–they merely pretend not to have by promoting false equivalencies and pretending to stand for the rights of everyone. “Everyone’s right to express themselves is equal,” they say. But just like the progressives with whom they sympathize, some are more equal than others. They have favored sons. That is hardly a sin, but when their entire stance is the refusal to favor any son, it is a hypocrisy. And they refuse to acknowledge or admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians say this is not a particular problem. But it is. It is a very deep and concerning problem, because we fight enemies who will use our freedoms and rights as weapons against us. Agitators will come to meetings and shout us down, crying “free speech!” when they are ejected. Our enemies will form mobs to cause havoc and destruction when we assemble to discuss issues or share information, and cry “freedom to assemble!” when they are dispersed. Our opponents will slander us in the press with blatant distortions and outright lies, and when challenged or called out will hide behind freedom of the press. Mosley encountered this very problem when he attempted to stop Churchill from starting the Second World War. Trump is encountering this problem now. Hitler ran into it before both of them. The reason the Brownshirts, the Blackshirts, and now the Lion’s Guard were formed is that Communist agitators are masters of using the rights and freedoms of a nation to get their way. They will cut you with a knife, proclaim it their right to do so, and cry foul when you push them away or strike back with your fist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why libertarian hypocrisy cannot be borne. Communists, Socialists, Bolsheviks, and Jews will forever and always use our freedoms and rights against us as poisoned daggers. The only way to stop it is employ similar, if tempered, tactics. Even elder libertarians admit this. They themselves claim that a true libertarian society can only come about if all communists, hippies, marxist sympathizers, and welfare leeches are expelled and cast away. But to the matter of how this is to be done, they speak not one word. They see the problem, but much like the handwringing progressives of Europe who see the invaders as a problem but say it is impossible to deport them back they offer not even the faintest hint of a solution. No. There is a solution. There is a solution to getting rid of cultural marxism, just as there is a solution to sending the refugees back. But like the progressives with whom they sympathize, libertarians pretend that what is standing plain before them is not there. If they do see it, they deny it and refuse it, saying there must be some other way–that the situation can be solved without violence or compromising their libertarian mores and morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are wrong. This will never be solved peacefully. The enemy will not permit it. They are dyed in the wool fanatics that believe they are saving the world from itself and will die for what they believe, running the streets red with blood. If you are not prepared to do the same even to stop them, let alone to begin reversing the tide of what they have done, it is tantamount to conceding defeat right now. There are no lengths to which a rabid dog will not go to bite a man. It must be put down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the European talking heads refuse to admit is that the invaders could easily be rebuffed. They came here under their own power. They can leave under their own power. If Europeans started executing every Muslim they see, the problem would sort itself out in under a year. They would self-deport back to where they came from if they were made to fear what lies before them more than what they fled. The same solution exists for cultural marxism and all the various flavors of socialist, communist, quisling, and opportunists that push it. To fight them legitimately within the confines of the rules is to propose the raising up of an entire nation within a nation–to have a second America preaching the truth to counter their lies, a second media machine, a second governmental process, a second source of mass information. This is categorically impossible to accomplish, and even if it weren’t, the powers that be would not permit it. The leviathan of the state would not stand idly by while you erect a behemoth in front of it to fight it. Libertarians admit that the threat must be removed but choose to ignore that it will never go willingly and will fight to the death to fulfill its purpose and nature. Force is the one and only solution. But to do so is foul, disgusting, altogether too barbaric, downright fascist, and, worst of all, that most wicked of libertarian sins–authoritarian. So the libertarian will never do so. He will plead the Fifth on the matter even as they are lowering him into his own grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, even if they had fought for my right to free speech, that means next to nothing. Am I to overlook a man stabbing me in the back with a knife because he once passed me the salt or held open a door for me?
      </p>
      <p>
       The forces arrayed against us will use the rights we value to kill us and everything we hold dear. You have seen it already in the Chicago riots. Under the guise of “freedoms” like the right to assembly and the right to free speech, the actual rights of free speech and freedom to assemble will be unmade through naked terrorism disguised as the will of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only positions libertarians may ever take are to either stand completely aside and permit those who are willing to do what must be done, to join us and fight back, or to stand by their principles as hypocritically as they do now, but show them towards us instead. These are the only viable positions for them to take. The libertarian masses choose none of these. Thus, they are part of the problem, not the solution. And these are just the issues with libertarianism that appear when confronted with the issue of cultural marxism. They go far deeper than this. Libertarianism is the promotion of the individual over all other concerns, and as such libertarianism is the suicide of culture and nation both. Libertarianism will not enforce the changes that are necessary to fix this country, or indeed any country, because any such concentration of power would be condemned for its own sake merely for existing. They promote free trade, which breaks the back of any economy that utilizes it–and always will–for free trade is only viable if all trade partners engage in it, and they never will. Thus, it is a policy of being taken advantage of and will always ultimately lead to jobs and labor being outsourced to foreign bidders and wealth flowing out of the nation and into the pockets of international corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim that progressiveness is only a problem when it is pushed on people by their government. What they fail to realize is that the government will always be biased towards a political ideology, and not only that, it should be. McCarthy’s bias for American traditionalism and against communism is what protected America from it, and but for the Grace of God that he could have gotten all of them instead of merely most, we would not have many of the problems that we do today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government will always force upon the people the ideals of those who hold office. Thus, the government will always be vulnerable to subversion by intrusive and malicious alien elements. It is not a self-correcting system. It must be corrected. Socialism did not form in a vacuum. Just like how women have been granted equal rights many times before in the history of human civilization, it is a symptom of a greater scourge of the entropy of civilization and the decay of society. Sexual liberation, female rights, and socialist policies will always be the harbingers of the end for a society. To try and embrace the poison like libertarians do–to insist that the volatile and poisonous progressive culture can be preserved and is even somehow inherently good–betrays their naked ignorance and naïveté on the subject. It is progressive culture that is causing these problems. It is liberalism that has brought us to this point, it is egalitarianism that has allowed this to come to pass, and it is individualism that permitted this to foment. To preserve modern culture but insist on conservative law and fiscal policy is to replace a rotten fruit with a fresh one, but scoop out the festering heart of the rotten and transplant it into the healthy. It is painting over rust instead of scrubbing it out. The culture dictates everything, because it controls the wills and wants of the people. This is why cultural marxism has been so effective. A nation is held aloft from the very bottommost rung, and that bottom rung is the family–the smallest microcosm of civilization. A family is a group of related people who share space, genetics, and ideas. A group of families is a locality, a group of localities is a city or region, a group of cities or regions is a state, and a state either stands on its own. or itself comprises a group of states that form a nation. Thus, all of civilization is supported by the family.
