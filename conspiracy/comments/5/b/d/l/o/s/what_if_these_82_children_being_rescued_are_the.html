       Think about it. And then the FBI can have a much clearer conscience if that's what they're sitting on.... Infact a child pedophile ring, then the FBI agents would feel better getting the kids rescued, and then probably later quietly silenced for standing up to Hillary and the billionaires... And then There would be no more evidence tying to The  Clintons and they would be allowed to go on as normal
As threatened by her administration or the elites ... I wonder.

       That was my initial thought, the timing of this with the leaks cant be a coincidence. What makes it more shady is these rescues happened 3 weeks ago but news doesnt break until today, almost like they were giving certain people time to distance themselves and cover their trail.

       How does that work? - They cured the country of pedophilia everyone! Whoopee!!

       No, they saved a couple lives and the satanic, child-sacrificing pedophilia ring will continue unabated.

       There is no justification for this (if your theory is correct).  Do not accept this cop-out narrative.

       quite frankly, 82 seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands of reports they claim to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can see not publishing the names of the kids who were allegedly rescued, but there should be a public record of the names of those who were arrested. if we can't find a list of names, then we can safely assume that the FBI is full of shit, and that they didn't rescue any kids.

       I'm saying, what if the 82 kids that were just rescued, were the ones tied to The Clintons, if they are involved in the pedophilia rings, maybe.. Are being basically given immunity, but to appease all these FBI agents that are acting up and apparently threatening to jump on the case...they rescued all the kids, so their conscience could rest easy... While The Clintons get away with it.

       I think he is saying that the kids rescued are involved in the Clinton and Epstein conspiracy. The FBI agents care more about saving the kids from the torture they're enduring than they do prosecuting the Clintons. On the condition that the Clintons walk free, the FBI is given the information to rescue these kids from the Clintons and Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I concur with the argument but it could make sense if I'm understanding it correctly.
