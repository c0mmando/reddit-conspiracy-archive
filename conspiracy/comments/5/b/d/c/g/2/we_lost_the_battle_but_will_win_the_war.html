       A few days ago, no one believed in conspiracies, or any of the things we have known was going on. Now people are waking up faster than any time I can remember. The MSM looks foolish because they aren't reporting on anything of merit. If elected clinton will have a very hard time getting support, More things will be found in the emails, and no one will want to be associated with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at a point where it actually takes effort to not believe this stuff. The government agencies look impotent and will resent her. Congress will have a very hard time doing anything she wants, because they will not want to be associated with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites will keep their distance because they know the spotlight is on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, I just wanted to point out how many good things have happened in the last few months.

       The world is a stage... If this is all happening, there is a reason for it. I do not believe in coincidences... Remember when being a nerd was a bad thing? Now it's all the rage? Same here... I think this goes far deeper than just the US elections. This is spiritual and astrological, to me. We are in the Great Awakening. Amazing right? No, not necessarily! Dark times are ahead. I don't care how many rabbit holes you've been down, or how many pet "theories" you have. We are entering very dark times.. Mentally and spiritually, are you prepared? I'm not...

       I totally agree, we are going through one of the most interesting times in history. The more corrupt the government get the more people turn their backs on it. When all is said and done I think we will all live in a much better world.

       If someone would have proposed a scenario that we are witnessing today 10, 20, or even FIVE years ago, I would have dismissed it, and told them
       <em>
        "pass that bong, dude!"

       It is all so surreal, but I fear that we are merely cresting the first apex of what is sure to be one HELL of a roller-coaster ride.

       that was from yesterday yeah it had to do with your comment and the other person you were talking about let me see if i can find it ok hang
okok  this made me think of what was sent to me  [vampires more than trolls ]
      </p>
      <p>
       "OK, 14 for the number of pieces horrus was cut into cutting the middle finger is his penis letting out blood resembles him bringin his intention into being, the fish is a chariot or the finder of the penis.... i think, luls the only shitty thing about making things manifest out of the magickians blood is that sure its the strongest thing you can give but after time and time again it becomes cheap so, he probably self harms or leads people into a shitty life as an offering "magikal fuel", i guess thats much esier when what you do effects so many people.
Forgive the spelling and the grammar."
