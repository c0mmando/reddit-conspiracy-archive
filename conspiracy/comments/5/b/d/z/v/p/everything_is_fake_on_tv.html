        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just explaining to my five-year-old daughter about TV and how it&#39;s all pretend after she got scared while watching a crime drama. I said it&#39;s a all just a bunch of people sitting around thinking how to make the people watching feel a certain way - since it was a drama vs. a comedy  etc... We then acted out a scene and posted it to YouTube so she could see the results and see for herself the process.</p>

<p>It then occurred to me that if more of us would take part in the filmmaking process maybe we would look more skeptically at what is presented to us on the brainwashing/idiot box. </p>

<p>EVERYTHING you see on TV is scripted and not genuine. Remember that!  I scripted my two minute video with my five-year-old to prove a sinple point to her. Don&#39;t think for a second that TPTB won&#39;t spend whatever it takes to script whatever and create a false reality for you to feel a certain way that suits their agenda. And they&#39;re very, very good at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the world my friend, wolf&#39;s all over, unfortunately, what you are saying is no longer viable, children are getting murdered, raped, brainwashed and dumbed down. Plus, the best year&#39;s in life are when you are grown, but the powers that be have everything upside down. The sooner they know the better so when they get to adults they truly succeed. What you are saying is meant to keep people down, to be slaves of the system. Believe me, it is true.</p>

<p>Just because you change the medium you watch on, doesn&#39;t change it&#39;s ability to brainwash. (which isn&#39;t as evil as &#39;brainwash&#39; makes it sound, it&#39;s more constant suggestions, product placement, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tv muddies the line between real and not real.  My kids understand that TV is fake, the people, the shows, the situations, all of it.  Then my daughter said, &quot;What about the news, is that real?&quot;.  I explained the news is the most unreal of them all.  We have to be able to tell the difference.  Dreams give us the opportunity to test real vs unreal and to see things that indeed <em>feel</em> real but are not.</p>
