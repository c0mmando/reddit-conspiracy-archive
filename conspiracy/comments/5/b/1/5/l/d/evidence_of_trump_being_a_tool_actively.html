    <div class="md"><p>Trump was only pushed to get this far because the democrats figured he would be the easiest opponent to beat. Trumps message really resonated with a lot of people and now they have no way to stop him. TPTB&#39;s plans backfired on them. I was very skeptical of trump at first and thought he was full of shit like most other politicians, what changed my mind is that 30 year old video of trump where he talks about our country being shit on and run into the ground by our spineless leaders. He said he didn&#39;t want to ever be president, but if it ever got so bad and no one was willing to step up and try to fix it, he would. Well our country is in shambles and he&#39;s staying true to his words. The media hates him, politicians mostly hate him, that should tell you he&#39;s the guy we need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say &quot;TPTB&#39;s plans backfired&quot; like there&#39;s a single unified group of elitists who are all working in unison towards a common goal.<br/>
Unity is rare, particularly amongst the most powerful.<br/>
Trump is certainly the lesser of two evils (because it&#39;d be hard to find an individual more evil than Hillary), but if you think he&#39;s in any way anti-establishment or &quot;the guy we need&quot; then you&#39;re in for a rude awakening. Exactly the same rhetoric was being claimed when Obama appeared with his message of Hope &amp; Change. He couldn&#39;t be worse than 8 years of Bush Neocon insanity could he? Could he???<br/>
It&#39;s all theatre. There&#39;s nothing organic or grassroots about this.<br/>
He&#39;s just another puppet who&#39;s cut from a slightly different cloth. Serving a different set of masters perhaps but certainly with no intention of serving the US public.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would there be a revolt? Why hasn&#39;t this revolt already occurred? Who is going to revolt? You are being played. Trump is a crass opportunist, as are most politicians. Just logic through this shit for a bit. Why would a guy who has a long history of exploiting every opportunity to advance himself and his brand suddenly change course and do what is best for the country even if it is detrimental to his own individual interest.  If you are against corruption, this is the exact archetype of a person you don&#39;t want in power.  They are easily corrupted and have no moral compass. Lets assumed he has had a change of heart. This is like having a wild ferocious animal as your pet. Yes, you raised it from infancy and it hasn&#39;t attacked you yet but it is still a wild animal. You have tamed it but it has not been domesticated. It still has its primal instincts that has allowed its species to survive in the wild for centuries. This includes being an opportunist. These aggressive tendencies have to be culled out of the herd, which takes years upon years of selective breeding. </p>

<p>This outrage that you and your ilk feel is justified. But it isn&#39;t channeled in the proper direction. You aren&#39;t mad at the candidates, you are mad at the direction of the country. You are angry at the system, you just don&#39;t understand why. What you are really seeing is cognitive dissonance on a large scale, on both sides. On one hand, you see a country and its economic and political systems that you were told were great and you are finally seeing the flaws in those systems.  You are seeing a breakdown of these systems.  In fact, the overwhelming majority have same problems with these systems they are just presented in a different way to each different group.</p>

<p>You have BLM who says that police corruption is out of control and that there is an inequity in regards to treatment. You have another group who says the exact same thing about HRC and the FBI. These are the same issue. The issue is that certain classes of people are above and beyond the law.  </p>

<p>These issues are all the same and 99%+ of the population have many of the same common goals. They are simply arguing about which way to get there. Sadly, the end result of both sides is the same place. Both want to avoid a concentration of power in a small groups hands. One says multinational corps. have too much power, one says the federal government does. One side rides behind unfettered capitalism, one side rides behind socio-capitalism. Both lead to same thing, a concentration of power in the hands of a select few. The end game of capitalism are cartels. The end game of socialism is an oligarchy. Which the cartels eventually become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to even receive a major party presidential nomination without either working directly for TPTB or being closely affiliated with them. </p>

<p>This is all speculation, but my working theory is that he BEGAN as just a friend of the elites and a collaborator, put in place to lose to Hillary Clinton but now, given the scandals surrounding her, they&#39;re switching to him. </p>

<p>In the last few years there have been many large scale societal trends (probably intentionally so) toward feminism, LGBT rights, unity, tolerance, environmentalism, anti Wallstreet, etc, all of which Hillary Clinton supposedly stood for. Trump was placed as her opposition to be overtly racist, fear mongering, divisive, a billionaire elite etc... Pretty much everything that stands against all of the major societal trends this country has shifted toward recently. On paper, it should have been an easy win for her, which was their plan A. </p>

<p>However, given the leaks, and the growing distrust toward Clinton, TPTB realized she may not be the most effective person to put in office. Enter plan B... the major shift in Trumps campaign. Way less divisive, less racist, more direct, truthful, and actually speaking for the majority of Americans (like she was originally when she first started running) and now he&#39;s behind all of the causes that are popular... exposing corruption, taking on the media, the elite, etc. </p>

<p>IMO, we&#39;re being played, on both sides. Plan A, Hillary didn&#39;t work out. She&#39;s being thrown under the bus by the establishment to try and save face and replaced with Plan B, an &quot;anti establishment&quot; pied piper to give the American populace the illusion of victory, but the end result will likely be the same. </p>

<p>I could be wrong, but that&#39;s the vibe I get. It&#39;s all a play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I certainly hope he is, however I will remain cautious. Especially regarding people this high up within the system. Their methods are so manipulative, and grand, that it&#39;s hard to really tell much of anything at this point. I do like what wikileaks is doin tho. And honestly, between the two, I would probably side with him just given the fact he&#39;s at least pointing some very true and very disturbing things out to the American public, which will hopefully continue to wake more people up about what&#39;s going on. </p>
