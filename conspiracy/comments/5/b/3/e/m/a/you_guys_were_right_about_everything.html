       It's okay. The day I finally put all the pieces together, including the ones I intentionally put aside because I Just Couldn't Handle It, was a very bad day. I literally stopped working, became severely depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, one rainy Sunday, I was so down that I walked down the street a few blocks to a nearby church. The sermon that day, amazingly, seemed directed EXACTLY at me. Since that day, things have gotten better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see how this plays out. The satanists are very smart but also very arrogant. Could go either way.

       You may find spiritual people at a church, or whatever faith might appeal to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to surround yourself with healthy-minded people. I don't know where you live; it can be harder, depending on the region.

       It's a rigged game, run by maniacs, yes. But there are reversals of fortune all throughout history.

       I believe that sermon was for you. Not metaphorically, or broadly in general. I mean that God put it upon the pastors heart to preach what he did, for YOU.

       Well undeniable proof is a paradox nowadays. Anything they don't want us to know is vehemently denied. For starters, operation mockingbird permits the use and spread of disinformation and propaganda online, so even here your gonna get called crazy. And those who tune in to main stream media are so propogandized it will take years to break it all down if you even can. your gonna be a walnut pasta salad for awhile man, thats what were labeled as to discredit us. You either believe them or us, or join the sheeple, or make up your own thing. Good luck!

       How many people have died. Hackers, Inverstigative journalists, whistleblowers, witnesses, prosecutors, all gone just for being brave enough to say no while we twiddled our thumbs and took their word for everything. How many stories have been passed up by the media like they were never even happening. The actual tangible effort to disinform the public. The global hatred of America, and how little we actually know and learn about other countries. The fact that our education system is fundamentally flawed and we dont care to fix it. The fact that they make it hard to access ways to learn unless you have the financial means, though that directly implicates the development of our race(human race) . The fact that our economy is designed around putting people in debt prison. A lot of stuff man, it gets dark when you dive into it all, but its makes every day life a lot less stressful cause like, the whole worlds about to come unhinged at any second, so fuck it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want recent proof, check out whats up in Germany, they have "rape culture" cause of the immigrants (no media coverage). Oh and Podesta of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       To firmly answer, it is a walnut sauce pasta dish, however, the people willing to by the crap they are selling and the lies they are telling are the something worse walnut sauce pasta dishes.

       It's ok.  Alchemists or Luciferians to be more precise.  I believe they are nazi ss, due to my own connections and deep research on them in the domains of politics, history and the occult.  The seventh floor group for example, along with several financial transactions initiated by Hillary Clinton and as revealed in pod esta and Fbi and other foia records suggest she is in the secret seven society which is referred to as SS and if you look at old photos of colliegate group founders they are holding a book with the German iron eagle.  Just sayin.  Nazi ss were big time crowleyan black magic death cultists, same same with skull and bones ideologically.  Nazi ss did not die at close of ww2, they escaped via rat line to Thailand and Latin America.  If I weren't on an iPad I'd link to the supranational orgs brain to show you a map of the data points...the sources are largely Wikipedia

       Dude the fact that you can admit you were wrong is pretty awesome. Us conspiracy realists are so used to disbelief, it doesn't get to us as much after a certain point. It's all worth it when someone sees the light.

       Enough with the Satan bullshit.  There is absolutely no proof of that - EVER.  It's been made up by over zealous christians.  There has never been a satanic ritual killing proven.

       all have been either false memories from shitty hypnosis, liars, or coached children.

       I'd love it to be true (for impeachment purposes), but let's not assume it's true by default..especially when there is no proof.  People just want it to be true so bad that they can't handle a logical opinion on the subject.

       You will not see this go anywhere past conspiracy theories.  Because there is no evidence.  Keep trying to dig, it doesn't bother me except that people are so fucking idiotic to ignore evidence to the contrary due to what they want to be true.

       The video of Bohemian grove ritual is just all good fun I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what it all comes down to is fear. Fear controls people. If they worship Satan or just don't believe in anything it doesn't mater, they have people thinking they do. It makes the opposition look crazy and makes people fear speaking out about anything fringe for fear of the brush off into the words "conspiracy theorist."
