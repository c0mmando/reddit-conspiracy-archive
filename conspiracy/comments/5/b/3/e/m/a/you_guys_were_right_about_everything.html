<p>Ultimately, one rainy Sunday, I was so down that I walked down the street a few blocks to a nearby church. The sermon that day, amazingly, seemed directed EXACTLY at me. Since that day, things have gotten better. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see how this plays out. The satanists are very smart but also very arrogant. Could go either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well undeniable proof is a paradox nowadays. Anything they don&#39;t want us to know is vehemently denied. For starters, operation mockingbird permits the use and spread of disinformation and propaganda online, so even here your gonna get called crazy. And those who tune in to main stream media are so propogandized it will take years to break it all down if you even can. your gonna be a walnut pasta salad for awhile man, thats what were labeled as to discredit us. You either believe them or us, or join the sheeple, or make up your own thing. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people have died. Hackers, Inverstigative journalists, whistleblowers, witnesses, prosecutors, all gone just for being brave enough to say no while we twiddled our thumbs and took their word for everything. How many stories have been passed up by the media like they were never even happening. The actual tangible effort to disinform the public. The global hatred of America, and how little we actually know and learn about other countries. The fact that our education system is fundamentally flawed and we dont care to fix it. The fact that they make it hard to access ways to learn unless you have the financial means, though that directly implicates the development of our race(human race) . The fact that our economy is designed around putting people in debt prison. A lot of stuff man, it gets dark when you dive into it all, but its makes every day life a lot less stressful cause like, the whole worlds about to come unhinged at any second, so fuck it.</p>

<p>If you want recent proof, check out whats up in Germany, they have &quot;rape culture&quot; cause of the immigrants (no media coverage). Oh and Podesta of course.</p>

<p>To firmly answer, it is a walnut sauce pasta dish, however, the people willing to by the crap they are selling and the lies they are telling are the something worse walnut sauce pasta dishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok.  Alchemists or Luciferians to be more precise.  I believe they are nazi ss, due to my own connections and deep research on them in the domains of politics, history and the occult.  The seventh floor group for example, along with several financial transactions initiated by Hillary Clinton and as revealed in pod esta and Fbi and other foia records suggest she is in the secret seven society which is referred to as SS and if you look at old photos of colliegate group founders they are holding a book with the German iron eagle.  Just sayin.  Nazi ss were big time crowleyan black magic death cultists, same same with skull and bones ideologically.  Nazi ss did not die at close of ww2, they escaped via rat line to Thailand and Latin America.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ll call it now, last time I post about this, since people are mindless.</p>

<p>You will not see this go anywhere past conspiracy theories.  Because there is no evidence.  Keep trying to dig, it doesn&#39;t bother me except that people are so fucking idiotic to ignore evidence to the contrary due to what they want to be true.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, if this goes anywhere, i&#39;ll admit I was wrong and an idiot, until then, I firmly believe you guys are being ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video of Bohemian grove ritual is just all good fun I guess. </p>

<p>I think what it all comes down to is fear. Fear controls people. If they worship Satan or just don&#39;t believe in anything it doesn&#39;t mater, they have people thinking they do. It makes the opposition look crazy and makes people fear speaking out about anything fringe for fear of the brush off into the words &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe what you want, I can&#39;t stop you.  But where is the common sense?  The self doubt?</p>

<p>The info provided is proof of nothing, just enough speculation to wonder, not to make a judgement.   It&#39;s gone so far into foul ball territory, that you need people like me to make you question it.</p>

<p>There has been no proof.  Prove me wrong, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m against you guys, I&#39;m just against people being blind to evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care, in time you&#39;ll see how wrong you were.   There was a time when you guys were on the right track, now we are at &quot;lizard people&quot; type theories, and for some reason nobody else is calling it out, so I will.</p>
