        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>October 18, 2016 - Assange internet cut</p>

<p>October 19-21, 2016 - activity is seen at the Ecuadorian embassy.  People begin questioning whether Assange has been caught.</p>

<p>October 21, 2016 - The largest DDoS attack in history takes place.</p>

<p>October 22, 2016 to present - Podesta email dumps continue but the promised more incriminating dumps have not come.  Leaks begin about human trafficking and child diddling.  FBI re-opens email investigation.  Leaks about Clinton Foundation investigation.  Rumors that further leaks are &quot;delayed&quot; while child diddling connections are &quot;investigated.&quot;  Assange has not been seen in the flesh.</p>

<p><strong>What does this all mean??</strong></p>

<p>Likely, Assange has been caught.  The DDoS attacks were to prevent the dead man&#39;s switch from being released.</p>

<p>Rather than a full stop of Wikileaks, we are being baited into waiting for this alleged bombshell material.</p>

<p><strong>What is my opinion??</strong></p>

<p>There is no bombshell anymore -  Assange and associates have been silenced.  The dead man&#39;s switch has been &quot;taken care of.&quot;  The leaks have been contained.</p>

<p>There is no Clinton Foundation investigation - it was already squashed by Loretta Lynch and the DoJ.</p>

<p>There will be no bonafide proof of larger crimes - no child diddling, no human trafficking, no CF corruption, nothing.</p>

<p>The rumors are meant to bide time until Hillary is elected on Tuesday.</p>

<p>If we weren&#39;t being baited with baseless rumors, it would be obvious that Wikileaks has been thwarted.  But then people may be in the streets protesting the continued wanton corruption at the highest levels.  And that might actually influence the election.</p>

<p>We are being gamed.  Everything is a game.  Evil is winning.  There is no justice in politics.</p>

<p>EDIT:  If some bombshell <em>is</em> released before the election, I will come here to eat my words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For you to be right, we have to assume that the deadman switch can be fooled so simply.</p>

<p>If Wikileaks is legit, they would certainly have put thought into the mechanics of the deadmans switch.  Surviving a network issue would be low hanging fruit.</p>

<p>The largest DDoS attack in history, taking down much of the internet on the East Coast of America is simple?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s quite conceivable that WL did not envision such vast state-sponsored efforts to squash the dead man&#39;s switch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more conceivable that WL did in fact envision such efforts.</p>

<p>I also think DDos and other network roadblocks would have surely been discussed when building the mechanics of the dead man switch.</p>
