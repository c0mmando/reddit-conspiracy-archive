        At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime.

Clinton knew that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were arming ISIS while Secretary of State and they still gave weapons to Saudi Arabia and Qatar though we knew them to fit the FBI's definition of Terrorism (This is what FBIAnon was talking about).

In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

       Its worth noting that nothing in the Assange video suggests Assange is safe in the Embassy. Watch it again and you may see the edit where you dont see Pilger ask the question about the FBI investigation and Assange only makes a statement about the purpose of the FBI. Also Pilger makes a statement about the last week of the campaign and Assange never addresses that statement. There is no establishing shot. Do you remember the Daily Show interviews and how they were cut? The only dates tied to the video are
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">
        10/13 referencing the Saudi Arabia funding
       </a>

        being cutoff
       </a>
       , and the Moroccan King email released
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22030">
        10/20
       </a>
       . Those dates are important because it is speculated that Assange was taken from the embassy on the 20th/21st of October. The only place the discussion is even
       <em>
        allowed

       You have the GLF5 flight occurring on 10/21/16. That flight happened on 10/17/16. There aren't any dates on your linked screen caps of the flight path.

       That thread is time stamped "21 days ago." That would place it on the 17th. I was following the flight at the time - you can see my comments in that thread. So, yes I can confirm that flight GLF5 was on 10/17/16 insofar as I watched it live on that day on Flightradar24.com.

       , from two weeks ago also mixed up the flight's date, placing it on the same day you did, the 21st. I asked for clarification at that time as well but got no response.

       Wikileaks was designed from the ground up to be redundant in the instance that Assange was compromised. Even if CIA has possession of Assange, I believe we can still trust the info from wikileaks.

       Nope. Its in the post. Nothing in the interview suggests he is alive today. Did you know that Heath Ledger was dead before The Dark Knight was in theaters? There is reason to believe that the video is evidence that Assange is dead.

       Seriously. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." Our forefathers gave us this. They built the foundation and did what they could, while they could. It's now our turn to take over it and maintain it. To do the upkeep that's required, similar to that of a garden. Only when we stop pruning the parts that need to be pruned, let the weeds take over and abandon it is it finally lost.

       Keep doing what you're doing. Spread the word. Wake people up. I've been at it for about 5 years and I'm seeing about 5% of my circle really waking up. We need about 10% of the population to be on the same page, then we win.

       I have to use a canadian proxy as my end point because though some of this is marked U//FOFU, others not.

       <p>
        background
There has a been quite a bit of talk today about the attacks on our cyber infrastructure.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       technical details:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        DNS are like phonebooks, they take a url and give you an ip. your computer then connects to the ip.
DNS servers, for big sites, provide not just the ip address, but distributes the traffic amongst many ip-addresses and has added features where if one of the ip-addresses goes down, the DNS server will point you to another one.
the time to live (TTL; that's how long the saved phonebook-to-ip is considered valid) for these sites is 5 minutes because they want to provide you a fresh lookup in case the previous ip goes down or if too much traffic goes to it.
to break DNS, the attackers need to persist attacks longer than this time to live. 
Normally for your basic website, like 4chan that lives at one data center, the TTL can be in hours or days.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         note: this last bit is a bit complicated, so read it over a few times
reliability for DNS is achieved by having valid records distributed and saved across many DNS servers. This isn't possible if the TTL is really short. Only big sites with multiple data centers are vulnerable to this attack because they need short TTL. 
today's attack is likely just a test run for a larger more sustained attack. 
the attack emerged from a distributed botnet of IP devices (IP cameras, the fridge, TV box tops)
        </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        nov 8
critical internet infrastructure will brought to its knees in order cut people off from news/information about the elections results
sites that are vulnerable to this sort of TTL attack will be down, these are sites that require multiple data centers to distribute traffic (CNN, NBC, FOX, face book, reddit, twitter, youtube).
this would create an information vacuum around the election results
would you riot?

       <strong>
        The Assange Factor
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange wants to
       <a href="http://www.anonews.co/assange-on-hillary/">
        bring down Hillary
       </a>
       because he knows she won't pardon him or his friend Chelsea Manning, but he is also
       <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or">
        not a Trump supporter
       </a>
       . COG (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government">
        continuity of government
       </a>
       ) wants to get Hillary or Trump elected, who would most likely renew COG
       <a href="http://rense.com/general92/coup.htm">
        like Obama has done the past several times
       </a>
       . They definitely don't want Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein, who would promptly throw their asses in the shitcan. Why do you think Bernie was stomped out like a used cigarette butt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that Hillary is basically
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/casar-vargas/why-i-can-no-longer-suppo_1_b_12698874.html">
        done for
       </a>
       and Assange's main goal of exposing her treason for all Americans to see is complete, they took him out of the picture, so what do we have left? COG Plan B, the
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-21/assange-tweets-chilling-assessment-us-democracy-there-no-us-election-there-power-con">
        Pied Piper candidate
       </a>
       aka Donald Trump on the express lane to becoming POTUS, not much dirt in his way. Meanwhile Assange is unable to say or do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe THIS is why John Kerry (
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/state-department-h-q-houses-secretive-shadow-governments-7th-floor-group/">
        7th Floor Group aka shadow government
       </a>
       aka COG) forced Ecuador to cut off Assange's internet. COG was worried that Assange would interfere
       <em>
        even further
       </em>
       with the election and push people away from Donald Trump as well. Assange was

        itching to get his hands on Trump leaks
       </a>
       ? Where'd that effort go? The crickets are starting worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       If both Hillary and Trump were pushed out, COG would either get put on the backburner or dissolved, but COG had contingency Plan B in the works -
       <em>
        <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/10/julian-assange-ecuador-internet-cut-john-kerry-hillary-clinton-statement-wikileaks-john-podesta-election-hack/">

         elevate Trump
        </a>
       </em>
       . It was even DNC's inner plan to elevate Trump. Think about it...Assange would have
       <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/8/wikileaks_julian_assange_attacks_against_jill">
        pushed third party
       </a>
       if he had the chance, or possibly Bernie if he wasn't cheated out of the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Conclusion - if Assange isn't allowed to interfere with the election, to the point where his internet is cut off at the Embassy, then why is he subsequently allowed to make a "live" teleconference call to CISL to discuss the election, and why is he allowed to do an interview with John Pilger and discuss the election just days before Nov 8th? AND why wouldn't Sweden let him make a public appearance at Gavin MacFayden's funeral for an hour, where he WOULDN'T be discussing the election?

        I too would LOVE to believe that a revelation is coming that is so utterly unspinnable that the sheeple will finally have the scales fall from their eyes. But here's what's bothering me about Julian Assange, the NYPD, the "breaking bombshell" in True Pundit and the video from Steve Pieczenik.

       Think of this: do you believe John Pilger is part of the conspiracy agaist Assange??? Because Pilger KNOWS he didn't interview Assange just few days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if he/they cut the video in a fashion we are fooled to believe that... it means that THEY WANT EXACTLY THIS! They want the world wonder about Assange whereabouts. I TRUST PILGER!
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they (our friend Pilger and RT and their friends) want to keep low profile around Assange whereabouts... it means Assange is safe, and maybe he's FLED from the embassy with some foreign help. We will be told after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a stupid dream. This is true if you trust Pilger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you trust Pilger? Then... Assange is safe!

       God I really fucking hope so. But we need to know where he is NOW because if he is in "evil" hands, whether US, UK or Russia, his life is still a poker chip at this point. If Russia has him, they can execute him and point to his body as evidence of a corrupt American system.  If America has him, they never ever ever need say his name again - Jimmy Hoffa style. PILGER has been good at pointing out bad journalism and fighting propaganda, but he is also an extreme leftist (me too so I'm kind of torn on this), and they don't seem to be Assanges biggest fans lately.

       4chan's AMAs aren't high on my radar of credibility at the moment, especially as it relates to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm unfairly grouping credible FBIanon with what happened in the subsequent days, but for the next
       <em>
        week
       </em>
       there was a rash of LARPers who whipped the community into a lather that arrests were
       <em>
        just around the corner
       </em>
       and there was
       <em>
        big news tomorrow
       </em>
       , that the
       <em>
        NYPD was going to come forward and release EVERYTHING if Comey didn't indict.
       </em>
       People fell for it. Including me, which is my own damn fault because I wanted to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing happened (as defined by no arrests and Comey clearing Clinton a second time with zero ramifications). Even now, I'm guessing 4Chan'ers have their tail tucked between their legs in that there haven't been subsequent LARPs of explaining the FBI or NYPD "behind the scenes" right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       happened on Nov 5th as it relates to a big data dump or hack of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, we're still trying to push the narrative that Assange is dead and WL has been compromised, in spite of the Pilger interview? I'm not buying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mainstream media is guilty of giving people half the picture, where people then have to go out and get the rest of the story. But 4Chan is guilty of giving the full picture with a steaming heap of bullshit on top of it, where people then have to use critical thinking (or in some cases, wait for time to pass) to discern the actual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Maybe FBIAnon is legit; maybe they're not.

       Nothing happens for justice at the level we are talking about without political will. Without marching and demanding answers we all know we need, nothing can happen. Nothing. We have in our hands actionable evidence. But the the people running this country do not have to act until we make them. Look at the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for evidence of that fact. The ball is in our Court and TPTB will never address our concerns if we ourselves will not.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBIanon has "published" crazy alien UFO stuff, in my opinion, on a website where people will actually read the info if it is confirming any outrageous notion they already believe. /conspiracy and /pol/ are the places where people actively challenge the "official" narrative,  we are the ones that would actually find this information and spread the word. When the wikileaks subreddit is actively suppressing "their"  own leaks, we have reason enough to question their legitimacy just as much as to question FBIanon.

       We are also the ones most easily silenced, ignored, and removed. The term "conspiracy" has very negative connotations in mainstream society. It is considered unacceptable for a person to entertain ideas that contradict the official narrative. This has given birth to places like /pol/ and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no place in our ever so sophisticated society for such discussions, we are forced into the fringes to discuss our ideas and have honest conversations. This further alienates us from "normal" people and also lumps us all together in a neat little package they label as "crazy".
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I'm trying to make is that we collectively have very little influence on the situation. People dismiss us as loony tin foil hat clad conspiracy theorists. We have to think outside of the box to figure out some way to red pill enough people to get anything of substance done. If we fail to do this first, win the hearts and minds of the general populace, whatever action we take will be in vain.

       This, and many other posts in this /r/, should really make it to the front page. I can understand the hesitation to believe some of the things that are discussed here, but this is proof, solid evidence, that there is actual corruption going on. What more do non-believers need? A picture of Hillary handing Saudi and Qatar millions of dollars?

       This email isn't even negative for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows that the US is working to contain ISIL throughout the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does show the US knows Saudi and Qatar fund and supply ISIL, but US is engaging them to contain the radical threat. The implication that any assistance to the Saudis or Qatar is treason to the US is laughable as they are our allies. You may not like that, but they are. We have a complex relationship with them and don't agree with 100% of everything they do. It's clear here that the US wants to pressure them to cut off ISIL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Against Turkey it's interesting, because they want to full on arm the Kurds now because the Turkish gov't is now Islamist and seen as not an ally to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing here is out of line official gov't policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminds me of Assange and Trump's strange claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS, ignoring the complicated nature/history of all the infighting and proxy wars. It's like smears against Hillary for connections to the Saudis because of 9/11 or here ISIS, while ignoring they are one of our very closest allies (and yes, sometimes they take actions we don't agree with, and yes, not all in the royal family are allies).
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like a terrible accusation but only if you don't understand any of the context--and being cynical, it's obvious Assange knows most people lack that context but doesn't mind confusing people to push his advantage.

       Continuing to distribute weapons to SA knowing they are arming ISIS.

       I dont think you read the rest of the post.

      <p>
       Doesnt matter. Email sites the government of Qatar and SA. Links from the Guardian above show that ISIS was Al-Qaeda. We knew that the Saudis were arming Al-Qaeda and used them to overthrow Assad. Kind of like Saddam or Bin Laden or the CONTRA's.

       I dont think what Assange is asserting is intended for anyone that
       <em>
        isnt
       </em>
       paying attention. He isnt a sensationalist. And what he is talking about takes a ton of context. Which is why you have a wall of text above to explain it, which in itself requires 34(!) different links to give proper context. This is not for the low information consumer. But your half hearted rebuttal is.

       God I really fucking hope so. But we need to know where he is NOW because if he is in "evil" hands, whether US, UK or Russia, his life is still a poker chip at this point. If Russia has him, they can execute him and point to his body as evidence of a corrupt American system.  If America has him, they never ever ever need say his name again - Jimmy Hoffa style. PILGER has been good at pointing out bad journalism and fighting propaganda, but he is also an extreme leftist (me too so I'm kind of torn on this), and they don't seem to be Assanges biggest fans lately.

       I admit that I could definitely have made that simple mistake, I've been hospitalized for a week and not had any real sleep for a couple of days. Was your thread actually about Kerry leaving the UK? Thanks.
