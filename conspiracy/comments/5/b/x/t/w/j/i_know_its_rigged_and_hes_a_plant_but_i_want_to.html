       The DNC fucked themselves in PA with me when they screwed Bernie.  But I am not voting for Pence either, so Jill Stein was an easy choice. Gary Johnson is LARPing as a politician.

       Not only LARPing as a politician, but as a libertarian too. What type of libertarian supports TPP? Fuck me, you couldn't think of one thing to support that could be any stronger of an anti-libertarian position than the TPP, a transnational government set up by corporations which surpasses constitutions.

       You forget one thing: Barack Obama was a puppet, an actor picked to play a part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wasn't "picked" by anyone. He was his own man, who had to fight against the mainstream media, the Democrats and the neocon establishment within his own party.
      </p>
      <p>
       No handlers chose Donald Trump because of a focus group, and scrupulously hid his past (to make him as vague as possible to the voters) and then pushed him out as a figurehead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's been a known commodity for decades. He was no cabal's "creation," like Barack Obama was. Or Barry Sotoero . . . or whatever other alias the shadowy character went by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Obama's personality is fake. Check out the actor who trained him to speak and use the mannerisms of an "educated black man from Chicago". (Evidently, Obama--raised by white grandparents--spoke "too white," and was effeminate.) So they brought in actor Harry Lennix to give him a fake personality. Check it out:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPX80htpHcM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPX80htpHcM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: There was no change under Obama, because Obama was a puppet, an actor. He wasn't an organic political figure. He was groomed and brought onto the public stage by handlers. . . . A nonentity who George Soros thought might be useful to "pull a fast on on the American people". Trump isn't from Obama's "broke community organizer" circle; he's from the billionaire Power-Broker circle. So (as much as it might pain you to hear this) Trump will be a President who, more than likely, calls his own shots. We haven't had one of those since George Bush, Sr.

       It'll be interesting to watch so many of you get broken in the same way Obama voters were when he turns out to be just as owned as Obama was.  But, seeing as you don't believe that and me saying it certainly isn't going to change your mind, I'm just going to wait for the inevitable and see what y'all think in about.. 6 months.

       It's good for you to be skeptical, and to approach this thing reservedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by all means, speak truth to Power. (Where Trump falters, I hope you'll call him out.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be mindful, though, that you not be overly zealous in your doom and gloom predictions. After all, there are so many people who've made claims this election cycle that turned out to be fantastically wrong. Like those who claimed 1) Trump could never win the GOP nomination and 2) Once he won it, claimed he'd never beat the establishment, the media and the neocons within his own party to win the Presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hilarious now, watching all the people who were flamboyantly wrong all along, enjoining us to believe wholeheartedly in their future predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not comparing you to these Nostradamuses. (I'm really not.) But it does seem funny now, watching these false prophets scramble.

       I get where you're coming from, and I don't mean to give off a 'doom and gloom' vibe, I'm just aware of the simple fact that there is no outcome to this other than Donald flip-flopping.  I suppose it was calloused of me to talk about them being 'broken', but it is what will inevitably happen.  When they see their champion abandon them they will know that they were duped.  I don't wish that upon anyone, but it is, in some ways, necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary had won, it would've been easy for them to say it was only the Democrats who were corrupt and so on and so forth.  Now, they will have no choice but to see that it is all corrupt. Now, the right will see what many of us on the left learned a long time ago:  that there are only two real sides- Those in power, and the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's a big club, and you ain't in it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say it will be interesting to see their faith broken I mean it in exactly that way, from the standpoint of curiosity, because I want to see how they respond to it. I want to see if they will do what many on the left did, or if their reaction will be different.

       Even if you believe in Donald Trump (as I personally do), you have to admit he's a band-aid on a shotgun wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system has already been so corrupted and bankrupted by the previous administrations (and their puppet-masters from the world of finance), that
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       President getting in there now would be all but doomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed was just waiting for the election to happen to raise interest rates and set off an economic implosion that should have happened a while ago (but they've been synthetically holding it back).
      </p>
      <p>
       The economic (and geo-political) crisis America now finds itself in is larger than a Donald Trump presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can do now is cross our fingers and see if he can pull off some miracles. (The only thing that gives me hope is that he pulled off the most stunning campaign in American political history, and did what all the experts claimed was impossible.)

       If you believe, as I do, that Trump was always 'part of the plan', then his campaign victory was not a stunning victory at all.  The only stunning victory was that people were successfully fooled into believing that he had achieved a stunning victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could believe that he is actually going to make things better again, I truly do.  I guess we will find out.

       You should have known after he put former Goldman employees on his campaign staff, and if not then, when he spoke before the CFR.  But hey, this was the conservatives turn to have a candidate do to their faith in the system that Obama did to progressives 8 years ago.

       Although many of those progressives didn't seem to learn from that, because they fell for Bernie's bullshit.  Amazing how much people can forget, either willingly or otherwise, in that short of time.

       I'm aware of that.  "We will know if he prosecutes Clinton"
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that he won't prosecute Clinton, and when he doesn't you will begin to see what has been apparent all along, that Trump was never 'anti-establishment'.  That's what I meant about him hiring Goldman employees and wringing his hands with submissiveness before the CFR.
      </p>
      <p>
       When his supporter's see him flip-flop on every promise of 'draining the swamp' or 'changing the status quo', they will become disenfranchised in the same way that Obama supporters were after he entered office and did sweet fuck all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether they will do anything about it, or just pretend it didn't happen and fall for the next con-man to come along, like progressives did with Bernie Sanders, remains to be seen.

       Trump being such a 'Layman's' representative (in lack of a better word), anti-establishment, 'voice of the people' etc, with the large emphasis around it this election.

      <p>
       Maybe
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       , if it turns out he's not fulfilling his promises, or it turns out he favours, or is in bed with the same elite, maybe this will be the last straw for everyone. People might start to realise that some change is in order. Since the possibility of the next one actually having the people's interests at heart would appear more bleak than ever. Unless he perpetuates this 'divider' tactic and groups turn on one another to larger extent.

       Check out redefininggod's front page he has a good breakdown, it involves either Obama/Clinton being sore losers and refusing to accept the loss creating a civil war scenario or Putin being propped up as the benevolent Anti-Christ who will restructure UN for the good of humanity. It's been gameplanned for decades, because the same people running Trumps campaign have ties to the Putin government.

       My thoughts exactly!!! Today is the best day ever. Everyone sounds like a fucking petulant child. "The world is ending". Wow people - now you know how it feels to be powerless in a system that doesn't give a shit about you. I've been feeling that for the last 4 years ever since I became a conspiracy theorist.

       I don't mean to shoot anything down. But why do I feel so conflicted about the idea of him being a plant? Like if we truly believed it we wouldn't even care,  but we do. Like,  did we let them trick us, or are we concerned for good cause. This idea has caused me much confusion. I do think he is a plant but Idk how far things go

       Since we're talking about debates and Trump/Clinton collusion, I'll repost something from an old thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       So we know Hillary had an earpiece in for the debates. In the third debate you can clearly hear somebody speaking over the mic when she stumbles - you've probably seen this already.
Well look at Trump's reaction right after; the quick body posture change, the eye-roll of acknowledgement:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/XkiPZL4Qp5M?t=2m34s">
        https://youtu.be/XkiPZL4Qp5M?t=2m34s
       </a>
       At first it may seem like his reaction is in response to the low-blow from Hilldawg - like "yeah right this bs" - but if you look at the transcript to see it all in context at the time of the incident it's still not really clear what she's getting at, or even that its an attack on Trump.
I know this may seem abstruse compared the more substantial evidence that Trump is controlled opposition, but for some reason I found it quite telling. I'm sure he heard it. Surely 'The Donald' would comment on this if he heard it, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the transcript from the debate at the time mic-mishap:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wallace: ..would you impose no fly zone in Syria ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton: Well Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day.This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground. We've had millions of people leave Syria, and those millions of people inside Syria who’ve been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS.
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees, made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in, but I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting, and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the *dozens of people at the (eyeroll here) nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse Night Club, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.

       You forget one thing: Barack Obama was a puppet, an actor picked to play a part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wasn't "picked" by anyone. He was his own man, who had to fight against the mainstream media, the Democrats and the neocon establishment within his own party.
      </p>
      <p>
       No handlers chose Donald Trump because of a focus group, and scrupulously hid his past (to make him as vague as possible to the voters) and then pushed him out as a figurehead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's been a known commodity for decades. He was no cabal's "creation," like Barack Obama was. Or Barry Sotoero . . . or whatever other alias the shadowy character went by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Obama's personality is fake. Check out the actor who trained him to speak and use the mannerisms of an "educated black man from Chicago". (Evidently, Obama--raised by white grandparents--spoke "too white," and was effeminate.) So they brought in actor Harry Lennix to give him a fake personality. Check it out:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPX80htpHcM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPX80htpHcM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: There was no change under Obama, because Obama was a puppet, an actor. He wasn't an organic political figure. He was groomed and brought onto the public stage by handlers. . . . A nonentity who George Soros thought might be useful to "pull a fast on on the American people". Trump isn't from Obama's "broke community organizer" circle; he's from the billionaire Power-Broker circle. So (as much as it might pain you to hear this) Trump will be a President who, more than likely, calls his own shots. We haven't had one of those since George Bush, Sr.
