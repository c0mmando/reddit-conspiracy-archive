<p>Like I didn&#39;t think section B was damning at all. Also the pictures of the walk in fridge/freezer wasn&#39;t odd. Of course people will joke in the comments. The miniature coffins are also coffee tables. I wouldn&#39;t buy one like but I&#39;m not seeing a whole lot of evidence that the author is trying to suggest. The weird art and strange pictures with known pedophile imagery and things of that nature are massive without jumping that bit extra into something which at best is a lot of different assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an agent involved in high seas interdiction which was usually drugs, sometimes people. Basically I had access to intel from on high, my job was to predict where they would be (by thinking of why) and then effecting the interdiction. More of what I&#39;m doign here deals with that intel and how it was managed (info up, intel down) but pedos trigger my cop radar and its rarely wrong. Those videos from comet ping pong were more than enough for a follow-up for me. I am disturbed that this amount (avalanche) all points the same way and there hasn&#39;t been an agent of trusted integrity to dig around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Left: Art of Sasha Lord, possible recruiter for the network, shows an adolescent having an out of body experience or dissociated state, which can by triggered by trauma (physical, sexual). The words in the background are &quot;teen mom&quot; and &quot;teen aviation&quot;, suggestive of impregnation, followed by flight. The &quot;after 10 PM&quot; part is weird. Who has an all ages show that starts at 10 PM? </p>

<p>Right: Artwork appears to possibly be from Comet Ping Pong or Sahsa Lord instagram (haven&#39;t confirmed). Painting appears to be Nowhere to Run Ria Pratt or Kim Noble, who claims to have subjected to ritual abuse. Depicts a circle jerk while a small person is raped and goes into a dissociated state. Aka &quot;Impregnation and Flight&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you know that what you&#39;re saying is wrong then. My grandparents owned a few restaurants, one really popular in a town with a population of 200,000, Golden Corral style buffet that went through huge amounts of food. Their walk in fridge was 1/4 of this. Their freezer was about the same. My dad owned a pizza shop that was almost exactly like Pizza Comet in terms of size, and our freezer there was 1/10 this size. Any pizza hut across the nation is going to have a similar one. Man I&#39;ve worked everything from a Little Caesars to a 1000 room hotel&#39;s restaurant that catered, and nothing has ever been this big, aside from working in places like Wal-Mart or grocery stores. </p>

Unless you branch into catering (in which case you still wouldn&#39;t need that space), you&#39;re limited by your floor space, seating area, and the time you can get tables in and out, to determine your sales volume. In the videos you can go and watch showing the inside of Comet, which you have been to, you can see that it&#39;s medium-sized, never really all that packed, and that they invite patrons to sit around and play ping pong, drink beer, or generally relax. Their seating area is 1/4 of the seating area in any Golden Corralish buffet, probably less. You&#39;re making fun of me for being &quot;ridiculous&quot;, and insulting my family&#39;s businesses for some reason, but it&#39;s like you&#39;re <em>trying</em> to look away from the obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for checking out my history.</p>

<p>The &quot;secret&quot; bathrooms are just bathrooms with hard to find doors (they look like part of the wall), but they&#39;re just normal bathrooms in the middle of the restaurant otherwise. </p>

<p>The screenplay didn&#39;t go anywhere. It wasn&#39;t about BDSM specifically, but as a writer I have to research lots of different things.</p>

<p>It could be I&#39;m just not in the know. But like I&#39;ve said, I&#39;m familiar with that area and I know plenty of people who worked at Comet for years (Poetry and Prose, too). They might have mentioned a child rape dungeon and kill room. It&#39;s not a big building and it&#39;s not a private building...there&#39;s just nowhere to do what&#39;s being alleged.</p>

<p>I never saw the hole in the ground, but based on the pictures it looks like standard reno work in an old building. </p>

<p>As for the print, sure its weird but so are all band posters. </p>

<p>And the Besta Pizza logo appears to be an abstracted slice of pizza, oozing cheese. The FBI link about pedophile symbols says its a blue triangle specifically, which the Besta Pizza logo isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The use of known pedophilic logos is odd. The connection between Clinton charity and sex trafficking out of Haiti. The Epstein connection.</p>

<p>As much as I don&#39;t like the art or the Instagram posts you can&#39;t really use that as a judge. I love h.r.giger which depicts a lot of macabre and darkly sexual scenes but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a judge of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen to your sentiments! There is more outright and incontrovertible proof of serious law-breaking from the Clinton team on which to focus our efforts. But much more importantly, hyping/sensationalizing tenuous pedo claims is not smart or responsible. The charge of pedophilia is not one to level lightly, done only after a solemn and exhaustive investigation yields irrefutable evidence of evil. Most of what has been proffered as damning is at best puzzling, but it certainly is not conclusive enough to label another human being a child rapist, not even insinuate that he/she is one. This is no light matter of yak bak on the Internet, it is a deeply devastating matter, affecting lives and families. You should think long and hard about any energy you put into the cause to destroy a person, whether or not they are your enemy. For if you have lost your moral compass in the process of punishing another for losing theirs, you are as damaged. I am not saying that you should not follow a smoke trail, only that you have a grave duty to consider all information in all its most innocent intent before you resort to what amounts to extreme emotional abuse. Be very careful that you are not wrong so that you may avoid becoming the more guilty party......</p>

<p>It is the way he said it that makes it sound hinky. Adding the time component makes the sentence redundant, everyone knows that most of the time lunch breaks are an hour, or break between meetings are generally for an hour. And for someone who is supposedly educated as him, he must understand redundant sentence structures.</p>

<p>But I can also understand that all this may not be something at all (even though the mounting of evidence, the connections, the symbols/codes, and his ownership of distasteful art (painting of small children, sculptures of murdered people etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I don&#39;t think it sounds that sketchy, even if it&#39;s not something everyone would say. If I have an hour long break I might ask if someone wants to spend an hour getting food, rather than asking to go eat with the implication we&#39;re going straight back to work when we&#39;re done. </p>

<p>Personally, I just don&#39;t see enough connections otherwise in this either. I think it&#39;s really interesting too, but these types of things rarely actually happen in reality. Yeah there&#39;s some disturbing looking artwork, but to claim it as smoking gun proof of some kind of satanic sex ring is too much of a stretch for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. But inside the ground of the WH no outside food. When celebrity chefs come to cook for diplomats or the president they have to send a list to the WH staff of the stuff they need. Down to the alcohol, seasoning, even the sanitary products. These items are purchased using layers and layers of shell companies to keep them secret. As human beings we have evolved a long way but one thing remains constant for those at the top (kings, PMs, etc). Someone else making your food leaves you extremely vulnerable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say you are selling body parts to underground cannibals. </p>

<p>You&#39;d come up with innocuous names for body parts. Ie, instead of kidneys you&#39;d be selling &quot;beans&quot;. You set up a fancy little shop near some old underground tunnels and call it The Bean Store. </p>

<p>Inside the store you have 1000 kinds of beans to sell, Dry beans, tinned beans, etc. </p>

<p>As for setting prices, you would change the decimal spaces. &quot;$2.00 for a can of beans&quot; would mean something like &quot;20k for a kidney&quot;.</p>

<p>So businesses that reference beans and have a strange obsession with beans would be a way to signal to others &quot;in the know&quot; that you are a bean seller (who also sells kidneys).  </p>

<p>I&#39;m just reading these mails because I want to clear Podesta, Hillary and friends in the court of public opinion</p>

<p>It seems that these people look more guilty everyday, but I will use my weaponized left autism brain to finally debunk these claims.</p>

<p>He was about to testify against Hillary Clinton, and then just mysteriously died in a weight-lifting accident.</p>

<p>EDIT: As u/helenanananah brought to my attention, this article has some falsity to its claim:</p>

<p>From the Snopes link provided by u/helenanananah:</p>

<p>WHAT&#39;S TRUE: Former UN Official John Ashe died in June 2016 at his Dobbs Ferry home. His death was initially misreported as a heart attack rather than an accident, and he was about to begin pre-trial meetings related to corruption charges at the time he died.</p>

<p>WHAT&#39;S FALSE: Ashe&#39;s corruption trial wasn&#39;t set to begin just days after his death, and he wasn&#39;t going to testify against Hillary Clinton.</p>

The man who owns this restaurant is in charge of investigating child trafficking, he makes his own restaurants logo the symbol for pedophilia, and constantly posts weird shit about sex and children?

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, we don&#39;t &quot;have them&quot;, we have a mountain of circumstantial evidence, specifically the logos and language used and that is exactly why they should be presenting to a judge and obtaining a warrant.</p>

<p>I agree, there is no amount of sleuthing that could possibly uncover something like this because you need to actually access physical locations and data that is protected from this kind of prying outside of law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>The best evidence is the individual&#39;s reaction to being questioned, their body language, tone of voice, microexpressions, reaction to evidence. This all requires substantial investigative work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“AMBER Alert has not achieved and probably cannot achieve the ambitious goals that inspired its creation.” Griffin and Miller examined data from hundreds of AMBER Alerts issued between 2003 and 2006, and dubbed the AMBER Alert system a “theatrical policy” that was largely ineffective in helping save kidnapped children. “In most cases where they were issued, Griffin found, Amber Alerts played no role in the eventual return of abducted children,” the Boston Globe wrote in 2008. “Their successes were generally in child custody fights that didn&#39;t pose a risk to the child. And in those rare instances where kidnappers did intend to rape or kill the child, Amber Alerts usually failed to save lives.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There simply are not that many pedophiles running about, particularly ones that run pizza parlors. u/If-im-not-you-im-me is absolutely correct this design is extremely common.</p>

<p>The spiral was literally one of the first things ever drawn and a triangular spiral wasn&#39;t far behind. These symbols are ancient in the truest sense of the word. They have been used pretty much universally through all cultures and are present throughout history. These forms are found in every art form, from craft jewelry to fine art sculpture and everything between.</p>

<p>Just because some fringe group decided to co-opt the triangular spiral as their logo, that doesn&#39;t mean every time someone draws or utilizes that symbol they are referencing said fringe group. It&#39;s quite the opposite. These symbols are so ubiquitous it is nearly impossible to draw the conclusion that anyone using them is referencing pedophilia. To draw such a conclusion you would have to provide some pretty solid evidence that a little pizza parlor used a common triangular spiral pizza slice logo to mean &quot;we&#39;re cool with fucking little kids.&quot;</p>

<p>The world is a crazy place and it&#39;s entirely possible you are right but at this point the evidence is severely lacking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I decided to read up on pizzagate because I didn&#39;t know much about it.</p>

<p>Asking a question is not evidence. Being a business owner, I can honestly say, I would change my logo if it became the target of a conspiracy theory. It sounds perfectly reasonable to me.</p>

<p>What evidence has lead you to the conclusion this &quot;theory&quot; has any merit? I&#39;ve read through plenty of the assertions made about this idea. The logo seems to be a really hinge piece of evidence for some people. However, to me, it seems like a really obvious logo for a pizza joint.</p>

<p>There has to be more substance to this story than a simple pizza logo, some random instagram photos, and an email talking about lunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so there isn&#39;t really anything in particular that has convinced you this real, it&#39;s simply the aggregate collection of unrelated things that does it?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take it one at a time then: the email Podesta allegedly received about a lost handkerchief.</p>

<p>The first time I read this email, it sounded like it was referring to a promotional item, as it has a map on it. Also, we don&#39;t know if this is Podesta&#39;s handkerchief in the first place. Nor do we know if this e-mail is even a bon fide message received by John Podesta, as our only source seems to be WikiLeaks. However, for the sake of argument, let&#39;s assume the e-mails are real.</p>

<p>Regarding the use of &quot;handkerchief code&quot;; it is a really, REALLY huge stretch to say this white handkerchief, with presumably black printing/writing (map) on it, is related to BDSM. I can assure you, if you are at a private BDSM party nobody bothers with handkerchief code. Things like that are for public events, meet and greets, Pride events, etc. and honestly isn&#39;t that widely used.  If you are at a private party, you know why you are there.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem like a more reasonable explanation that this was a handkerchief with some advertising printed on it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I think about it most pizza places I go to have strange pedo symbols as their logo. Advertise as kid friendly but have profanities on the walls. Their instagrams are definitely filled with pornographic pizza images. The owner visits the whitehouse and occasionally ties 3 year girls up as a goof. Most of them dig holes and joke about filling the hole. And they definitely all have bands that have posters of child abuse play at their child friendly restaurant on the reg. Perfectly commom shit. </p>

<p>Ok? That&#39;s a pretty glaringly horrible breach of protocol if they&#39;re using some sort of code. I mean, not only did the original message imply that the random link below contained important information, but podesta later confirms it by responding with <em>Yes.</em></p>

<p>There are quite a few seemingly nonsensical emails in podestas inbox, usually containing links that only seem like genuine urls as long as you don&#39;t look at them too hard.</p>

<p>You can find quite a few of them by just searching for &quot;games.com&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have any luck trying to load <strong>&quot;<a href="http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001">http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001</a>&quot;</strong>. However, doing a google search for <strong>&quot;emlcntusgame00000001&quot;</strong> turned up a couple of <em>very</em> sketchy yahoo groups and various other websites.</p>

<p>The first one I found was this:</p>

<p><a href="http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines">http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines</a></p>

<p>Go ahead and read it. More nonsensical conversations that stress the importance of &quot;reading between the lines&quot;.</p>

<p>This next one made me a little uncomfortable:</p>

<p><a href="https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715">https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715</a></p>

<p>So, there is no explicit mention of anything illegal or immoral. Trust me though, just read through the conversations. The same pattern emerges where people talk to each other using questionably strange sentence structure and inexplicably odd grammar, but you&#39;re pretty damn sure <em>they</em> know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I can only speculate at the moment, but that certainly isn&#39;t the <em>only</em> strange email. Am I seeing patterns where there are none?</p>

<a href="http://tmzworldnews.com/police-find-satanic-ritual-dungeon-in-chuck-e-cheese-basement/">http://tmzworldnews.com/police-find-satanic-ritual-dungeon-in-chuck-e-cheese-basement/</a>
Chicago, Illinois – Authorities have identified the skeletal remains found in a Chicago Chuck E. Cheese basement as those of four teenagers that disappeared between 2013 – 2015. Multiple media outlets report that the teenagers were local residents of the city. Charged in their deaths is the owner, 68-year-old Melvin Wallace. There is another woman being charged as an accessory to the murders.</p>

<p>Court documents allege that Wallace regularly performed “Satanic rituals” and “animal sacrifices” in the Chuck E. Cheese basement where the bodies were found. The basement dungeon, where the bodies were discovered, was full of mold, garbage, debris, animal feces as several satanic markings. Police say the children were more than likely abducted from the “family fun center.” Parents, who regularly take their children to the Chicago Chuck E. Cheese say they are shocked at the findings. “We come here to have pizza and play games at least once a week,” said Rita Thomas, mother of four. “Melvin seemed like such a nice guy, a little weird, but a nice guy. Parents need to watch their children more closely! There are these crazy types of creeps everywhere!”</p>

<p>Authorities believe that Wallace was performing these satanic rituals below the restaurant for more than a decade now. Crime scene investigators are searching the wooded area behind the building for any other bodies which may have fallen victim to Wallace’s disturbing rituals. The business has been closed, pending further investigations. Wallace is being held on murder charges with no bond.</p>

<p>Before pot became legal in my state when ever I txted my dealers I never ever, ever, once said &quot;I need weed, pot, cannabis,&quot; or anything relating to the smoking of herb. We used nicknames and symbols just like anyone else would who is trying to conceal there real activity.</p>

<p>Lets keep in mind at the time the worst I would have faced is a night in county and a ticket. The crimes they are committing are astronomical in proportion and criminality.</p>

<p>These people are not nearly as dumb as you and I want to think and will not divulge such information blatantly without being chastised within their own &quot;group&quot; of criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And his logo is a really generic piece of pizza</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, what the hell is the point of his business clearly displaying that he&#39;s a pedophile? How will he meet others with a shared cause through that medium? Do other pedophiles come to his store and ask the cashier to speak to the manager about some special business? </p>

<p>Listen the logo would be damming if there was literally any other sort of evidence, in the state the story looks now it seems a whole lot like harrassing a small business owner with ridiculous allegations about his generic looking logo he probably paid 200$ and used without knowing about the implication </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn... this is kinda spooky. I was on the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/psc/press-room">https://www.justice.gov/psc/press-room</a> website poking thru the releases... and at the end of one article there was a link to <a href="http://inobtr.org/">http://inobtr.org/</a> but when I clicked it... it had one of those popups confirming that you are entering a site that they cannot verify the information on... only time I&#39;ve seen that on a .gov site so far. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/j6PKM">http://imgur.com/a/j6PKM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://inobtr.org/about/">http://inobtr.org/about/</a> says &quot;St. Louis-based business leader and philanthropist <strong>Steven Schankman</strong> has been the driving force behind the INOBTR campaign, which has been in development since early 2006&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stlmag.com/A-Conversation-With-Steve-Schankman/">https://www.stlmag.com/A-Conversation-With-Steve-Schankman/</a></p>

<p>From the same interview <em>&quot;That’s why music is so important; that’s where I run away. Like yesterday, we all got killed in the market, but from 8 to 10:30 p.m., I didn’t think about it. I was playing “Children of Sanchez” by Chuck Mangione.&quot;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/chuck_mangione/children_of_sanchez-lyrics-409838.html">http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/chuck_mangione/children_of_sanchez-lyrics-409838.html</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t see exactly who runs <a href="http://www.amberalert.gov/">http://www.amberalert.gov/</a> but the website is same shitty unupdated style as inobtr... Are amber alerts total bullshit? I think they might have been doing some pervy stuff with <a href="http://ikeepsafe.org/news/ikeepsafe-launches-new-k12-student-privacy-badge-for-california/">http://ikeepsafe.org/news/ikeepsafe-launches-new-k12-student-privacy-badge-for-california/</a></p>

<p>And I could even theorize the National Guard offices often serve as enforcement arm protecting these child/drug rings in a lot of cases... The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard">Army National Guard</a> is a militia run by the each state&#39;s governor... They are set up in a confusing fashion which could lead to oversight and corruption easily.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to this, got briefed about this whole pizzagate by a mate.</p>

<p>Playing a little devil&#39;s advocate here, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll appreciate it in a sub like this. So a guy who owns a pizza place uses a logo that could be interpreted to be a pedophile symbol works at a position to hunt human traffickers? It looks like something a mediocre logo designer would come up with. I&#39;ve probably drawn the same symbol when I was in high school, it&#39;s a fairly obvious one to come across. I&#39;m not convinced the graphic designer of the pizza company had boylove in mind.</p>

<p>The owner of the pizza place is also working to stop human trafficking. That&#39;s good. Would he also commit or aid human trafficking himself? Where&#39;s the evidence to that?</p>

<p>A pizza logo doesn&#39;t convince me. Could someone point out the factual evidence of the pedophile ring?</p>

It&#39;s a big walk in but it&#39;s nowhere near the grocery store monstrosity you&#39;re making it out to be. Maybe consider that running a super popular restaurant in DC might outscale your Golden Corral. And regardless, this is a sideshow argument to your fucking ridiculous assertion that somehow a large walk-in = child sex trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>most of the sleuthing everyone is doing on the internet is speculative at best. i havent seen one piece of sleuthing that really convinced me any pedophile children trafficking is occuring, honestly. its really a huge stretch and i feel infowars and the rest of you are jumping to wild conclusions and proclaiming that youve GOT THEM when in reality there isnt anything substantial here. youre talking code words in emails, pedophile symbols, and linking food restaurants to each other while making baseless accusations. its honestly fucking embarassing to witness this, and ill be the guy in here to call you all out on the bullshit because its clear as day to me how far youre all reaching to prove your points. really have to stop this sort of shit it does no good for anyone. there is plenty of damning stuff in the podesta emails, and even the occult artist stuff was interesting (although also completely over exaggerated) but until you have something more substantial concerning the pedophilia network im gonna have to respectfully say youre all stretching the truth. downvote away.</p>
