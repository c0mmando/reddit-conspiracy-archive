<p>How about banning the OBVIOUS shills. Notice I only referred to OBVIOUS shills here.</p>

<p>Yet you refuse to take any action. What conclusion am I to make when you admit, in your own words, that you will never take action against even the most blatant shills?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the votes have since turned to crap, but they are still very much decided based on some algorithm and there are methods of detecting unusual behavior.  The idea of a tool is not so much a &quot;fake/not-fake&quot; guarantee but a way to test an already suspicious post.</p>

<p>Like how about the hillary post that was on all with 50% upvoted?  Posts there never make it to the top.  So something like that is clearly suspicious.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods here tend to stand back and let things just happen instead of getting involved. They do step in when things get out of hand for the most part. It&#39;s this philosophy that has made r/conspiracy the bastion of uncensored free speech on Reddit that is is. Unfortunately, we have to put up with that kind of brigading BullShit from time to time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That policy makes you just as prone to manipulation as anything else.</p>

<p>The better policy is to gather as much information as you can, apply critical thought, follow the bread crumbs and resign yourself to the fact that you&#39;re going to hit a dead end more often than not.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t put too much value in the opinions of others and, instead, assess their reasoning.</p>

<p>With that you&#39;ll often notice that these people who attempt to direct your attention rarely provide any reason. If they do, a little bit of critical thought will force you to reject what little is there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a major fuckup in some of the initial reporting on the 762 Park Place bit.</p>

<p>There is in fact 2 pizza related LLCs owned by Richard Gross. One goes to the PO box mentioned in the image above, the other is actually <strong><a href="http://www.crcweb.org/LOC/Pizza%20Spice%20Packets%20521.pdf">Pizza Spice Packets LLC</a></strong> which is listed directly at 762 Park Place according to this Chicago Rabbinical Council - which should probably get some investigating in this matter as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/us/pizza-spice-packet-llc.html">Pizza Spice Packets LLC is actually listed at another Florida address though</a>, which has a really creepy vibe to the building overall. </p>

<p>951 - Pizza Spice Packets LLC - <a href="https://sli.mg/a/7nBz4C">https://sli.mg/a/7nBz4C</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a really creepy van out front from a Google Streetview captured in August 2016. You can read on the front of this van &quot;A VIP Transportation Services Inc.&quot; Interestingly, there is almost nothing online about this company other than <a href="https://npidb.org/organizations/transportation_services/non-emergency-medical-transport-van_343900000x/1184071268.aspx">where it is registered and who it is registered to</a>. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/saH08h.png">Totally looks like the compound for a &quot;non-emergency transportation service&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>There are so many weird rabbit holes to all of this.</p>

<p>Hell, 762 Park Place in Brooklyn has some fairly current paperwork from the wife/sister/close-relative of the Chef of the Clintons. </p>

<p>More on this in a bit.</p>

<p>But mate, the most popular post on this sub right now is a post telling us to stop talking about the Podesta Pedo connections when we both know there&#39;s solid evidence. There&#39;s two posts below that with 300+ and 100+ upvotes telling us that somehow talking about these things is a&quot;psyops distraction&quot;. Like wtf? I&#39;ve never seen anything like that on this sub before. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking you to make it known we are being brigaded. How does that curtail discussion? How is that heavy handed? How does that censor anything?</p>

You will <em>never</em> persuade the Mod team to censor topics that don&#39;t break the rules though however much they annoy people or are even brigading, censorship is a slippery slope. If you knew how many times we&#39;ve refused to censor the flat earth &#39;psy-op&#39; demanded by our most valued users maybe you&#39;d understand the curation angle is anathema to the mod team. Some people believe different things and will argue with you, this is to be encouraged if all sides of a story are to be examined by dispassionate observers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking you to censor anything. I&#39;m simply asking you to make a post that we are currently under a substantial brigade and sticky it. Any individual mod can do that. That&#39;s not censorship at all and it&#39;s something YOU can do. So why aren&#39;t you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The posts you link to are no more a PsyOp than this post is. The community is divided right now and has different opinions on how to best use our resources, (time and effort). The people making posts urging you to steer away from certain topics feel that those topics aren&#39;t worthy of looking into or that there is nothing going on. That doesn&#39;t automatically make them a CTR shill or a plant, it makes them opinionated. I hope you see the irony in your thread here, condemning their posts for condemning the posts of others. This sub, while striving to promote transparency and the truth, is diverse and full of people with all different kinds of opinions. They have just as much right to urge you not to continue wasting your time as you do to scold them for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to take the opposite approach! They want us to stop but were on to something. I recently posted to this sub about something I thought I was REACHING BIG TIME. It was a small joke bill maher made about Hillary having jon benet ramsey in her basement. Something that would normally be dismissed as a lame joke. But with the recent podesta leaks, I though it was strange so I did a little research and found some connections between the 2. </p>

<p>Like I said, I thought I was reaching heavily.
I posted to this sub and what do you know...
That YouTube vid was deleted! Along with many other podesta/child sex related content.</p>

<p>I had maybe the furthest connection to make and they still deleted the video. That should speak volumes to what were on to!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is this, what does it hurt to look into it? If we look into it and come up with nothing, then great, we cleared that end. But why is it that we cannot look at multiple things at once? Perhaps by going after multiple things we can see some pieces fit together better than focusing on one small spectrum of this Clinton Foundation mess. We cannot go stagnant on this, just because Trump won does not mean this is over by a long shot. </p>

<p>/</p>

<p>The point of this post is to get people to not promote the posts that are telling us to not look at certain stories. We should be looking at <em>everything</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s a question that listens. or hey did you know that Cinton is a satanist and probably a pedo? Did you know that Papa Bush was a Nazi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Podesta forgot his pizza napkin map and just loves a spirit cook here and there. Hillary and Lynn Rothschild openly email about Minerva and Moloch. </p>

<p>Oh, and papa bush did help fund the Nazis. The Guardian can explain it better than I can though.</p>

<p>Define Obvious.</p>

<p>Yet you refuse to take any action. What conclusion am I to make when you admit, in your own words, that you will never take action against even the most blatant shills?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t day that in the slightest. And I already warned you of repeating things that I did not say.</p>

<p>Sounds like you&#39;re implying that it&#39;s 100% fine for CTR to shill on this sub. That sounds like being condoned to me.</p>

<p>Not condoned. But I&#39;m not using moderator privileges because you say someone is a shill.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a stretch and you know it. Nor did I say anything you didn&#39;t <em>IMPLY</em> anyway.</p>

<p>Nothing you said stated I <em>implied anything</em>.</p>
