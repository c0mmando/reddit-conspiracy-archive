      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When COG was initiated, most of Congress was in the dark.  As they found about about, they inquired and were told to STFU basically.  Eventually, the reigning establishment, realizing they've been politically, legally castrated, the public government has consented to something called
       <em>
        "secret law"
       </em>
       --wherein they claim the Executive gets to let the CIA do whatever it wants and the Congress isn't aren't allowed to ask about it.  This is a cop out, because it's not legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution, not the CIA or POTUS is the "Supreme Law of the Land".  So where does the Constitution get it's power of authority?  From YOU.  It's derived by "popular sovereignty": The constitution is a social contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government is telling us that they can violate our social contract whenever they want, however they want, and there's nothing you (or they) can do about it.  This means effectively, there is a shadow government that does what it wants and yet you still have to somehow obey the rules.

        What Unpunishment of State Abuses Effectively Means
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because either it's the case that the acknowledgement and adoption of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_law">
        "secret law"
       </a>
       within our public government means that the
       <strong>
        <em>
         CIA has become a private institution
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and no longer a
       <em>
        public
       </em>
       one.  In other words, the Intelligence community, MIC, Deep state, Shadow Governement, whatever you want to call it, is no longer part of the US Government.  If this is the case, it has committed acts of
       <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/D841FAAF-E243-B000-0DCB-72E2CE6F8821#-169">

       </a>
       , and the
       <strong>
        <em>
         Congress, Executive and SCOTUS have all therefore been complicit in treason since 9/11
        </em>
       </strong>
       by continuing to allow them to do these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Alternatively, if the Intelligence Community is still part of the Public US Government, then it can only mean that the Constitution itself has been suspended,
        </em>
       </strong>
       and there are no laws in place right now because all laws--with the exception of international law (maritime admiralty law) and other forms of law not defined by the constitution--are wholly invalid, state constitutions are invalid, and all courts are invalid.

       Fascinating. I remember COG pre-y2k. I fell off the attention-train a few years after 9-11, and then Iraq/PNAC compounded the clusterf, when it became clear that no one was getting ANYTHING, and it was obviously a time best spent continuing to learn and observe and tunnel around. My own business and personal requirements over the last decade kept my eyes on other balls, waiting for a global Moore's Law of informational connectivity to catch up so that working my corner through these lenses would feel relevant again. Thanks for your posts. Am perusing many of your priors - can't comment on them because they're archived - but am grateful for the info. Thanks.

       Glad you are enjoying them.  I think something almost has to happen at this point.  I think we've reached a tipping point and their tricks no longer work on us.

       The tipping point I'd like to envision is that their tricks no longer work on them. The best win is when the other side sees that you're right - and changes sides.

       All this time they've been using it as goalposts for semiconductor development. The problem is, it's not linear at all, and there seems to be an asymptote at the singularity. Thank fuck.

       Bin Laden was killed in 2011, but ISIS began in 2012, so obviously COG was needed to keep fighting them overseas so we don't have fight them here. Once we finally kill off ISIS, I'm sure we'll have 6 - 8 weeks of Constitutional rule before the next group of America killers pops up and we have put that silly old piece of paper away again.

       Continuity of Government is one of my favorite "conspiracy theories" because it is entirely verifiable and super creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so real, and almost undeniably happening right under our noses.  The suspension of the constitution and the introduction of a new "secret" governing body, hidden within the government makes so much more sense than trying to believe the bullshit that Obama, the constitutional law professor pulled as soon as he took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I can't really talk about this stuff with anybody in real life because it instantly destroys my credibility as a person to everybody outside of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter how much documentation is available or how obvious the connections are.... they just look at me like I'm crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My research so far has lead me to believe that "B" is most likely what's happening.

       From OP:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Alternatively, if the Intelligence Community is still part of the Public US Government, then it can only mean that the Constitution itself has been suspended, and there are no laws in place right now because all laws--with the exception of international law (maritime admiralty law) and other forms of law not defined by the constitution--are wholly invalid, state constitutions are invalid, and all courts are invalid.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The simplest way to explain what this means is that a "shadow government" has taken control of the actual functions of our country while the normal elected government runs the public-facing day to day operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the surface it would look like we're running a democracy, but the normal parts of a democracy could be suspended at any time it's convenient for the gov't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another a/effect of this Foreign policy and domestic law shitshow is that slowly, repression of dissent will become the new functions of local governments and law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're working up to something big, here.
