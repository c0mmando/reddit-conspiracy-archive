    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s both, no? Perhaps the end goal is to siphon the wealth away from the public in order to insure there are no resources available to pursue the re-attainment of rights. </p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t forget to include how credit scores are used to force impoverished individuals to pay more money for the same goods through higher interest rates. Meanwhile, artificial market manipulations create bubbles which enable seizure of property on massive scales. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Backing up everything you said was Cecil Rhodes plans on how to create a global government. I&#39;m sure you know that, I just thought I would point it out for others. You have been spot on with everything I have seen you post by the way, I actually defended you awhile back even when I was less sure about you than I am now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man.  It&#39;s good to have an ally.  I found out about Cecil Rhodes when I made the list of confirmed conspiracies (rhodesia and using his employees as a private army).  It was serendipitous that I came across a corbettreport talk about rhodesia and cecil rhodes and the round table group.  I was like, damn, Corbett has been doing this shit for way longer than all of us.  So I have to give him credit as well.</p>

<p>Of course he got a lot of his stuff from Mae Brussell.  Do you know Brussell&#39;s work?  She&#39;s a deceased conspiracy researcher from the 70s and 80s who had an independent investigation of JFK.  She&#39;s maybe one of the most influential conpsiracy researchers there is.  She (and Iserbyt and Levenda) clued me in on nazis in america, a fascists taking over the intelligence community.  Here&#39;s her archive.</p>

<p>I also listen to Michael Parenti, and recently Webster Tarpley but I think Tarpley may be an agent of disinfo in some cases. His venusian (venice) conspiracy stuff is good though.  Nothing else like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know about Mae, but my knowledge is more limited to pursuing history. But when researching history I ended up brushing up against the more occult/super weird things so that is where I am at now. So for me what cued me in was seeing you connect lots of the history I already knew to the odd numerology and occult or religious things. As an atheist and naturalist this has been the weirdest part for me but it&#39;s obvious there is something to it. I&#39;ve been frantically researching but it&#39;s certainly the hardest issue to find good information on. For example, I have known about the CIA connections to cults for years and that&#39;s made me interested in Assange from the beginning. Being a computer nerd myself I also noticed the weird ties between intelligence and religion in the past that now is seeming to be replaced by hacker culture instead of religion. Assange was a part of that from the beginning. Still not sure what it means though. </p>
