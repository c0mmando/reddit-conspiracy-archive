    <div class="md"><p>Nah come on dude. I listen to Alex frequently, sure he over hypes some things (he is a radio show host after all). But much of what he says is accurate, he has a great since of history and his guest speakers are very smart and interesting people from across the board. He has a whole team of reporters that write their own articles too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he does is take the conspiracy of the day, let’s say 9/11, then he goes through the scenarios, mentioning the reasonable scenarios, along side with the far out ones, and then he adds some kind of crazy stuff to the reasonable ones.  For example, he might push the idea that the planes were holograms or something along those lines, to discredit the underlying theory.  He muddles the picture.  He isn’t trying to condemn people that are looking into things, he is trying to get them off the trail, sell them a bunch of BS neatly packaged along with just enough of the true story to keep those that have a clue on board.  It’s really text book intelligence/counter intelligence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, but lets focus on the bigger picture of what he talks about (globalism). Even if he was controlled opposition he still brings up things about &quot;their&quot; agenda. Why would they want anyone to have any idea about the agenda in play? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where yall are coming from. But I still think he is a over-zealous misunderstood person. I&#39;m listening to him right now for the 52hr election broadcast, he said &quot;no matter if Trump wins or not, Trump wants us to not let TPP pass&quot;. IF he was a CIA agent, the thought of him putting out even the slightest opposition to arguably the most bullshit globalist trade deal is hard to swallow. They wouldn&#39;t want the message out. Plus, he never argues for violence, if he was sitting their telling everyone to grab their guns and go to DC I can see how the psyop is applied. Glass half full- GO TRUMP!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He took that energy and legitimate frustration and channeled it back into the political system (Trump). </p>

<p>Most people new to thinking this way will pick up on his vibe of extreme emotional unwellness and get a bad taste in their mouths whenever the views he expresses come back in front of them because they will equate those emotions with the views. </p>

<p>He is sort of the human equivalent of the word &quot;sheeple&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.  </p>

<p>One of the oddball side effects of this strategy is that it&#39;s made people better debaters, which has been counterproductive to the overall strategy itself. </p>

<p>Another thing to notice is the consistent tactic used by the disinfoists to encourage simpler models.  Dumb it down.  This is where the useful idiots are groomed.  SJWs are a good example.  So when you see the models &quot;getting simpler&quot; and this is encouraged through the use of shame tactics - it&#39;s a sure as fuck smell of goofery. </p>

<p>The 14th Dalai Lama was financially backed by the CIA from the late 1950s until 1974, receiving US$180,000 each year. The funds were paid to him personally, although he used most of them for Tibetan government-in-exile activities funding foreign offices to lobby for international support.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anybody thinks that our intelligence agencies are just sitting around saying “Geez guys, these conspiracy theorists are figuring stuff out, I guess we better stop doing bad stuff now, since there’s absolutely no possible way to influence them, bummer for us, oh well.”  </p>

<p>These people spend as much time and resources on mis/disinformation as they do actually gathering information and intelligence.  One sure way to make it difficult to prove that the govt. shot JFK is to spread a variety of well thought out and plausible alternative scenarios, using intelligence assets in the MSM (Alex Jones) as well as online using shills.  They use those same assets to muddle and condemn the actual story while pushing the false scenarios in their place.  Eventually nobody is talking about the govt. killing JFK, they’re talking about Cuba, or USSR or the Mob, etc...This is Intelligence 101.</p>

<p>Even among conspiracy theorists an idea has it&#39;s time and occasionally it comes too early. I&#39;ve seen many theories that went from ridicule to common knowledge (at least among theorists).</p>

<p>If an individual has already been wired to ridicule before understanding then the battlefield for that individuals mind has already been won or lost from our point of view.</p>
