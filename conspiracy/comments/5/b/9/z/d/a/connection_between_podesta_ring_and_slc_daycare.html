<p>Someone mentioned they are looking for a Clinton connection...maybe it&#39;s David Yocum, he prosecuted Ted Bundy and is or was a registered owner of the place in question. It&#39;s also been sold for zero dollars a bunch of times...</p>

<p>@LS found that info she has links if needed...</p>

<p>This comment by u/hydroponicfunbags reminded me of the SLC Daycare conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re trying to make other connections to pedophilia rings in government.
Here&#39;s a for instance... So far in email connections, off the top of my head, we have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/</a> this Hastert guy who admitted diddling kids when he did work as a teacher, and if you do some Googling you find he did a 3-4 month stint in Japan, with Tony Podesta, John&#39;s older brother, where they both taught students.
You have the lady trying to steal 33 kids from Haiti.
And of course, you have Epstein.
We should be rounding up all these connections and googling names from email chains in Podesta mail to see if we can tie anymore of their friends to pedophilia or sex trafficking accusations. It&#39;s not normal to have several people in your social circle involved in this fuckery.
I believe the angle of examining the Amber Alert system equipment, etc, is the same as people going down the trail of the 2 journalists Bing and Bill Clinton went and picked up from North Korea after they got detained as &quot;spies.&quot; The two female journalists were investigating sex trafficking. These trails are being examined because if a sex ring is real, then people in power are probably putting their tendrils in the industry of investigating said rings, so they can continue to tilt the scales and keep their own selves out of any investigations.
Other threads Anon have been going down including examining Visa programs (good cover for human trafficking) and examining movements of shipping containers. They have stumbled upon a few innocuous looking conversations about pushing shipping containers through customs without inspection and avoiding tariffs, etc. Sounds boring until you look at it through the lense of &quot;What if they are trafficking humans?&quot;</p>

<p>Do some diggin on SLC Daycare. It is no daycare. About a year ago conspiracy threads were actually being deleted and people were being threatened to stop digging. I hope the winds have changed a bit. Some people were able get calls answered by a spanish speaking woman and surmised that it was only for poor children and government sponsored. One guy went and parked his car there until a woman and girl came out, then a guy cracked the door 6 inches &quot;what&#39;s the problem?&quot; and after he saying he was interested in enrolling his child they got hostile and said he needed to leave. One user claimed friends broke into it drunk and found 1 room with a large tv feed from the other large room. More fucked? The whois on the websites were linked to the cities media management head, and quickly went private. The thing that just made me shit my pants is that tons of sketchy container shipments were linked to the place as well. Like entire shipping containers full of plastic jewelry and footballs for a place that only intermittently had any kids, but a constant stream of state exempt licence plates and plumbers/electricians/vans all the time. Lapsed licence in 2006 but fresh paint and shipments? And it is linked to multiple other businesses that are registered as daycares across the nation. I can&#39;t ignore this one. I know there is something to it. I will try to update with links later.</p>

<p>FBIAnon said something like &quot;Look at the Cards&quot;.
FBI CARD:
It is the mission of the FBIâ€™s Violent Crimes Against Children program to provide a quick and effective response to all incidents of crimes against children. The first few hours after a child is abducted are critical, and that is why we established Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) Teams in October 2005.
<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/cac">https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/cac</a>
Laura Lislby is also Laura Silsby-Gayler, who now works for AlertSense
<a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a>
AlertSense is a company that provides a platform for mass alerts, such as abducted children.
So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts.
Something doesn&#39;t add up here.

Others have had a spanish speaking woman answer and inform them that it was government subsidized for poor children.

Old subway station under pizza places.

LAUREL CANYON underground tunnel network
