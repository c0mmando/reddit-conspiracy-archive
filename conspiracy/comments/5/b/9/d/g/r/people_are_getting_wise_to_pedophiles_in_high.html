       Some on this sub have been aware that pedophilia is practiced by rich, well-connected people who are probably integral to the Deep State. It's just one of many conspiracies which have been written about for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election is bringing this issue to light, with Trump supporters giving it a huge push. What will happen to all this energy after the election is over? This can't be a one-time deal. Which one of us would want to be in those kids' shoes, at the total mercy of some psychopath? The only way that Western society can be purged of this, is if the pressure to do so is maintained. And the only people who can keep the pressure on, are
       <em>
        The People
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So reach out to everyone on these subs, on 4chan, and anywhere else where this issue is discussed, and remind them that this has been going on for a lot longer than this election season, and will
       <em>
        continue
       </em>
       to go on, if nothing is ever really done about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that there are good guys in the police forces and federal agencies who would like to clean up this pile of corruption, but they need to know that we know what's up, and we're with them, (as long as they continue to be willing to be The Good Guys).

       These recent leaks are unprecedented. Nothing in history comes close. Historically mere rumors of this type of behavior has toppled kingdoms and ended bloodlines. The worst thing that could happen to Clinton now is to become elected president to face impeachment and prison. She's fucked.the DNC are Fucked, if not as dead as the GOP. The climate is ripe for revolution, everyone knows it, feels it...hell it might be unavoidable. One thing is for the first time in history, a populace are better armed and outnumber the combined world military 50 to 1. Which makes me believe tptb aren't going to test a revolution at this time... especially since everyone has Google maps to find elite skulls. Soccer anyone?

       It all falls on the hands of the daily troops of investigators and cops really.  The people outside the system have very little power, its going to be the troopers inside to make sure things get seen through.
      </p>
      <p>
       These leaks are damning and the more the troops know the harder it is to cover up or for that matter pay.  This is going to be an interesting couple of years.

       Are you speculating that certain Candidate supporters are "giving it a huge push" ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you telling me to "reach out" to others? Have you been here before?

       It's dismissive use "psychopath" ... I could go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will disagree with you about something, though: I don't think "they need to know that we know what's up" -- If your assumption is correct (and I think it's a compelling premise), then don't you think they already know we know to begin with? Do you honestly think people haven't received the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, if there were "good guys" in named agencies, how in the shit are we supposed to know who they are? Added to this, how in the shit are we supposed to "reach out" to them?

       I admit that it's difficult to "reach out" to people in the three-letter-agencies. I didn't recommend that. I recommended reaching out to the population at large. The "push" that the guys in the TLA's will feel, is from the general zeitgeist of the nation. It's not easy to take a controversial and potentially hazardous stance, when you feel that
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       is on your side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, certain Candidate supporters are giving a push. Visit the other candidates' subs, and see what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "them" knowing that we know what's up, that's never been as clear.
