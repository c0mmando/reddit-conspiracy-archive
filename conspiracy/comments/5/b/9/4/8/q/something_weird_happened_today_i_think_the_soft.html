        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today and/or yesterday, all of the following happened:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bret Baier; after claiming some bombshell that would lead to indictment fm pologized for claiming that FBI pushing for an indictment, said his source was wrong, and walked it WAY back: <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/11/fox-news-bret-baier-sorry-for-clinton-foundation-report-230743">http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/11/fox-news-bret-baier-sorry-for-clinton-foundation-report-230743</a></p></li>
<li><p>The FBI began investigating it&#39;s own tweets (!!): <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/03/fbi-is-investigating-its-twitter-account-over-election-tweets/">http://nypost.com/2016/11/03/fbi-is-investigating-its-twitter-account-over-election-tweets/</a></p></li>
<li><p>NYPD was the victim of a shooting today. A lone gunman shot two police officers and killed one. This comes just a day after NYPD sources said they were going to leak CF scandal. Assassination? <a href="http://6abc.com/news/2-nypd-sergeants-injured-1-gravely-in-bronx-shooting/1590119/">http://6abc.com/news/2-nypd-sergeants-injured-1-gravely-in-bronx-shooting/1590119/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Pieczenik posts a new video with a <strong>very</strong> different tone than the first. Seems he is possibly under duress or something. Essentially says we shouldn&#39;t be violet and some corruption is inevitable and the revolution lives on long term. May contain buried refs to indicate he is under duress. Night and day compared to the other video. <a href="https://youtu.be/CJ_CYS-KMjM">https://youtu.be/CJ_CYS-KMjM</a></p></li>
<li><p>Other random oddities - Fox went out, someone apparently spamming 4chan with CP, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think something happened today to partly squash this soft coup. Lots of NYPD sources saying they&#39;re getting separated from FBI and this won&#39;t go forward. People shooting at NYPD, Baier getting whipped into line, Pieczenik and his air of a reluctant defeat. It feels like something behind the scenes got nuts today.</p>

<p>And Pieczenik&#39;s video itself is unlike him. He says nice things about George H W Bush, even though it is well known that he HATES Bush. It seems as though he is resigning to something.</p>

<p>I ask you this here because nobody else has been looking at this angle, but it is very natural to me. I would like to know more about if anyone has seen any other crazy stuff today, or is tuned into this interpretation of events. Seems the current regime has retaliated (se it Assad anyway)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you trust people who openly tell you their job is to lie to you? This guy&#39;s job is literally called &quot;psychological operations&quot;. Read the youtube comments, the sentiment is pretty much 100% that the whole time his purpose was to diffuse revolutionary energy and basically make everything go smoothly for hillary. I think it&#39;s pretty obvious the first video was to gain the trust so he said some things that made you think he was legit, but as we can see with the second video he&#39;s praising people like Kissinger and telling us we need to not &quot;get violent&quot; even if our country is taken over. He is here for psychological operations against us, and you think he&#39;s on your side? Give me a fu**ing break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Bureaucracy is undoubtedly the weapon and sign of a despotic government, inasmuch as it gives whatever government it serves, despotic power.”</p>

<p>“Despotic power is always accompanied by corruption of morality.”</p>

<p>“It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be oppressed by a majority.”</p>

<p>“The Americans, having broken the thread in 1776, spliced it together again. They became eminently conservative in 1787.”</p>

<p>“Americans dreaded democracy and contrived their constitution against it.”</p>

<p>“The great novelty of the American Constitution was that it imposed checks on the representatives of the people.”</p>

<p>“What the French took from the Americans was their theory of revolution, not their theory of government — their cutting, not their sewing.”</p>

<p>“History is a great innovator and breaker of idols.”</p>

<p>“Politics = the ethics of public life.”</p>

<p>“A public man has no right to let his actions be determined by particular interests. He does the same thing as a judge who accepts a bribe. Like a judge he must consider what is right, not what is advantageous to a party or class.”</p>

<p>&quot;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummm, it&#39;s called reality.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bret overstepped responsible journalism to grab a headline. I can&#39;t believe I just used &#39;responsible&#39; &amp; &#39;journalism&#39; in the same sentence. But it did cause plenty of damage to Hillary so it&#39;s a plus.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vault tweets are unusual but nothing earth shaking. Not uncommon when something unusual happens that a department will investigate itself when something unusual gets viral media attention. Already explained as an automated system that wasn&#39;t working got fixed by a CMS update that was pushed out by IT the day before. (I do think there are some lower level staff mad and took the opportunity to &#39;fix&#39; it at a critical time)</p></li>
<li><p>Attacks against officers have been happening all around the country this year. It&#39;s terrible but not something new. Hitting a street officer wouldn&#39;t send a message. A message would be sent much higher up the chain.</p></li>
<li><p>Pieczenik is a bit of a deceiver in my opinion. I think he&#39;s very good at being quick to take tidbits and weaving a narrative to make a picture. He plays on everyone&#39;s &#39;conformation bias&#39;. There&#39;s been plenty of news about how lower level agents are mad and still working cases behind the political heads &#39;stand down&#39; orders. Add in the obvious leaks coming from the FBI and Pieczenik gets to weave a story, make himself seem important and confirm what everyone is hoping for.</p></li>
<li><p>Fox &amp; CNN dropped out for a bit. In this area they disappeared from DirecTV. No big mystery. We overpay for shitty services that seldom work as advertised. A guide update in the system broke the system and moved the channels. Hell, my Roku kept resetting YouTube to default yesterday. Wasn&#39;t hackers...just shitty service as always.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Stay calm, things will happen on their own. Take advantage of these fake, false or misdirected headlines to push the narrative that Hillary is corrupt. Just make sure you spread them as plausible sounding so it hurts Hillary in the polls. I&#39;ve been keeping the Bernie people riled up by reminding them about how they got screwed by dropping those Podesta emails into their FB page.</p>

<p>You have to keep Hillary out of office if you want any chance of justice to be served.</p>

<p>I&#39;m recent to being a regular here and it takes a lot of reading to find that 10%. Then you have to analyze your goals. Then it&#39;s small steps to get to your end game. Everyone wants to rush off and fix the system in one election. Ain&#39;t gonna happen. It&#39;s taken the dems 25+ years to set this stage. It will take us a couple generations just to get back to even.

<p>My comment about the dems taking over is how they got smart and went to lower levels of gov&#39;t and got the courts filed with left leaning judges. Republicans just sat back and did nothing while the appellate courts went blue. 
Our gov&#39;t has always been for the oligarchy. I have problems deciding the point that gov&#39;t merged with Wall St and corporations and really went over the top with screwing the little people. Maybe around Bill Clinton&#39;s time and the Bush&#39;s put the nail in the coffin?</p>

Imagine you were another NYPD in on this, &quot;Gonna release this evidence&quot; and your precinct colleagues get suicided. You&#39;d likely back off unless you have balls of steel, or you&#39;ve flown your family to a far off country.</p>

<p>Having said that, they did threaten the FBI that if they don&#39;t press charges by 5 PM today, likely EST, then they will release the evidence. I don&#39;t think the CIA would send in wet works for the chief that made the original threats, so there&#39;s that too.</p>

It seems hard for only part of the corruption to be exposed it&#39;s looking like it&#39;s going to be all or nothing. If it&#39;s nothing things will get much worse. Clinton will be eliminating all threats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing sticks to these people, her in particular. Also, you have to remember this: pin a body to her (I mean with video, not just leaked emails) and about 43% of the people will still vote for her. This isn&#39;t just a problem with Democrats. This is what Mitt Romney alluded to in 2012.  You have to get to that group of people in the middle, and Trump is a loudmouth polarizing figure that just scared the hell out of people.</p>

<p>This is true, but Trump also wins among independents. And since they committed so much election fraud during the Dem primaries and many Bernie voters dropped the party over jt, there are more independents than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll see. I don&#39;t see him pulling this out. I voted for him - and I&#39;ll be honest- I can&#39;t stand him. He&#39;s entertaining as an eccentric billionaire. There is almost nothing about him I want as president. Because of his business experience I think he <em>might</em> have some ideas how to create jobs and bring some jobs home.  My only other option was Johnson. And that was my plan when I was sure Trump would carry my state. Now all of a sudden we&#39;re a battleground state. Hillary must have spent <em>millions</em> here. I was so annoyed by the ads watching the world series  (the Cubs won, did you hear? It wasn&#39;t really covered that much).</p>

<p>In the end it came down to the fact whoever is the next president will appoint one supreme court justice for sure, and possibly three... and I like the second amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>keep hitting hard on the stuff that&#39;s known- make a really big deal out of the Clinton-Saudi connection (they. execute. gay. people.) wear away the Hillary support organically and watch the election carefully. if she loses the race, the team goes down.</p>

<p>there will be legal battles over who wins the election... if the remaining HRC supporters are vocal enough, it&#39;ll squash Trump&#39;s challenges to the legitimacy of the results. we need to make them fight a multi-front legal battle, simultaneously dealing with the FBI and Trump&#39;s attorneys.</p>

<p>the remaining HRC supporters are the key. hit hard where it&#39;s soft, don&#39;t speculate, and don&#39;t let them change the subject or weasel out of an answer. make them take ownership for the fact that their chosen leader is cozy with a King who murders gay people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always said that the powers that be use 1984 as their playbook. I have been trying for awhile now to figure out what is being played out with this election. I have an unease, a suspicion about it all.</p>

<p>It is hard for me to grasp all the fervor that is being played out. My conscience is telling me that none of these leaks would get out to the public unless they wanted them to.</p>

<p>I am left with my original belief in the playbook. I just had a revelation that Alex Jones and or Julian Assange is the Emmanuel Goldstein. The enemy of the state. Hillary will be elected and they will all be paraded in front of your TV screen as the enemy.</p>

<p>The voice of hope will fall silent, the people will fall in line and as far as anyone could remember, we were always at war. </p>

<p>Maybe this is a plot that went as far as to be an elaborate ruse concocted by the state, for traitors of the state to pick up and run with it.</p>
