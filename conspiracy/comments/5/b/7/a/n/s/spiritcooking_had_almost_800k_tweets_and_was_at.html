       Surprise, surprise. #SpiritCooking with 800k tweets has been replaced now with #RememberWhenTrump at the top of trending with 111k tweets. Absolute blatant. The #rememberwhentrump came out of nowhere to suddenly be #1, while #spiritcooking has been removed completely.

       Pro big government? I call it "looking at the models set by successful nations". Denmark is one of the happiest countries in the world because it invests in it's people. Same with Swizerland. Maybe you've become complacent with having a government that shits on you.

       I believe you did. Anybody can do SEO and rank high in the serps. I believe Snopes and other sites are boosted to the top of the serps because they fit the agenda...without extra SEO work done. It's damage control.

       Wrong. She would have had a far easier time against Jeb. Jeb would have meekly smiled, and refused to attack her corruption record. Allowing the media to ordain her our new savior. Feminism, and Equality for all! Bleh. You should know this after seeing how the last two elections went with establishment GOP goons who sold their loss about as well as professional wrestlers.

       The twitter trending system has been fucked. They allow trends with 6k to be higher on their list than ones with 100k. They pull ones that dont fit the pro-hillary narrative and allow anti-trump ones to remain. This is nothing new.

       For once im glad something was deleted. Its an enormous waste of time and wild goose chase without a goose. I want nothing more than Hillary to go to prison, but this is not helping. Edgy performance art is not a crime, and there is precisely zero demonstrable proof of any occult/satanic stuff being real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious fearmongering makes communities like this and T_D look stupid and ignorant, and is embarrassing to log in snd see. What happened to being rational and logical? Why are half the threads about an edgy art video and not focusing on things that could lead to an indictment?

       Exactly the kind of look that makes it easy for the MSM to wave us off categorically and ignore the important news/leaks. Prioritizing outright bullshit like this 'Spirit Cooking' thing in some effort to scare religious voters towards Trump, is doing everyone a disservice and making an embarrassment of these collective communities.

       It was actively changing votes. It doesn't matter whether you think it matters, lots of voters cared...voters who
       <em>

       apparently care about actual corruption.

       If anyone changes votes over this non-issue, they're factually stupid and shouldn't be voting. There's a lot of reasons not to vote for Hillary, but this isn't one.

       If your goal is to trick people into voting for Trump by means of fearmongering, tricks, lies, etc, then aptly apply your last sentence to yourself.

       Except it's not a lie, and I'm not in charge of what people are allowed to be afraid of. Besides, I thought it was a psyop distraction? Can't even keep your propaganda straight when correcting the record, huh?

       Maybe Trump is in the cabal and all of this pushback is just for show, but it seems to me we have a very clear choice this election between globalist scum and someone the establishment absolutely hates. I wish they were paying me for that. I could use the money and I'd lose no sleep.

       what do you call it? the video is literally performance art, no one is being harmed, that isn't human blood, and the occult stuff is all unsubstantiated BS.

      <p>
       The woman who made it has other works of art in MOMA and still works to this day, so she apparently made a successful career out of trolling religious people. She's the female Marilyn Manson of the art world.

       if it isn't art what is it? The occult/satanism/demons/etc aren't real, so it can't ever be anything but a performance. It doesn't matter what she believes, your beliefs don't re-define reality.

       Interesting point, however What you or I believe isn't the issue here, it is what the people doing the stuff believe.  When people believe they are acting on behalf of a higher they do some shitty shit, especially when it is a higher that they identify as evil.

       Furthermore, it is clear that you likely havnt even taken  the time to look into what is being discussed here and just wish to be blindly argumentative. Marina is not a 'He'.

       It's easy to dismiss it when you just assume it away. If you start with a worldview that rules out the supernatural, yeah it's just dumb stuff. But when you do believe in more than the natural world, then the dark and demonic is not serious, serious stuff not to be messed with. Most of us in America still believe in the spiritual realm, so this is a big deal.

       One creates, the other consumes. One gives life, the other death. One restores, the other perverts. The Bible is very aware of powers of evil and darkness, and intentionally sets itself in direct contrast to it: power of love and light, not manipulation and darkness. God was battling against Molech long before
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       was.
      </p>
      <p>
       "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 10 and find out what pleases the Lord. 11 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 12 It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 13 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 14 This is why it is said:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Wake up, sleeper,
    rise from the dead,
    and Christ will shine on you.” (Ephesians 5:8-14)
      </p>
      <p>
       Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. (Ephesians 6:11-18)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to find some more examples, those were just two of the first two examples that came to mind.

       It's not even the most edgy art i've heard about this week. Lots of people appreciate the dark/occult/etc symbolism without actually believing any of it to be real, and i've seen no evidence to lead me to believe any of it is real.

       Well ok. I guess. But I really think you should take a closer look at this shit. These people in power are really into some weird shit. I don;t think it's real either, and I'm pretty sure they don't either. But the fact that that is what they enjoy is really telling.

       Don't be surprised if it turns out they're compromised then, and this is a wild goose chase to divert people away from actual important issues. Are you not wondering why there hasn't been a bombshell yet 4 days out from the election? All year they promised something. Delivered absolutely fuck-all.

       What the fuck does that have to do with anything we're talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       The essence of this thread is suppression and you applauding it because you think it's fine for some entity to control your (and others') perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there's some importance in it if they don't want people seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a second ago you were talking about how good censorship is. In the next breath you're complaining we don't see anything real. I mean, just take a moment and analyze the absurdity of your thoughts. Are you that oblivious to your very own double think?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be hard to have a lower opinion of humanity than I have, especially right now. But even I afford them the burden of thinking for themselves.

       She said in her ama that it is not ust art, here is a quote from her:
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.

       Dude, you are outside the norm.  This hashtag exploded precisely because so many people cared a ton.  Also, T_D has
       <em>

       Neither contemporary art nor satanism are illegal, but i believe while america is fine with the first woman president, it is not yet ready for the first satanist president, or one perceived as such.

       The only people I know of who identify as Satanists are edgy atheists who just take that label to piss off religious people. They don't believe in the devil/demons/etc or anything like that.

       So what you're effectively saying is Americans won't vote for a non-christian for a role that is meant to separate church and state. That says a lot worse things about America than the individuals running.

       May not end in jail time, but this stuff most certainly does matter in the mind of an average voter. For anyone not into this weird art scene (most people) this will absolutely tarnish the image of the Clinton campaign. I say keep pushing it. Getting Clinton in jail will only happen if she first loses the election.

       Twitter openly admitted in 2014 that there were 20 million bot accounts. At the time that was about 8.5% of all accounts. I couldn't find a more recent number in 3 seconds of Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people agree with Twitter when it confirms their intuition. I've never signed up because bots were the first thought in my head. This will never be real.

       The only people I know of who identify as Satanists are edgy atheists who just take that label to piss off religious people. They don't believe in the devil/demons/etc or anything like that.

       So what you're effectively saying is Americans won't vote for a non-christian for a role that is meant to separate church and state. That says a lot worse things about America than the individuals running.

       Wrong. She would have had a far easier time against Jeb. Jeb would have meekly smiled, and refused to attack her corruption record. Allowing the media to ordain her our new savior. Feminism, and Equality for all! Bleh. You should know this after seeing how the last two elections went with establishment GOP goons who sold their loss about as well as professional wrestlers.

       It's not like that pedo rings exist and get busted often, it's not that theres billionaire Jeffery Eipstein with his pedo lolita express plane and pedo island, its not like theres a boiok called The Franklin Coverup, it's not like theres a documentary called Conspiracy of Silence, it's not like theres a movie called Spotlight that covers pedo preists, its not like theres a movie called Eyes Wide Shut, it's not like there are police forces and intelligence angencies protecting pedo rings, its not like theres many people coming forward claiming to be raped by politicians and other global elites as children... oh wait...

       Edit: It's also not like big dogs throw underlings under the bus and have investigations called off whenb they hit close to home either...
