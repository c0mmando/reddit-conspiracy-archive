       Used to be corrupt, still corrupt, used to be corrupt too.  MSM is a left vs right shit show.  The only reason to check in on them to see the angles they are playing.  Look at the few families that own what we see every day.  No, the revolution will not be televised.  Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.

       You're stupid.  If you think citizens can actually change anything with violent uprisings, check the military spending of the US.

       If we go violent, we are fucked.  Martial law, NSA monitoring, and gun crackdowns galore.  Then things will undoubtedly get worse, if we ever move back to democracy.

       Exactly.  I'm with this sub on some things, but to say it's weird that Trump is losing is just stupid.  He's the only person who has ever run for president that is more disliked than Clinton, of course he's going to get more negative press.  Clinton has gotten dogged this cycle, too.

       Hillary supporters are the type of people that think everything is just peachy and not to worry about the truth because the elites have our best interest in mind and we are crazy for worrying about such things.

       Ok.  Let me break this down for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I am not a Hillary supporter.  I didn't vote for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump isn't an elite?  He's a billionaire.  If he wins, the elites will continue to get away with awful things, just different things than the ones that Hillary has gotten away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you're crazy for worrying about it.  I don't think the Democrats think so, either.  They were asking for the emails to be released, and I think that request was genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a lot of collusion in the DNC to get Hillary elected.  This doesn't necessarily reflect on the government.  The DNC is corrupt as shit, but they're a separate entity, and will continue to run things however they want unless they're put under a microscope.  I think they should be completely overhauled, but in a way that makes sure people who play fair will be put in their place.  I think that's very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make it about Red vs Blue is stupid, nothing is ever going to change if these parties continue to get the majority of the votes.  They will expect that the next election will be the same, and will put up a corrupt-as-shit candidate knowing that the other party will do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get sucked in to the us vs them narrative, and downvote me for stating facts.  Both candidates suck ass, and anyone who thinks that theirs is good just because the other is worse is just fooling themselves.  If Hillary gets elected, I will be among the first to line up outside the White House pressing for her impeachment.  If Trump wins, I'll just move.

       I'm not even voting for Trump.  I just think there is a better chance of Trump blowing shit up from the inside.  Hillary will be a guaranteed continuation of the status quo while trying to disarm private citizens.  I prefer a wildcard to that.

       Trump's not a perfect person, but he's literally the only anti-establishment candidate we've ever had. He's the only opportunity for substantial change we have ever received. Every candidate is a gamble. We don't know what to expect, but with Hillary we have a pretty good idea with her extensive political record. Plus, she's being investigated by the FBI! She can potentially be charged with TREASON, yet some people still think she's good for our country. That is mind-numbingly stupid. It's the sort of story you'd hear from a third-world dictatorship.

       might make you think of third world countries a little more.  I mean, that's military dictator 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the calls on his side to limit freedoms of the press, slanderous speech, and internet rights, as well as the "stop and frisk, then take the guns away from the bad guys", personal attacks against critics, speech of "being able to get away with anything", shooting someone in the street, and taking liberties with women.

       edit - Plus, if you really think he's the only anti-establishment candidate we've ever had, you're a freaking lunatic or you turned 18 this election cycle.  He isn't even really anti-establishment, he loves anyone who supports him, and he'll be thoroughly pro-establishment as soon as he's a part of it.

       Okay,
       <em>
        first-world
       </em>
       dictatorship... Is that better? Not many of those around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't the only one calling for Clinton to be imprisoned. Hell, he wasn't even the first person to say it... But most importantly, she actually does deserve to be imprisoned, or at the very least disqualified from taking office. He'd resemble a dictator if such a call for an imprisonment were unjust, but she has certainly broken the law and most definitely lied under oath. And anyways, saying she'd be in jail if he were president was just a snappy comeback during the debate. What he actually threatened her with was the announcement that if he is to be elected, he is going to appoint a special investigative team to look into her emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limit freedom of the press? With the exception of Fox News and a few small conservative outlets, Clinton essentially
       <em>
        owns
       </em>
       the press. Not only are they blatantly anti-Trump, but they won't report on most of Clinton's wrongdoings, and those that they do mention, they try to portray as baseless and silly. A nation in which guns are banned and the media is controlled by the government, is very similar to a dictatorship. North Korea, for example, has those same characteristics. Trump recognizes that the media is already largely controlled by a single party, and wants to change that by basically saying, "play fair or don't play at all."
      </p>
      <p>
       As for limiting slanderous speech, the left (Clinton) are already censoring those who oppose them. Have you been on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       lately? Post something negative about Clinton and see what happens. Facebook is censoring right-wing news sources. Twitter is removing anti-Hillary hashtags. YouTube is limiting the view count on anti-Hillary videos. The amount of censorship and propaganda we've seen this election cycle is unbelievable, and it's not coming from Trump's side. If she has this much power as a
       <em>
        candidate
       </em>
       , just imagine what she could do as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop and Frisk is essentially profiling. In other words, somebody looks suspicious, so they are treated accordingly. People don't like the sound of it, but it's useful. Appearance says a lot about a person. Also, how they act, how they talk, what they say, what they listen to, who they hang out with, etc. If somebody looks like trouble, is it really better to wait until they commit a crime and then later on say, "Ya know, I had a feeling he'd do something like that"? If somebody who is stopped and frisked has done nothing incriminating, then they have nothing to worry about. Now, can this method be abused? Yes, as can just about anything, in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal attacks against critics... Well, uh... Yeah. Most of them are fucking assholes. I've lost so much respect for so many different people this election who are critical of Trump, and it's often because they're either hypocrites, liars, or propagandists. They call Trump a bully and then proceed to make fun of his appearance or his supporters. Hillary herself called us "deplorable." Real unifying words there, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is (or was) a womanizer. Did anyone actually think otherwise. He even publicly confessed in an interview years ago (with Howard Stern, I think) to having committed adultery in the past. After that bus tape came out, he stated, "I never claimed to be a perfect person." Think about this for a second... Trump openly confessed to having committed adultery in the past, where as Bill Clinton lied to the American people (numerous times) about his affairs, and was subsequently impeached. Hillary Clinton chose to stay married to Bill, the serial adulterer, yet still attempts to shame Trump. Either way, an adulterer is going to be in the White House. I mean, people like JFK, and he was probably a worse adulterer than both Bill and Trump... Well, maybe not Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me being a lunatic, I'm not the one pretending to be some sort of psychic. If he were pro-establishment, he'd have more support from his own party.

       Your justifications for his actions make my head hurt.  I can't believe the amount of mental gymnastics you're going through to genuinely believe giving this guy your vote is the right thing.

       Stop and frisk is not constitutional, so even though you have deemed it useful, though you are a great and wise leader, it's not legal.  It's like waterboarding, it might get useful results sometimes, but it's not worth the loss of rights.  I'll never agree with it, so next "point".

I would insult Donald's, but he doesn't have any besides a wall and immigration policy that he's not really sure about, deportation squads that would cost fucking enormous amounts of taxpayer money, public works (yes, that's helpful, and specific.  Great words, Donald.  And very conservative, almost FDR conservative), and ISIS is bad.

       The womanizing argument is not solely against Bill. Hillary has been attacking Trump's womanizing past while simultaneously choosing to remain married to a womanizer herself. In other words, she's being a hypocrite by acting like his past actions are unforgivable.
      </p>

       Pence is a politician, sure... But he seems to be more of a strategic addition than anything. Two non-politicians on one ticket would have likely resulted in even less support from the GOP than they are already receiving.

       Trump has more policies than you give him credit for. I assume you probably don't look too in depth to them though, considering you've already made up your mind about him. How about his plan to impose congressional term limits? A move that would certainly help prevent the continuation of government corruption and idleness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say Donald's supporters must be paid, but Clinton has CTR, and recently, popular YouTubers have been coming out saying that the Clinton campaign offered them money to make pro-Hillary/anti-Trump statements in their videos. There is also video evidence that the Clinton campaign has paid homeless and mentally unstable people to incite violence at Trump rallies, and more video evidence in which the Clinton campaign is offering $300 rebates to  people living in halfway houses if they vote for Clinton, and if that's not disgusting enough, they claim that they will only receive the money if Clinton wins. Also, there is actual financial record of the Clinton campaign paying protestors.
      </p>

       You're smiling "intensely at my anguish"? Jesus. You don't have a boner too, do you?

      <p>
       I love that you address my insults, and then try to counter them with an insult of your own... Followed by desperate attempts to convince me that you are smarter than I am by following your comments up with "lol." Am I supposed to believe that you're so intellectually superior to me that my "ignorance" is literally making you laugh? And how arrogant does somebody have to be to type out the word "yawn?" Also, how'd you go from thinking I was 18 to thinking I'm 40?

       Actually, pretty great.  It was way more satisfying than expected to see Hillary lose, and most pro-Trump supporters shut up immediately after they heard him say the words "work together," and some have already turned on him.  I no longer doubt that the rest will, once they realize the rest of his platform was just pandering too.

       And really, it's not like you didn't lose.  We all lost!

       Same stuff happened during Bush's 2nd term election against Kerry. I had so many friends saying they were going to move to Canada if Bush won, and not 1 of them actually did.

      <p>
       Same thing probably happened during his first election against Gore, but I was 16 at the time and since I couldn't vote anyway I didn't pay a ton of attention.

       I only really started paying attention to politics a year later when I was 17 and 9/11 happened.

       As far as I know Paul Allen is very far removed from MS (other than having a large financial stake). He's been out doing his own thing for quite some time now.

       Absolutely true, and the ironic thing is that the MSM is what Trump used in the primaries to get untold millions worth of free advertising dollars. They were covering him non-stop when they all thought it was a joke. As soon as it got real in the last few months, especially the last 2 months or so, it became clear they are all terrified of him and the bias became so obvious. I honestly think it could backfire on the MSM. Alex Jones has been saying this for a while now.

       They did that stuff because the Clinton campaign told them to legitimize bad Republicans like Trump. That was literally an active strategy of the Clinton camp. Exposed by Wikileaks, but largely ignored it seems. probably because pro-Trump people wouldn't like hearing about it and they're generally the loudest anti-Clinton folk. Read this:

       If not for Clinton making it happen, the Republicans probably would have nominated someone else. They almost managed it even with unprecedented free advertising from the Clinton-controlled media.

       9/11/2016, HRC drunk or sick and passes out in a near coma on video, has to be picked up and thrown into her black ambulance/hearse, this was seen by 100s of millions both domestically and worldwide.

       then they bring out Teresa and the other woman to play HRC for the camera, its 100% obvious that HRC is sick, too sick to run for POTUS, let alone be POTUS.

       I don't think so. I've been listening to him since he was on shortwave and selling DVDs on a site that looked like it was made on geocities. His message has always been good.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can generally tell the good in something by the content of the message. Alex tells you to go research yourself. CNN says don't listen to anyone but us. Alex's message tells you to be active and think, prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Just common sense shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people like to call that fear mongering, though. For those people, if the fear finds them, they will be helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt very many people would be questioning 9/11 if it weren't for Alex. Despite the fact that people still believe the obviously absurd official story. He's done a lot of good work to be called a "fucking joke." What have you done?

       How has he been whoring himself out? Because he makes money to expand? That's how it works in the real world. Must work. You can't fault someone for making money. If he's not making money he can't do what he does. He has to flip burgers or stock shelves 8 hours a day.

       If only. It's too close. Some serious action needs to take place, and then the there needs to be enough time for the MSM to be forced to run with it before it will influence voters.

       Only action will get noticed. I've just watched multiple reports on MSM about increased police presence for "suspected" terror attacks before the election. I'm not advocating anything, I'm just critically thinking about what I am being presented with and why.

       I believe that all the rumors are true. Too many predictions have been too accurate for it to make sense that somehow only these latest ones are false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those same sources are saying that despite the DOJ being totally corrupt, there are apparently NYC DA's and investigators who are prepared to indict or release all evidence. If either of these options were to occur, there would be serious potential for unrest in the country, due to how explosive and irrefutable the evidence apparently is, and how asleep most of the country has been. Therefore, the faction of disaffected law enforcement and other agents who have coalesced under Trump would logically prefer not to take this road since the more peaceful transition would involve Hillary stepping down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Brett Baier and others had sources saying "indictments were imminent", then went radio silent for close to 24 hours, then completely walked back their statements, to me says that a deal was made, and they have decided that, for the time being, the right decision is to continue the charade for the useful idiots in order to usher in a peaceful transition of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       My prediction is that Hillary will resign for "health reasons", potentially within hours. Negotiations are likely ongoing about details like who exactly gets thrown under the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the end though, other fights loom, depending on how much the Trump/law enforcement coalition actually does insist on cleaning house.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, unlike most predictions, these ones will be definitively confirmed or not in short order.

       But what if that IS the plan? To create civil unrest by letting those 2 candidates get so far in a presidential election, then saw distrust and show the world a little fraction of the corrupt system that is in place, to show them things so horrible and disgusting that they exactly do what you said and go to the streets, revolt and get rid of the perpetrators while in fact this is all just a shit show to make you feel you did the right thing while in reality they either continue to do what they did for years/decades/centuries or even get stronger through this?

       But then he would have to shut down Breitbart and similar propaganda papers on the right as well. Unless of course that's the idea and at that point its really more silencing the opposition than anything else.

       fall back on the Russian plot when being put in the tough spot. Did they give you a sort of manual or something with a decision tree that tells you what to do in case A ("Tell he's a Russian operative") or case B ("Tell he's a Putin agent")?

       Has anyone considered that it's not a "there's 2 sides to it" kind of thing, but that it's a standard corrupt politician running against an insane corrupt business celebrity who doesn't know what he's doing and is making things up as he goes? Like pretty much every reasonable person saw through this a year ago, but now that it's a 2-person race we have to be positive about him to be balanced?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you please take a step back and look at this? Most of the Bernie supporters (like myself) are begrudgingly voting for Hillary because it's the only realistic option to prevent potential disaster, but all these people who realized Trump was an idiot when he started running are now passionately supporting him when he hasn't changed at all. I don't see what's Orwellian about pointing out that we probably shouldn't make an incredibly incompetent overgrown child the leader of the free world. If Jared Fogle (while still imprisoned) were running against Trump, there wouldn't be two sides to it either. There's an obviously better option.

       Can I ask for your reasons? What policies particularly were you in favor of? Because the policy differences between Sanders and Trump are pretty huge. Just curious, not an American so trying to focus on policy rather than just the scandals on either side.

       Yeah Hillary will suck. But it's in every way better than what Trump would bring us. There's no contest here. Like I said, I'd vote for Hillary over Trump the same way I'd vote for Trump over Jared Fogle. There's clearly a better option even if they both suck. If that means "I'll reap what I've sewn" I'm ok with that.

       The one thing I do agree on is that Trump disrupts a political system that needs to be disrupted. But there are far, far better ways that could be done and people it could be done through. There's limits to that if that's what you want, and Trump should exceed that limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's a continuation of what we already know goes on. At least with her as president, the status quo can be maintained and we can protest and fight against her. We know how things go with her type in charge, and we can put up someone better to beat her in 2020. A Trump presidency is not just a protest to the political elite, it's potential ruination of domestic and foreign policy with someone in charge who consistently demonstrates an unprecedented blatant level of ignorance and incompetence.

       How could Trump ruin foreign relations? By exactly what you're saying. We keep careful alliances with middle eastern countries for more reasons than oil and small donations. I don't like it either, but have you considered the ramifications of breaking them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of corruption we've seen from Hillary is pretty much what I expected, and if anything less than I expected, considering the extent to which we've been able to look at her behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I understand we've been active in bombing campaigns. I think the right thing to do is temporarily ally with Assad and fight him through diplomatic means later. But ISIS is also on the verge of collapse, and it's looking to happen without an all-out invasion. Hillary, at most, is only leading us to diplomatic breakdowns with Russia. Neither her or Putin are interested in a war. She's experienced and politically intelligent, a no-fly zone would likely not lead to anything if actually implemented. Trump, on the other hand, goes to the extreme in our fight against terror. Whether or not he's used in recruiting videos (afaik, he has been recently), he's exactly what drums up anti-American support among terrorist groups. The tactics he wishes to use are the same things we've tried and know only make things worse, except in movies. Not to mention he could be easily provoked by empty threats by powers like North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with congressional term limits. Trump wouldn't have sole power to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary/Kaine wouldn't reboot the system. But the point isn't to reboot the system into chaos and turn our country into a joke. We can fight against them while they're in office, elect the right people in congress, and kick them out when the time comes. Disrupting the system is a positive I will admit came out of the Trump campaign, but we now have a movement to continue it, and we're not forced to put literally one of the most incompetent, idiotic, and easily-influenced people like him in office to make things happen.

       In my view the only realistic option to prevent potential disaster is to NOT elect Clinton. Trump is an idiot beyond any doubt, but Clinton is a proven psychopath and mass murderer. Between the idiot and the psychopath, I choose the idiot easily.

       Clinton probably never actually had political/legal/whatever opponents killed. We know Clinton isn't the literal butcher of Benghazi, you can take a reasonable look at what happened there. The only actually proven thing about her is that she's a mildly corrupt establishment politician who panders to things she doesn't care about and has some bad high-profile allies. She's exactly the type we should get out of our political system, but she'll get us by. (are we going to ignore the rumors about Trump, too? there are enough stories with flimsy evidence to portray him as a literal psychopath as well)
      </p>
      <p>
       But even disregarding all that, let's call Hillary a psychopath and murderer - no, I strongly disagree. A psychopath is selfish but rarely actually chaotic. An idiot can mess with more than our freedoms. Not to mention being strongly susceptible to manipulation by the exact type you're worried about.

       She probably used the email server for convenience. It's almost impossible for someone in such a position to do their job in the modern era without that. I really, really don't care about it that much. I don't see how anyone who's been in a coma for the past few years, without any media or social influence, could wake up and hear that and not be like "ok did anything important happen?"
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't even know if her email has been breached, it's still only rumors. What isn't a rumor is that the state department servers have been breached. Everything is susceptible (gmail, btw, is actually pretty strong on security if the user has the right practices). In the end it's a matter of protocol so long as she didn't directly allow someone access who shouldn't have it. I don't really care about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you DO think this thing (which multiple high-level people on both sides in our government have done) is that important, she's still an infinitely better option than the alternative.

       Yeah. I don't disagree with that. It sucks, but she's still infinitely better than the alternative. I'm not going to look at that and move to the extreme right-wing incompetent idiot.

       I think there's a collective guilt building up about who will get empowered in this country/internationally if Trump were to win, the social freedoms and equality that might recede, the fact that ISIS, the european far right, and his American supporters all seem to be coming from the same anti-US establishment school. His campaign has thrived on labeling big media as untrustworthy, in Hillary's pocket, rendering truth itself unstable...instead, here, get the real scoop from such bastions of partisan-free, objective thought like Foxnews, breitbart, fucking Alex Jones, and a man who's been the figurehead of a hacker group bent on destabilizing any situation they don't like, good old Julian.

       I too voted Sanders in light of Clinton's neoliberal centrism, and now find myself somehow defending her and her clan against the cynicism of everyone else. I want to believe all the conspiracies, but even then I know that a guy like Trump, with all the types who support/have created his whole campaign/will run his policy, basically represents a perfect nightmare...one the rest of the world seems to happily want.

       Thank you for a reasonable post. We've gotten to the point where Trump and his supporters can literally just say shit and make stuff up, and non-partisan fact checks are considered attacks and part of the liberal media paid by the Clinton campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end of your statement is where I don't understand why no one else here sees this. We know Trump is an idiot. Even if Clinton is guilty of half the accusations against her, the same types who are like her (and even worse) are standing behind Trump. Trump can be manipulated and influenced by made-up graphs/pictures from random twitter accounts. You think the republican establishment can't do that to him with ease?

       I think he's fallen in with a camp he knows can help to get him elected, with all their built-in target markets and extremist reactions to extremism. Conservative radio's spent decades mounting their ranks for this exact opportunity. He's conformed to their rhetoric and tactics perfectly, it's a mutually beneficial situation, a "good deal" you might say. Fearmongering and muckraking are nothing new to politics or to grown adults losing their shit on messageboards all night. The leftist lean of the US domestically has wounded the white christian nationalist, turning paranoia back to your classic One World Government, aka ruthless international socialism, loss of liberty (capitalism), etc.

       Anyway, that's how I'm viewing things now. I've been obsessed with the far right this election, mostly cause I didn't know how intelligent, widespread, and wounded it was, and how this all looks like pending revenge of some kind. Do they think that liberals want more psychos and terrorists in this country? We want to heal, they want to ban. Maybe they're right to be afraid, but isn't that the definition of "letting the extremist's win?" Sure sounds like it.

       Do a damned google search for criticism of Alex Jones and judge for yourself.  It's out there and most of the examples show reasonable explanations that defuse his crazy spin on things.
