<p>Assange himself characterizes this as the most significant email in the entire collection. Essentially it is an email b/t podesta and clinton which acknowledges, in 2014, that the governments of saudi arabia, qatar, and others are the direct benefactors of ISIS. As head of state department, Clinton continues to provide aid and arrange weapons sales to these countries, and they, in turn donate massive amounts to the clinton foundation. </p>

<p>As a result of Clinton&#39;s policies, hundreds of thousands in Syria are dead. Syria is basically destroyed, with millions fleeing their homes. </p>

<p>But, if yall wanna go on and on about a piece of satanic performance art, with no evidence that anyone was actually harmed, by all means go ahead. </p>

<p>While not technically &quot;news&quot;, as most of us have understood for a while now that ISIS is a creation of US allies, this bit of information is clear incontrovertible proof that Clinton knew it at the time that her own policies were enabling it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make it seem like people took a break and paraded around for almost 24hrs. People were still looking through while others who aren&#39;t as dedicated to look through information are helping spread others research work around. #SpiritCooking wasn&#39;t disinfo. It&#39;s a psychological weapon. It has these effects: red-pill the public (since it&#39;s easier to digest; satan ritual and pedo is bad = simple vs. multiple pages of info on why gov is bad = long &amp; confusion) and makes them question things thus allowing for us and r/td to be able to present more information and motivates bystanders/online volunteers to look into the emails more. </p>

<p>Are we trying to find the truth and: a) keep to ourselves or b) using this grand opportunity to reveal hard truths?</p>

<p>On one hand, by promoting this we have shown that painting in blood and dabbling with the occult is an actual thing directly connected to a major Party&#39;s <strong>presidential</strong> candidate. By making people aware of this, and as importantly by presenting evidence to prove it, more people are likely to be receptive to evidence about major issues we have with <em>other</em> official narratives and facades. </p>

<p>Are you saying that the truth is secondary to getting people on your side?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that exactly what the Clinton campaign&#39;s goals are? i.e. dismiss email scandals, hide the truth and get people on side at all costs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the term you&#39;re looking for is reasonable doubt. If you can&#39;t prove something beyond reasonable doubt, then you can&#39;t convict someone of a crime...</p>

<p>No court would, on the &#39;evidence&#39; we&#39;ve seen so far, find Clinton guilty of Satanism - even if it were a crime. Same for pedophilia. </p>

<p>So far the only evidence I&#39;ve seen thus far is that the Clinton&#39;s flew to an island several times where a convicted pedophile was living. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Does that mean everyone who visited that island were all there for the same reason and had knowledge of what was going on? Because that&#39;s the leap you&#39;re taking... which would therefore mean Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss and even Donald Trump along with the Clinton&#39;s are all guilty by association...</p>

<p>Now granted, given Bill&#39;s past and the number of trips we know he made, it&#39;s entirely reasonable to make the leap... but there&#39;s still no &#39;proof&#39; of anything... </p>

<p>In fact if you&#39;re looking for proof of something, this is a direct quote from Trump in 2002 which indicates he knows the type of guy Epstein is / was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and <strong>many of them are on the younger side</strong>. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot; <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which one could argue is more damning than the &#39;evidence&#39; against the Clintons as it&#39;s a direct quote from Trump on Epstein confirming their relationship and acknowledging the fact that Trump knew Epstein liked young women. Again, no court would find Trump guilty of anything for saying that but it&#39;s a more damning piece of evidence than anything I&#39;ve seen so far on the Clinton&#39;s in relation to Epstein...</p>

<p>I keep hearing there&#39;s more evidence, but I haven&#39;t seen it so at this stage you have to call bluff and say it&#39;s scaremongering... what would be the point in <em>not</em> releasing that kind of information as soon as possible to the public if you wanted justice / didn&#39;t want Clinton in office?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence
assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia,
which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and
other radical Sunni groups in the region. This effort will be enhanced by
the stepped up commitment in the KRG. The Qataris and Saudis will be put
in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to
dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. By
the same token, the threat of similar, realistic U.S. operations will serve
to assist moderate forces in Libya, Lebanon, and even Jordan, where
insurgents are increasingly fascinated by the ISIL success in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a copy/paste from Clinton&#39;s email. Read this and tell me again that Clinton is <em>for</em> assisting ISIS. Clinton is interested in putting pressure on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and I know it because she wrote it. Moreover Clinton is interested in helping the KRG, the Kurdish government, which is another faction in Iraq and Syria <em>opposing</em> ISIS.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em> Clinton knew that Sunni governments are helping ISIS. She was the secretary of state when Trump was firing people on TV. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/isis/1.693831">It&#39;s not much of a secret either</a> and people who e.g pay attention to the news know all about it.</p>

<p>America has pursued a policy of calling the Sunni regimes in the Middle East &quot;our allies&quot;  and offer them aid in order to increase American influence in those regimes. It doesn&#39;t mean that America condone&#39;s their playing with militant Islam, it means the opposite. You have an email in your hand detailing Clinton&#39;s play to pressure Saudi Arabia not to aid ISIS and you still write that it&#39;s all her fault.</p>

<p>Edit: Approving an arms deal with them can easily be a carrot-and-stick approach. I&#39;ve found an analysis <a href="http://susris.com/2010/09/17/us-saudi-security-cooperation-impact-of-arms-sales/">here</a> but I&#39;ve yet to read it entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well besides the fact that selling influence is already corruption, it&#39;s made worse by the fact the deals were made with countries that support terrorism. No, she does not explicitly support them. However, she does support countries that support them, that much is clear. What difference is there really? If you really wanted to say she had no idea or intention of this, then you&#39;d at the bare minimum say she &quot;inadvertently&quot; supported ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She explicitly doesn&#39;t support terrorism. She explicitly mentioned pressuring Saudi Arabia and Qatar not to support ISIS, and helping the Kurds, which also fight ISIS, and she wrote that there needs to be decisive victories against ISIS, which since then have been achieved. This is not coming from the news, this is coming from a leak on Wikileaks. You need to do huge amounts of cherry picking to arrive at &quot;Clinton helped ISIS&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. Nowhere does it say she explicitly supports terrorism. Maybe she didn&#39;t even end up accidentally funding ISIS. Who knows. But what we do know is that she gave favors to countries (like Qatar and SA) that donated to the Clinton foundation while she was secretary. Everything beyond that is superfluous. </p>

<p>edit: and whether she funded them or not, it&#39;s not a good look is it?</p>

<p>Which is just false and is demonstrated to be false in OP, which is an interesting property for a top comment.</p>

<p>Regarding the Clinton Foundation, honestly I don&#39;t know enough about it to make an informed comment. Maybe this part of the story is actual corruption. If you have actual sources, e.g from leaks or reputable media, I&#39;d love to see them.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow bombshell Clinton knew that ISIS was supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar&quot; is really silly, given that I knew about it because I was paying attention to the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much of a secret, I agree. Have been aware of this for years now. I guess I&#39;m let down that this is what Assange believed(?) would put Clinton in jail. I had hoped there would be more.</p>

<p>Sure she&#39;s a big part of the mess in Syria, but its more of an indictment of general US mideast policy for the last three decades, wherein the US funds radicals for short term geopolitical adventures then must prosecute wars and occupations when these same groups seem to invariably turn against US interests.</p>

<p>The US has funded sunni governments openly and also radical groups both openly and covertly. To pretend that all of this has been to &quot;increase influence&quot; in order to rein in the terrorism and violence is, I think, naive. This has always been about resource control/exploitation.</p>

<p>US actions in the mideast over the last 3 decades have led to millions of deaths, destruction of entire countries, refugee crises, etc. It&#39;s truly a genocidal scale event that we have been witnessing. The real satanism and true evil is the fact that those who pull the strings don&#39;t seem to care about these human beings. What really depresses me is that western people can&#39;t seem to prioritize this properly. We are sitting by and watching this stuff happen, year after year, and the only time people at the helm are seriously threatened in their power is as a result of personal sex scandal, or this latest satanism &quot;scandal&quot; that signifies nothing.</p>

Its puzzling why wikileaks retweeted it at all, when the only goal of it is to scare naive religious voters towards Trump. </p>

<p>If wikileaks wants to effect the election why wasnt there a bombshell or all the emails released this week which would be a KO punch to Hillary? Its fishy and makes me wonder if theyre compromised since that blackout.</p>

<p>Heres a scary thought: what if the fix is in on the voting machines and she is winning, wiki is gotten to,  now theyre just toying with people sending them on wild goose chases about the occult, all the easier to dismiss us as loonies after the election.</p>

<p>Question is, can it be done and presented to the MASSES OF VOTERS BEFORE TUESDAY???</p>

<p>No fucking way. Even if inculpatory evidence COULD be compiled and presented in language that the masses MIGHT understand, there is NO WAY that they could absorb and assimilate that information in time to have a decisive effect on Tuesday&#39;s outcome.</p>

<h1>NO WAY.</h1>

<p>So for the time being, focus on what CAN be absorbed and assimilated by the busy and distracted John and Jane Citizens: The documented corruption, collusion and conspiracy by and between the Hillary staff, the DNC and the current administration to cheat against and DESTROY the Sanders campaign; to insert firebrands and agent provocateurs into Trump events, and all verifiably related scurrilous activities.</p>

<p><strong>THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE</strong> is to keep the Witch from returning to the Castle, where the POWERS she represents will be exponentially magnified. </p>

<p>Once the objective is achieved, we will be able to move froward, at OUR leisure, to present a damning and fatal blow to the pedophile rings that MUST be taken down, and the participants judiciously dispatched.</p>

<p>I mean, anyone who&#39;s been legitimately studying this stuff for even a decade understands that when studying them, it is impossible to go for long without coming back to that topic. It goes hand in hand with them, and in all actuality, is a some-what direct explanation of why they even do what they do.</p>

<p>P.S. the pizza shit is distraction for sure. The Occult stuff is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To regular peeps getting up this morning there were 2 interesting stories.
Assange drops his trailer for the interview and the Podesta satanic spirit cooking stuff.</p>

<p>Did anyone pay attention to which one went viral? While Assange dropped an important message the satanic memes filled social network.</p>

<p>As wrong as it might seem the #SpiritCooking caught, went viral, and seemed to bother people at a base level. I would prefer to see Hillary taken down for her connections to ISIS but if it&#39;s #EatMyPain that gets the message out we might be electing a loony toons, well, I&#39;ll take that. 
And memes are to damn easy to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding me? I love #spiritcooking.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: Clinton&#39;s guilty to Sunday when it comes to the legitimate crimes and allegations. But at this point with a mere 5 days before they cast their ballot, no voter can digest the complexity. As an example, go to the mall and ask, &quot;what&#39;s Teneo?&quot; and just look at their response.</p>

<p>Spirit cooking on the other hand... it&#39;s catchy, edgy, and about to introduce a whole lot of people to the more legitimate creepy side of politics and the occult (and those valid connections do exist, independent of whether or not this is it). </p>

<p>And besides that, investigative research isn&#39;t mutually exclusive: different groups can work on different things, and that&#39;s okay. </p>

<p>Edit: And let&#39;s remember--it was Bill Clinton&#39;s sordid and tawdry affair with Lewinsky that sunk him, even though there were SO many other incriminating issues. How he didn&#39;t serve time for selling secrets to China is beyond me. So if it&#39;s something stupid like Spirit Cooking that ultimately cooks the Clinton camp, then so be it. </p>

<p>They&#39;re clearly past roman emperor levels of insanity, why wouldn&#39;t they be? you could just as easily say wikileaks are controlled leaks that are being used to cause an easily steered revolution, like what happened a century ago</p>

If this info would have come out last year there might be enough time to connect her to some kind of child - stealing pedo ring,  but with the time constraints all it can show is that she has really poor taste in who she&#39;s associating with.   How the fuck did podesta get so far with all the naked pictures of kids in his house? </p>

While the spirit cooking thing is weird and disgusting, this is not some satanic ritual it&#39;s just rich people hiring a performance artist to to weird and disgusting shit (and anybody who knows performance art knows that it is entirely based on doing weird and disgusting shit and rich people are willing to pay for that). There is so much worse shit associated with Hillary than this, focus on THAT. Don&#39;t let happen to the Hillary scandals what happened to the 9/11 conspiracy, where idiots come up with stories about holograms and dustification and discredit the entire concept of a conspiracy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1JnrEUxiJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1JnrEUxiJY</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is absolutely correct. Marina Abramović&#39;s work is regularly shown at MoMA in New York. She has an international following. It isn&#39;t surprising she&#39;s been given money to make art or support her initiatives. </p>

<p>Which doesn&#39;t in any way distract from the many revelations of criminal, unethical, and manipulative financing by Podesta for Clinton. And Hillary Clinton herself. </p>

<p>We only need to connect our political pedo ring to the rest and maybe we can have our first and only chance to get a leg up on this well-known evil.</p>

<p>Question is, can it be done and presented to the MASSES OF VOTERS BEFORE TUESDAY???</p>

<p>No fucking way. Even if inculpatory evidence COULD be compiled and presented in language that the masses MIGHT understand, there is NO WAY that they could absorb and assimilate that information in time to have a decisive effect on Tuesday&#39;s outcome.</p>

<h1>NO WAY.</h1>

<p>So for the time being, focus on what CAN be absorbed and assimilated by the busy and distracted John and Jane Citizens: The documented corruption, collusion and conspiracy by and between the Hillary staff, the DNC and the current administration to cheat against and DESTROY the Sanders campaign; to insert firebrands and agent provocateurs into Trump events, and all verifiably related scurrilous activities.</p>

<p><strong>THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE</strong> is to keep the Witch from returning to the Castle, where the POWERS she represents will be exponentially magnified. </p>

<p>Once the objective is achieved, we will be able to move froward, at OUR leisure, to present a damning and fatal blow to the pedophile rings that MUST be taken down, and the participants judiciously dispatched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, the reality is we can&#39;t prove this link is real. There are pedos in all walks of life, in all industries - not just in positions of power / status.</p>

<p>If this is as common as people say it is, why don&#39;t we have more evidence? Why is more damning evidence supposedly being held by NYPD? Where are all of these bombshell leaks we keep hearing about that will get Clinton locked up? Weren&#39;t we promised big things today. November 5th??</p>

<p>Any idiot can claim someone is a pedophile and say trusted anonymous sources gave him info - it doesn&#39;t mean we should take it at face value. There have been similar accusations about Trump which get instantly dismissed... it&#39;s not a level playing field in my opinion and we should be looking for / demanding more evidence before connecting people to this shit and celebrating it as fact / truth or some sort of justice when the reality is it&#39;s just a theory...</p>
