        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Moir53.html">Moir53</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all, wishing you well during this time of death and rebirth, the season of Samhain is upon us. Protect your energy well as the veil is thin during this time. </p>

<p>Firstly, I would like to start this thread by stating the intention of increased awareness, alternate perspectives, as well as deeper understanding of self and cosmic community.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping for this thread to stay open-minded, engaging, and perhaps to cause some questioning in regards to ones own ego structure placed on &quot;reality as we know it&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>First and foremost</strong>, this reality has been hijacked. During a certain <em>moment</em> within our collective, unified consciousness reality, there birthed an anomaly. This anomaly, going unchecked, began to manifest itself through our own unheeded unconsciousness.  Through much battling and struggle, portions of collective consciousness had been deceived, or rather placed in a time/space illusion. We call this &quot;the fall&quot;, because in truth, we are all unified and connected, merely separated via illusion.</p>

<p>This consciousness has had many names and takes on many expressions, you may have heard of, such as the following -</p>

<ul>
<li>Archonic</li>
<li>Satanic</li>
<li>Vampiric</li>
<li>Demonic</li>
<li>Malevolent</li>
<li>Setian</li>
</ul>

<p>The list is endless, although the core principle of this consciousness is the same. It seeks destruction and perversion of all that is pure and true. Although considered a consciousness, it is more of an anomaly in the sense that it has no concept of <em>soul</em>, lacks empathy, and consumes without regard.</p>

<p>Through certain means, this consciousness somehow has managed to enslave humanity through many faceted layers (not just humanity, I must add this also). We see this today in increasingly rapid numbers of exposure, from Satanic paedophelia rings, corrupt banking institutions, inverted symbols of protection, perversion of the divine masculine and feminine energies, war racketeering, shadow governments, reptilians, greys, etc. etc.</p>

<p>This is <em>THE</em> invisible war that has been waging for time immemorial. This is Ra and Set, The Christ and Satan, Mahdi and Jinn. It is very tricky to fully explain the extent of the manipulation that has occurred, so if you&#39;re still with me, I do ask that you stay open to what I am trying to present and discuss. In order to fully digest more of this, please research Gnosticism and the Archons. </p>

<p>Of course, one could and SHOULD explain that this anomaly is also a part of us (as is explained in Gnosticism). This darkness, this vampiric awareness stems from our own unconsciousness, and so, although it is a part of us or stemming from us (collectively), it is not US in our truest form.</p>

<p>Now, of course, not all is lost, and nor shall it ever be due to the eternal nature of the soul, but we are at a point in the time/space illusion in which we have an opportunity to make a choice. We&#39;ve always been at this choice, arguably as all that really exists is that in which the moment presents, but with the invention of the internet, we are really starting to become the expression of collective consciousness manifest. Think Reddit &quot;hive-mind&quot;. Even there, the polarity is visible... Those seeking for truth, and those willing to suppress it. The battle waged on in many, many layers. As above, so below.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling on all Gnostics to chime in here, those with knowledge on the astral planes, intrusion level events, vibrational shielding, shifting focus away from the anomaly and onto the solution. The more we impact the collective field, the quicker it vibrates into manifestation and unfolds physically. For those who hear, let them hear.</p>

<p>What is an Archon? - <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons02.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons02.htm</a></p>

<p>Alien Intrusion, Archons - <a href="https://www.metahistory.org/gnostique/archonfiles/AlienIntrusion.php">https://www.metahistory.org/gnostique/archonfiles/AlienIntrusion.php</a></p>

<p>Pt. 2 - <a href="http://www.metahistory.org/gnostique/archonfiles/AlienDreaming.php">http://www.metahistory.org/gnostique/archonfiles/AlienDreaming.php</a></p>

<p>Now, all perceived beings that are of subtler dimensions or guidance are not considered Archonic. When one has true experience, or Gnosis, of an Archon expression it is undeniable and indeed very distinguishable from other aspects of consciousness.</p>

<p>I know, perhaps this isn&#39;t all, I&#39;m writing purely from the top of my head here in what I&#39;ve been researching and through my own experience with them (via plant teachers such as Ayahuasca and Peyote). I&#39;m very much still a student in the Gnostic realms, but anything to get the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> discussion going. I think now, more than ever in time/space, the Archon influence is on show for all to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an experience on Ayahausca some 6 years ago in which &quot;beings&quot; i could only describe to as diabolical, tried to explain this idea to me(funny enough before i took it i asked the universe to show me the truth that i wanted to know my heart was open..ya) but I couldn&#39;t  handle what they where showing me and didn&#39;t know anything about the occult or anything outside what normal society is taught....but that experience definitely started me down a path of discovery...trust me so many things i was unable to understand or couldn&#39;t comprehend i know about now from reading and researching in my free time. Sometimes i wonder if i am crazy but i know what happened to me actually happened and ya i was under the influence of a very potent psychedelic but as the beings told me our minds are like t.v.s and the only only way to reach certain channels is to extend the antenna.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely not alone my friend, many will view these tools as purely psychoactive ingredients and pretty pictures of the subconscious on display. But one must ask the question, what IS the subconscious? Rather known as &quot;THE&quot; mind. The All.</p>

<p>Back to the Ayahuasca though, I completely understand where your coming from and you are not crazy. Each and every person has their own form of Gnosis and yours is just as valid as any others. It&#39;s also incredibly hard to recall every fine detail from a ceremony and a journey. </p>

<p>Interesting how information tends to find us rather than us finding it eh?</p>

<p>If you wish to elaborate, feel free, although we understand if it&#39;s a troubling memory. Sometimes when the veil gets ripped open like that, it can be shocking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok so i was alone and took a brave dose of ayahausca...after i had purged..i made to about my living room from the bathroom and felt something in my head pop and thought &quot;oh fuck took to much something in my brain exploded&quot; and i shit you not i look up and there was blue reptilian aliens just ...chilling.... in my living room...with me but what really tripped me out was the fact THEY noticed that i noticed them as soon i saw them and were sooo amused that i was able to see them. I literally thought What a terrible time to be getting abducted  by aliens while im tripping balls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intriguing. I&#39;m wondering what sort of experience you would have under a guided practitioner. Perhaps these beings were not demonic in essence, but rather such a shock to your ego and it&#39;s primary belief system that all it could do is label it as a threat.</p>

<p>Generally archonic energies are very draining, mindless/lifeless, very low in their vibrational frequency. Most of it wishes to destroy, or pervert what we understand. So the idea that these beings were indeed teaching in some form, makes me wonder.</p>

<p>BUT, like I said, this is your experience and you know what you felt in that moment. I know what you mean by just... Chilling. It&#39;s strange to see other etheric beings sort of just, existing, using their own freewill within their own frequency. Very strange, yet over time becomes very natural.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">7</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Moir53.html">Moir53</a> 2016-11-05</p>
    <div class="md"><p>So, as far as I know and have experienced, energy harvesting is when consciousness is focused on a single point. The more energy that is harvested (so, the more subjective points of consciousness I.E. people), or focused onto a single point or intention, the more power it gains to manifest itself into an actual physical reality.</p>

<p>The strangest experience I&#39;ve had with it is during an EDM (not techno, electronic, rave... EDM. Something I feel is much more sinister and orchestrated) festival I went to a few years back during my initial awakening. Something hit me during the experience in that I could see the actual energy coming off of the crowd, all sort of being sucked into this focal point (the stage). The stage itself was shaped like a pyramid (not just a structurally good choice, but the actual festival itself was peppered in Egyptian symbology), and that point it occurred to me... High frequencies blasted at people on substances that lift the veil or amplify the aura/energy, coupled with high intensity graphics which include subliminal symbols and words projected on a screen, all whilst everyone is in a trance like state (literally zombified, standing in perfect unison towards this focal point).</p>

<p>This was during a time when I had just received a lot of informational downloads due to an Ayahuasca retreat I had visited earlier. In time, it was clear why all of this was being shown, but at that moment I was very surprised. Not that this single event was happening, but that it had always been happening and that I was just seeing through it, to see it&#39;s essence.</p>

<p>So, in essence, I believe harvesting certain types of energy allows them to manifest certain states of reality (fear, despair, sorrow, deception). The key here, I believe though, is that if it works there, then it works for the polarity of those things (peace, love, compassion, etc.). It just depends on who has the ability to construct larger areas of harvesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found As Above So Below to be very applicable in the sense that what happens in the etheric planes, also plays out on the physical in a somewhat macro-cosmic/micro-cosmic sense. Death and Rebirth being present everywhere within the cosmos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth with a twist, i think. It implies a balance and a need for one, but the death/destruction portion of this equation is an anomaly, a misfit phenomenon which was never inherent in the original design of the universe. Time itself as a repetitive cycle is an anomaly. </p>

<p>Seeing a balance glorifies a nothing to a Something. More to the point, it glorifies death which has no power of its own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a very valid point there, although if we take out the idea of death then we have what I suppose used to be always known. The continuation of the journey, right?</p>

<p>Although, preferring eternal light to banish the dark, again implies polarity and then duality. This then would have to imply some form of balance because without one there cannot be another.. No? Tricky stuff.</p>

You cannot continue to use the <em>former</em> language of freedom and goodness and transcendence in the realm of action outside the WAR. You have to leave behind entirely the entire language of WAR itself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you see the war as occurring on &quot;many, many layers&quot; because you still see <em>truth</em> from <em>within</em> the WAR but think winning it means in some way taking the Messianic Hero and making it part of how you see yourself.</p>

<p>But taking yourself out of the WAR means you leave behind the language of messiahs and heroes, especially as you understand yourself from now on. Otherwise, thinking you&#39;re <em>now</em> on the side of goodness, righteousness, and benevolence against the side of evilness, corruption, and outright malevolence is going to ensnare you deeper into the way the WAR organizes and shapes its own limitations, even its <em>creators</em>.</p>

<p>You have to take seriously that Neo was never a human, <em>and neither was Morpheus</em>, and he has to learn how <em>his</em> dream was a lie even when <em>he was the one</em> going around telling people about the prophecy that woke him up thinking that will wake them up. People hated that second movie for a profound reason that gets obscured behind other understandable complaints: it challenges how seriously you can unlearn what you&#39;ve learned. It challenges you to take more seriously how &#39;The Brotherhood&#39; of Emmanuel Goldstein is &#39;The Party&#39; of Big Brother. They are <em>both</em> power incarnate.</p>

<p>Hear it out, feel it out, sniff and taste the air you&#39;re breathing:</p>

<p>The point is to learn how to &quot;walk away from Omelas.&quot; The point is to remove yourself from the WAR. Suicide won&#39;t get you out of this. Killing other people won&#39;t get you out, no matter how innocent that person is.</p>

<p>But maybe I&#39;m wrong. The worst to happen from adopting my perspective is that I end up doing my best to be <em>useless</em>. If you are right, then the Archons —or even just the particular kosmokratôr who has jurisdiction over me— <em>have no use for me</em>.</p>

<p>Why improve myself, become skillful in the art of WAR, and nevertheless end up their useful weapon? Why not take a different chance altogether?</p>
