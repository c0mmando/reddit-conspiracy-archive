       My roommate's mom is really religious and she said look up the throne of satan. that's what i found. Most evil thing i have ever seen. Said it was the real reasons for the crusades was to collect all the parts of it and all the holiest artifacts for themselves in italy. Another
       <a href="http://babylonrisingblog.com/images/ThroneofSatan-Zeus.jpg">
        part of it is in germany
       </a>
       when hitler stole it and was trying to gather all the parts to see if they had occult power. The vatican part i believe goes on top of it. Was originally called the throne of zeus. Some truly esoteric shit.

       Yeah the Vatican hoover that sort of stuff up. Lots of esoteric artifacts in these high, powerful places, we have The Stone of Destiny over here in the UK. You would have thought our rational scientific intelligentsia would ridicule the old orders for this stuff. Really strange.

       So, for example: The gas used to murder jews was just anti-bacterial and couldn't have killed anyone, and the hundreds of thousands(wildly exaggerated in their mind) that died by other causes inside and outside the camps, were the result of diseases, and accidents.

        The way i've heard people talk about it, they're not denying the holocaust just the scale (which has been revised a few timesin both directions since, no?) and question how people were killed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, many people outright deny it ever happened, calling it a jewish lie. So there are absolutely outright deniers. I've spoken with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People "questioning the scale and method" are also deniers in almost every case, just like in my example. They'll say that maybe 100k jews/gays/blacks etc died(questioning the scale), and that most of them died as a result of the war(diseases, cut-off of supplies and resources)... They are still holocaust deniers, since they deny the scale and method used to murder jews and others.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I've never really looked into it cos it's a fucking massive legal issue in Europe. I personally don't think Hitler gave a fuck about jews, maybe himmler did idk doubt it tho, and was just playing on racist people and xenophobia because he was manipulative as fuck
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where in Europe do you live? Because I also live in Europe, and there are zero problems with researching it where I live.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are suggesting Hitler killed 6 million jews(and hundreds of thousands of blacks/gays/Romanians/handicapped) for shits and giggles? You do realize that the hunt for jews cost a lot of resources in the form of man-power and money, right? Why the hell would he focus more and more resources on murdering jews as the war went on? Considering he was struggling in the war?

        your second part is all based on the premise that 6 million people were starved in a sophisticated extermination operation rather than less people were rounded up and simply neglected, which would take less resources.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, that's not the premise. you're either misunderstanding me or misinformed. Most of the jews of the holocaust weren't murdered via starvation at all. Some were, but a majority was murdered via gassing, mass-shooting, beating etc. That's where the chunk of the "extermination operation" took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also weren't neglected. Why do you think the allied forces and the russians didn't find millions and millions of rotten corpses? They found mass graves all over the land, but not in the scale of millions-

       will help you understand exactly what's happened to a lot of people. They are not awake and some people cannot be awoken. They have been severely conditioned to not believe reality if it does not suit their pre determined idea of what reality is, which is achieved through poor education and mass propaganda.

       That's the 50s mentality for you. Be a good citizen and don't pay attention to how bad we are getting screwed. I asked him why the state would help pay for stadiums and what they would use them for if needed. He doesn't believe it. Even though Japanese were interned in a stadium in our town and there was Katrina. He never read Noam's Manufacturing Consent.

       Have you ever seen the TED talk about why we're "smarter" in an IQ way with each generation? It's because we have to live in a world where abstractions are needed to live, and back in the day, they needed concrete examples. For instance, if you asked (and there's record of it) a person in 1901 what the difference between a bird and a fish is, they would say "nothing at all". You might say "well don't you think they're both animals?", and they would say "no. One is a bird and one is a fish". To them, hierarchical categories and classifications were completely unnecessary, because they wanted to know what you could do with a bird or a fish, and not what you could learn from them. Now we're more able to think in that way, and so our empathy is growing by leaps and bounds. I remember, when I was a kid, no one ever talked about the emotion on dogs faces, but now, my whole family, at get togethers, will sometimes remark on what my dog is feeling based on how she's acting. I think that that's really really important, but no one with any credibility has taken the time to make it into an official thing. Anyways...
      </p>
      <p>
       Have heart, because some day, we'll be the dumb ones, and the world still won't be right. We got a ways to go, and we're farther along than our parents, but we don't have
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       answer, yet, is what I was trying to say.

       You need to start attacking them when they start talking about things critically. Just yell out 'oh so you're a conspiracy theorist? You think their conspiring against you, yeah?' It has at the very least helped me in making a couple of people realize how empty of meaning the term is.

       I usually just rattle off definitions of "conspiracy" and "theory" and then say "so without the pejorative connotations that have been unfairly associated with those words; you're damn right I am. But the better choice of words is that I am a skeptic. I don't take what I am fed as fact. I do my own research and make my own conclusions."
      </p>
      <p>
       The unfortunate part is that most are unwilling to accept sources outside of their comfort zone (MSM) as actual news. "If this is true why isn't it all over the news"? Aaaand if you talk about the MSM being bought and sold? "NOT EVERYTHING IS SOME BIG CONSPIRACY".

       They both already voted. The deed is done. I will certainly not stop paying attention and have every intention of letting them know exactly what they got themselves into however.

       You guys need to do what I did. I seriously began training my family to start thinking critically about everything that happens. It starts with just a convenient youtube video playing when they enter the room. They get curious and ask, and then they sit down and watch a bit. This gets them interested, and almost everybody ive done it with has stayed to the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, I start doing the whole kindergarten teacher act and ask them a question about something they have just seen. For example, watching TV with the wife, we just learned a new term "cultural marxism". So when we see something degenerative on TV like the new hip singer flashing her ass on TV I look over to her and say "and what do we call that?" Then she replies "cultural Marxism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally I start throwing in some quotes or definitions, and do them frequently. After a few weeks of me doing this my entire family from siblings, parents, spouse, and even cousins are starting to see the bullshit around them. And now, the redpilling is spreading outside the family. The other day my father even just brought up Hillary's crimes with a complete stranger. I feel like a teacher watching the student flourish.

       Basically. It also helps that I'm a great listener (so I'm told), and can feel people's emotions on a very deep level while simultaneously remaining distant,
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       to be objective. I wouldn't say I win all the time, that would be elitists and arrogant. But, more times than not, I achieve what I set out to do (poke/plant seeds). People always come back asking for more, which I gladly welcome (and is the point - they come
       <em>
        to you
       </em>
       ).

       I feel your pain! I had that same issue. Instead of trying to convince people I just try to educate them. Sometimes they are not ready for the truth at that moment but if you plant a seed in their head it will get them thinking and maybe they will wake up! Keep spreading the truth

       If you see my previous posts here, you can see I clearly stated, there definitely IS something in the "chosen people" theory. First of all, those "chosen" people run all important facets of society, academia, banking, political influence/lobbyist/think thanks and entertainment. And media lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 0,000000000001% of "us" here discuss the problems, invest vast amounts of energy of our finite precious lives to this, pontificate, debate, we even have various level of shills on YouTube who serve as our "ideological leaders", none of which mention the "chosens" because we all know if you do that you are DONE, so we deal with varying degrees of "philosophical" gibberish and sophistry.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we waste time, they organize and go ahead with their ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can see ,their plan is going pretty well. I might be delusional and wrong, it could be that we are WAKING UP!! WE'RE WAKING UP! JUST WAIT! NOT MUCH LONGER!

       LOL. It's over, the sooner you accept it the better. Our kind, our race, is pathetic, easily seduced, prone to material shit and begging for validation in every possible way -

       This is exactly where your point fails.
We live in a world where the only people reading conspiracies were "tin foil hat" people, but that's changing, they are growing in number and diversity, due to the scope of how fucked up the world's governments and MSM has gotten. To conclude that most people doing this research and investigating are people outside of the popular demographic, is not only erroneous, but also very pessimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's just Australia (or anywhere not USA) but most people I converse with now are very aware of what is going on, and are watching attentively, people my dad's age now are opening up about how they feel that this can't keep going on.
I feel you're caught in the worldwide depression/anger. But fear not there are many of us who can see clearly and will make the right choice when it comes.

       My main complaint about the alt-right is that most of them would think most of us here are retards because we question the official government narratives of 9/11, Sandy Hook, and other major events of our time.  They are so anti-Muslim that they not only believe every hoax like the Pulse nightclub shooting, Boston bombing, and all the others, but they call you a retard if you question them.  They might not think these things are important, but if they continue accepting every fake news story that is presented just because it validates their nationalist narrative they will be easily fooled and manipulated in the future -- for example if there ends up being a false flag shooting by a "white Trump supporter" that actually does lead to gun confiscation etc.

       What if I'm not alt-right (I'm still not sure what that means), not anti-Muslim, and I never called anybody a name for questioning things, but I examined the facts in those cases and simply disagree?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a "white Trump supporter" caused an attack right now, I'd raise an eyebrow.  But if I examine the data I can find and decide it is want it appears to be - then I'm just different.  But it doesn't mean I blindly accept everything the media puts out, it doesn't mean I'm a bigot, doesn't mean I look down on people who believe in those theories. And I suspect there are a lot of people like me.

       I can. As a Canadian I see that we are almost the perfect society for globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Massive resources and a low centralized population in large cities. All the resources in the world under our feet yet no connection to the earth. No identity, massive race mixing, and a perfectly polite double think society. Hell we just voted in the most obvious pawn because he's handsome and his dad was a great globalist too. And he's a sweet drama teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gets me is Canada has a pretty awesome immigration policy yet we are all calling trump racist for wanting the same. Hell no I'm not a trump supporter. Yet the msm has the power by using one idiot to change the entire debate on any given subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's talk about immigration- your a racist. 
Let's talk about free trade- where's your tin foil. 
He's a man- sexist.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main concern is the lack of understanding to the depth of the things being done to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the afghan war for example. At first we could only understand it as a war over terror. Then slowly we started seeing it as an oil war. Then slowly we started seeing it as a war to revive opium trade. Then slowly we see it as a war for the federal reserve. Then slowly we see as a war for profiting the mititary complex. Then slowly we see it as a war to weaken and stretch the American military(strength). Then slowly we see it as a war for oil pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half those realization probably really haven't even happened yet. What I'm trying to say is the many many reasons for the war were well thought out possibly 100s of years ago, but through compartmentalization of self and state imposed thoughts we take so long to digest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now apply that to trump and Hillary. How many things were planned for this election that we don't even realize yet. Trump wasn't planted just so Hillary could win, that's just one of dozens of reasons. And Hillary was planted to win just to maintain status quo. Think critically about something then do it 10 more times and you might get somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to start channeling all the positive thing happening. We know all the bad bad shit they do. Fuck them and their evil and negativity. This sub needs to work on bringing positivity to light or else what the fucks the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to use your guns to kill each other. Our power is in doing the exact opposite of what they want. They are scared to death right now. Probably as worried as they've ever been. Mistakes are and have been made and love is winning by a landslide.
      </p>
      <p>
       We rejecting the Syrian war (pre-Isis at least) that's a win. 
We rejected the race wars the past few summers. Another win.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other wins have you seen??
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's shift our perspective because we have to.

       I'm slowly seeing people wake up to the liberal feminist movement, so it's on track to becoming a win.  With the glamourization of Trump (the hell else do you call it? lol) I see people waking up to double-speak, political correctness, and neuro-linguistics, even if it's at a subconscious level where we don't realize it

       The only time Jesus was angry in the Bible was when he threw the money changers out of the temple. That's what we're getting at here, and anger is an appropriate response. They have jilted and retarded the evolution of humanity, in both consciousness and outward social progress, for centuries. Just understand that the people around you are victims of this.

       Look inside the minds of the .01%, and you begin to see, not a complete monstrosity, but a limited perspective. They see us in the way that they see us, because
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       minds are handicapped by filters, probably to the same degree as the bullshit filtered media garbage that they feed us. It's just in a different
       <em>
        manner
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these people lived very isolated lives, just like the rest of us. Very different lives, with very different habits and values passed on through the generations, but still very isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, there's the psychopaths. Fuck them. Not every oligarch is a psychopath, but a disproportionate number of them are. They
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       and probably
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       go to some sort of hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I want to clarify what I wrote about the .01%: We tend to get into this shorthand way of talking about the issues which muddles the conversation a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every one who is rich and successful is an evil bastard. People talk about "good hard-working Americans" with adulation and respect, but they're only operating within the same paradigm that the richest 1% are operating under. It's not right to adore one group and malign another, when the only real difference between them is the size of of their treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus said it's easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven, and immediately followed that with: "but with God, all things are possible."
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is whether you're on the side of right, or wrong. Not whether you are rich or poor. It becomes an issue of rich or poor when the only way to get ahead is to tamp down your conscience and engage in activities which you know are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to say don't let my language trip you up. I talk like a sailor because I
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a sailor. I
       <em>
        enjoyed
       </em>
       being a sailor. I know when to refrain from indulging in the easy emphatic manner that certain "bad" words allow, but hey, this is Reddit. It's not like we're in "polite company".
      </p>
      <p>
       (Furthermore, some Christians have had an issue with this, but then, they are not my master, now are they?)

       I'm sorry, but who of all the world leaders has been confirmed as a child abusing atrocity?  I mean, confirmed by multiple sources with credible backing, not some random website who's copy/pasted the same exact article from another website.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you people realize how serious of an accusation this child abuse shit is.  You need concrete facts behind these sorts of accusations or else every argument this Sub creates will be equated to that of The_Donald (i.e. radical Rightism).

       We're the new world, and they're the old. Keeping that in mind makes it a little easier. They have no idea how we operate, because they're used to being spoon fed everything in the form of pushing the channel up or down on the tv, and for us, we've learned to entertain ourselves with our own directed intelligence; i.e, we ask ourselves "what do I want to learn about/entertain today", and they say "I wonder what information I'll be randomly exposed to today".

       edit: Just today I was talking with my mom at lunch about these things and although she now believes me, she said on facebook everyone is saying "this is just smear politics" and I got mad that people were starting to say podesta emails were made up.   They have DKIM cryptosigs (domainkeys)...but people don't even understand the chemistry and physics of how a plane flying into a building can't make the ground over 2000F for 3 months...so they sure as hell aren't going to get crypto hashes if they can't understand for example how wtc7 did

       fall due to fire, nor are they even aware we proved fire was an impossible source for it collapsing, as proved by physics and model-perfect advanced CAD simulation which has now moved into a prosecutorial phase with the world court.

       dude, just post something anti establishment/msm/hillary in politics or news and you will get the same reaction.  anger, denial or mocking.  these are the sleep walkers.  they are innocent.  once in a while a sleepwalker will awake.  most never do.  it is our burden as seers of the truth to advocate for them also.

       You don't know anything for sure about the kiddie stuff, none of us do. You may have your opinions, but they are no more provable than theirs. You may have proof soon, but you may not. Family is more important than asshole elites.

       So, for example: The gas used to murder jews was just anti-bacterial and couldn't have killed anyone, and the hundreds of thousands(wildly exaggerated in their mind) that died by other causes inside and outside the camps, were the result of diseases, and accidents.
