This is only the most recent of the many of hints and clues that the elite are into some seriously messed up occult shit. My question is why? I&#39;m an athiest/agnostic so think that normal religiosity is also silly and not true, but obviously a bloody semen drink is more disturbing than a baptism. </p>

<p>Edit: thanks for the replies so far. My real question I guess is what is the historical connection between those at the top and the occult. I doubt they just started being evil for no reason, there must be some prologue to these practices that I&#39;m unaware of that some of you might know about?</p>

That would be ignorance.. As for Satanism, it goes far deeper than that, imo. Satanism is a cover to a cover. Gets the religious people riled up (but still controlled). But it&#39;s far deeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO? More esoteric/occult than religious, which is what Satanism would imply. Satan is a figure in the Monotheistic religions, which is a caricature of many different ideas/deities. Those are the things you should be looking into, if you want to understand the actual elites more. Think Egypt-&gt;Babylon-&gt;Mesopotamia, then think pre-Deluge civilizations...</p>

<p>People have killed just because people told them it was gods will, how hard do you think it would be to get them to do that?</p>

<p>I was speaking more towards that, but you focused on a rape thing (that wasn&#39;t part of the questions the guy asked).   I was thinking for infinite money and power, of course I&#39;d kill someone, I think.  It&#39;s impossible to say until you are in the situation, and lets be honest, nobody..scratch that, most haven&#39;t killed another person, or been in a situation where they were tested.</p>

<p>The world revolves around greed.  </p>

<p>There was also no mention of kid fucking, unless you consider it part of ritual incest, which I read as &quot;fucking family&quot; not &quot;fucking underage family&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MKultra has been proven real, their success rate is unknown, if any (to my knowledge).</p>

<p>Once it comes to religions and Demons/bloodlines though, it would take a lot for me to believe it, like, an insane amount of proof.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I believe it is how intelligent people control more weak and unintelligent people.</p>

<p>&quot;If you want all you&#39;ve ever wished, join me, hold my hand and let us wander the fields of gold together.&quot; - that&#39;s my interpretation of indoctrinating people into religion, you show them they can get things they want, you show kindness, and leave a little mystery.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really fucked up to do to people, but also really easy to do.  People want to believe, and if you don&#39;t give specifics, and be very vague, they will fill in the blanks with their own beliefs.</p>

<p>To clarify, I believe there are cults, I just don&#39;t believe in a mystical power surrounding their practices.</p>

<p>There are far more atrocious acts, that occur on a more regular basis, that make having a tall glass of chilled bloody semen drink cocktail seem as trivial as baptism.</p>

<p>Acts performed by people, or groups of, that may or may not adhere a religious/spiritual ideology which would include you atheistic/agnostics, with mentalities so engulfed by such seemingly maledictive nihilistic doctrine they make satanists, luciferians, and many others all on par with the likes of your more widely socially acceptable belief systems.</p>

Demon/devil worship is real, demonic possession is real, and the elite such as the Skull and Bone society and Bohemian Grove really do participate in these rituals. Nobody can give you the answer as to <em>why</em> they worship these demons but I have a hard time arguing that their power isn&#39;t very real.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the actual rules to this reality, far from the 10 commandments, are &quot;Do whatever you can get away with, just make it a good story.&quot; And the tenets of satanism/the occult are the closest among the various religions to that truth, so in practicing it, they find it effective and can be led to believe that it&#39;s true in its totality. But, all the trappings/demons/deities etc. are more so just psychological tools to allow the practitioner to enter altered states and, in general, more easily accept the philosophy as a whole.</p>
