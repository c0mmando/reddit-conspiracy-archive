        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is an obvious pattern emerging which links art galleries/expositions and restaurants as a facade for these pedo-rings.  Initially it seemed like coincidence, but now with the revelation of the 3 restaurants in DC (all on the same block) this needs to be examined more closely.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the first to point this out, not even close; but there is a point I think has eluded everyone looking into this stuff: restaurants and art sales are the best means of money-laundering.</p>

<p>A little light reading on the subject:
<a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/arts/design/art-proves-attractive-refuge-for-money-launderers.html">http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/arts/design/art-proves-attractive-refuge-for-money-launderers.html</a></p>

<p>Most restaurants skim the cash sales to make extra money off the books and avoid some taxes. Someone looking for a way to cover up a lot of extra income can claim additional cash sales so the additional &quot;income&quot; looks like clean earning.</p>

<p>This was the case with  a very popular late-night eats restaurant in my area, which turned out to be a drug front. Showed up one night to eat and it was shut down after having been raided by DEA.</p>

<p>This is also true of art sales. Most rare art is appraised at a certain value, but is still subject to market price.  Simply put, art is worth what people will pay for it.  Selling a piece of crap painting for a high price is a great way to mask the sale of something else. I.E. Some person goes to a gallery or art expo at a restaurant, gets some &quot;cheese pizza,&quot;  and buys a $20 painting for $5k.</p>

<p>Here is the tricky part: when purchasing art from a dealer, the sale records need only list the piece of art and the price.  The buyer can be listed as &quot;private collection.&quot; The seller can also be listed as &quot;private collection.&quot; This is done to protect buyers in cases where a painting might be a target of theft, due to its value.</p>

<p>This makes it very difficult (even impossible) to track how the money changes hands, especially when a &quot;painting&quot; has changed hands several times.  </p>

<p>The alleged &quot;insiders&quot; have said to follow the money. I think there is more importance to these restaurants and art galleries/shows than previously expected. I know many are already digging for ownership info on the DC restaurants, but I think we need to expand our search to any places (exclusive or secluded resorts and hotels) frequented VIPs.</p>

<p>To these people, children are a commodity. They have to be obtained, housed and transported, etc. While the sales/services will be masked with various covers which make tracking the financials impossible, the bricks and mortar &quot;store fronts&quot; will have records of ownership. So far it seems most are owned by shell companies, however there has already been some progress in potentially linking one of the DC spots to Andrew Kline of the DOJ.</p>

<p>This is a darker revelation than any of us ever could have imagined. It&#39;s been difficult and even nauseating reading through these posts. While 9/11, the assassination of the Kennedys, moon landings etc are important to history to expose, this is happening right now. It&#39;s still happening. It will continue to happen. Children are being abused as i write this. </p>

<p>MSM is already spinning the pedo-rings as &quot;alt-right internet conspiracy theory.&quot; So we won&#39;t be getting any help on this, but then we are used to that. Keep digging. Keep sharing. </p>

<p>Even if you think a thought or detail might be insignificant, share it; allow others to verify. A post doesn&#39;t need to be elaborate or impressive, it just needs to contain valuable info. If you&#39;re a lurker or have reservations about making posts, pm me your thoughts and I&#39;ll post it.</p>

<p>Photoshop wizards, keep making info-graphics and posting here and on imgur. The wave of disinformation is tidal in scope, so we have to repeat this stuff until its regarded as fact. People don&#39;t want to think about this because it&#39;s too horrible, but we cannot allow this to fade into obscurity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that lizard person and flat earth posts are stupid distractions, just like the podesta sketches. </p>

<p>Human trafficking is know to be a huge problem, so I&#39;m sure there are things we don&#39;t know about. This specific case, that came out almost the day before the election, is likely a wild goose chase. </p>

<p>It&#39;d be wise to confirm once the election is behind us though. I&#39;m not saying to not investigate, just do it tomorrow</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re useful for providing enough details to gather suspects for a lineup, but not for people online to look at and determine &quot;case closed.&quot;</p>

<p>Plus, I didn&#39;t say they were worthless. I said it was a distraction, for being so focused upon during election day, and for sounding so far-fetched to anyone who refuses to give credit to internet users who tried to crack a case on their own. </p>

<p>Plus, it&#39;s not exactly like the site has a great history with fingering suspects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think trying to organize information sharing and encouraging people to focus on the hard facts of this issue (as opposed to taking big intellectual leaps) is spam?</p>

<p>I too have noticed a slough of off-the-wall tin-foily, spammy posts, especially yesterday to today, and I&#39;ve been calling them out.</p>

<p>Case in point: this bullshit.</p>
