        Summary
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Broward County violated state election law by opening and counting 150,000 mail-in ballots without the Canvassing Board being present to verify each signature and address on each ballot.  Ballots were opened in secret, and challenges were limited to 30 minutes per ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way to go backward and verify those ballots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Florida GOP threatened a lawsuit by Nov, 3rd @ 9:00 am.

       This is Debbie Wasserman Schultz congressional district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Broward County had mailed duplicate absentee ballots out earlier this month due to "misprints."
Broward County doesn't deny they opened and counted ballots without approval of the Canvassing Board.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are following the standard practice for ballot by mail preparation. We haven't done anything different than we have done in the past. The only difference is we sent out a no-match affidavit to the voters whose signatures are deemed to not match the signature on record

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Appearing on Fox News Wednesday, the chairman told Adam Shapiro, "Florida law prescribes that when the supervisor of elections takes in all these ballots, they have to be approved by the canvassing board." And these were not.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bottom line is, the officials have no legal authority to open the ballot envelopes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue actually came to light behind the scenes a week ago, after the Republican National Lawyers Association sent Florida Bar-certified attorney David Shestokas from Chicago to watch the election in always-colorful Broward.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Wednesday Ingoglia told Fox's Shapiro 1) none of the ballots had been approved, 2) he had written a letter to Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda C. Snipes (
        <a href="http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/sites/default/files/letter_rpof.jpg">
         see letter reproduced below
        </a>
        ), and 3) the party would file a lawsuit at 9 a.m. ET Thursday if county officials failed to respond to his complaint by close-of-business Wednesday.
       </p>
       <hr/>
       <p>
        within hours of receiving Ingogliaâ€™s letter, sources told The Miami Herald, Snipesâ€™ office had brokered this two-step compromise:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Starting Thursday morning, board member Judge John D. Fry will be at the supervisorâ€™s office in person to oversee canvassing of mail-in ballots.
        </li>
        <li>
         Both state parties, Republican and Democratic, will also be allowed a representative on hand at at all times as ballots are canvassed.
        </li>
       </ul>

       There's 1.8 million people in the county.  Prob an estimated 1.4 of voting age.  You're telling me 10% of the county's voters ballots are here?  In a great election year, you only get around 50% voter turnout,so now that 150k ballots are 20% of the total.  Shady business.

       Good luck getting anyone to do anything about election fraud in this country. There was plenty of evidence of election fraud, pretty blatant evidence, during the dem primaries. What happened? Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. I expect more of the same. Laws mean nothing if no one will enforce them.

       Because the canvassing board verifies ballot signatures and address BEFORE ballots are counted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Broward had been sending out duplicate ballots in the weeks before this incident.

       The allegation is, if I understand, that some counting process did not (and has apparently never had in the past) representatives of the political parties present.  150k votes were already processed this way, but the remainder of votes will have party reps and a canvasing board judge present.  Is this the crux of it?  The problem is that Republican votes may have been thrown out illegally by non-neutral officials counting the ballots?

       I explained it in the main post.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Broward County had mailed duplicate absentee ballots out earlier this month due to "misprints."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Broward County violated state election law by opening and counting 150,000 mail-in ballots without the Canvassing Board being present to verify each signature and address on each ballot.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Any number of things could have happened.  Broward could have thrown out ballots for Trump or permitted thousands of fraudulent submissions.  The second is more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       People could have voted twice or more because Broward sent out duplicate ballots, and those ballots would have been counted because the Canvassing Board did not verify each ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are far too many mistakes for this to be a coincidence.

       You say that the board was not verifying signatures and addresses, but doesn't the group that was opening and counting claim to have been doing that?  The article seems to say that's how they always do it.  First phase is counting and verifying which sets aside problematic ballots, and only the problematic ballots go to the canvasing board.  If it was always done this way, then the difference now is that there is less trust in those doing the initial counting and verifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duplicate ballots thing does sound egregious.  They admit that "mistake", but I'm not clear on what policy they adopted to cope with it.  Did they just invalidate all ballots with misprints on them regardless of how they are marked?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for asking questions, I'm not trying to give you a hard time and I believe you that funny business was going on.  I just want to understand it well enough to spread the word with some sense that I know what I'm talking about.

       Broward County and its elections supervisor Brenda Snipes have been at the center of a few incidents in current and past elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read Snipes statement I pasted in the main post she is parsing her words. Snipes does not deny that ballots were opened and counted without the Canvassing Board verifying ballots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snipes tries to pretend they've been following the law and have been doing the same thing for previous elections.   If you read the Miami Herald article I linked, it is clear Broward was not following state law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything Snipes statement brings into question of whether or not Broward permitted fraud in previous elections.
