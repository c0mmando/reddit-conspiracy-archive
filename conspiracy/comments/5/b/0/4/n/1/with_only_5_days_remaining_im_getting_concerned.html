<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs">https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs</a></p>

<p>So, why haven&#39;t there been any arrests yet? </p>

<p>I hope the plan isn&#39;t to have the election with Hillary as the victor and the entire country dissolves into chaos because our country is now in the clutches of an obvious federal criminal. I can see many riots breaking out as millions of people demand to see justice and other people thinking &quot;Well, if she can steal and murder, why can&#39;t I?&quot;</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not fear mongering. I&#39;m just looking for a discussion about this. </p>

<p>On the flip side, what chain reaction would occur if Hillary is arrested prior to the election? </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most logical day to leak something major is Friday, or Saturday.</p>

<p>By posting it just before the weekend you can ensure people have nearly 72-hours to digest the information to maximize the impact. It also means Super PACs, CTR, etc. will potentially not be at full capacity. Look at what happened last week with the FBI letter to congress, CTR and the Clinton campaign went silent for nearly 3 days while they regrouped and came up with new talking points.</p>

<p>If something worse then the FBI letter happens tomorrow the election is Tuesday, it will take them until at least Monday to even coordinate a strategy, and by then it will be too late.</p>

<p>My only fear is whoever is leaking waits until Monday. While it might seem like the day before the election is a good idea, it doesn&#39;t give enough time for the information to spread to enough people.</p>

<p>What I realized this week is those of us who follow this kind of information are in the minority. r/conspiracy is only 394,121 people, meanwhile there are over 318 million people in the USA. Even the debates were watched by less than 1/3 of our population.</p>

<p>With that said, you also have to consider we&#39;re all functioning within echo chambers. Even this subreddit is an echo chamber. The average American now gets their news from Facebook on a mobile device. Even the power of the main stream media isn&#39;t what it use to be. I&#39;ve come to realize that the intention of Facebook is to purposely keep you in an echo chamber, that is the fundamental system of control they are using to keep the masses ignorant. It is not a communication tool to find new connections, it is a tool to maintain exsiting connections only, and isolate you within a false sense of community. But Facebook controls what you see, and when you see it. The same is now somewhat true of Twitter.</p>

<p>To properly make an impact on the election the release of a critical leak needs to be timed perfectly, and in my opinion if it doesn&#39;t happen within the next 48-hours it might be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points. I especially like the &quot;echo chamber&quot; comment.  We are all so into researching this stuff and staying informed, and commenting within this sub to other &quot;freed minds&quot; it&#39;s easy to forget we are in a bubble that we see out of but nobody sees in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like reading a good book while someone else is in the room and you are so caught up you briefly forget they aren&#39;t in on the story. </p>

<p>Regarding the timing of the leaks, I think the 5th is symbolic, both historically and as a nod to the plot of V. The timing also works perfectly with it falling in a weekend and allowing people to be exposed to the new info. I just hope the early voting areas don&#39;t miss out on the potential for having the fresh leaks change some votes in case the FBI can&#39;t convince the DOJ to file charges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can actually hold her on suspicion.  They have more than enough; and frankly we&#39;ve held everyone from activists to not-terrorists for far less than we have on her.  The charges would be conspiring against the government which is treason.  So this would make her an enemy of the state, which means she loses rights of habeas corpus as an enemy combatant.  Remember, they can declare someone an enemy of the state, blackbag them to a facility and they CAN do this to anyone.  Because they&#39;ve already done it before.</p>

<p>They can do this at any time, but that they haven&#39;t means they are just fucking with us.</p>

<li>All sides keep saying without a doubt so and so is going to win. But nobody knows exactly what will happen. Rigged? Sure but they say they can&#39;t edit the voter data by state more than 4% using the GEMS program.</li>
<li>There is a lot of evidence against her. I think wikileaks made a big mistake not releasing their big dirt info in October because I&#39;m beginning to think this was an FBI strategy to delay, AGAIN.</li>
<li>All that evidence, and the MSM ignore it like keeping the status quo, a true matrix.</li>
<li>These good guys according to Steve have been working their arses off, but maybe the strategy is to release all this overwhelming evidence, Hillary must be indicted therefore can not be elected by Nov 8, or the election gets delayed for more time to interview and prosecute.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I read somewhere (sorry for being so vague) that there&#39;s an unofficial or official law/regulation stating that government bodies should not be involved in elections. We have innocent until proven guilty here in the states. Meaning she would need to be tried in court before truly guilty. So, if she was found innocent and they arrested her, that would obviously affect our votes. We wouldn&#39;t know she was innocent until after elections. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say, anyone on this subreddit knows she is guilty. But that&#39;s why I think nothing has happened on that front. Now, I&#39;m not saying all her collusion switch the state department, et al, or the media outlets hasn&#39;t also helped her not get arrested! I&#39;m saying its multi-faceted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way for us to know what is going on in the FBI right now. it could be that the FBI is waiting until closer to election day to drop the damaging bits, hoping to sway the largest segment of voters. It could be that there is a power struggle inside the FBI. Or it could be that they just don&#39;t have anything as good as all the theories.</p>

<p>Regardless, if Hillary is elected, it will be extraordinarily difficult to prosecute. It would be hard enough with someone as wealthy as her, but once she&#39;s wielding power it&#39;ll be near impossible. If she wins expect the FBI to be restructured immediately. Hillary&#39;s &quot;campaign&quot; has focused on controlling information and debate, extending tentacles through the DNC, Hollywood, youtube, msm, and Reddit itself. Once she can extend control through the DOJ in a similar fashion, I don&#39;t expect any prosecutors to step up and try to take her down. </p>

<p>That leaves impeachment, which is a congressional process. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll have the votes. I do know the Republican party is ruptured and leaderless. There is no one who has enough clout to lead that kind of attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the <a href="http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/">rumors</a> about Hillary and pedophila/child trafficking are true then there are currently massive blackmail/threats going on behind the scenes.   The more time that elapses the less likely we are to see the story break.   </p>

<p>If the True Pundit article is accurate the NYPD should have held a press conference the day of discovery.   Cops are probably having their careers and even lives threatened as we speak.   </p>

<p>Israel is heavily implicated in the pedo honey pot operations.   They are probably calling in favors.   </p>

<p>Supposedly Wikileaks will be dropping Hillary truth bombs tomorrow.   They better, because the hour is growing late.  </p>
