<p>At this point there are few options for the cabal.  Most likely they will have another false flag, potentially nuclear, attack on major US cities.  This will allow them to usher in martial law appointing hillary as the czar and brushing off the voter fraud info as russians trying to undermine us (like all the other leaks).  </p>

<p>At this point WW3 will have officially begun and we may even see a return of the draft system.  Mass casualties can be exepected if any sort of tussle starts with russia, even if its all fake.  Remember that one of the main purposes of modern warfare is to curb the population.  Say goodbye to your freedoms everyone, they have systematically taken every single one away leaving us with no laws on our side.  Our time to rebel was years ago.  We are fucked, go to the mountains in south america if you want to avoid all of this.</p>

<p>With all due respect, how can you be so ignorant? The surveillance state has been in motion. Doesn&#39;t this impact your day to day life? Data pertaining to your spending habits, what shows you watch, etc is all being archived somewhere. And that&#39;s only one aspect of it. I presume there are others which are unknown. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe some pointless <strong>wars</strong></p>

<p>The deaths of people taken by <em>violence</em> do not impact you at all? Doesn&#39;t it make you resent it all if you knew the bullets used against innocent civilians were partly funded indirectly by you?</p>

<p>I am very suspicious of the mass shootings, yes, but I don&#39;t necessarily think they are a direct government kind of operation.</p>

<p>I look instead to the extremely powerful private for profit intelligence and private military organizations for cause.  It benefits their ability to receive increased tax money for security and political power as well.</p>

<p>The main benefit of it all is literally taking the power out of our hands so they have no chance of being overthrown using means written into the constitution, which literally gives us a right to overthrow the government if it becomes tyrannical (which it is).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been worried about this too. Obama passed an executive order recently that gives the Feds authority to shut down the grid in case of solar flares. Very strange timing. The executive orders freak me out a little in general. I have been worried about some kind of attack near the election. We&#39;ve stocked up on food and water, etc. How can you be so sure though, that WW3 is imminent? I have also read about project blue beam and I totally subscribe to the notion that &quot;they&quot; use false flags to coerce public opinion and as pretext for pre-planned events. This has become obvious to me. That being said, do you have any documents or proof of this upcoming chaos? I know Russia is not behind Wikileaks. I know the media is pushing this anti-Russian narrative. But how can we be sure that such a thing is on our doorstep? Wouldn&#39;t be against their interest to destroy the infrastructure of the US which allows them to make money and stay in power? Or is this kind of thing inevitable because the dollar is crashing anyway? What cities do you think might be targeted? And why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump will win with a landslide -- something I&#39;ve been saying here for a year and a half, at least.</p>

<p>There will be scattered expressions of unhappiness by black people (who else does the rioting?) which will gradually die down.</p>

<p>Trump will move to appoint his own people, replacing the people Obama put in. These Trump people will set about looking into the crimes of the Democrats over Obama&#39;s two terms. Heads will eventually roll. Maybe even the head of the Hillary monster.</p>

<p>Trump will build the wall with Mexico and force Mexico to pay for it.</p>

<p>He will get rid of all the Nancy boys and carpet lickers  and Mr. Dressups from the military, and will restore military readiness.</p>

<p>He will insure that the FBI is lean, clean, and honest.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court will be swung to the right.</p>

<p>He will get rid of all the trade agreements that have hurt US interests over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p>He will limit immigration, by excluding illegals and Muslims.</p>

<p>He will restore the power of city police forces to administer the law to blacks.</p>

<p>He will make peace with Putin, and his term will be known for decades as the period of friendship between the US and Russia.</p>

<p>He will bring about the reunion of North and South Korea.</p>

<p>His example will spark a renewed nationalistic movement across Europe. Muslims will be expelled. The integrity of European nations will be restored.</p>
