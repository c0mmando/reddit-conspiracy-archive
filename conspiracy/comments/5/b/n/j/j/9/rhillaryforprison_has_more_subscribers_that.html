    <div class="md"><p>Just to give some perspective. Reddit is probably the biggest aggregate news site on the internet. </p>

<p>The official r/HillaryClinton page has about 35,000 people subscribed.</p>

<p>The r/HillaryforPrison page has about 67,000 people subscribed.</p>

<p>The r/DNCLeaks page has 18,000 people subscribed.</p>

<p>These last two are communities more or less dedicated to finding illegal activities in the wikileaks emails. That’s 85,000 people on Reddit who oppose her, over twice the number of people officially in support of her. There is probably some overlap but even if all of the r/DNCLEAKS were subscribed to the first then there is still a minimum of 67,000 people dedicated to that effort.</p>

<p>r/the_donald page has 263,000 people subscribed.</p>

<p>The r/sandersforpresident  page STILL has 211,000 people subscribed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s  amazing that so many news and politics subreddits seem incredibly pro-Clinton even though the her Reddit fan base seems quite small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been off and on that sub for years. It was never especially good, but there was a variety of political stories, and you rarely got downvote bombed unless you said something super offensive. It changed and shifted fairly rapidly this election, much different than I can remember in the previous election.</p>

<p>I remember when the whole sub had a craze for Ron Paul during the primaries last election. They loved the guy, but they changed party rules on him and his support dwindled till there was just this pic of him sitting alone in a hallway. Really sad. After that it slowly shifted to an Obama lovefest-ish with a few Ron Paul people hanging around, and Romney getting a little support (very little).</p>

<p>This election, I saw it go from slowly adopting Bernie stuff and then going full blown Bernie lovefest. Stayed that way until the last day of the Dem Convention, and then literally overnight the Bernie love transformed into rabid, angry, trolling defenders of Hillary with high propensity for downvoting anything negative about her. Been that way ever since (minus the lull in which the head of CTR said they went black after Hillary collapsed on 9/11. The whole sub shifted back to disliking Hillary for a couple days, and then suddenly shifted back to the new &quot;normal&quot; again).</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a fascinating thing to see, really. Being around here this long and being an avid fan of politics, it blows my mind when I sometimes encounter people who act like it was an organic shift.</p>

It was basically 100% Sanders and Trump people, both of candidates having a history outside the two party duopoly. No one was backing the DNC. People around at the time noticed immediately when Correct the Record started flooding in though. It was immediately obvious and happened overnight, and after the Democratic National Convention they increased their funding and were able to take over completely. The mods used to allow dissenting thought, but somewhere along the way they started banning people just for being anti-Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been off and on that sub for years. It was never especially good, but there was a variety of political stories, and you rarely got downvote bombed unless you said something super offensive. It changed and shifted fairly rapidly this election, much different than I can remember in the previous election.</p>

<p>I remember when the whole sub had a craze for Ron Paul during the primaries last election. They loved the guy, but they changed party rules on him and his support dwindled till there was just this pic of him sitting alone in a hallway. Really sad. After that it slowly shifted to an Obama lovefest-ish with a few Ron Paul people hanging around, and Romney getting a little support (very little).</p>

<p>This election, I saw it go from slowly adopting Bernie stuff and then going full blown Bernie lovefest. Stayed that way until the last day of the Dem Convention, and then literally overnight the Bernie love transformed into rabid, angry, trolling defenders of Hillary with high propensity for downvoting anything negative about her. Been that way ever since (minus the lull in which the head of CTR said they went black after Hillary collapsed on 9/11. The whole sub shifted back to disliking Hillary for a couple days, and then suddenly shifted back to the new &quot;normal&quot; again).</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a fascinating thing to see, really. Being around here this long and being an avid fan of politics, it blows my mind when I sometimes encounter people who act like it was an organic shift.</p>
