       I respect your logic. Americans voted for America clearly. They may have been deprived of the Bernie option but in an elimination match style electoral process they voted for essentially the 1950's America at its peak versus the 1770's Monarchy that America rebelled from.

       Given that I think the election is rigged, Donald Trump winning would restore my faith that the people can still choose the president. Even if I really don't like who that person is, or his policies.

       They're all plants. Sanders was planted to get everybody all believing in hope, and that the people have a say. Sanders was planted to distract the passionate people from actually stopping the status quo, by making them believe that a vote or action about a vote is more important than anarchist action. Trump was planted to make Clinton's win appear as if free and fair elections exist in the U.S. Clinton was planted to win.

       are you aware that Trump is a clinton donor and long-time family friend, WWE Raw actor, TV personality, and bill clinton's golfing buddy?
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that anyone thinks it actually matters or that this is a real contest is surprising to me, like they think everything is rigged ... just not the clinton donor and family friend who was set up to "run against" a clinton? lol.

       It does matter though. At least Hillary can be tried now. We won't have millions of girls looking up to her as an inspiration for decades to come... The list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Trump is controlled opposition, we've still seen a victory tonight. No matter how slight it is. A true victory would be a revolt in the street against the system entirely, but we're not their yet. We're close.

       I never understood the support r/conspiracy gave to Trump. The whole thing is scripted, just the fact he was able to be a viable candidate is evidence of his part in it. There's no way they'd let some upstart challenge the status quo without their own agenda.

       I think elections are rigged too. Now when you say rigged, do you mean they placed Trump as the opposition, made him look like a fool, so that Hillary can just walk into office? Do you think there are other ways they rig elections?

       Well, some forms of rigging I think are well proven at this point: namely, the elite pour money, use their companies (Esp media ones) as proxies for the candidate, they sometimes fund both sides to ensure they can use both to further their objectives, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also think they rig the voting machines themselves. So much so, that it doesn't matter if a person steps into the booth or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I think there's some evidence pointing to this in the 2000 election and in the Sanders/Clinton primaries... this is the theory that hasn't been proven with overwhelming evidence.

       They use decimals so like that movie Office Space they can shave just like you said. In a close race its all they need to tip it.  And very hard for anyone to notice it where as a huge deviation might spur outrage.

       JFK was also planned opposition.  But he rebelled and got his head blown open.  Trump has deep roots in the NYC corruptocrats, vide Roy Cohn and the founding of Trumps realestate empire.  Trump has a short leash.

       All presidents are only symbols, bar-coded Tarot-card chessmen in the Conspiracy's ceremonial Monopoly Gameboard Earth. Elections don't need to be fixed; they are FIXES for the hopeless who are all too willing to deceive themselves into getting a sense of "empowerment" by standing in line for hours to put a little checkmark on a dead piece of the Amazonian Rainforest. Some reptile shoves a card in front of your face: "Which vampire would you like to pay to suck your blood? Clone One, Clone One, or Clone One?" And you Pink Boys and Girls lecture about apathy!

       And in line with what you're saying, it's obvious that the elections are rigged. When everything else is engineered reality, why would elections be any different? The elections exist to give people the feeling that they have some agency in this system, and to distract would-be anarchists from taking any action.

       That is anecdotal. No one doubts he has at least 30,000 supporters in any given state. 30,000 people showing up at his rallies only shows the fervor of his supporters. There are many, many more than that who show up to the polls, though.

       If a rally of 30,000 people is anecdotal, then a poll of 10,000 people is anecdotal. So while I agree that this doesn't accurately gauge how many people will actually show up to the voting booths, I'd argue that the polls don't gauge that either. So what evidence is there that Trump has way more opposition that support?

       No, that's not how polling works. A Trump rally is a group of Trump supporters. A poll is representative of multiple demographics (democrat, republican, independent, young, old, black, white, etc)

       Even Nate Silver admits
       <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/08/nate-silver-yes-there-is-a-crisis-in-polling/">
        polling seems to regularly underestimate Republican/right-leaning candidates

       Because Hillary can't even fill a room with Cleveland's biggest star, LeBron James. Only a picture from the rafters from a security person exposed this...and it happened over and over and over. Green screens, Bernie Supporters throwing chairs (not) in Nevada, Trump supporters starting riots in Chicago (not)...but hey, yeah...I even live in Baltimore and see all those Hillary signs in people's yards (not). She doesn't have the empirical evidence needed for true support and I'm certainly not putting all my chips on some MSM talking head saying shes a Weiner...winner.

       Consistent polling across the board is a much, much better indicator of who's winning than rallies. Any statistics course could show you why this is true (falsely polling in support of her would do nothing to help her btw, and would probably hurt her).
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing the fervor of his supporters doesn't tell you anything about the opposition. Most of the democratic base isn't that excited about Hillary Clinton, it's just agreed upon that she's a much, much better choice than the alternative. A few thousand passionate supporters doesn't tell you much about the hundreds of thousands voting in each state.

       Yes because the fact of the matter is more votes were cast for one candidate -- and whomever receives more votes  should be the winner.

       Well the reality TV just went to new levels. When he started winning last night I thought oh, they'll just keep the drama going and make it a tie. Instead they said fuck it let's just keep this rolling for the next four years. My paranoia is strong right now. Trump getting installed is a terrible terrible sign.

       Are people really gonna buy this though? I'm stunned. I didn't think the image of democracy could be sustained by a trump victory. Obviously he has been placed where he is right now. But damn. My paranoia is going off so strong. Now in afraid the false flag is gonna happen soon, like even before the inauguration. I thought we had maybe a year with shilliary.

       It actually looks like he will win at this point. Out of the 7 states that are still counting, only 2 (MN &amp; ME) are blue. And they only hold 14 electoral votes. But Hillary needs 55 more. Trump needs 26 more and the 5 uncounted red-leaning states hold 61 together.

       Its gonna happen, they have been prepping us for it. The North Korea threat, the Russian threat, the Al Qaeda threat, something is in the works. My guess is that they are waiting for the riots to start before they declare Martial law.

       It makes sense, I mean either way it is like a win win for them. If Trump wins they dont want him in power, so they would do this to nullify the election or at least postpone it. If Clinton wins it would give them time to cover the mess of it being rigged.

       Rioting over smaller issues?  The people rioting, Afro Americans, are literally being gunned down in the streets by their peers and the state.

       Individuals have been shot, yes. And some were unarmed. I've also heard stories about the rioters looting and destroying other's property as well as beating the crap out of white people and people wearing pro-Trump clothing. I don't know what to believe. But yes, it

       I think you were being a little dramatic.  There have been large scale riots in the US and they have been the same demographic for the last 70 years. That demographic riots because of the reasons I laid out in my post above.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rest of the population of America to start legitimately rioting there literally has to be no gas at the pumps, no milk or bread in the stores.  This isn't a speculation, it's historical fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       When over worked people complain. And maybe unionize
      </p>
      <p>
       When out of fuel (gas) people protest
      </p>
      <p>
       When out of food, people riot
      </p>
      <p>
       Then depending if the state oppresses they revolt

       I'm not "being dramatic". I'm just sharing what I've seen in articles and videos regarding the rioting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And duh. Of course something catastrophic that interfered with people's ability to survive - like lack of food and running water, or even electricity - would have to happen for the rest of the population to riot. I'm not sure what you're arguing about because I never said anything that contradicted that. In fact, that's exactly what I stated in other comments. Perhaps you're confusing what I've actually stated with assumptions about me you've conceived in your own mind.

       Really because when I see societal breakdown I just see large refugee centers. Perhaps the FEMA coffins are just waste-bins and the FEMA incineration camps are cooking centers.

       The thing is, we don't live in the 90's, or the 80's or the 70's. I don't know about the next guy, but I have munitions and MORE than enough to protect myself and my neighbors if we were attacked/attempting to send us to FEMA camps.

       Don't you think they know that?  The month-over-month record-shattering firearms sales numbers are not lost on those in control.  This won't be about them forcibly taking your guns and sending you to FEMA camps -- this is about turning all those guns on each other.  It's plain as day, to me.

       You and me both.  But when you consider the broader context, and especially the emotionally-charged violence already having erupted spontaneously around the country, you see an unprecedented potential for something not seen since 1861.  It's all engineered, of course, but it's effective and clever.

       The same reason most of the population is focused on social politics and why they think either president will do anything for us, is the same reason they would fight each other. Useful idiots. The same ones who disrupt speeches and shut down cities are the same ones who will feel justified shooting a fellow citizen based on invisible thought crimes.

       It'll be the DAPL protest. I can almost guarantee it. Someone will get shot - and not with those petty rubber bullets, riots will become violent, and suddenly all those "cops" (hint: they aren't -all- cops...) start massacring and mass-incarcerating protesters.

       Something is going on, now that Russia was so quick to say they weer working on an alliance with Trump I suspect it will be either BLM related or ISIS related. I suspect something like shootings, IED, etc. I really think something is in the works. It may not be yet, perhaps soon after Trump takes office.

       I hope you are right. I dont think it will resort to Martial law, but civil unrest and rioting will be definite. They will try and cause panic in the rest of Americans, playing on people's emotions and trying to get them to think they did the wrong thing.

       On top of this, I think they'll make an effort to be behind the riots. The match flick in the powder keg. The BLM movement would be a prime candidate, people are all ready frothing at the mouth over this. The fools. All lives matter and you don't go saying a particular race matters and destroy shit then expect people to support you. It'd be so easy to have a plant in one of these groups instigate something bigger. With the massive number of seemingly unthinking or unaware masses it'd be a cinch. Then riots will kick off for the wrong reasons, they'll have their excuse and then we begin our transformation from an open society to a closed society.

       I mean, Russia &amp; the US definitely have been butting heads in the middle east. And US and China have been on edge, too. I don't think that the US is the "good guy" by any means... The US is absolutely responsible for the unrest in the middle east. And we've only been provoking Russia further. I don't know whether or not Russia would actually seek to attack on US grounds. It's possible. But it's just as likely that the US would stage an attack to gain support to go to war. Seeing that they've done it successfully once before...

       Yeah man! I'm very happy Trump won and Americans have their country back (for now) but kinda glad it's over so we can get into some new juicy conspiracies and save the world from our evil overlords.

       You bet not. They wanted everyone to roll over.

       Poor Poland wanted their independence back and Russia stole it with Prussia, then they welcomed Napoleon and all his empty promises only to starve and freeze to death in retreat of his massive over reach into Russia. (I will never understand Hitler copying his mistake except people say he had been getting more and more erratic and irrational).  Then WWI and Nazi's.  EU promised the world and delivers only insurmountable debt and endless refugees with terrorists, rapists and murderers camouflaged inside.

       Now we have these rumblings and it felt like HRC was pushing for WWIII.  She certainly wanted Lybia destabilized thus destroying the only dam keeping the Muslim hoards out of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I can onky pray Trump surprises us all in a good way and puts rhr breaks on this runaway train, encourages Syria not to cave to banking cabal and makes trade not war with the world but without disgusting liberty destroying treaties like TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, I know... I hoped and prayed Barry Soetero would keep his word and end this war machine and close GITMO, force the repell of the Patriot Act and not sign the NDAA.  How bitter my disappointment.

       I mean, I agree all of those things are bad, but how would they allow people to live underground, deal with awful air quality, genetic damage, possible irradiation, lack of farmable soil on the surface, and destruction of all resources on the surface?

       There are certainly some very vocal supporters of war with Russia, but the general population has no interest in it.  Most complaints against Russia sound like something we'd cook up here and since most media sources have worked their assess off trying to discredit conspiracy theorizing, they've sort of written themselves into a corner.

       While once the republican voters were the weapon to push for tax breaks for the rich, deregulation of wall street, and war mongering in the middle east - today the democrat voters are the weapon to fight for destruction of freedom of speech, increased intelligence, protest quelling, and gun control.

       I'm not sure how much of a difference it's going to make, but people who grew up with the Internet seem more inclined to not be retarded and to not just blindly believe everything they're told. And I'm not saying it's a majority of the younger generation who have a head on their shoulders... Just more of them than the older ones, simply because they have a lot more tools than older people.

       I see NO evidence of your "believe" point. In fact, it seems worse and critical thinking in general seems stunted.  I don't know how old you are, but I came from the "old world" and transitioned into this "new world" and I've seen mostly the opposite.

       I disagree. Most millenials are the most easily influenced people around. They don't have the party loyalty of the boomers or the apathy of the xers, but they get passionate over everything and really, really suck at analysing information or thinking long term.

       More of us just roll with whatever the headlines tell us without actually doing any research. We care more about entertainment than information and so we end up with this shitshow of an election.

       I think you have valid points but I would just add that the narrative of Trump supporters being too scary and therefore used as a pretext to inact draconian agendas is being delivered to them with a big bow. You don't have to dig very far in this sub pr others to find dozens of Trump supporters talking about how they're going to gun down government officials and in some cases anyone that has a different opinion than themselves. I get why people are angry, but this is playing right into the stereotypes. This isn't 1776, you're not going win a revolution by grabbing your musket and bustin caps.

       I don't think so, but I do think it'll be a crazy white man. I predicted a year ago that whoever wins will be a target. Not sure if I saw correctly, but Hillary was behind bullet proof glass in Philly speech tonight? She's built quite the list of enemies and I wouldn't ever want to be in her shoes because you have to be insane to want to be where she is.

       it happens, it can easily be blamed on Russia. Here's the MSM narrative: "Trump lost, so his evil friend Putin attacked Madam Hillary's America! Invade Russia!"

       I don't understand why it's so hard for people to grasp the fact that Russian isn't a big fan of America simply because America keeps trying to be the god damn world police. Wouldn't it be a legitimate reaction if we freaked the fuck out because a coalition of foreign powers with self-serving motives lead by Russia was trying to strengthen its grasp on central/south America and putting a crap ton of weaponry near the Mexican border?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia isn't out there trying to dominate the world, spread communism, and burn babies, for Christ's sake... They're just trying to make sure they don't get bent over by Americans overreaching across the globe. They don't necessarily have the most progressive human right stances, but they're far from being the worst place out there, and a good case can be made about the US having a pretty fucking shady track record as well. How people are so easily manipulated into viewing them as some sort of boogeyman is beyond me...

       I saw on Facebook some of my friends that identify as pacifists (well they were before Hillary made war cool #imwithher... sorry need to literally puke after saying that) advocating the use of extreme and total lethal force on a militia that is apparently forming in Georgia right now. "Take em all out like any other enemy"

       It's funny. I'm Canadian, and I've always been entirely against guns. I've been living in the US for a while and following politics, and throughout the course of the last 2 years, I've completely warmed up to guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I most likely won't ever own one myself, but seeing as the government seems to be working against its people, I now believe that the American people owning a lot of guns is absolutely necessary.

       If we ever find ourselves in a position where our government goes into hiding and the country is being invaded by a foreign country, how the flying fuck do we expect to defend ourselves? There's no way the military can be everywhere at once.

       To be fair to them I used to be in that train of thought and it comes from the one place you would think you would expand your mind from... school. I think it was the Frankfurt School who said that is the way to indoctrinate the future and they are right. Its a shame really because learned helplessness is becoming the norm for the future generations and if Hillary gets in this will become Europe 2.0 with weak "men" being walked over by aggressive neanderthals

       Pacifists are taking a moral stand and can still actively protest injustice and overthrow them. In many ways, they are more effective than armed mobs. I mean look at India, they effectively liberated themselves through nonviolence.

       I believe they can. Many are veterans and enthusiasts that are trained to use their weapons. If it was possible to stomp out such a movement we would have won in Nam and I feel like our soldiers are unlikely to drop napalm on small town Georgia.

       As for the ban.

       Guns are like Pandora's box. They are out in the country and will not be removed. Few gun owners would turn their property to the govt and attempts to confiscate would turn groups like the NRA into a militia.

       What makes a crazy homeless person with no ambition off the street any different from a man with ambition and a pension for profit under current laws?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand your logic. Who is an ideal candidate for president? A crazy, feeble, criminal woman pandering to feminists? A black savior with a thirst for war and death overseas?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, there is no one qualified to lead a large nation. Why should anyone be above others?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, you're choosing between a profiteering businessman operating under corrupt law who can't run a casino and a profiteering businesswoman who takes bribes, harasses people with federal agencies, and is a proponent for war using banks, women and minorities as a platform and supports policy against her platform. They are both fallible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that Hillary is a career politician and has things in the works to further her and her sponsors agenda and has done things beyond Trump's league. She is also a proven failure in politics from all areas of her career.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would anyone vote for her unless they are brainwashed? She's being sensationalized as a feminist hero although she condones and defends rape and sexual assault of women and sexual affairs by her husband. She's being painted as a hero to minorities although her past policies all indicate she is a racist an doesn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get the Trump hate.

       Well by "shortly after the election" I didn't mean 2 hours.

      <p>
       I suspect Hillary didn't 'win' because Trump actually won by a larger margin than they could flip via rigged voting machines, fraudulent ballots, etc. without making it obvious.

       If you're suggesting that a false flag could have helped the democrats scare people into keeping them in power, it's a real possibility. And maybe they would have done it had they foreseen this outcome. And maybe they still will. Am I understanding the question?

       Because they're not just used to win elections, they're also used to change laws, gain power, instill fear, and advance political and military agendas in other ways. Take a look:

        http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html
       </a>
       . Unfortunately it's not a matter of if it will happen, but a matter of when it will happen again, and of how large of a crisis they want to create.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I hope it doesn't happen under the next President. As you said, I was just being smug with my predictions. And I hope the chance of it happening is diminished with Trump, but realistically we don't know much about him.

       As a person whos subbed on The Don I have to say question number 2 (like 9/11) is going to be real shitty. Alot of people will die like many have over foreign lands in the past 15 years. While that is going on yes it will succeed in taking away the small liberties we still have and make us into Europe 2.0. As far as WHO the war will be with we don't know but for sure something will kick off and it will not be pretty

       the elections weren't close enough to need a false flag. There might be establishment forces trying to derail Trump if he refuses to fall in line, but apparently there are elements within the establishment who actually want "true change"

       I, for one, find it very interesting that the FBI suddenly cleared Hillary...
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       ...with two days to go before the election. It would seem that Mrs. Clinton's handlers do, in fact, want her to occupy the oval office. Trump doesn't stand a hope in hell. While Trump might be good for America, the oligarch's can't control him and therefore won't allow him to take office.

       And potentially get Trump assassinated. Trump wants peace. The Oligarch's want war. John F. Kennedy wanted peace. The Oligarch's from JFK's time wanted war. JFK was shot. The parallel is clear.

       I could be off the mark, but I don't understand why Bernie is still involved in campaigning for Hillary. He's fundamentally against what she's about. Given that either he was threatened or at risk of senate seat removal, all he had to do was endorse her at the DNC and then peace the hell out. Why the further involvement? By my logic, it seems to increase the chances of him being a shill by a pretty big margin.

       She has blackmail against him. I posted a way long thread outlining my theory about Sanders/Clinton

        here

       . Remember the Wikileaks where they said how he wasn't "sticking to the agreement" and how they could use "leverage" if need be?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure the terms were laid out clearly when he decided to run: Clinton/DNC thought he could be useful as a way to reach the Occupy/youth crowd so they indulged his run. But I'm guessing Clinton said something like, "but if I win the nom (knowing full well she would), you agree to endorse me and continue to campaign. If  I win the presidency I'll offer you 'x-token.' If you don't do these things, then x info gets released." Plus, she'd be the POTUS. You don't want to be a politician on the wrong side of her, especially as a Dem. Even if he's technically an independent, it'd be like pissing off the popular girl in school who can make your life in school a living hell.

       It HAS TO be way darker than that ... at ANY time over the past few months, Sanders could (
       <strong>
        should
       </strong>
       ) have pulled his support for Hillary and left her to flounder! There's something way bigger at stake here, because he's sold himself out and he knows it.

       From personal experience, I have watched a cop plant drugs on someone and then arrest them.

       I have also seen a criminal target another criminal by dropping a bag of dope and dealing supplies into a vehicle he owned before calling the police on him.

       I'm not talking about the sexual assault allegations. Those were too well-timed to be taken seriously. They're entirely believable, but they serve the Clinton campaign a bit too well to be taken as fact. I'm talking about the multiple recordings of him saying shit that clearly exposes Trump's views on women (ie: grabbing women by the pussy, attributing any sort of behavior he doesn't like to PMSing, commenting about women's weight in the most demeaning way he can muster, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is a sexist mother fucker who doesn't seem to believe women have any use other than looking god and cooking his dinner. It's not a reason to not support him when the only other option is Clinton, but anyone who argues that Trump considers women to be equal to men has their head pretty damn deep up their own ass.

       See I find this attitude disturbing.  They've built up this narrative around trump with nothing to back it up other than meaningless words.  The right has built it up like trump is some underdog outsider who only cares about doing what is right, but the reality couldn't be further from that concept.  What we do absolutely know about trump is that he has a history of defrauding people and rubbing shoulders with the other wealthy and powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It bothers me to see people act like trump is some victim, because that puts him in a position where he can blame others for anything he does that people don't like, and people will believe him and take his words at face value.  Maybe trump does only want peace, but we don't know what his true intentions are and it is foolish to take his words at face value when he has a history of lying to people.

       All we really know about Trump is that he sees normal people as pawns and couldn't give less of a shit about them, that the only reason he is running for office is the money he can siphon out of it, and that he comes from the exact same background and crowd as the Clintons and that they're friends behind the scenes. I fail to see how anyone could expect any better from Trump than from Clinton.

       If I were to guess which candidate has all the fat cat investors my bet would be on the one with all of the mainstream media support, not the one under constant assault.

       You can shit on Trump University all you want, it was just a non-accredited specialty school. If you want some real fraud I suggest you ask someone who has lived in Haiti within the past decade how they feel about the Clintons.

       Its sort of a universally accepted fallacy these days that its always Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich. I believe Trump is the first legitimately good candidate in our lifetime and people are too cynical now to see it. Hillary Clinton is literally a criminal and has already sold out our government from a lower office. Trump basically already won life. He's rich and famous with an incredible family and capable of doing whatever he wants whenever he wants. He's been saying for decades that he doesn't want to run for office, but he's finally doing it because he honestly believes its gotten so bad that nobody else is capable of doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a once in a lifetime opportunity to elect somebody for president that does not owe anyone anything and does not need anything himself. He will be the very definition of a public servant, not the beneficiary of public office.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument of who deserves to vote is pretty stupid and irrelevant. Won't bother there... and no, they aren't BFFs. Unless your BFFs file frivolous rape lawsuits against you.

       That's an incredible leap of logic. He's saying that we're effectively all in this together in terms of economic prosperity, that economic turmoil crosses borders. How you tie that to a specific position on a specific piece of legislation is beyond me. One thing's for sure though: Hillary Clinton called TPP the gold standard for trade deals and her husband signed NAFTA.

       That wasn't at all the point I was trying to make. What I mean is that from the perspective of the ruling class that's what we are, and they sure as hell aren't handing the reins over to us any time soon. If nothing else this election should have taught us that.. remember the DNC primary, after all. Which is part of why I think all this is immaterial anyway - I mean, I'll still vote, because it's kind of fun, but come on, we know how this is going to turn out, don't we?

       It's not so incredible. If you were being incredibly reductionist you could argue that TOP/NAFTA enable global trade at the potential cost to local economies and jobs in the wealthier trading prtner country. Trump and Clinton are both globalist extremists. Maybe that's the only way forward that will work, maybe not, but they both bullshit and pretend to want limits on "free trade" and support elements of a protected economy, while just a couple years (or days, in Clinton's case) previous they went on the record with their ubprecedented love of globalism.

       I'll still take Trump over HRC if given the choice. There's a chance Trump really is a well-meaning idiot who will moderately fuck up the country for a few years. That seems preferable to WW3.

       yeah but this sub is filled with retards now.  They are just like the SJWs that want to "FEEL" like they are part of some sort of "revolution".  It is really easy to get these types to believe anything you want: first present the current reality and explain how it is corrupt and all lies...once you have them agreeing with you there then you can literally feed them any bullshit non-sourced article you want and they will believe everything it says simply because it isn't the mainstream source that you showed was wrong/biased/etc.  The level of brainwashing in this supposedly free-thinking sub is just plain sad.  I have been avoiding it for weeks for this very reason.  I decided to check it out again today....regretting that decision.  Might as well just rename this sub the_donald because that is all it is these days.

       It's pretty sad seeing rational political discourse die. Both The Donald and any Hilary leaning subs are hopelessly divided. Conservatives immediately dismissed as racists/etc while liberals dismissed as "cucks". HRC supporters who say they support democracy scheming how to deny Trump electoral votes. Trump supporters gloating every chance they get.

       Well we are already supposedly attacking ISIS in order to bring peace, so not a great argument. We are actually supporting them, so if he did actually attack them he might be able to actually achieve something. Doubtful, but not arming them might be a good first step.

       So if someone who's down in almost every poll and has an unprecedented level of opposition for a presidential candidate wins the election, it's proof the system works?

       If that happens there's probably something wrong.

       I feel we have all learnt that even when clear evidence is provided publicly which should place a number of powerful people before a judge that nothing happens. We understand just the kind of strength the mainstream media holds as well as those in power.

       When I Google into both Clinton and Trump I see nothing on the corrupt CF, Podesta, Pedo rings etc. This election really has concluded for me that most of society is dumbed down, brainwashed and too sensitive! People hate in what someone says on camera (Trump) over what someone does off camera (Clinton).

       I got the sense that the FBI brought this up again, with the intention ahead of time to "close the case" again before the election, thereby reassuring the uninformed proletariat that there's nothing to see here, move along, and vote for your queen.

       Was scanning The_Donald and there was a post indicating that the NYPD was told to hand over all materials relating to their investigation and to stop the investigation.  So, basically, the FBI opened their own investigation so they could stop the NYPD investigation and confiscate all the evidence.

       This is pretty typical protocol. However, quite sly if this whole thing was done specifically to stop the NYPD investigation. I have my doubts about this because the NYPD probably weren't going to get anywhere with those emails anytime soon and they also weren't going to get anywhere in general because they weren't going to get access to the emails and other evidence the FBI already had. There would be no way to cross check anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true, it may be a power move by the FBI to get the emails and other evidence in their position, and their position only. The FBI has a better ability to keep that stuff safe without anything leaking. There is probably more damning stuff in those emails other than a couple being classified.

       I'm not even going to touch Trump being good for America, but I would assume the FBI cleared Hillary for the fact that Comey wants to keep his job. I don't think it was ever planned to investigate further with the new emails. He wrote the letter specifically so it would be leaked and cause controversy.

       It was the move to make, when you think about it. I mean, by all accounts, a lot of people at the NYPD knew about the emails and about the fact that they'd been turned over to the FBI. If you're Comey, what do you do? Wait till the information is leaked by the NYPD and have a situation where it looks like the FBI now has double the amount of emails they initially had and are trying to keep it on the down low, or give the appearance of being totally forward and transparent by announcing it before anyone else does, knowing fully well that you'll whitewash HRC a second time before the election? It's a pretty easy choice.

       Choice is an illusion. By holding elections and allowing us to vote; gives all of us the illusion our choices matter. They don't. The next president has already been chosen for us. "It’s called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it" George Carlin

       Of course they are. Bill was the one who told Trump to run. They just spent the last year telling us how different the other was and how evil the other was. I sure hope you don't think Trump is going to make good on his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton.

       One politician being manipulated by a cult makes sense. there is evidence, it's happened many times before. Rasputin being the prime example.

       arguing that dozens if not hundreds of high level politicians are all in on a child kidnapping/molesting occult society with the bare minimum of evidence is ridiculous.

       I am saddened by the rhetoric at University of Michigan... Everyone is so pro-Hillary and so fearful of Trump, that if you bring up the fact that the election is rigged, not real, or that she's a criminal etc. you just get ostracized.

       Anyone who votes Hillary is functionally retarded. I'm not saying vote for Trump, but there's more than enough information and evidence to prove Hillary guilty of several federal crimes. It's ridiculously obvious how hard the state department and Obama have been covering for her and slowing down investigations, which is only more suspicious given the fact that lying Obama is directly implicated in her coverup of Benghazi and her email server in which he was found to have communicated on under a pseudonym.

       I'm not American, but I can assure you that this looks utterly bizarre from my viewpoint too. You have a woman, who is obviously a criminal, running for office and nobody is brave enough to stop her. This is the kind of shit you expect to see in the most corrupt nations in Africa, but not in the US. Don't get me wrong, I'm not naive enough to think that corruption isn't rife in all governments, but this is taking it to a whole new level. They are flaunting it right out in the open, for the whole world to see.

       What do you mean "brave enough to stop her"? Hillary is part of a powerful national (and international) political faction. She has a tremendous amount of political capital and appears to be spending it wisely. There are also a number of questionable deaths amongst those that stood in her way or represented some threat. So maybe it's not bravery that's keeping people from stopping her.

       If this election has taught me anything, it's how fucked the world really is and how little people seem to care. I honestly feel SO deflated about the whole thing it's unreal . All the evidence that's come to light, it's all there in black and white and it's all been completely brushed under the carpet and nothing is going to be done. That and the amount of ignorant people who just say oh it's fake or I don't care I still want Hilary to win is mind boggling. The things she has done and will continue to do with no consequences is just astounding. How the hell has it come to this? What went wrong with humanity that money, power and greed is more important than what's right? It really does just seem like we are completely powerless and just have to put up with it because they have money and so many people will turn a blind eye if the price is right.

       What is rarely understood is that far too many of us are in a position where the choice is protest or eat. Skip work to occupy and you will be fired, homeless and without healthcare.

      <p>
       I'm of the belief that more must be done for sure but the system is designed around helplessness this way. It's terrible but I believe it holds the key to retribution. Make them helpless and the fight can begin.

       I think more important than job security situations involved in protesting in the US is something that no one ever talks about: The US is enormous for one country, with an enormous population. We don't have a few major cities to protest in, we have dozens or hundreds spread out over several thousand miles and also seperated by wide gulfs of culture (relatively speaking).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if mass protests occur in the capital city, that's just one place representing a tiny fraction of the population. The coordination required is nigh impossible by itself, ignoring the motivation required.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same reason the style of democratic socialism practiced in much of Europe is just
       <em>
        not possible
       </em>
       on the US scale, in my opinion.

       I actually think live protesting is old fashioned and counter productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what they do at protests now? Collect surveillance on the protestors, plant false dissidents who break shit, and then use said incidence to delegitimize the issue at hand, and increase surveillance laws and further militarization of the police. No thanks. I don't feel like getting a faceful of pepper spray, water gunned, or arrested for expressing my first amendment right.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, the goal of protests were to call attention to a subject, so that the media would report on it and get others to care. We no longer require the media to bestow importance on information, thank God. We also don't have to physically assemble in order to disperse information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ergo, protests are useless. We are not lazy for not engaging in them; we're just smarter.

       Are you kidding me? What exactly would
       <em>
        protest
       </em>
       accomplish? If it were a non-violent protest we would be shrugged off &amp; dismissed as "crazy sore losers" by the media and the sheeple who believe the media. Not only that, but most people can't afford to take off of work to spend time "protesting." Many of us have families to care for that need food and a safe place to live. If violent protest - the military is more than prepared for that, and the elite would love that more than anything because they would get to unleash their baby - martial law. That would be their dream come true. Sorry, but I don't advocate putting people's lives in danger just to most likely make the situation worse. The corruption is too severe and average Americans are
       <em>
        utterly incapable
       </em>
       of successfully rebelling against this nation's military. This isn't the 1800s. They have weapons far beyond what we're capable of attaining as average citizens. You don't know what you're talking about.

       It would show them that there is zero fear in The People, which is all I can grasp from your comment - fear.

       It would also accomplish much more than sitting at home liking and disliking Facebook comments or upvoting and downvoting Reddit threads and their comments.

       Unfortunately we are victims of a society that tells our history operates in a most Carlylean way. "Great men move history" is what we are subliminally taught and being that we aren't one of them learned helplessness takes over as we wait for a hero. We wait for an MLK, we wait for Ghandi, we wait for Jesus Damn Christ when if we were to change the paradigms we simply need those willing to fight the good fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need someone willing to die for the cause and those types are in short supply when the populace is well fed and entertained. You have too much to live for to be the spark, to preform that all important act. I don't believe I am the person to do it either due to cowardice or otherwise but every bit of me wants it to happen.

       If it was organized well enough and had enough support it could absolutely be done. It would take many thousands of people but it could happen. If enough people were committed and effectively communicated their intentions to the general public, the fence sitters would join in and the movement would grow. No not everyone can afford to protest but there are a lot of people who just feel it isn't worth the financial burden they would take on to do it. If they saw enough other people doing it, they might join in.

       If you got enough people to do it sure, but you won't. The best course of action is mass organized protest on the capital. They won't admit it, but the jails are overcrowded as it is. They can only "arrest" so many people before they have to start thinking of a better solution. Force the government to shut down. Block them from getting to their jobs, shut down the streets around government facilities and make them listen. The international media, corrupt or not, will have no choice but to cover it. Refuse to cease and desist until they take action. Do not get violent but don't back down. Make them call the police and then the Army. If they continue to escalate the situation with weapons and violence, the outside world, (Other first-world countries), will get involved. If there is enough outrage, they will have no choice but to give in.

       If everyone stopped paying taxes, the feds would just print more money.  Taxes only fund local governments.  Federal taxes are there to ensure you (a) have less income and (b) to force people to use their currency.

       From what i believe Trump will win so they can blame the economic collapse on him and conservatives.If Hillary does get in they need to start WW3 as an excuse for the economic collapse.They cannot keep the current economic system up for a full term, no way in hell.

       I disagree. You are right that they can't avoid the economic collapse, but they can go to war with Russia to mitigate the consequences. They need Hillary in office to do that.

       Well the next day after the election is 11/9.
Numerologically that is an excellent day for a large stock market crash which would happen in the event of a Trump win.
Gonna be an interesting few months whoever wins.

       It should also be noted that John Kerry is in fucking Antarctica until the 13th. That seems highly suspicious to me, as it looks like he's protecting himself from something. Suffice to say, you could be right. I'm finding this one extremely hard to call.

       The strength of the US Dollar as a world currency is dependent on being used to pay for oil.That is a huge part of what the middle east war is about now.The USA is currently losing the wars in the middle east, the petrodollar is in grave danger of losing it's status.When that happens expect very high inflation.

      </p>
      <pre><code>someone that is a complete LIAR
someone funded by SAUDI ARABIA (worst state in Middle East - funding lots of radicals)
someone who has HUMA ABEDIN (ties to Radical Islam) in the team
someone who funds personal things from her foundation
someone who was psycho-happy that Khadaffi was KILLED like a dog (I wonder what Americans would feel like if Obama was killed in the same fashion - no trial no nothing)
someone who wants war with RUSSIA

       The thing is most people don't know, or won't know if they're trapped in the work/student debt/mainstream news cycles. And if they have heard of these, they'll probably dismiss you. And even if they don't dismiss you, you have to inform them about so much &amp; about such complicated issues in a concise yet logical way that doesn't lean too partisan. Not playing Devils Advocate with you, but that's how hard it is. Most people don't even know about Qadaffi or about Wikileaks

       BEST OUTCOME: HRC is elected then impeached within her first couple years. It's a win-win all around: No Trump. First woman elected. HRC and WJC get to be twinsies with that little impeach asterisk after their name in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       BEST OUTCOME BONUS: Republican party goes the way of the Whigs and is replaced by something resembling rational (or not) and DNC leadership implodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       MOST BOLD OUTCOME: No change.
      </p>
      <p>
       MOST BOLD OUTCOME BONUS: Kardashians get another ten seasons. Oh, and decapitation becomes legal in the NFL to avoid brain injury lawsuits.

       The fix is probably in via voting machine fraud. Its unaccountable so they wont get caught. Like Assange said, "Trump won't be
       <em>
        permitted
       </em>
       to win", meaning the establishment already coronated her and all of this was a formality, she will magically win despite having record low voter enthusiasm.

       For all the times i said it would never happen, that clinton was pre selected, i must say i was wrong. At some point, the powers that be realized they couldn't keep up the damage control, and bailed on her. Feels good to stand corrected! I apologize to the people whose hopefulness i cynically disregarded with defeatism.

       So many friends ( on Facebook and real life) are so upset right now about the way this election turned out. I am thinking of deleting Facebook for the mere fact that so many of these people refuse to see how much more evil hrc was and that she should of been thrown in jail months ago. Is it right that someone can be so vocal about hrc and not anyone else? Should I feel ashamed that I can't support/ join in their frustration that their corrupted messiah didn't win? In a way it's like hrc won the election considering all the posts im seeing on fb right now. I don't know who to side with or show compassion to. Shouldn't we all be happy that a criminal didn't take office? It's very depressing for me to see these people who I care very much about, who I call my closest companions, who I have shared life with, so lost and blind about the world around them. I have this yearning to share the posts  that i see up on r/conspiracy with these people but i don't want them to judge me and think I'm some sort of traitor to my own country. Even though a criminal didn't win and knowing this time around that justice might finally be served, I can't share this relief amongst my social circle and this to me is even more defeating than a criminal taking office because I feel like I'm the criminal even though I did not vote for either trump or Hillary. Tonight, I will fall asleep with an internal joy though bittersweet and especially silent because I was not born blind, but with an ability to see the world differently. The world works in mysterious ways and tonight was proof of that. Maybe tonight was planned, maybe it wasn't but it goes to show that we ought to start putting our belief, our strength, and our worries into something that's more true. What that truth is, I don't really know right now but at least we have 4 years to figure it out. Sorry for the long rant but I really had no where else to go or talk to. It's especially comforting to know that some of you might be feeling like this too. Thanks for listening.

       I feel you 100 percent. I was on a huge high last night (actually very early this morning) and as soon as I posted the victory, the negativity began. I went to my feed, and Trump supporters were happy but kept it classy. Totally different story with the others. I ended up closing fb and coming back here to see the optimism and hope I felt before. We can't let them take that away from us.

       I had to take a break from r/The_Donald because some of these people are fucking delusional.
I want Trump to win as I know Hillary is the worst you can get but some of the posters there have no clue that this election is getting stolen as we speak. They are flooding the forums with posts just saying "landslide!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if every eligible person in America had one honest vote then Trump wins all day. I think most of the fraud will be done in Florida because they can keep it isolated to that state and they know it is a must win for Trump.

       I'm an independent who mostly has progressive views but I can't stand like 90% of progressive people. They are so damn regressive with how they try and do things. You don't agree with their opinion than you're some kind of ism/ist insult, and they will go out of their way to fuck your life up by getting you fired from your job and publicly shaming you. I fucking loathe the Clintons but the only place to get anti Clinton news is by shifting through that shit show over at The Donald. They are delusional. So much so I honestly think CTR realized this, and they are the ones spamming landslide and the other mumbo jumbo shit coming from there. Egging on their behavior and making them look that delusional.

       This isn't a conspiracy, it's a goddamn shit show, we all know crooked Hillarbilly will get crowned despite the votes, and if Trump does get elected he'll be holding his brains Kennedy style for establishment crony Pence to take over.

       In the end this whole drama soaked emotional campaign of psyops and mass misinformation will be glossed over by tomorrow or Thursday.

       I really wish our vote could elect someone who could impart meaningful change, someone who has the best interests of the people at large. Centralized government is too disconnected from the people it rules, power needs to be disseminated in smaller pockets, where the people that have it can interact with those who support them at a community level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's to 4 more years of increased debt, more wars, more taxes, bigger government, and more secret government cover-ups. In other words, business as usual, regardless of who gets elected, because guess what, the people we elect don't make the rules. They never have, and they never will, the president, and our elected representatives are slaves and PR men for the real rulers.

       How utterly hated do you have to be as a candidate, and how incompetent and self serving do your party and your corrupt cronies have to be to lose against a baboon with a comb over? You had Bernie, you stupid morons, and you chose the one everyone hates. Once again America can't be trusted with as much as a piece of string. Someone call the Queen, it's time to make that place a colony again. You lot are clearly unfit to self-govern and all of the CTR idiots, who so smuggly hjacked r politics and ruined the place for everyone have done their part towards this. Seeing them fail feels so good but seeing Trump and not Bernie win makes me sick.

       It's finally here, and boy have I been dreading this day.

      <p>
       Tomorrow we will have a corrupt treasonous lying bitch as our new president despite it all.

       I'm not a Trump fan by any means, but thinking about Clinton being the next president after cheating her way to this point (not to mention everything else)  truly saddens me. The bitch should be in jail.

       Feelings of change are enveloping the nation at the moment and it's hard not getting caught up in it all, but when you are honest with yourself and take a good look at the situation it's easy to see we are not headed towards any positive change and things will most likely be getting worse. Which sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, maybe Trump will win and he really is everything the people over at T_D say he is. I'm not holding my breath though.

       Many round here feel like voting is pointless, and it probably is. But the way I look at it that you're not really losing anything by going out and doing it, and on the off chance your ballot doesn't land on a small fire somewhere, well at least you cast your vote.

       Let me just say this. In that article where the cameraman after a Matt Lauer interview alleged that she flipped out because he asked the wrong question, she supposedly said "if he wins we all hang from nooses." If there is truth to that, that says to me that she doesn't think they can rig it to a degree where it is impossible to lose.

       I see one of three things that are almost guaranteed to happen when Clinton is installed as president:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         She will escalate things so bad with Russia that nuclear war will break out. She will keep pushing "missile defense systems" capable of launching missiles all the way to Moscow so close to their border that they will feel threatened and snap. I wouldn't blame them either. I can't imagine how Putin feels towards the West. Our leaders literally do not negotiate and use diplomacy. It's war first, talk later. Hillary has said herself several times that she will go hard on Russia. She is an evil war hawk, no doubt about it. At least Trump has talked about de-escalating tensions with them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There will be massive reports and evidence of voter fraud which will make people so mad that they'll actually do something. Massive riots all over the country and a policeman will end up killing some unarmed kid which will then provoke retaliation. The Second American Civil War. Another more plausible scenario is that Clinton will go hard on the Second Amendment and provoke protests and riots that way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another 9/11 false flag attack on the USA to get people to forget everything and go back to the way things were. Another Iraq  War, millions more dead in the name of "fighting terrorism". This cycle will continue, and decades later, through the use of new technology and more complex social conditioning, people will be so dumb and sedated that they'll give up all of their rights without resistance, starting with the 2nd. The few true patriots left in the country that fight back will be labeled as crazy evil terrorists and be shot down. Brave New World.
        </p>

       The election will be "pre-determined." The technology exists to do it, and so it will be done. 9/11 was the coup that started it all, the most perceptive among the intelligentsia caught on quickly and were outright co-opted or have generally independently accepted their condition as "peons" who are just along for the ride. Life is a spectacle decided and projected by the establishment elite and realized by the relevant sectors of the economy (media, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, etc.): so just enjoy the "movie" and hope at most for a well-enough paying job while doing it. "Reality" (that antiquated concept)--possibly not even the elites care for/can keep track of it at this point.

       “They say we need more money for education. That’s the big answer to everything, education. They say we need more money for books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools, and more testing for the kids, and they’ll say, well we tried all of that, and the kids still can’t pass the tests. Don’t worry about that, because we’re going to lower the passing grades, and that’s what they do in a lot of these schools. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass – more kids pass, the school looks goods, and the IQ of the country slips another 2 or 3 points. And pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a pencil. Got a pencil? Then get in there, it’s physics!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people wonder why 17 other countries graduate more scientist than we do. Education – politicians use that word, they use it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind 3 things: the flag, the bible, and children – no child left behind, no child left behind. Oh, really it wasn’t too long ago you were talking about giving children a head start. Head start – left behind, someone’s losing ground here, but there’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. There’s a reason education sucks, and it’s the same reason it’ll never ever be fixed – it’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you got, because the owners of this country don’t want that. I’m talking about the real owners now. The wealthy big business interests that controls things, and makes all the important decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget the politicians, they’re irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of choice – you don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and payed for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media, so they control just about all the information you get. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying – lobbying, to get what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Well we know what they want. They want more for themselves, and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want – they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that – that doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests. That’s right. They don’t want people that are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table, and think about how badly they’re getting screwed by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? Obedient workers – Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines, and do that paper work. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and vanishing pension that disappear the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your social security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it – they’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this place. It’s a big club, and you aint in it. You, and I are not in The Big Club.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest hard working people: white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard working people continue (these are people of modest being) – continue to elect these rich douchebags who don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t give a fuck about you – they don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t care about you at all – at all – at all, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s what the owners counted on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white, and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth. It’s called the American Dream cause you have to be asleep to believe it.”

       Maybe Soros is playing a game he knows he can't lose. Either Clinton gets elected and he gets more control in US.

       Or if Trump gets elected, it gives him the option to make more money with the currency(if dollar crashes like with the Brexit), or it will destabilize the nation.

       I googled:  Voting Results 2016

      <p>
       A live Google feed will come up.  If you select:  President --&gt; Popular Vote, you can see how well they're doing.  It isn't a breakdown by state, but you can extrapolate from the numbers given and figure it out.

       In case you were wondering, 3rd party is getting crucified.  No matter how ridiculous the Dems and Reps get, somehow everyone still votes for them.  This is a herd mentality I'll never understand.

       Likewise. Not the boot camp part but the nervous part. I get anxious but the nerves I'm feeling now are different. I hope we're wrong man, but logic says they may try something to get attention off the complete and total shitstorm brewing with all the pedo/satanic/occult stuff.

       They could commit fraud if there wasn't a massive turnout from Trump supporters. There was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was never able to overwhelm the fraud against him with numbers because of the nature of the primaries, and because of apathy from Dem voters.

       There are certain media sources that are pushing this "civil unrest" fear...basically, whatever my parents and in-laws are reading is pushing it, because every phone call, they ask about it...one day it was "will people riot" and another day it was "will there be a terrorist attack?" It's fear to get them to vote Trump...and unfortunately, it's working pretty well. Our parents don't read anything but links from Drudge or Breitbart no matter how much we try to get them to use multiple sources to vet the information they're getting.

       So Trump leads after that small town in NH just voted. Pack it up boys we did it! But no we know Hilary will win. It's been a faux movie the whole time and a lot of use ate it up regardless. And we'll do the same thing 4 years from now if we make it that far

       Never voted until this year's primary debates. Voted for Sanders , not because I believed in him, but because I thought maybe there was a chance they couldn't steal it if enough people voted against Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voted Stein today.  Here's why...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't believe in this candidate  (or my vote being counted for that matter)
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to believe Trump is the anti establishment Messiah,  but I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is an absolute monster but nothing we've done, nor the mountain of evidence against her, has stopped her or swayed the lemmings that will vote for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read on this sub that if the green party gets x% of votes they have to appear at the convention next time (or something like that)
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone close to me specifically stated that they wouldn't vote green because they voted Nader during the Gore vs Bush election and they believe it cost Gore the election.  I'm really not sure if a vote for Stein is a vote for Clinton or a vote for Trump. I don't know which of the two my vote is (hypothetically) helping but I hope my vote for Stein is hurting Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope is that my vote, if counted , will lead to this x% being met, forcing a third party into the limelight next time around.
I really can't believe in spite of everything we still couldn't get people to snap out of their A or B ONLY mentality this time around. There were SO many reasons to try something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting, I live in CA and  I'm fairly certain I was given a provisional ballot during the primary.  Me and a lot of friends (some who have voted and some who haven't in the past) were all mailed ballots back in May/June even though this had never happened to any of us before. A lot of us went to our polling places.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Reddit Conspiracy so I'm pretty sure everyone is up to date on the theory that all of the Bernie votes that were provisional were tossed. Today I went to the polling place and was told that I had requested an absentee balot. The next three people who came in were also told this. Once again,  I was given a provisional ballot.

       I agree with a lot of what you are saying. I also voted Stein but I do like her platform. The percentage is 5%. They get a $10 million federal grant next year and something else I can't remember off the top of my head.

       I feel like the fix has been in on this one for a long time so getting to that 5% mark would be the closest thing to a victory of sorts.  Thanks for clearing up the percentage and the reward for reaching it!

       Hillary can be impeached, and we'll get Kaine. Trump can be brought down with a flick, and we'll get Pence. It's too late now, since polls are mostly closed, but it's sort of one of those things where you need to look at the veeps and composition of the cabinet to decide.

       It is incredibly unlikely for Trump supporters to get the president they want. The first point to note is that, if Trump were truly anti-establishment and had any chance to win in fair elections, he would probably not have been allowed to run by the Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, the American and international oligarchy has chosen Hillary, so a fair vote in honest elections is highly unlikely. If the elections are not rigged sufficiently and Trump does win (which is a giant if), AND he is actually anti-establishment, then he will probably be assassinated or neutralized in some other way.

       In Indiana, Trump is up 70% to 26. Wolf Blitzer says "Trump maintains a significant lead over Clinton".

       Gotta look at the number of votes - they projected an easy win in Indiana, but the 70% to 26% was with less than 1% of the vote in. It's down to 63/32 now that 12% vs 1% are in. But still, Trump will take Indiana and that's no surprise to anyone (but by the time all results are in, they'll be closer).

       Maybe a new theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any shot they give Trump the presidency in exchange for letting Hillary and Bill and Podesta "disappear". Maybe some sort of pardon? I know Trump isn't leading the charge into digging up their corruption, but he certainly shined a huge light on them which caused a lot of Americans to wake up.

       Here's what I mean: Clinton will be our next president.  It doesn't matter who voted for whom.  Votes are being switched around and the electoral college will vote any damn way it pleases.  But Trump will get the popular vote in the country.  He gets the one thing that SHOULD matter, but still loses.

       The electors don't get to vote any way they please. Many of the states require the electors to vote for the popular winner, and many states allow the parties to bond electors to the party. There aren't very many "free" electors.

       If Bernie rightfully got the nod over Clinton, I imagined more Clinton supporters would back him over the current situation of Bernie voters backing her. Reason being Bernie would have won fair and square and Clinton voters would not mind voting for him to stop Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the current reality is that many people are NOT voting for Clinton as former Berners, because why would they? The primary was stolen from them? The DNC wanted their golden hag to win it all.

       Plus, her campaign manager and his affiliates are into pedophilia and spirit cooking. Not that I care but I'm not really into that stuff. Bernie's chance was stolen and the wikileaks prove that the DNC rigged the primaries. Either way, Trump in my eyes is decently better than Hilary and her warmongering. Not that presidents have full control over every policy making decision but still.

       I'm happy on a really visceral level that Clinton's getting a run for her money, and on many levels I'm gonna be happy as hell that she doesn't win, if only to restore my faith in our ability to actually choose shit in this country, but god damn if I'm not terrified of what a Trump presidency will look like with his vows to impede green initiatives and progress against climate change.

       It baffles my brain just how out of touch the media are with the people in 2016. As a UK citizen I can tell you it was exactly the same with Brexit from the BBC. The people have spoken in their masses yet they still continue with their warped and biased agendas.

       Forget them. The mainstream media sold the last of it's meagre credibility in a last ditch all out propaganda war for Hillary.

       The heroes of this election are the alt and indie media who kept it real throughout the campaign and provided people with a counterpoint when the entire global media was providing only one monolithic viewpoint. The MSMs collusion and blatant bias has done nothing except ensure the rise of indie and citizen media... Internet killed the news corporation.

       Alex Jones can be a moron sometimes, but his site is more accurate than most of the msm.  I read a WAPO article this afternoon that picked winners and losers and they admitted that they were losers but in the same sentence denied bias.  Un be lievable

       Yes, the man who was in bed with the Clintons until a few years ago will win in a seemingly rigged election. Elections aren't about winning everyone over, it's about winning just enough and throwing enough shit towards the other person to get by as their voters jump ship. Trump loses nothing by getting slandered by Clinton. There's a reason why the more popular he got, the more outlandish things he said. His job was never to try and win, it was just to destroy the credibility of the GOP (Jeb is ruined, Rubio probably wont win back his Senate seat, lying Ted is mostly tarnished) and make Hillary look good by comparison as he made himself look like a fool and took a bunch of shit.

       When people get on here and claim the NWO/Zionists/Illuminati run the world and that the election is already fixed do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believe they only had one candidate and that Trump is some sort of messiah? It boggles my mind that one of the most fraudulent and arrogant men in the world has managed to convince large groups of people that he is a holy pariah, free of all political sin and that he's here to wash away the sins of the establishment and MAGA!
       <br/>
       On the Hillary side I also find it interesting that people have so much faith in the FBI when they have been confirmed to have MURDERED MLK and all the dastardly deeds done in COINTELPRO including murdering Black Panthers.

       Of course they still do. But let me give you some insight on something that will expose the contradictions on the other side. You know how you have all these Trump supporters or people against Hillary saying the DOJ is corrupt? How on one hand can they call them corrupt yet cite the FBI studies about blacks and crime? You would think that they would know that the stats they're citing are limited (because of the way the FBI collects and how they collect from) and that the BJS, which is a part of the DOJ, would have the most stats (and they do).
      </p>
      <p>
       So the hypocrisy is uncanny with these people, I've never seen anything like it before in my life.

       Why It's Better for Clinton to Win:
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long time I thought Trump would be better.  But hear me out why Clinton might actually be the better president.  Trump is pulling an Obama on us.  Once in he won't do what we hope, and then the "left" is going to rage and rage about social issues (sexism/race/lgbt) instead of government/war/corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Clinton wins then the "left" will magically think all the social issues are solved and have nothing else to focus on except war/corruption.  Scary Trump will no longer be a reason to turn a blind eye to Clinton.  So with Trump we will get a defusement of the population and only anger at trivial/divisive issues.  With Clinton the anger will stay directed at the real problems.  Because neither candidate will actually fix things, so I feel maybe we are being played with Trump as another Obama, to pacify the right this time.  Trump would actually be a brilliant move for the globalists if this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Disclaimer: I would never vote for a neocon like Clinton nor encourage you to.  Just reflecting on the benefits of the likely outcome.)

       I love watching the newscasters stumble around trying to avoid saying that Trump has a lead, referring to him as the republican and then breaking in with Hillary Clinton has won...or has a considerable lead in....I don't give a toss who wins but it is so blatantly manipulated that it's disgusting. My only joy is watching them squirm as Trump slowly picks them off. It's like they are off script.

       I think a tie could be forced and then Clinton is in. It would make sense that theyd have a fallback plan in case things went downhill. I bet HRC has a few states in her back pocket to keep trump from getting the 270. Then it goes to a house vote which puts her in

       Correct... but there has to be a large portion of the agent workforce that do not agree with what they have seen.

       I predict this will go down like the RICO case in The Dark Knight... with Comey being the Harvey Dent... I believe in Comey. I've looked long and hard at him and his decisions. I think he is prolly fuckin' super-legit.

       Each states get a certain amount of votes in the electoral college.  Because we use the electoral college, and not the popular vote, the election is won on a state by state basis.  Win the big "swing" states and win the election.

       Sam Wang via Princeton Election Consortium: "11:44pm: The business about 65%, 91%, 93%, 99% probability is a sideshow. Instead, the key point here is that the entire polling industry – public, campaign-associated, aggregators – ended up with data that missed tonight’s results by a very large margin. There is now the question of understanding how a mature industry could have gone so wrong. And of course, most of all, there is the shock of a likely Trump presidency."

       I was sitting down talking with my mother about this few months ago. I remember saying that: "In the event that Trump wins presidency and Hillary doesn't, HRC and every other Elite organization out there will have strings on him just as soon as he gets inaugurated, if not now. We were so busy worrying about Hillary's shit and exploiting her, we didn't stop and think maybe this what they want us to and this is how its going to be planned out." Not particularly worried if he wins, all race issues and ignorance aside, I'm more so worried on the time span from now to January and the FFs, riots, and eventual martial law that's going to come with it, if a nuke doesn't happen first.

       I live in Texas and I seriously hope that jobs open up because he kicks the illegals out and im damn serious about that. You could not believe the amount of money these illegals make. I mean I am a law abiding us navy vet and I get 10hr (at least when I was working construction related jobs) and they got brand new trucks, 17 hr, 80 hours every week. I got a broke down truck that i wore the transmission out on because I had to use it for work. It pisses me off so bad. Also they are thieves and that shit aint cool either.

       Right now, he's got a 1.3% lead in PA (AP called it for him already). He's got 1.8% lead in MI. He's up by 4.1% in AZ, and 15% in AK. Usually, those numbers hold pretty steady when you're over 80% of the vote count, like all but AK are right now.

      <p>
       A shadowy figure is behind it all.

      <p>
       <em>
        Someone

       hacked the DNC.

      <p>
       This
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       could easily have sown seeds of discord within the Dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Someone
       </em>
       provided Wikileaks with that data.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Someone
       </em>
       got the FBI to announce the second email batch right before election, despite complete peer discouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Someone
       </em>
       is an evil mastermind who got Clinton to kill off Bernie's campaign, and the US to elect a potentially impeachable PotUS.

      <p>
       Trump did not look happy. A few possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. Hillary made the elites mad. So they decided to give it to Trump.
B. Trump made them mad. So they decided to give it to Trump.
C. Possibly a third-term for Obama, so it won't matter.

       My theory.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        PA was TRUMP's 1-2 hours before they called it. You had commentators saying things like, PA is going to go TRUMP's way, but we're not calling it yet.
       </li>
       <li>
        The NYT suddenly changed their percent of vote counted in PA from 98% to 89% about 1/2 hr before they called it
       </li>
       <li>
        hillary did not concede.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Dow Jones was down 800 pts.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then TRUMP got a call from the Rothchilds or other global elitist political donor insider oligarch.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said, we have people in PA who will turn the election for us. We will tank the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       And TRUMP had to cut a deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the 1-2 hour delay in calling PA. TRUMP was deal-making with the global elites.

       What is there to say at this point? I haven't heard one issue discussed for thirty seconds on or in mainstream media except for the two primary candidates' top talk point:
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC: DJT sucks
       <br/>
       DJT: HRC sucks far more than I do
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. The most informed folks I know think we are in the decline phase of the empire and this is an election choice between Nero and Caligula.

       Just saw a "Trump gets booed at his polling station" story. Probably planted by Clinton's campaign. I wouldn't put it past them, given that they sent people to his rallies to incite violence.

       Good point, but the amount of fuckery the Clinton campain, DNC, and MSM have pulled this election cycle just causes me to automatically ignore anything they say as false and jump straight to a "it was planned/rigged" mindset. I can't help it. The crock of shit they have stewed up has just completely turned me off of what they have to say, and I am definitely not the only one.

       A razor thin defeat was promised to Trump to make his "services" worth his while, he becomes an even bigger celebrity as a result of his razor thin loss: more money more business. He comes out "bigly" despite his loss.

       I was certain that TBPB will puch HRC through with North Korea style 160% votes. Either Trump is for real and they couldn't do anything about it (which explains HRC not showing up to give a speech at her HQ - she wasn't prepared for that), or the rabbit hole is way deeper than we think.

       I think rigging 50 contests simultaneously in one evening was a tall order. They focused on strategic states but the gap between HRC and Trump was larger margin than they could cover reasonably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there was a last minute grab contemplated for PA, because at 2:30ish the AP
       <em>
        amended
       </em>
       the number of precincts reports from 98% to 89%. It was odd as fuck and talking heads were talking about absentee ballots possibly tipping the results towards Clinton. A few minutes later they walked it back and definitively confirmed Trump won the state.

       Yeah I've heard of the PA shmuckery. Also explains why the news outlets didn't call it until the last minute, even when it was way past the point of no return. And then had absolutely nothing to say other than "he won, I don't believe it."

       It's simple really, they never had to rig a national election. There was never anything at stake for the biggest elites, anyone unfriendly to them was always filtered out before. And they couldn't get anything votes couldn't beat ready in time when the media tricks didn't work.

       Although I feel relieved that Trump won the election instead of Hillary, I wouldn't be suprised if TPTB has something in store to enrage the already pissed off masses all over the country into civil unrest. I have a feeling that the global elites and the mainstream media will blame upcoming false flags events and financial turmoil on Donald Trump. It's going to be an interesting 4 years.

       If nothing else I'm glad a lot of people, who previously dismissed the corruption as mere  conspiracy, have had their eyes opened to exactly how corrupt media, government and business interests are. In Hillary, we have the perfect node to link up all the interlinking pieces. And it's for that and that alone that I thank her. I hope she wins... that's the only way she'll be held to account. Think about it - Hillary Clinton. President of America. Getting grilled in congress about the CF. You have ambitious republicans with careers to launch, as well as older heads with scores to settle. Not to mention Bernie. I need one of you guys to tell me I'm not just being wilfully naive when I say that the real reckoning will come once she's won. Just lay it on me .. I can take it.

       She'll be President of the United States. Just look at what she was able elude just being the wife of a former President who himself was impeached and you tell me she won't get away with EVERYTHING. If Hillary wins, she wins. At this point I'm fairly certain she only wants the presidency so she can pardon herself.

       Not arguing that they're much different, but the wedding thing means very little.
      </p>
      <p>
       People attend weddings of those they know professionally or who run in the same circles all the time. Weddings are one of those "polite" events where you attend to network and make an appearance even if you have no particular attachment to the bride/groom. You go to be seen, especially true of weddings of the rich and powerful.

       Wikileaks has amply demonstrated oligarchy rules; the Democratic party has become the preferred choice of said oligarchy (Republicans are dragged down by retrograde baggage in comparison). The Democratic party through the magic of predictive analytics not only anticipated, but created the main strategic geography of this election, right down to the ex-nihilo “Pied Piper” persona of Donald Trump (again per Wikileaks’ revelations). The purpose, besides winning of course, is twofold, use the creation of the strategic geography to control, indeed “drive” the election to the desired outcome; to present said strategic geography as alibi in the case of an even more controlled and technically pre-determined outcome–in which case the aforesaid alibi of the magic of predictive analytics serves to mask the outright falsity of the election results.

       Perhaps, but probably not on either country's own soil.  I think the US will get more aggressive in every country Russia is meddling with, and the number of those countries will go up.  Call it a luke-warm war.

       You know, maybe Trump can shake things up and make it interesting. I can't believe he is leading right now. I thought Hilary would have a red carpet laid out to the White House but this is kinda proof that the votes are not rigged all the time. How could Trump be a part of the plan? So much potential for fuckery.

       There's a chance Republicans could win all 3 tonight. Presidency,  Houuse and Senate. Does that speak towards the shift in change in voting in the USA? We may have not won the war, but in future years we could win!

       I see a Hillary Presidency as an exercise in cautious incrementalism on the part of the NWO. They know they dodged a bullet. People are waking up too fast. They've been too aggressive this millennium. I see them slowing down and letting things cool down.

       A few questions: How does a presidential pardon work? Can Obama pardon Hillary if she loses (not likely, just entertain the idea), in order to try and cover his own ass because he is, at the very least, implicated in the server scandal? Or can the president only pardon people if they have charges against them?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary does win, I don't think Obama will pardon her at all because she'll be able to pardon herself once she's in and pardoning her would only make him look suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible at all that the rank and file of the FBI know this and are planning on letting her steal the election so that they can have evidence of intent and then also execution, and then timing her arrest for the moment of transition of power, so that Obama can't pardon anyone, and she won't have had any time to pardon herself?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just my random, probably too hopeful thoughts this morning.

       I don't think you could get away with pardoning yourself.  And federal pardons can't be given in cases of impeachment.

       This election is one big distraction. Everyone is focused on it. Guess what happens when you aren't looking. Atrocity. There will be no news of the DAPL protest today. They don't want you to hear it. But it will be a great time and excuse for them to take out people who oppose them through death or prison. Just wait. If and when they are heard from again, it will have gotten much worse.

       I put $1300 on HRC last night so that I can take my winnings and invest it in trying to get a re-vote or re-count. I pray to God I lose this bet tonight though. I will be so fucking happy.

       Would be an interesting 4 years of Trump wins. I'm from the UK, so with us leaving the EU and Trump being in power over in the US, it will make for chaos. In an odd way (if trump wins), I think it shows that the people are slowly starting to turn away from doing what we are told. Politics aside, the fact that million will go out and vote for things to be different (actual difference, completely unthinkable) gives me a small bit of hope for the planet. Perhaps we are not nations of drones?

       A great satisfaction to see Hillary lose. Democracy and peace won. You might not like it, but the excercise of democracy implies that things might turn out in a way you don't expect. Instead of blurting out opinions, reflect, study and try to comprehend the Zeitgeist of happenings.

       i just reviewed the US map by region and Trump majority.  about 90 pc of the US voted for Trump.  The Hillary voters are DC, by large majority, Maryland, LA and SF, Seattle...and Hispanic areas in Texas, Az, Ca...  So some opinion.  DC is the core of corruption in the US, and radiates out, eg MD.  the LGBT and Hispanic vote accounts for the West coast Hillary vote.  Maine and Michigan? dk.

       The narrative usually implies that there is a secret behemoth pulling the strings behind the curtains and that regardless of vote or hope their puppet will always win, today that narrative was dismantled. Many times did I hear that Hillary was fixed to win, drummed in my ear, bought and paid for etc. Bottom line, there is no boogeyman fixing the vote, people are just either smart or stupid. Most of the times stupid (dnc), but so is human nature. Let's see how this plays out.

       The only reason she didnt win is because we caught all the vote manipulation and machine "malfunctions" during the election process. She needed waayy more than the homeless and deceased votes, and those were due to come from the corrupt machines. Look at the states they held off on calling forver last night - AZ, MI, PA, WI - all of these states had massive machine malfunctions and ballots thrown out. The race was ridiculously close, she lost by 1-2% in these locations and those are the votes they had to rig to win. You cant rig an election and win by +5-9 pts in battle grounds, its too "coincidental". Thats also why they were refusing to call it for trump, they literally recounted PA because they couldnt believe we out voted their "fix". No damn way it took an east coast state til 2:45am to count votes and release the electoral winner. This race was over when she lost FL and OH. At the end they were just clinging for a sweep in hopes of a 269 tie.

       They definitely were trying to fix the election and I saw all the same fluctuations of vote% and DOW#'s across Fox/CBS/NBC/PBS. When they showed the counties of PA that were "undecided" I actually knew of 3 that are legitimately redder than Texas. Surprisingly, or not, all 3 of these counties are major union/industrial areas for blue collar crowd. Fix the election or we fuck your retirement type fears.

       Too close to call my fucking ass. Every one of those news stations knew the fix was in, they were all holding off because they didnt want to be the first to go against the queens wishes.

       All kinds of funny business was going on.  Trump was ahead in Virgina and Hillary surged ahead 6% in the last 8% reporting.  NH counts were just not coming, leaving a path open for hillary.  Maybe they were waiting for everybody to go to sleep and find some more votes that were 'missed'.  Counties all over the us map were holding out reporting, playing a wait and see game trying to figure out how many ballots they needed.  CA was called for Hillary 1 minute after the polls closed giving Hillary an artificial momentum.
       <br/>
       There was so much bullshit! the media just stalling waiting for a miracle. while the vote counters tried to get it close enough to go for a recount.

       I'm glad everyone else noticed the PA stuff and I wasn't just seeing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around 1:45-2 am eastern, I was watching the fox stream in bed. At that point I was just waiting for them to call PA and NYT had Trump at &gt;95% to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       he was going to win but I was just trying to stay awake until it was official. Then Podesta went in front of the Clinton supporters telling everyone they're not doing anything until all the votes were counted and CNN kept acting like there was still some kind of chance Hillary would win, so I didn't want to miss it somehow if it did happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       At about 2 am, I saw that PA was 98% and fox said they didn't want to call it yet, but some other websites and stuff had already called it for Trump. I figured I'd find out any second now since they only had 2% to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 or 10 minutes later, fox shows the PA graphic and somehow it said 68%? I was absolutely confused and kept trying to think how the fuck I saw it so wrong just 10 minutes earlier. I checked NYT and somehow his percentage fell all the way down to like 70 something.. so I said fuck it at around 2:15, really confused and wondering if there was some sort of fuckery afoot or if I was just too tired to read properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went to sleep. I wake up later and see that my mom had texted me at 2:45 am from work saying they called it for Trump. About 20 mins after I said fuck it and went to sleep because PA had somehow dropped 20-30% in counts like they just lost votes somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was bizarre and I'm glad other people were noticing things got weird.

       So what you are saying is that there is indeed a "man" behind the scenes but he's so incompetent he loses a rigged race? You understand how moronic you have to be to lose a rigged race? So the "man" with all its chemtrails, power, influence, and unlimited wealth couldn't control a couple voting machines? They look pretty stupid and harmless from where I'm standing. There is a real "man" in Myanmar for instance, they are called the junta, way less influent or resourceful but they win every year.

       Good luck with that, the pattern is that when something happens that breaks that conspiracy narrative (like Hillary losing) there is a paradigm shift that corrects itself to agree that whatever happened did so to further the "illuminati" agenda, next up you'll see that somehow they managed to get to trump too, and the cycle continues. The tinfoil runs deep

       No. Trump won in a landslide and the media knows it.  It was such a blow out they would have been an investigation if she did win.  (or if they were to show trump winning in a landslide, rioting may have been worse) This is the powers that be trying to maintain control so they can steal it again at another opportunity.  The illusion that is 'close' is so that all the methods of cheating can stay in place.

       i mean people got the clinton loss so many were pushing for, but the question now is at what cost and why.  the very nature of elections in the US have so many people believeing that its all a show and voting is rigged anways so what is trumps purpose in this system?  hes clearly not the outsider people want to imagine him being, hes been involved with the elites ,even looking awfully friendly to the Clintons for most of his life.  you can go back 20 years or only just a handful of years back and hes said positive things about many of the people he 'ran against'.  many of the people i have seen on lists of potential cabinet members are still the same corporate elite / establishment members.
      </p>
      <p>
       im just amazed at how slow people have been to try and grapple with the idea that we voted a corrupt businessman(who has always used his money to sit at the edges of politics) in instead of a corrupt politician
      </p>
      <p>
       trumps possibly a puppet and was picked to win( of russia or god knows who else) or the grand conspiracy about voting being rigged is not true ( and then likely many others connected to it)

       his temperament should scare everyone, look at how much the past few presidents aged during their terms and now imagine a man so impulsive that openly basically said comey was a partisan hack, a hero to his country, and then a partisan hack within the span of a few days.  now apply that sith mentality all day everyday for years

       Well, he would essentially be the republican version of Obama. False hope, no change. However, what's interesting is that if this were the case (which my gut tells me it is) it could reveal to a larger population - a population starting to wake up and is getting involved in populist movements - that leaders of these movements can be shills and controlled by the same system (or 'the powers that be'), essentially cut from the same cloth. If that's the case....fuck, we've got a long way to go.

       Upon further review, the popular/electoral vote split had to be intentional, especially given how monumental this election was. It's simply too "out there".

       Trump wants to eliminate the American ties to the TPP which has some serious ties to the Clinton Foundation

       Building a wall and restoring our military bases

       Removing universal health care (obamacare)

       On one hand I want Hillary to be their selection. This way, I get to see all the crazy shit the Trump supporters come up with. They were on the mans dick like crazy so seeing them cry, scream and go nuts is very appealing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand I want Trump to win. The reason for this is so he will show his true colors and treat those who felt they were disenfranchised and marginalized like shit. This way, their entitlement is flushed down the toilet and they can take a step back and evaluate themselves.

       I've been trying, trying to prep my loved ones who are credulously clinging to Trump for the inevitable troll, but it hasn't been successful. Eyes and ears closed and I'm worried how they'll handle it when they realize what they've done.

       I think a lot of you anti-Hilary folks are forgetting that Trump too is as much of a puppet as she is. Of course they're handing her the seat, why else do you think they had Trump run? Much easier to stomach a Clinton victory in this election if the other candidate is so distasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be a waste of a vote but screw it, if I'm voting then I'm voting for the alternatives to these candidates, it's not like voting Clinton or Trump is any less of a waste in this sham.

       but there are still republicans in power (like florida governor rick the skelton man Scott) that will very much want trump to win. Im just trying to say its very much possible either side rigs this election, its not impossible. Most people on reddit werent even born in 2000 when we saw one of the most rigged elections in our history

       Do you understand what "rigged" means? It means heavily and covertly weighted towards one outcome. It doesn't mean "fixed" which is a guaranteed outcome. Fixing carries a much higher risk of detection than rigging.

       This was a landslide, without the ghost votes and buses and the collusion of the entire media and all the other tricks the Dems would have been wiped off the map.

       For them it was an election, business as usual but for the people who voted against Hillary, against "the swamp"...for them this was a revolution.

       The best part about this election is that if Hillary wins, no matter how legitimate it seems, trump babies will cry rigged the whole way back to mom and dad's attic. The thing is she didn't even need to rig this election because of the sheer hilarity in her opposition. She will win because trump is a failure and we can add this to all his failures

       Hillary will win, and as much as I wish that she has to cheat to win (and get caught and impeached), she will in fair and square because what rational, educated person sees the joke of Donald trump being a better president? My hope is these next 4 years blow by quickly, we don't have a war, status quo is maintained, we get liberal leaning judges in 2017 (unless the right continues to disrupt and make a farce of their jobs) or after the midterms, and then in 2020 a real progressive like Bernie, BUT with better implementations of their ideas, and we move on from this cycle of elitism. One can only hope for that future

       I know plenty of Trump voters who aren't rapists. That said, they are playing a serious game of "see no evil, hear no evil" and "speak evil every once in awhile." They aren't even willing to discuss it with me when I bring up facts, they just say, "I've made up my mind." I think it's tougher for them because they KNOW I'm not a Clinton fan and have despised those people for decades, but fuck if I'm going to let them go through life thinking
       <em>
        Trump
       </em>
       is some kind of messiah. And they know he's not a messiah, but just can't, at this point, handle the reality that they're being clowned.

       If you got enough people to do it sure, but you won't. The best course of action is mass organized protest on the capital. They won't admit it, but the jails are overcrowded as it is. They can only "arrest" so many people before they have to start thinking of a better solution. Force the government to shut down. Block them from getting to their jobs, shut down the streets around government facilities and make them listen. The international media, corrupt or not, will have no choice but to cover it. Refuse to cease and desist until they take action. Do not get violent but don't back down. Make them call the police and then the Army. If they continue to escalate the situation with weapons and violence, the outside world, (Other first-world countries), will get involved. If there is enough outrage, they will have no choice but to give in.

       I'm not American, but I can assure you that this looks utterly bizarre from my viewpoint too. You have a woman, who is obviously a criminal, running for office and nobody is brave enough to stop her. This is the kind of shit you expect to see in the most corrupt nations in Africa, but not in the US. Don't get me wrong, I'm not naive enough to think that corruption isn't rife in all governments, but this is taking it to a whole new level. They are flaunting it right out in the open, for the whole world to see.

       If everyone stopped paying taxes, the feds would just print more money.  Taxes only fund local governments.  Federal taxes are there to ensure you (a) have less income and (b) to force people to use their currency.

       The strength of the US Dollar as a world currency is dependent on being used to pay for oil.That is a huge part of what the middle east war is about now.The USA is currently losing the wars in the middle east, the petrodollar is in grave danger of losing it's status.When that happens expect very high inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the economic numbers put out by the US government are fake.All total BS.

       The electors don't get to vote any way they please. Many of the states require the electors to vote for the popular winner, and many states allow the parties to bond electors to the party. There aren't very many "free" electors.

       One politician being manipulated by a cult makes sense. there is evidence, it's happened many times before. Rasputin being the prime example.

       arguing that dozens if not hundreds of high level politicians are all in on a child kidnapping/molesting occult society with the bare minimum of evidence is ridiculous.
