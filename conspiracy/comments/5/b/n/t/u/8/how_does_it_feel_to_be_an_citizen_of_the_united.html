       Tomorrow will be another nail in the coffin of this once great country.  It's a terrible thing for the citizens here.  I hope the days following will lead to change.  If even a fraction, a tiny little fraction of what is going on in our country is true, then we need a restructuring of government, our agencies and our leaders from the top down.  I'm personally ready to move to Iceland if nothing changes.  Fuck this place and it's current state of affairs.

       I'm a dollop of conscious energy inhabiting a physical body that resides in the United States, on a planet rife with violence, narcissism, exploitation and greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foremost among those exhibiting these traits are having a battle for control right now. I don't have a dog in the fight, nor do I care to get involved.

      <p>
       Let them tear each other and this floating ball of wet dirt into shreds, or let them do a 180 and start espousing concepts like caring for your fellow man. Don't care, I'm just observing it all in an almost voyeur like style and I'll be dead within a few decades anyway, which is nothing compared to the known age of our universe and who knows what else which lies beyond time.

       Ahh, taking the ole "step back" and looking at things on a grand scheme.  You're right of course.  What sucks for alot of us though is that even though we know what you're saying is without doubt a 100% true, we have kids. That changes your perspective a little dude, even though I know what you're saying is true.  With all due respect, I just want to figure out something that would get my daughter out of this mess.  If it was just me man, I would take a seat right down beside you, enjoy popcorn and watch.

       Carlin really tried to tell the truth at the end, I really think he risen to a point where he could see clearly what we're just slightly seeing now, it's all fucked, and on purpose for a tiny fractional amount of people.

       This election has made me realize that our country only has laws for the poor and that the rich are exempt.  I had always suspected but, I never thought I would see such blatant proof, nor did I believe so many people would ignore it.  It has made me realize that the agencies sworn to protect us are just arms of the powerful to make sure they stay safe, and we stay controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been many years since I have been naive enough to believe that it's all smiles and rainbows in the world, but it's sickening to have confirmation that I and many others have been fed a litany of lies about our position in the world, that every good thing we ever believed in about our home and country has been used as a tool against us for the purpose of manipulation.  People look at these two pieces of shit running for the highest office in our country and they think "These stupid Americans" but it's not us.  We tried really hard to do the right thing, we fought and donated and volunteered and spoke our minds at a time when it was really difficult to do so.  And in the end, here we still are.  Feels bad man.

       You know that feeling when a large storm is coming? You know it's coming, and eventually you have an "oh my god this is really going to happen" moment, and you know you can't stop it. You have to batten the hatches and hope you don't need to do anything drastic to save your home and family. I feel like we're watching a hurricane blow in and we're powerless to stop it.

       The 2nd doesn't mean anything if we don't use it for it's intended purpose. Otherwise we are just firearm collectors. If there were ever a time the 2nd was needed it's now. This doesn't mean we start blasting shit up but it definitely means the millions of Americans that care about this country and the rest of the world as well needs to join hands, form a militia, and head to the capital to make some arrests.

       Trump will not win this election and if we want true freedom we have to stand together and let the TPTB know we are not afraid and you do not control us.

       We can't be scared and change doesn't come without a price. Everyone needs to take a look at their loved ones and ask themselves " do I want my daughters and sons to have a fighting chance"? If you want for your sons and daughters what you grew up believing in then the answer is clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you that are scared and choose to do nothing don't worry we will still fight for you as you're our brothers and sisters and no matter our differences you're still one of us.

       We bought our first firearm last week and have spent quite a bit of time practicing with it, for the express purpose of defending ourselves and our home should we descend into martial law. I won't be the first one to take to the streets, but I would probably join in. And if a tank came rolling down my street I would sure as hell stand in front of it.

       One of my greatest fears right now is that, come Nov 9th, Wednesday, the day after the elections...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this built up tension, all this banter, all this back and forth...amounts to nothing. A winner is elected and...that's it. Like a light switch, suddenly everyone goes "oh..well, that was fun" and it's back to business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be what happens with everything, every time. Massive/huge amounts of build up for absolutely zero payoff, leaving those of us watching in the lurch wondering "Well what the fuck was all that even
       <strong>
        for
       </strong>
       !?" I'm getting so exhausted with all the doom and gloom and, for all things considered, VERY apparent and obvious bad things about to happen, to then just suddenly
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       matter anymore. That it was all hysterical hyperbole, even though all evidence points to the contrary, but suddenly everyone (even the opposition, whoever they may be from your point of view) are like "jeez calm down it was never THAT bad, we were just taking out the piss"...it's just, that's how it eventually goes, every damn time in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a pot of boiling pasta. It looks like it's about to roil and boil out of control and get everywhere, but then you blow on it and see that it's just foam at the top...

       Maybe. You know, after the invention of the printing press, there was more widespread dissemination of information, followed by revolutions. In the grand scheme of things, the internet is still pretty new. We're living in an Information Age. It seems natural that revolution will follow. We'll see.

       This seems so much more likely than I'd like to believe. We'll all just seamlessly move onto the next thing we can all get upset about. Scary.

       Unfortunately this is the natural progression of all empires. In a mere 10 generations the population transforms from hearty, enterprising pioneers to a decadent and corrupt welfare state. This was as true for ancient Rome as it was for the Arab empires, Byzantine empire, and the military and commercial American empire.
      </p>

       Much to most people's surprise, most of Donald Trumps
       <em>
        economic
       </em>
       policies would actually slow this inevitable decline. However, it could never be permanently turned around without the emotional, philosophical, and patriotic dedication of the population. If America could pull off such a trick, it would be the first empire to do so in over 4000 years.

       Problem is, the American population is so very fragmented now ideologically, economically, and ethnically. We've become distracted and dumbed down by entertainment and the worries of life. We have a media propaganda machine to label dissidents as terrorists and spin the narrative. We're fucked.

       What's new about what's happening in The United States?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The government is corrupt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Oligarchs secretly run the state of affairs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Taxpayer money is diverted and stolen for the benefit of a privileged few.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Racial division is sewn to keep the 99% from realizing they're getting screwed the same way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Federal Reserve guarantees the country stays in debt regardless of its output and economic affluence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Teenagers are put on the front lines to kill people on the other side of the world who have done literally nothing to them personally.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The media is beyond complicit in covering up the misdeeds of the rich and powerful.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All of these things are as American as apple pie (Which isn't American at all. Yet another colonized takeover)
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference? You. You see what they're doing, there's ample evidence of at the very least improprieties and at worst full-on treason and every deadly sin x 100. But that's always been there. The difference is now you can see the train coming straight at you with little to no power to stop it. But if you've been paying attention you'd know that the train has already mowed us down plenty of times. How does it feel to me? Like every other day in this place.

       The government is overrun with corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not like this just happened recently.
It's been like this for a hundred years. Only now some people are beginning to notice.

      <p>
       It's far, far worse than people realize too. I've always said if people knew what was really going on behind the scenes then there would be rioting in the streets of every city in this country.
