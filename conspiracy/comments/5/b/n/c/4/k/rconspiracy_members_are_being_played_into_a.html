       This is highly true for people who haven't looked into things such as the 9/11, CIA, Al Qaeda/ISIS, and other things. Nobody likes the possibility that TPTB may have things set up in place besides Hillary Clinton and her election.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Julian Assange &amp; Wikileaks - Assange called 9/11 a false conspiracy &amp; Bilderberg meetings conspiratorial. Anyone who has looked into 9/11 and the background of it and know that elites gather at the Bilderberg meetings should be raising red flags. Also, Wikileaks hasn't damaged TPTB in any significant way since its inception and nobody questions this because emails got released. To entertain that Wikileaks is US-sanctioned and controlled is considered straight out
        <strong>
         untrue
        </strong>
        for some odd reason. Nobody is questioning which subjects we are being fed with by Wikileaks.
       </li>
       <li>
        Alex Jones - A known disinfo/conintel agent. Nobody finds it strange how he has gotten so much attention over past week with the #Spiritcooking and the Satanic ritual narrative.
       </li>
       <li>
        Steve Pieczenik - This person has a history of Psyops and has worked under people like Kissinger and G.H.W. Bush and refers to them in a good light when they're some the dirtiest people in government. Why are we suddenly trusting him with his message about the FBI and possible peace?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        FBI/FBIanon - We're to believe that the FBI who earlier in the year tried to gain more power from the FBI vs Apple case to be good guys who are looking out for us? Why haven't they released anything years ago on 9/11 or other topics? We're to believe that the FBI is going to somehow get everyone in the government out, including the CIA and other strong individuals/groups?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Donald Trump - A lot people seem think that Donald Trump is going to be this savior for us. How do we know that to be the case? Looking past his speeches and slogans, we don't know how he is going to do things. How is he going to deal with the bankers, corporations, CIA &amp; other agencies, and other power individuals/groups we haven't realized yet? A good number of us in r/Conspiracy can't even process the possibility of Trump being controlled opposition.

       In your humble opinion, are we really watching a counter-coup failed or is this just part of the theater?  Not sure which is more disturbing.

       I don't think it was "justifying" anything but simply exposing what the real motives were behind the story the mainstream media were putting out.  I don't think he was endorsing any action at all.

       Right, I agree.  It doesn't justify the war with Syria. In fact, it depicts USA as a coward that manufactures bad intelligence so it can do whatever it was planning on doing anyway, which is dominate all countries on the 33rd parallel, expropriate their resources and then occupy jerusalem

       Yes, and it's good. But I say that with a warning: Put your critical thinking cap on because Curtis is said to be a gatekeeper of sorts (see corbett report curtis establishment gatekeeper).  We discussed 'problems' with this film at C_S_T

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, those shorts of his about the media are SPOT on and given how he's singularly blown the whistle on nonlinear warfare, I have to reevaluate whether he's a gatekeeper or just a got some things wrong.

       was what initially opened my eyes that I should maybe question everything I see &amp; hear from the media.  That coupled with reading Bernays' stuff was a rude awakening to what is basically engineered consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.” - the very first paragraph of Edward Bernays' 1928 book
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">
        Propaganda
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And who is to say that the accusation that he is a gatekeeper isn't just more disinformation itself.  In looking into the theory and history of propaganda and public relations and their progression from the late 1800's into the modern era, the accusation of gatekeeper simply doesn't seem to fit.  It's all there in the historical record.

       The OP is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone passed damning info about Trump to WL would they release it? Another thing is why is a foreigner so concerned about politics in this country? There is corruption all over but why focus on this country?
      </p>
      <p>
       AJ and SP are disinfo agents. It's been proven about AJ time and time again and SP has worked with some of the most evil men to walk the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBIanon is a liar and troll. Nothing he said ever came to past and everything he said, that people thought was real, was info that was already common knowledge. Hillary having access to SAPs or taking a closer look at the CF? Do a google search, it was on forums way before the stooge even hit 4chan. And let's not forget the fact he called for the deportation of black people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI? They are the stasi of the elite. Why the fuck would they go against their superiors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is not a savior. He pandered to a certain demographic, who felt underserved and marginalized and the rest is history. The people at the top let him get this far because he is capable and willing when it comes to serving them.

       I disagree with you, but I'm upvoting this because this needs serious heavy discussion. There is far to much unconfirmed sourcing in this sub.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        #1. Wikileaks is sacrosanct. Unless you can provide SOLID factual evidence to the contrary, I cannot get behind this statement. Yes it is possible that SOME of their leaks are tampered with, but there is no evidence of this. Without something to back it up, this statement carries no more weight than Alex Jones.
       </li>
       <li>
        Alex Jones - Yes. Disinfo/conint. I don't find it strange how he has gotten so much attention, nor do I think he had anything to do with it. It was
        <a href="/r/the_donald">
         /r/the_donald
        </a>
        who made the discovery. I think this is just an early Christmas for Alex. A broken clock is right twice a day, after all, and he's been broken for decades.
       </li>
       <li>
        Steve Pieczenik - Don't trust this guy as far as I can throw him. However, given his history, it makes sense what he's putting out. That being said, he's made a career out of appearing on AJ's show, and I honestly think he's just trying to sell books.
       </li>
       <li>
        FBIanon - I take everything this guy said with a grain of salt. That being said, a significant portion of what he has said has panned out in the emails. Whether or not he's release info on 9/11 is simply a straw man arguement. There are a lot of other possibilities with regard to his identity and motive, and I think he gets less attention than he deserves, but we need to seriously discuss: What his motive is? Is he the one who released the emails? Which leaks is he responsible for? Who he works for?
       </li>
       <li>
        Donald - Highly suspect controlled opposition. Remember, Hillary was promised this election in 2008, and trump has to put on a good show. Further, he's getting the people ready to revolt after the election. That's a set up for gun laws lockdown on the US, as well as free speech, and online monitoring. Mix in BLM, and we've got a SERIOUS Situation on hand.

       100% agreed. I don't know if wikileaks is still wikileaks, but up until Julian Assange had internet they were, as you put it, sacrosanct. And up until that point, they had already leaked enough information to put almost anyone in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Hillary is still on the campaign trail instead of behind bars pretty much proves the amount of corruption we are dealing with. Assange is the guy who facilitated this proof, and that's no small feat.

       Here's the problem with wikileaks: I don't think this stuff can be used against her in court. It's kind of like wiretapping laws. The info has to be acquired 'just so'. Wikileaks is to easily stricken from the record, given it's questionable legality. In that regard, it could be said they are doing Hillary a favor.

       What? You mean like the Snowden Leak?
      </p>
      <p>
       All sarcasm aside,  I think it really comes down to who leaked it. If it was, in fact, a govt agency that leaked these, then I have no idea whether it will be admissible or not. That's better than right now, where the popular rhetoric is that the leak is from Russia. No way a court of law is going to let that pass.

       The FBI could just as easily contact the NSA  and have any email ever sent by hillary in the past 7 years. They already had access to her server. Wikileaks just showed the public there was classified info on her server. They also showed collusion between the DNC and media, however that's not illegal but it would be prior to 2012 (thanks obama)

       AJ has a million claims, every day, then when one of the million is correct, he says "LOOK, I TOLD YOU SO!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of AJ's documentaries from the past are quite good though (eg: A Noble Lie)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his problem is that he has to
       <em>
        deliver every day something for his daily show
       </em>
       , and that show makes him money. He's addicted to money, and that's how he's controlled.

       I consider all these critics about vitamins and water filters pretty hypocritical. You either need to generate some income through such sales and ads, getting crossfinanced in a big media org for image and propaganda purposes or get financed by the state.

       I think AJ got lured in with lucrative contracts that need lots of exposure, and
       <em>
        daily
       </em>
       airtime. The bigger his listener base, the more money he gets.
      </p>
      <p>
       This requires a lot of time to 'fill in', so he goes off-the-cuff to fill that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acting loud &amp; crazy is good for ratings too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he stayed small, and used good research, he would make a massive difference, but he chose to go big, and now he's a slave to his own creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose there could also be a possibility that TPTB planned to get him under control by enticing him with $$$ incentive contracts, but I'd have to see proof.

       His motive was attention. Hell no he didn't release shit. He isn't respinsible for any leaks. He works for Burger King.

       FBIanon couldn't even get the lingo right. Why listen to the guy? Others will say "he did that to protect himself" but it's all BS. Did he give any specific dates? No. Did he name any people that weren't already being looked at? No. Did he provide anything like vids, pics or audio? No. So why believe him?

       That's a valid motive, and identity. Probably most likely. Definitely most plausible. But in fairness, we can't just call him BurgerAnon. So, lets look at it from the perspective of a Gov't Empl. FBI, or CIA couterint, or Foreign counterint agent, or any other agence. What would they stand to gain by leaking this? IF he were really FBI, He's risking serious criminal charges by posting like that. What does he get out of that? And his stated intention of "Good guy anon leaks fbi insider info" is already on the list. Looking for new perspectives.

       The burden of proof for this individual being a liar is on you, the accuser. You have not provided any actual evidence that he is lying, only supposition. It is not my burden to prove that he was truthful, nor that I am claiming that he was being truthful.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, what I am claiming is that he had a motive. The question up for debate is what that motive is, and who that motive belongs to. I don't think that it does the conversation justice to simply flat out assume that the only plausible answer is BurgerKingAttentionWhore without exploring other possible avenues. That is exactly what the Clinton Cartel would want us to do.

       I did. He claimed to be an FBI source and the questions I asked proved what he is saying is a lie. Lying by omission and flat out lying. Again, his claim is that he is an FBI source with insider info. He posted that info. I and others have ripped that info to shreds. The questions I've asked, that have gone unanswered by everyone who believed the guy (yourself included) support this.

       Not FBI anon. I remember the original thread. This is a regular anon. I think perhaps they had not conferred with wikileaks before they submitted and did not realize there was a vetting process. Or they were killed. Either way, has nothing to do with FBIAnon.

       Look, buddy. It's just you and me now. This thread has long scrolled off the main post. 1, maybe 2 people will ever see this besides us. If you think you're going to one up me, or damage my credibility by flipping the script, nah. Nobody else is here. The main op has long since left even the 2nd or 3rd page. You're wasting your time.

       There's no disagreement here, because nothing was discussed. You simply blasted your megaphone then proceeded to cover your ears. Lalala not listening. I wasn't even trying to convince you of anything.

       To be more clear, I need evidence that wikileaks is controlled/US-sanctioned. An approximate date as to when it became controlled is also necessary, unless you want to posit that the entire wikileaks op was a CIA/etc mission from the beginning designed to take down Hillary and the DNC.

       I said to
       <em>
        "To entertain that Wikileaks is US-sanctioned and controlled"
       </em>
       . Unfortunately, you're going to have to drop your hard beliefs in order to do that, especially with you saying
       <em>
        "Wikileaks is sacrosanct"
       </em>
       while ignoring the rest of what I said about the Julian/Wikileaks topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you simply ignored the Julian Assange statement, that 9/11 is a false conspiracy (which has killed American people and lead to serious death tolls and destruction in the ME), makes question why you think Wikileaks is sacrosanct when the head of it made that outrageous statement and should be a red flag for any Conspiracy follower.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask for evidence but you failed to address what I said in the OP, that
       <strong>
        Wikileaks hasn't damaged TPTB in any significant way since its inception
       </strong>
       . Do you mean to tell me that the US government, which has agencies that specialize in Psyops/mind control/media manipulation, performed 9/11/JFK/dirty covert operations &amp; wars,   and other things, is seriously going to let Wikileaks stab them in the back? If you were a part of the government's inner ring and specialized in their psyops/mind-control agency, and you created a whistleblower/information leak operation and everyone loves it/does not question it at all, then that would be one of the best tools made especially in the Internet age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any true person who has gained significant information on something would instead use that as leverage over TPTB as giving out information to the public is a fruitless endeavor in it's own right. Wikileaks isn't going to uproot the TPTB. It makes more sense if it's US-sanctioned operation since none of the leaks since it's inception has damaged TPTB in any way and have only aligned with their agenda.

       Assange,  2010:  "I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am convinced 9/11 was an inside job.   You can start with Wesley Clarks video,  etc.  I'm not here to argue it.   I am surprised Assange isn't interested in the media and administration stooges who covered up 9/11 just like they are now covering up election fraud,  Clinton criminality,  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its probably more pragmatic on Assange's part.    Effectively,  his franchise is a media channel,  an alternative media channel,   where sources are concealed and the material is stolen documents from governments,  corporations,  or personal email accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My amusement is that Assange appears to have never come across any leaked material that is pertinent to 9/11 having been an inside job,  or any leaked material that is pertinent to there having been an intentional coordinated effort to cover up involvement of the guilty parties to the inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly,   the field of truthers is so tainted by  crazy alternative theories that the subject is distasteful to Assange,  possibly so toxic that it's professional suicide to bother with it.   So far,  that has indeed been the case.    No one has avoided professional suicide who has touched it,
       <strong>
        no one
       </strong>
       .    Assange is obviously a pragmatist,  a survivor.    I doubt he would still have been in the game,  a player at all,  if he had been embroiled with truther nuts.

       Yes renovation, which would make a convenient guise to have nobody there to witness all the damning documents being moved there. Same stuff as building 7.

It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.

        Steve Pieczenik -- you could be very wrong about this person.  He served under dems and republicans and believes in a public governement--he's proved his neutrality and connections.  I choose to believe he's on our side, you've chosen not to because he came out of the woodwork.  That's a kind of anchoring bias and a confirmation bias in one, isn't it?  If it turns OP is risght and we find out all along then he's put his face on this op, and he gets added to our treason list.

        What you've said about Trump is certainly valid: he's untrustworthy because it would seem he ran to fail.  That said, it could just be he ran a shitty campaign at first and became more sophisticated.  Your concerns about his governance are certainly valid.  He's inexperienced.  Some of his plans are dumb sounding.  He goofed and called Mexicans rapists--can't take that back.

        Julian Assange &amp; Wikileaks -- is NOT a limited hangout or a psyop, however we don't know if he's still alive and that wikileaks hasn't been taken over.  I say that because I'm unable to download the entire 3GB of the podesta emails.  I've tried over 7 different ways, using TOR, VPN, and other proxy networks.  Their link, their fileserver, I conclude, has been compromised.  The payload I receive appears to be compressed binary info and very corrupted, every time; and the file size and payload size changes every time, although it appears to be a valid gzipped file until you attempt to uncompress it.

       That said, I think OP is correct there IS a psyop at hand and I think it's the occult stuff.   Occult stuff is just ways for gangs to communicate they've been involved.  So like 33,000 is one group, 33 is maybe the same or another group, 777 is a claim such as 33777.77 and how that looks like 33,000 doesn't it?  It's like tagging buildings with graffiti, but with bank accounts and by aristocrat spook spy types.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedo stuff is probably real, but its engaging us as the clock runs out.  They are not bringing up madeline kahn and all this old stuff like videos of gunderson and old satanic ritual abuse stuff, either debunking or rebunking or redebunking so that they get everyone tied up.  It's all Cass Sunstein stuff I've talked about before.  A fracture of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is real though, is that our gov has been taken over by a private government and our public gov is too much of a pussy to go against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what is happening
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what people should be talking about.

       Also, with regard to your attempt to DL the files, Wikileaks has been under a ddos for many hours now. I would recommend looking for a mirror, however, files loose credibility when doing that. Not sure if there's a checksum for the entire DL since they have not released all the files yet.

       No doubt.  I'm very unhappy about it.  Not a single good download of the file.  I've even tried vpn'ing to russia and using TOR.  I'm pretty saavy with computers / linux devops,  so I've run some diagnostic ip tools and found that wikileaks is being run on a vps in russia--NO that's means nothing folks...we live in '[G]lobal' now--but I figured vpning to moscow would eliminate any MITM attacks but then again, they've (NSA) worked very hard to hack VPNs as well--much harder to compromise TOR so I imagine this is a problem on their fileserver--that wikileaks fileserver itself (the endpoint) is compromised or badcoded and messing up

       Running two concurrent tunneling protocols could cause a problem. Try using just tor and setting it to use an exit node in russia. You'll want to do that from an open wifi, pref from across the street. Don't worry, your tor traffic will be as safe as the VPN from local attacks. Moreso probably.

       Yes the truth signal has been lost in the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       People also dismiss any Russian involvement due to source of info. (Clinton).  One must look at wider events I think to discern what is really going on.  What we have is a lot of strange political turmoil in NATO countries.  Surprising election results (Brexit - fueled by Syria conflict displacing refugees), and the rise of strange fascist-like leaders like Duerte in the Phillippines.  You have a coup in Turkey, fake or otherwise, they appear to have shifted closer to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have Russia invading Crimea with surrogates much like US is invading Syria with surrogates.
      </p>
      <p>
       US gov't has made unprecedented statements about responses to Russian hacking:

      </p>
      <p>
       You have a very interesting article coming directly from Russia:

       And massive amounts of propaganda being put out to undermine the integrity of US gov't.  Just look at any RT.com links.

       Thanks. Indeed his blog is referenced in the article I quoted and referenced above. I think Scott Adams does a great job when it comes to his "3D Chess" and persuasion stuff, but he's otherwise an utter normie. He doesn't give a single thought to the possibility such persuasion might not be the product of a Trump-master-persuader but rather of an elaborate psyop.

       He's IMO clueless when it comes to politics and what's going on, who are the overlords. He makes utterly moronic reasonings, such as the one about "how many Americans killed per year by Islamic terror is acceptable to not have to deny muslims entry?" (not remotely being aware of US support and financing of salafism/wahhabism, let alone false flags / 911 / GLADIO B).

       True, but what reason does he have to believe in or advocate for it? Further, by even bringing this up, he's liable to discredit himself and or scare off his readership. The govenment's done a number on conspiracy theorists since the 80's, and at this point even the mention of anything slightly conspiratorial and you'll just get swept under the rug with alex jones. At least he's able to bring awareness to persuasion techniques without being lumped in with the conspiritards. It may even open a few eyes. Perhaps that's the most subversive persuasion of all.

       The Steve Pieczenik videos are the most blatant psych-op video I've ever see. Artsy black and white, Close up head shot, Studio lighting and sound. He expresses admiration for Henry Kissenger for god-sakes!

       Note to psych-op video creators - for future reference. Anyone really making a video like this would probably be in their home office on a webcam, not in a studio.

       Let me ask you this: would you know there is a coup if he didn't say there is a coup and countercoup?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known there was a coup before this person.  It's the continuity of government that was started on 9/11.  That's the coup.  We've been run by a junta since.  This is provable, not just something I made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Counter coup seems non-existent.  They've done nothing.  So very cowardly.  They had the weekend to do something, and now they've had till 4pm EST (now) to do something and they haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next holdout is 3:33AM on 11/9 and if it doesn't happen by EOD then it won't, and Hillary will be the next POTUS

       Couple points:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        He's an author trying to sell books.
       </li>
       <li>
        You can get this quality of video on a webcam
       </li>
       <li>
        Studio lighting isn't hard. Just need the right kind of bulb and a 20$ reflector
       </li>
       <li>
        Studio sound is equally as easy, though a little more expensive. A decent mic costs 300$, and is fine for web content. Live streamers have raised demand for studio quality equipment at a reasonable price and thus the market has grown.
       </li>
       <li>
        He probably hired a director for all of the studio work. Throw a hundred bones at any film student and you could get a 4 minute video done in a day or two.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So $420 bucks is a trifle for a video that will net you a couple thousand book sales on its own, and potentially land you several interviews through which you can sell yet more books. (Watched his interview with AJ out of curiosity. Lo and behold, big stack of books next to him on the web cam. Couldn't read the title on it. Video compression is a banger.)

       I say let's stop doing and believing things that make us feel weak as a group. Why do I say this? We'll part of me that understands where OP is coming from is the same part of me that wrestles with this information constantly and has to wonder is this all just a big psyop? Is it me that's wrong or not interpreting this information correctly? It's that little urge to make sure I cover my ass. I believe in my ability to not be manipulated. All of these sources must be trying to manipulate us and make us feel wrong and impotent RIGHT? But no...
Jesus y'all, if all of it is one big psyop, then where the hell does that leave us? Are we to shut our computers and forget that we have the power to change things? Do we honestly go against the immense sense I have for myself at the very least that my/our guts are right, and that the truth of what we are facing right now is as serious as it is? 
I know that right now it feels like darkness is descending. Of course Trump isn't the sole answer. Of course we have to grain of salt Wikileaks. Of course we need to be suspicious of things we hear from AJ and SP. Alex Jones himself has said for years, "don't believe me, do your own research." And you know what, many if not all of us have, and hasn't that given you some sense of what all of this is? 
What I am saying is don't stop believing in yourself and your own hard earned knowledge for the sake of putting aside what everyone else may be doing. 
These are the times that try men's souls the old saying goes. This is what it means. 
TPTB love seeing you waffle. They love seeing the divide. It's their bread and butter. 
Ok, yeah, we need to be careful and not follow all of the leads presented, but damn don't throw the bath out with the bath water.

       No one has proven that ONLY CTR makes statements that disagree with you. There's a large base of veteran subscribers to this subreddit who believe that Trump is controlled opposition.
