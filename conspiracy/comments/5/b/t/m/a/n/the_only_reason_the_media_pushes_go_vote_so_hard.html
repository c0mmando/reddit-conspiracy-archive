        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Have you noticed how fucking hard Google, reddit, Facebook, etc have shoved voting down our throats? I&#39;m seeing annoying popups, emails, celebrities, my neighbor down the street, all yelling &quot;GO VOTE! IT&#39;S YOUR RIGHT AS A US CITIZEN!&quot;</p>

<p>Why do you think these corporations push VOTING so hard? It&#39;s to pacify the people into thinking that they still have a voice and decision-making power within the federal government. That they aren&#39;t being controlled by an oligarchy. That they, too, can be a difference-maker in this country. Meanwhile, the federal government kings just laugh.</p>

<p>Remember: there is no political cure. Vote, or don&#39;t, but remember - this election was probably decided a long time ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve theorized that rigging an election is actually harder to get away with than we think. It&#39;s definitely still happening. However, if you get more people voting your way it takes the burden off of the difficult to rig areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, it&#39;s to keep up the illusion of choice, the illusion of democracy instead of an oligarchy. You are absolutely correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all yelling &quot;GO VOTE! IT&#39;S YOUR RIGHT AS A US CITIZEN!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this, though. It isn&#39;t so much yelling it&#39;s our <em>right</em>, it&#39;s more yelling it&#39;s our <em>duty</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because they also get to advertise their candidate in the process. They know that if they can convince more people to vote, those voters will most likely be people who aren&#39;t already enthusiastic about politics and are most likely to be swayed in a certain direction and that direction is most likely going to align with their current advertisements. And because they are encouraging people to vote, they seem fair and inclusive and that strengthens their other material as a news source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voting does tend to confer a psychological effect on people.  Voting provides a subconscious consent to the outcome of the election.  If someone that people hate wins, then voters accept them because they implicitly agreed to accept the contest winner.</p>

<p>Not all people are technically consenting when they vote, however.  If you are politically conscious, you might simultaneously dissent from the system yet also act in attempt to affect the outcome - because it <em>might</em> be legitimate.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, electronic voting <strong>is</strong> a sham.  Electronic voting is literally an untrustable facade.  I will not participate in that form of &quot;voting&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason you&#39;re told to vote is because you, the people, are central to the plans of those who pull the strings. As long as a substantial amout of people are complicit with the system, then the rest of us just accept the system as &quot;the way things work.&quot; Imagine an election where <em>nobody</em> voted. Do you think they would sit down and discuss the issues and ways to address them in a way that would restore your trust in the system? Or do you think that, in the absence of complicity... in the absence of any evidence to show that the people actually <strong>chose</strong> someone to lead them, would they simply sieze power?</p>
