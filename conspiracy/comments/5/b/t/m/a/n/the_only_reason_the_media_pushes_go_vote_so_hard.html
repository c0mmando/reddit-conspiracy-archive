       Have you noticed how fucking hard Google, reddit, Facebook, etc have shoved voting down our throats? I'm seeing annoying popups, emails, celebrities, my neighbor down the street, all yelling "GO VOTE! IT'S YOUR RIGHT AS A US CITIZEN!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think these corporations push VOTING so hard? It's to pacify the people into thinking that they still have a voice and decision-making power within the federal government. That they aren't being controlled by an oligarchy. That they, too, can be a difference-maker in this country. Meanwhile, the federal government kings just laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember: there is no political cure. Vote, or don't, but remember - this election was probably decided a long time ago.

       I was thinking about this for the past few weeks, not only does it give the illusion of power and give them opportunity to commit voter fraud but I also believe it's the only way they can make it work. If Americans, or any group decided on election day that not a single person would vote, it would should very quickly dummy votes and who they were cast for.

       Of course. It's all a shitshow to distract people from reality. It's like placating children. Tell them that they're special and they matter. Belief in the American "democracy" is one of the biggest conspiracies going in this country today. The entire election itself is a false flag.

       It's easier to rig when there are more people voting for their candidate anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've theorized that rigging an election is actually harder to get away with than we think. It's definitely still happening. However, if you get more people voting your way it takes the burden off of the difficult to rig areas.

       If it is rigged, then getting people to vote means the population will go along with the results.  If no one voted because they thought it was rigged, they'd be more difficult to rule over and control.

       it's just bs, kind of like the election where a clinton (president's wife) is "running against" her own donor and family friend/bill's golf buddy Donald Trump. It doesn't matter who wins, the voting doesn't count anyway, and anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together has long since figured it out.

       That's kind of hilarious.  I've only read about how they are trying to keep us from voting.  Hence why we vote on Tuesday.  Hence why it's in November so less people will want to stand out in the cold.  Hence why you can't vote if you have been convicted of a felony.  Hence why particular things are felonies.

       And then there is the whole argument that the election is rigged and this whole argument doesn't even have a base.

       Yeah I'm aware of that but I think I'm missing something key.  Why is t so impressive that he can change numbers in a spreadsheet?  Was he changing the actual numbers of live elections?  Was he using only the software found on an official election computer?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I saw, he wrote a program that could change a spreadsheet full of numbers.  I don't see how this is proof that people are tampering with election results.

       Exactly. The whole thing is a farce. It's made to look extremely important, but it's not that important. It's a total distraction from the much more serious issues, of the fact the deep state and military-industrial complex has infiltrated our government. The idea voting can fix this is a way to empower idiots while letting the real criminals continue to get away with stuff behind the curtain.

       You are all a bunch of tards. While your vote may not count for president, it still counts for everything else on the ballot for your state. That means senators, representative, all other public offices in your state, as well as state measures. So, if you all stop circlejerking, you see that there is a reason to vote.

       The numbers on the people that actually vote are staggering. 318 million Americans, 219 million were eligible to vote in 2012 and about 57% of them actually went to the polls. Even if you think America is a democracy, that's far from "majority rule."

       While I am very much so of this mindset, I've still always offered the counter of "Why are their such overt attempts to sabotage/sway/swing/rig. If voting doesn't actually count for anything?" I see it as while they have a certain amount of push, they can only push so far without it becoming blatantly obvious and therefore prosecutable.

       It's because they also get to advertise their candidate in the process. They know that if they can convince more people to vote, those voters will most likely be people who aren't already enthusiastic about politics and are most likely to be swayed in a certain direction and that direction is most likely going to align with their current advertisements. And because they are encouraging people to vote, they seem fair and inclusive and that strengthens their other material as a news source.

       Voting does tend to confer a psychological effect on people.  Voting provides a subconscious consent to the outcome of the election.  If someone that people hate wins, then voters accept them because they implicitly agreed to accept the contest winner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all people are technically consenting when they vote, however.  If you are politically conscious, you might simultaneously dissent from the system yet also act in attempt to affect the outcome - because it
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately though, electronic voting
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a sham.  Electronic voting is literally an untrustable facade.  I will not participate in that form of "voting".

       Yes, this is very correct and a very important control mechanism. You participated, and even if Hilary/Trump did not win this time, you still have a chance next time. You end up supporting the system that suppresses you.

       The reason you're told to vote is because you, the people, are central to the plans of those who pull the strings. As long as a substantial amout of people are complicit with the system, then the rest of us just accept the system as "the way things work." Imagine an election where
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       voted. Do you think they would sit down and discuss the issues and ways to address them in a way that would restore your trust in the system? Or do you think that, in the absence of complicity... in the absence of any evidence to show that the people actually
       <strong>
        chose
       </strong>
       someone to lead them, would they simply sieze power?
